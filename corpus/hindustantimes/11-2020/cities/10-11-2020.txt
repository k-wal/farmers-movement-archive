To keep a check on second wave of Covid-19 pandemic due to possible health complications arising from pollution, the administration last week imposed a blanket ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the city. “There is no relaxation. So clear instructions have been passed to station house officers to ensure strict compliance. Anyone caught selling or bursting crackers will be booked under Section 188 (for non-compliance of prohibitory order) of the Indian Penal Code and action will also be taken under relevant section of the Disaster Management Act,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. Though the offence is bailable, provisions under the Disaster Management Act are stricter as compared to Section 188 of the IPC, which carries maximum jail of only three months.Section 51 of the Act provides for a jail term of two years in case anyone gets hurt and one year for mere violation. Chandigarh Police on last Diwali had registered 13 FIRs under Section 188 of the IPC against those bursting crackers beyond the permissible time limit of 8pm to 10pm. With NGT order’s backing, admn not ready to budge Even though cracker dealers are hoping to get a two-hour window for bursting crackers from the Punjab and Haryana high court on the lines of Panchkula, the Chandigarh administration is in no mood to roll back its decision.The police control room and beat box staff are already making announcements in different markets and localities, urging residents not to sell or burst crackers. “We are creating awareness among people that any violation will invite criminal proceedings,” said Chahal, adding that on Diwali, special teams will be constituted to make rounds in their jurisdictions and ensure strict compliance. The administration also got a shot in its arm with the National Green Tribunal’s order on Monday, which while enforcing a cracker ban in Delhi NCR issued similar directions to all cities in the country where the average ambient air quality last November had dropped in the “poor” category. Meanwhile, sale of only environment-friendly green crackers have been allowed in areas that had “moderate” air quality with two-hour window to burst them during festivals. In recent weeks, the air quality index (AQI) has stayed moderate (100-200), after becoming poor (200-300) on November 4 when it was recorded at 203. In 2019, it was on the same date that the year’s peak AQI of 335 (very poor) was recorded in the city. The meteorological department has warned that even this year, the AQI might go up in view of dry weather and unchecked stubble burning in the region. High court to take up cracker dealers’ plea todayThe high court will take up the plea of Chandigarh Cracker Dealers Association against the cracker ban on Wednesday. The petition states that the pollution level (AQI) in Chandigarh is less than 150, while in adjacent Panchkula it is almost double, at 250. Despite this, the Haryana government has not imposed a blanket ban, and there is no such move in Mohali too, the petitioners have said. The dealers have sought quashing of the UT administration’s decision, or as an alternative, directions to pay compensation in lieu of losses suffered by them.The administration last week after conducting draw of lots for allotment of 96 licences for the sale of firecrackers in the city had decided to impose the ban. Earlier, citing health experts, who had advised against bursting of crackers, the administration had also issued an advisory for people to stay indoors and desist from bursting firecrackers in order to prevent air pollution and to protect the elderly and people with comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/burst-crackers-in-chandigarh-and-land-in-jail-for-up-to-2-years/story-RmJXwb13dKf9UCWJ2cESNI.html
10-11-2020||City||Delhi police Eagle Squad recovers 125 two-wheelers stolen for street crimes, nabs 15 gang members||New DelhiThe Delhi Police on Tuesday said they had busted a syndicate of alleged auto-lifters and snatchers involved in street crimes and recovered 125 stolen motorcycles and scooters from them. A total of 15 suspected auto-lifters and snatchers, including the alleged kingpin, were arrested by the police, which claimed to have solved 131 vehicle theft and snatching cases. The arrests and recoveries of the vehicles and six mobile phones were made by the Eagle Squad of the Sultanpuri police station in the last 17 days, the police said. Eagle Squads, which consists of nearly a dozen police personnel, were constituted in outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri and Sultanpuri Raj Park police stations in August to neutralise street criminals. In September, the Eagle Squads of Mangolpuri and Raj Park police stations had recovered 116 stolen two-wheelers and arrested 14 alleged auto lifters and snatchers, police said. Apart from stealing two-wheelers and using them for street crimes, the arrested persons used to lend the vehicles to other gangs either on a daily rent basis or for a 20% to 30% share in the booty. The daily rent is between R2,000 and R3,000 depending on the speed of the bike or scooter, said deputy commissioner of police (outer) A Koan. Koan said there are two groups in the gang – one steals two-wheelers and the other uses them for snatching. The first group stole motorcycles from different parts of Delhi and parked them in lanes, near parks, drain and other parking spaces in unauthorised residential colonies in the jurisdiction of Sultanpuri police station. “Watchers were kept to keep an eye on the parked stolen vehicles and alert the kingpin and other members in case the police or anybody else picked up the vehicles. It helped the gang members to keep themselves updated about the status of the vehicles and avoid getting caught,” the DCP said. Police got information about the syndicate during the interrogation of 14 persons arrested for similar crimes in September. The information was developed by the Eagle Squad and on October 23, the team arrested three men – Sumit, Ajay and Vikas (first names) – with a stolen bike. “The trio said they were members of a gang led by Sagar alias Monu Kumar. We arrested the gang leader and 11 other members. Their interrogation led to the recoveries of 124 more stolen bikes and scooters parked at various places on Sultanpuri area,” said DCP Koan. The other arrested persons were identified as Vishal, Hemant, Harish alias Kamal, Parvinder Singh, Mohammad Sharif, Kuldeep Singh, Shakti alias Golu, Sagar alias Naresh, Amit Kumar, Deepak and Amit. “The kingpin Sagar is involved in 33 cases of theft and snatching. He has also actively involved juveniles in the crimes and benefits out of the money earned by them through illegal activities,” Koan said. Of the 125 recovered bikes, 53 were stolen from areas in Rohini district, 43 from outer district areas and the remaining from west, north-west, outer-north, central, New Delhi and north-east districts, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-eagle-squad-recovers-125-two-wheelers-stolen-for-street-crimes-nabs-15-gang-members/story-DZ4YAPVtsuYYiEaLW6xYgL.html

On Monday – November 9 – it recorded a ridership of 7,165, while on September 7, its ridership was 600. This is an increase of approximately 12 times in two months of resuming services, the NMRC said.Ritu Maheshwari, NMRC’s managing director, said, “This rise can be attributed to the fact that passengers have faith in the safety standards of NMRC and consider the Aqua Line as a safe and secure mode of public transport during the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.”Sandhya Sharma, deputy general manager of NMRC, said that people use the metro to get to their offices and workplaces. “Some people travel for Diwali shopping as well. We are hopeful that the footfall will further increase in the coming days,” she said.From September 7 to 11, metro services were available in the morning hours (7am to 11am) and evening hours (5pm to 9pm), at an interval of 15 minutes. From September 12, the Aqua Line started its full fledged operations running trains throughout the day (6am - 10pm). On September 12, it had recorded a ridership of 2,148 passengers and since then the ridership has seen a steady rise. The NMRC ridership data of November shows the footfall has remained between 4,000 and 6,000 per day. On weekends, the ridership is relatively lesser. However, the post lockdown ridership is still significantly low as compared to the pre-lockdown period. The services of Aqua Line metro were suspended on March 22 due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. The Aqua Line had recorded 19,064, 17,720 and 16,007 commuters on March 16, 17 and 18, respectively.NMRC had ensured all precautions necessary for prevention of the spread of Covid 19 before resuming services, said officials. Sharma said NMRC is taking all necessary measures to ensure a safe journey for Aqua Line commuters. “The NMRC trains are fully sanitised after each trip. The stations, platform and other contact areas like call buttons of lifts, AFC gates, handle belts of escalators & staircases, POS machines etc. are also sanitised at regular intervals. The e-rickshaws are regularly sanitised after every journey,” she said.The 29.70 km long Aqua Line, which connects Noida to Greater Noida, has 21 stations out of which 15 are in Noida and six in Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/aqua-line-records-highest-ridership-on-monday-since-it-resumed-services-on-september-7/story-2xwkkGh0ILMBuP5WPaRf4J.html

Officers said Sharma had allegedly cooked up a plot that Mavi had shot himself dead while taking a selfie with a gun. The police and forensic team gathered evidence and arrested Sharma for his involvement in the murder.The incident took place on Saturday afternoon when Sharma and Mavi were going to attend a wedding in Greater Noida. According to the police, Sharma had allegedly claimed that Mavi had shot himself while taking a selfie en route. He was rushed to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead.Police said Mavi was a resident of Dharampura village and Sharma is from Achheja village in Greater Noida. Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, Noida Central, said Sharma and Mavi were friends and had known each other for some years. “Mavi had reached Sharma’s sweets’ shop in the afternoon in Greater Noida west on Saturday.

10-11-2020||Noida||Sharp rise in ICU occupancy as cases from nearby cities come to Noida district||Noida: As the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease goes up in the Gautam Budh Nagar district, officials assure that the city has enough hospital beds, even as hospitals anticipate a surge in the number of critical patients and see an immediate need to augment intensive care unit (ICU) beds.Projecting a grim picture, the number of patients in ICUs in the district saw a surge of about a 100% in the past two days, even as the total number of patients in the hospitals has dropped. According to the official figures, Gautam Budh Nagar – comprising Noida and Greater Noida – has a total of 1,811 beds for Covid-19 in service across its 12 government and private hospitals, of which 383 beds are in ICU wards and 181 are with ventilators.As of Tuesday, there were 1,228 active cases in the district, of which 1,097 are from Gautam Budh Nagar, admitted across different hospitals of the city or home isolated, said the chief medical officer (CMO). On Tuesday, the district recorded one more fatality due to Covid-19 which has pushed the death tally to 70, while the total number of cases recorded so far is 19,531, with 119 new cases on Tuesday, according to the official data.“A of total 486 patients are home isolated while 742 patients are admitted across different L1, L2 and L3 hospitals in the district. Out of these 742 patients, a total of 131 are from other cities including Delhi,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, CMO. As of Tuesday morning, out of the total of 1,811 Covid-19 beds in the city, 742 beds were occupied, leaving 1,069 beds available. While on Monday, there were a total of 1,127 beds available. “We have enough or rather, more than enough beds available. There are a total of 1,811 beds in service for Covid-19, besides which we have kept 2,000 beds on reserve in case of an emergency situation. There are many patients coming here from neighbouring cities, including Delhi, Ghaziabad, Agra, etc., so we have sent clear instructions to all hospitals that they will have to inform the CMO and district magistrate’s office upon admitting any patients from other districts,” said Ohri. Fears of ICU bed shortageWhile officials say there are enough beds for the city, the issue is the number of Covid-19 patients in needing ICUs or oxygen support. Going by to official records, on Tuesday there were a total of 120 patients on oxygen support in the district, while 18 were on ventilators. This is a sharp increase from Sunday, when the number of patients in ICU was 64, of which eight were on ventilators.Meanwhile, hospitals anticipate a possible shortage in the number of ICU beds in ICU in the coming days. “Till Sunday, of the 30 ICU beds at our hospital, we had 28 occupied and three of these were High Dependency Unit (HDU). Due to the surge in critical cases, we have augmented the bed strength, by converting HDUs into ICUs. By Monday, we had 32 patients in ICU and we have already started converting some of the HDU beds into ICUs as the demand is high,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, spokesperson, Sharda University, which is Noida city’s only L3 covid-care hospital. Anticipating a need, the Government Institute of Medical Science (GIMS), Greater Noida had increased its ICU capacity from 40 beds to 80.“Currently we have about 100 Covid-19 patients, of which 40 are in ICU. Critical cases have increased and we have seen an increase of about 30% in ICU occupancy in the past week,” said Dr Saurabh Srivastava, head of the department Medicine and nodal officer of the Covid-19 team at GIMS.“Definitely there is a surge in the number of patients and many patients are coming from neighbouring cities like Delhi, Faridabad, Agra, Meerut, etc. Though we have enough beds, the only issue is that we have limited manpower,” said Dr (Brig) Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS. At Yatharth Hospital, a private hospital with a 200 bedded Covid-19 facility, too, the number of critical Covid-19 cases has increased. “The number of critical patients has surged after Durga Puja. At present, 90% of the ICU beds are occupied, which was about 50% ten days ago,” said Yatharth Tyagi, director, Yathath Hospital. Meanwhile at Fortis Hospital in Noida, the occupancy was full. “The total Covid-19 beds are 45, of which 23 are ICU beds having eight ventilators. Currently the occupancy is 100%,” said an official from the Fortis Healthcare Limited, asking not to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/sharp-rise-in-icu-occupancy-as-cases-from-nearby-cities-come-to-noida-district/story-CLAz0BjNgHtWHZ2KcD6QeL.html
10-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai airport’s RT-PCR test facility detects 100 passengers with Covid-19||Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) detected 100 Covid-19 positive passengers in around two months. The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test facility at the Mumbai airport that started functioning for international arriving transit passengers from September, and for departing passengers from mid-October, has seen over 8,000 passengers (till November 8) signing up to undergo the test.According to airport sources, till October 14, 38 arriving passengers were detected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, and 62 tested positive in less than a month between October 15 and November 8.Of the total 8,000 passengers who signed up for the test, 6,910 were men and 1,090 were women. “A hundred passengers have tested positive till now and were transferred by the state authorities to designated Covid-19 institutions,” said a CSMIA spokesperson. “There is an increase in passenger confidence in travelling via CSMIA given the comfort, convenience and sense of safety that passengers feel with the measures adopted by the airport. These features include the launch of the RT-PCR test facility at the airport,” he added.After the aviation ministry allowed international passengers to get tested upon arrival, the airport had commenced RT-PCR testing as a measure to skip the institutional quarantine. It was also introduced to address passenger concerns regarding different Covid-19 regulations across domestic and international destinations. October 15 onwards, departing passengers too were allowed to undergo the test before travelling and could produce their negative test report to skip institutional quarantine at their destination. The airport even extended the service to non-passengers who visit the airport to drop off or pick up passengers. However, just three days after the Central government issued guidelines allowing international passengers to undergo the RT-PCR test upon arrival, aviation experts had raised safety concerns and had asked the ministry to review their guidelines. Experts believed that the guidelines issued on a pilot basis would encourage fliers to avoid getting tested and would increase the risk of Covid-positive passengers infecting others on board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-s-rt-pcr-test-facility-detects-100-passengers-with-covid-19/story-o8LV44dDJ45RpxfqxWH2LO.html
10-11-2020||City||Delhi to link its hospitals digitally, connect citizen through e-health card by August 2021||New DelhiChief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said a digital health information management system (HIMS) and e-health card facility will be implemented in Delhi by August 2021. The e-health card – a QR code-based system -- will store basic demographic and health information of all the residents, and help the government in mapping all people eligible for its schemes. The HIMS will help the government in health care delivery by bringing all patient-care services, hospital administration, budgeting and planning under the system. The entire system will be cloud-based and will be supported by a website and a mobile app. The system will enable citizens to avail of all health care-related information on a single platform, which can help in cases of emergency. “With this, Delhi will become the only state to have a cloud-based health management system. This facility will also be extended to private hospitals in the future,” a release from the government said. At the same time, the central government has announced an ambitious National Digital Health Mission that will digitise all patient records, where the ID will act “like a health care account” where their entire medical history will be available. “It is our duty to ensure there is no inconvenience to the people of Delhi. This management system should be able to provide all the health care facilities to the people. Other than that, by 2021, every resident of Delhi visiting a hospital should be issued a card to avail of the benefits of government health care services. Post the issuing, we have to ensure this card is integrated with the HIMS,” the chief minister said on Tuesday. The government will also set up a centralised health helpline to ensure uninterrupted health care facilities. A call centre will be set up to provide patients help with tele-counselling, information requests, queries, complaints and follow-ups. “To ensure the effective reach of health care facilities to people, we will link the call centre facilities to the app launched under HIMS. This will resolve issues of the people effectively. This system will ensure the availability of a doctor for the people 24x7,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. The CM on Tuesday had convened a meeting with health officials to ensure implementation of the HIMS and e-health card in hospitals run by the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-to-link-its-hospitals-digitally-connect-citizen-through-e-health-card-by-august-2021/story-JMaBMeZrFyTORCWLsaForI.html

His body was tied with a boulder and then thrown in the dam to destroy evidence, said police.The victim Nilesh Kumar Rawal is a cooking oil trader and was missing since November 3. Senior inspector Ajay Vasawe of Talasari police station said, “Rawal visited Uddhwa and Talasari town every Wednesday to clear dues and take orders from grocers. As he did not return home, his wife registered a missing complaint with us on November 4.” “On November 8, evening, we were informed about a body floating in the dam waters. The body was then identified by his relatives,” said Vasawe.The unidentified accused, to destroy evidence, had tied a huge boulder around his waist and then threw the body in the dam. The victim had sustained head injuries as he may have hit the underwater rocks leading to his death, Vasawe added.“We suspect the accused knew Rawal’s weekly routine. They may have kidnapped him for money. We are probing all possible angles. We have sent the body for post-mortem and a registered case under section 302 (murder) and 364 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code and are investigating further,” said Vasawe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/missing-traders-body-found-in-talasari-dam-near-mumbai-cops-suspect-murder/story-UypY8tDdchIeG7Cntfw4GO.html
10-11-2020||City||Kalyan-Dombivli to get medical college, hospital akin to those in Mumbai, says Maharashtra health minister||The twin cities of Kalyan-Dombivli will soon get help from the state to construct a medical college and hospital on par with those in Mumbai, said Maharashtra state health minister Rajesh Tope.Tope, who was in Kalyan to review the Covid-19 situation in the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) jurisdiction, expressed satisfaction that the city has shown marked improvement in recovery and flattened the curve.He said, “Healthcare infrastructure in urban areas is our priority, for which we have decided to give permission to use the reserved plots in the city to develop a 500-bed hospital under the public-private partnership basis. The hospital will have reserved beds for free treatment to the low income group. KDMC, like Mumbai, will also be allowed to develop a medical college-cum-hospital in the coming months.”Tope pointed out that once a hotspot, the Covid cases in KDMC are now under control. The number of cases, which was 500 to 600 per day in September, is now down to 100-150 per day.Tope added, “The fatality rate is also low at 1.99 per cent, the doubling rate is 300 days and the recovery rate is 96 per cent. There is a lot of improvement due to the efforts put in by the civic body. We cannot rule out the possibility of increase in cases once Diwali is over. If there is an increase in cases to 900 daily, the civic body should be ready with the accommodation facilities,” added Tope.KDMC requested for the appointment of a medical officer and a physician from the state, which Tope agreed to follow up. He also assured to develop a dedicated hospital for epidemics in Thane in the near future.“There is a need to improve the healthcare infrastructure in Thane and nearby cities. Primary talks for building an epidemic hospital in Thane are under progress,” he said. Meanwhile, Tope also said that the decision to resume local train services and reopening of temples “will be only taken after Diwali festival”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kalyan-dombivli-to-get-medical-college-hospital-akin-to-those-in-mumbai-says-maharashtra-health-minister/story-ogBzAVbiocVQM2qLIBZ24I.html
10-11-2020||Noida||After NGT ban on fire-crackers, UP govt suggests digital mode to celebrate Diwali||Ghaziabad: A day after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed for a ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the national capital region till November 30, the Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday asked the NCR districts of the state, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, to enforce the NGT orders and suggested digital/laser mode for celebrating Diwali. The air quality index (AQI) of Ghaziabad, Kanpur, Lucknow, Moradabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Baghpat and Bulandshahr is in the serious category, said a statement issued by UP chief secretary RK Tiwari on Tuesday.“Complying with the NGT directions, orders have been issued to celebrate Diwali in these districts using new technology like laser or digital technology,” the statement said.The district administrations of Ghaziabad and GB Nagar said that they have received the directions from the UP government but have not decided yet whether to organise laser/digital shows. Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar, said that the district officials have received suggestions for the ways to celebrate cracker-free Diwali. “We are still brainstorming the ways in which it can be done. Maybe by Wednesday we may come up with some plans. Also, large gatherings will not be possible due to Covid protocols. We have asked our officials to ensure strict compliance of the NGT order,” he added. The officials of Ghaziabad administration said that they do not have plans for such events but focussing on enforcement of NGT’s order. “We don’t have any plans as of now. Our focus is on enforcement of the NGT order. I have directed the administration officials and even the SHOs to take up strict enforcement in their respective areas. They will ensure that there is no bursting or sale of firecrackers and will have to submit affidavits to this effect,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, DM, Ghaziabad. “As regards the licences, we have received applications but not issued any licence so far. We have also received directions that issue of licences should be kept in abeyance. Further, we have also asked traders to destroy their stocks of firecrackers. There is a strict protocol for storage of firecrackers. If anyone comes up with applications, we will consider upon the trader fulfilling conditions. Otherwise, they will have to destroy the stock,” Pandey added.Residents said that the directions by the tribunal came less than a week before Diwali, so it would not be possible to make use of laser/digital ways of celebrating Diwali. “Since organising such shows requires lot of funds and time, we think it will not be possible in few days left for Diwali. Further, during the present times of the pandemic, it will not be advisable for arranging such shows which will involve large social gatherings. However, such shows can be arranged locality-wise, but it would take up herculean task for making arrangement,” said Alok Kumar, founder member of federation of association of apartment owners in Ghaziabad. Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist and Raj Nagar resident, said, “Ban on firecrackers is an opportunity for residents to find innovative ways to celebrate Diwali in a grand manner. Laser show or light show is one of the ways. It is also an opportunity for parents to tell children about celebrating Diwali in a traditional manner. I think the amount spent on firecrackers should be spent on decorative items so that local artisans can get more work and also get benefitted.”Last year during Diwali, the Delhi government had organised a mega light and sound show at Connaught Place’s Central Park in the wake of rising air pollution. The Delhi government recently said that this year it would organise a Laxmi Puja and live stream it for people to perform the rituals at their homes in the wake of pollution and Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-ngt-ban-on-fire-crackers-up-govt-suggests-digital-mode-to-celebrate-diwali/story-1eadhFFD5IZAmODjooXJ1L.html

10-11-2020||Noida||Air quality ‘severe’ for sixth day in Noida, Ghaziabad||Noida: The air quality of Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida on Tuesday continued to reel under ‘severe’ category for the sixth day in a row, witnessing one of the worst pre-Diwali air pollution scenario in the three cities. On Tuesday, Noida’s air quality saw a marginal improvement, but the pollution levels remained well within ‘severe’ category, with average PM2.5 levels for the city was nine times higher than the standard limits.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, on Tuesday was 455 against 477 a day earlier. The AQI value of Greater Noida was 436 against 478 a day earlier, while AQI of Ghaziabad was 444 against 482 a day earlier. However, officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the meteorological conditions are likely to get better as wind directions on Tuesday noon changed from north-westerly to easterly and are picking up speed bringing a ray of hope that the trapped pollutants would start ventilating out in the next two days. “The wind directions have changed from north-westerly which is from the direction of Punjab and Haryana to the easterly. So, the current winds entering Noida, Ghaziabad and then Delhi are from the direction of Uttar Pradesh. By Wednesday, the easterly winds may increase to 10-12 kmph which may help improve the air quality a little by stopping extra stubble burning smoke entering the region and ventilating the pollutants out,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. However, IMD said that the moisture in the air is also high with air having around 50% moisture content during afternoon hour and by the evening it increases to 90%. Experts said that due to the high moisture content, the air traps pollutants making ventilation difficult. “During winter when the air is heavy due to the moisture, the particles or aerosols get heavy as well or trapped and they get close to the ground. This worsens the situation as the pollution levels accumulate at lower height. Also, more wind speed is required to ventilate them,” said Shambhavi Shukla, programme officer (air pollution), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). So far the local source of pollution, including construction, vehicular emissions and the smoke from stubble burning in neighbouring states brought along with north-westerly winds have made the region suffer a severe air quality since November 5. On Tuesday, the average PM2.5 levels for Noida for the past 24 hours was recorded at 547.99 microgrammes per cubic metres (ug/m3), while for Greater Noida it was 536.87 ug/m3. The average PM10 levels for Noida was 619.51 ug/m3, while for Greater Noida it was 661.49 ug/m3. As per CPCB, the PM2.5 and PM10 safe limit is 60 and 100 ug/m3, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-quality-severe-for-sixth-day-in-noida-ghaziabad/story-8yhtqXNsRfhHOtTKSWHyTN.html
10-11-2020||Noida||Six of 10 monitoring stations in Noida, Ghaziabad record higher PM2.5 levels than PM10 in November||Ghaziabad: With the air quality index (AQI) already running into ‘severe’ category for the past six days, most of the residents of Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida are forced to breathe higher levels of much finer PM2.5 pollutants than PM10 this month. According to data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), out of 10 monitoring stations in the three cities, six stations have recorded higher average PM2.5 levels than average PM10 levels during November 1 to November 9. The six monitoring stations are Indirapuram, Loni and Vasundhara in Ghaziabad, Sector 125 and Sector 1 in Noida, and Knowledge Park III in Greater Noida. Officials have attributed the rise in PM2.5 levels primarily to external sources, such as stubble burning and vehicular emission. “The main factors leading to higher PM2.5 levels is burning of garbage, solid waste and stubble, besides vehicular emission. At present, we do not have favourable meteorological conditions. Hence, dispersal is very less. There are already trapped pollutants in the region and fresh instances of stubble burning are also coming in,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), Ghaziabad. “Anti-smog guns are also not proving much helpful as they bring down pollutants up to a certain height, but trapped pollution layers come down again. At local level, we are even conducting night checks at industrial units and also scanning farmlands for any fire incidents,” he added. The CPCB data assessed by HT indicates that all the 10 air quality monitoring stations have also recorded their highest PM2.5 and PM10 levels of this year in November. The data also shows that PM2.5 levels were five to seven times the safe limit. The standard limit for PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) while that for PM10 is 100 ug/m3. Doctors said that high levels of PM2.5 pollutants pose severe health risks. “The very fine, PM2.5, poses a greater risk as they can get deep into lungs and even into the bloodstream, making both lungs and heart susceptible to impaired functioning. Once inhaled, part of the PM2.5 cannot be removed by the lymphatic system and enters the blood circulation through diffusion, making its way to the heart, kidneys, and other organs,” said Dr Vijay Dutta, senior consultant (internal medicine), Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, New Delhi. Echoing similar views, Dr Gyan Bharti, pulmonologist, Columbia Asia Hospital at Ghaziabad, said, “Long-term exposure to particulate matter may cause cardiovascular disorders such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart attacks. Short- to medium-term impact of exposure may cause respiratory effects such as asthma and bronchitis.” As per the CPCB data, Loni and Sanjay Nagar in Ghaziabad recorded all top five most polluted days of the year, in terms of highest PM2.5 and PM10 levels, in the current month during November 1 to 9. Likewise, Indirapuram and Vasundhara stations recorded their highest PM2.5 pollution levels of the year on four and three days, respectively, during the same period in November. Due to the high levels of PM 2.5, residents, especially senior citizens, are forced to stay indoors and curtail any outdoor activity. “The levels are so high that we have got confined to our house where air purifiers are working round the clock. Still, the breathing is heavy. Morning and evening walks are out of the question even with face masks as they turn black soon due to pollution cover. My husband and I have not moved out for the past one week now,” said Pratibha Mittal, a resident of Kaushambi in Ghaziabad. In Gautam Budh Nagar district, Greater Noida’s Knowledge Park III station has also fared badly. It has recorded all top five most polluted days of the year, in terms of highest PM2.5 and PM10 levels,in November. The city’s second monitoring station at Knowledge Park V also recorded its top five worst PM2.5 pollution level days of the year in November. The station also recorded worst four days of the year in the same period when PM10 pollution levels were the highest. All the four monitoring stations in Noida had more or less similar issues. Noida’s Sector 62 monitoring station also recorded four of five most polluted days of the year in November. City’s other three stations at sectors 125, 1 and 116 recorded at least three of top five most polluted days of the year, having highest PM2.5 pollutants, in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/six-of-10-monitoring-stations-in-noida-ghaziabad-record-higher-pm2-5-levels-than-pm10-in-november/story-9orVSiBSPZua1SJetDd3BN.html

The decision subsequently got clearance from the state government, and a revised set of SOPs for school reopening was released on Tuesday. As per SOPs parents will have to sign a written consent before students attend school. Similarly, students can study from their homes with the consent of their parents and the guidelines for such a model will be released by the department shortly. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad had earlier said online learning will continue for students who wish to stay at home and study. The SOPs have retained some key precautions that need to be taken by schools, parents and local administration to ensure the safety of school staff and children once schools reopen. Sanitising school premises, daily temperature checks, conducting a mix of online and offline learning, making small groups for the practicals are some of the other guidelines issued in the SOPs. Parents said considering the fear of the infection, many might opt for online learning even after schools reopen. “We will first wait for the vaccine to come because we cannot take risk of sending children to school. We will continue with online learning,” said Anu Sinha, a parent from Thane.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-education-department-releases-revised-sops-for-school-reopening/story-Y0lqO3sZM8Vjln8owuJ7iI.html

It is an autonomous body elected by the stakeholders of the university,” he added.The senate polls were postponed on October 15 for the second time amid apprehensions that the governing structure of the university could be changed.The Congress members said V-C was coming up with excuses to delay the polls while trying to set up a board of governors. “This is a blatant attack on the university’s autonomy,” they said.“We have come together for the sake of the University. Now Covid-19 cannot be an excuse to postpone the polls as several other elections are being held,” said Goldy.The senate is an “example of democracy and each representative of all the stakeholders is a part of the body. If the governing structure is changed it will hurt all the stakeholders,” Dhillon added.The polls, initially scheduled for August 24, were postponed by the V-C for the second time on October 15 even as the term of the senate ended on October 31, leaving PU without its supreme governing body.Earlier on Monday former senators and members of the PU syndicate held a protest on campus, demanding that the elections be held immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-v-c-playing-with-fire-by-delaying-senate-polls-cong-leaders/story-iDGCDtwUuXGfl4p67DPpbP.html

Police have recovered ₹1.4 lakh worth stolen gold valuables from his possession. Kishan Vankore, 23, has a long list of burglary and theft cases against him in Navi Mumbai and Thane. He has also been profiled by the state’s Criminal Investigation Department (CID). A resident of Panvel, Vankore has been breaking into houses for over six years when he took to crime following into his father and brother’s footsteps. Vankore’s father and brother have also been arrested multiple times for similar burglaries. In January, Vankore broke into a Nerul apartment in Sector-10 and stole gold valuables worth Rs 3.78 lakh. After months of investigation, police claimed that with the help of the informant network and technical leads, they suspected Vankore’s involvement in the crime. The police then went on his trail and located him at his hometown in Akkalkot, Solapur, from where he was arrested on October 31. “The accused has at least 22 cases of theft and burglary against him registered across police stations in Navi Mumbai and Thane. He has been committing crimes since the age of 18.

10-11-2020||City||AAP, BJP spar over retired employees’ insurance funds||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled civic bodies have collected Rs 221 crore from retired employees in the name of cashless insurance in private hospitals but did not pay the money to private hospitals. Senior AAP leader and the party’s MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak on Tuesday said it was a “scam” and the money should be returned to the retired employees. “The BJP ruled MCD has collected Rs 221 crore from retired employees in the name of cashless insurance in private hospitals but did not pay a single paisa to the private hospitals. There are around 34,000 pensioners under the BJP-ruled MCD and these people are suffering massively due to the misgovernance and corruption. These people had opted cashless insurance scheme under the MCD and now they are suffering,” Pathak alleged. According to the scheme, retired employees would pay a certain amount to the civic bodies, which would ensure free treatment in any hospital in Delhi. Pathak said the civic bodies took money from every employee -- as Group A employees gave Rs 1.2 lakh per person, Group B employees gave Rs 78,000, Group C employees Rs 54,000 per person and Group D employees gave Rs 30,000 per person. “These retirees deposited around R.221 crore in the account of the MCDs. The civic bodies are supposed to pay regular bills to the registered hospitals under the scheme but did not pay a single penny,” Pathak said. Jai Prakash, mayor North Delhi Municipal Corporation, rejected the allegations. “The AAP is in the habit of levelling new and baseless allegations every day. All payment in connection with providing cashless health care benefits have been made to hospitals on time before the coronavirus outbreak. After the pandemic, the payment process has slowed down but we are working to streamline it. There is no scam in MCD,” he said. Praveen Shankar Kapoor, Delhi BJP spokesperson dismissed AAP allegations. “Due to financial crunch, there are problems in providing cashless treatment to pensioners in North and East DMCs during Covid. We urge Durgesh Pathak, if he is even little sensitive towards civic employees and pensioners, to ask the Arvind Kejriwal government to immediately release municipal funds, which will resolve all the crisis,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-bjp-spar-over-retired-employees-insurance-funds/story-FGglgagdr2Ms54Dd7Bp70O.html
10-11-2020||Mumbai||Food safety commissioner can pass orders on transporting contraband in Maharashtra: Bombay HC||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court has held that the July 2018 order of the commissioner under Food Safety and Standards which barred transportation of banned products like gutkha through the state of Maharashtra is valid even though the contraband is being transported between states where it is not banned. The court observed that as the 2018 notification had categorically banned manufacture, sale, distribution and transportation of such food products in state the company could not claim any reliefsA division bench of justices TV Nalawade and SD Kulkarni while hearing the petition filed by Dharampal Premchand Ltd, an Uttar Pradesh based chewing tobacco manufacturing company, was informed by advocate NS Tekale that they were challenging the July 2018 order on the ground that it was illegal and void, as the commissioner had no power to impose a ban on transportation.According to the petition, in December, 2018, a consignment of chewing products was being transported from Noida, Uttar Pradesh to the purchaser from Bidar, Karnataka in a truck. The truck was intercepted in Degloor Tehsil in Maharashtra by a Food Safety officer who checked the contents and upon finding that it contained banned food articles in violation of July 2018 prohibitory order made a complaint to the police. Both the truck and its contents were seized.Government lawyer S G Sangle opposed the petition submitted that the inspection of samples showed that they contained nicotine and therefore the action under the prohibitory order was justified.After hearing submissions, the bench referred to previous judgements and said that as per the provision of the Act, ‘food business’ contains transportation and relief in respect of seized Gutkha can be refused. The court further expressed that given decisions already rendered, it was not possible to give a different decision.When the company’s lawyer sought time to enable a Delhi lawyer to argue the matter the court observed, “Such approach and tactics cannot be tolerated and so this Court decided tthe matter based on aforesaid circumstances. In the result, the petition stands dismissed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/food-safety-commissioner-can-pass-orders-on-transporting-contraband-in-maharashtra-bombay-hc/story-2jzbb93ohPAaaD36ZnxMjN.html

On Sunday, the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) arrested Saeed and four others in an ongoing crackdown on the use of drugs in Bollywood. In a raid at her home in Juhu, officers found 10 gram of marijuana. Saeed was remanded in judicial custody on Monday, following which her lawyer Ayaz Khan filed for bail. “We argued that the quantity seized is very small, for which the punishment is around one-year jail. She has separated from her husband and the custody of the two kids is to remain with her. She has to look after them also,” Khan argued while seeking bail. Following a tip-off, NCB first arrested Wahid Abdul Kadir Shaikh alias Sultan Mirza from Andheri (West). During his interrogation, he revealed that he had supplied marijuana to Saeed. Shaikh has allegedly been supplying drugs from several years and is known as Sultan Mirza in the drug supply chain, said NCB officers.An NCB team immediately reached Saeed’s residence in Juhu and a search was conducted in the presence of two independent witnesses. Officers recovered 10 gram of marijuana from the property, which was procured from Shaikh. A notice was issued under section 67 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and Saeed was arrested after her statement was recorded.Apart from Saeed and Shaikh, NCB also arrested three other drug suppliers in the operation, and their questioning is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bollywood-drugs-crackdown-producer-firoz-nadiadwala-s-estranged-wife-shabana-saeed-granted-bail-by-mumbai-court/story-wIb7ku3hBs0DGAVwDNWEDJ.html
10-11-2020||Mumbai||Amid threat of second Covid-19 wave, winter session of Maharashtra legislature to be held in Mumbai instead of Nagpur||Amid the Covid-19 pandemic and potential second wave of the infection, the state legislature has decided to hold its winter session in Mumbai instead of Nagpur. The session is likely to be postponed and duration reduced depending on the Covid-19 situation over the next two weeks. The decision about holding the session in Mumbai was taken in a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the state legislature on Tuesday. It was also decided to hold the budget session of the legislature in Nagpur, depending on the Covid-19 situation in February 2021. Traditionally, the winter session of the state legislature is held at Nagpur, the second capital of Maharashtra. The meeting was attended by legislative council chairman Ramraje Naik-Nimbalkar, legislative Assembly speaker Nana Patole, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar. “Considering the current situation and the possibility of a rise in cases after Diwali, we have deferred the decision about the date and duration of the session. We will have another meeting of the BAC by end of the month, and will take a call whether to begin it on December 7 as scheduled or postpone it by a week or two. The decision about holding it for one week or two will also be taken in that meeting,” said Patole. Ministers from Vidarbha, including energy minister Nitin Raut, dairy development minister Sunil Kedar and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis insisted that the session be held in Nagpur. “Holding one session in Nagpur, the second capital of the state, is mandatory as per the Nagpur Pact of 1953. We have decided to consider holding the budget session there. A final call over it will be taken by reviewing the Covid-19 situation at that time,” Patole said. The decision of shifting the winter session to Mumbai from the traditional venue of Nagpur was taken on the basis of a report by the state legislature after their review last week. After a visit by the chairman of the upper house, speaker of the lower house and officials from the legislature, they came to the conclusion that it could prove risky to hold the session in Nagpur. “At least 5,000 people, including police personnel, legislators and political workers from across the state attend the session. The employees need to report to Nagpur at least two weeks in advance and will need to quarantine as a precaution. In such a background, we recommended to avoid holding it in Nagpur,” said an official from the legislature. The option of holding the season online has been ruled out by the legislature secretariat. According to the officials from the secretariat, it will need a lot of manpower as every legislator will have to be given technical assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-threat-of-second-covid-19-wave-winter-session-of-maharashtra-legislature-to-be-held-in-mumbai-instead-of-nagpur/story-cyBJaN0xFlW7PPMhEHRsWM.html

Residents of New Palam Vihar, Palam Vihar, Sai Kunj, Bajghera and several colonies gathered under the aegis of Jan Adhikar Sanghathan and took out the protest march around 11am. They also submitted a memorandum, addressed to the chief minister, to the district administration officials. “The smart meters are not accurate and compared to normal meters, the readings are 30 to 49% higher. The DHBVN {Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam} is issuing inflated bills and consumers are getting double to triple the bills they used to get in the past. The DHBVN has been changing meters frequently in the last few years, but there is no benefit to the consumers due to this spending,” said Bir Singh Beeru Sarpanch, who heads the Sanghathan. The delegation also asked the government to waive off three months of electricity bill for the lockdown period on humanitarian grounds, as a large number of people lost their jobs. The consumers also demanded that billing should be done on monthly basis so that bills are not calculated at the highest slab. “Thousands of crores have been given to power companies as relief for pandemic losses and it is pertinent the government also offers relief to consumers on similar lines,” Rakesh Rana, president, Sai Kunj residents’ welfare association (RWA). Kuldip Dahiya, president, Sahib Kunj RWA, said that electricity consumers across the city have decided to unite and oppose the installation of smart meters as these are too inaccurate. “We will submit memorandums, hold protests and refuse to pay bills if the government does not accept our demand,” he said. The DHBVN, under the Smartgrid project, has so far installed 100,000 smart meters, with a target of 300,000 smart meters for the city. However, there has been a slew of complaints by residents, who have alleged multiple problems, which mostly lead to inflated bills. Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said that the concerns raised by city residents would be sent to government for consideration. “The concerns raised by city residents would be sent to the government,” said Khatri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-protest-against-smart-meters-claim-inflated-power-bills/story-Tbfn9D9rApHlQK6imqw29H.html

The police said at least 20 bullets were exchanged with the two alleged criminals during a brief chase, in which both suffered three gunshot wounds. They were rushed to the Civil Hospital in Sector 10A for treatment where one succumbed to injuries and the other was referred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi after being reported to be stable, said the police. Two countrymade pistols, 20 live cartridges, a backpack and a Swift car were allegedly recovered from their possession. The criminals were identified as Rohit alias Lambu (23) of village Kakrola in Gurugram and Sitender Pathak alias Gudda (30) of Panna in Madhya Pradesh. Rohit died during treatment at the hospital due to heart failure. The police said there was a reward of ₹25,000 for information leading to his arrest by Gurugram and Faridabad police. He was wanted for more than 50 cases of murder, attempt to murder, extortion, loot and robbery, the police said. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that the suspects, close aides of Kaushal, have been together involved in over 100 cases of murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping, extortion and carjacking, including the murder of Haryana Congress leader Vikas Chaudhary after he denied to pay ₹1 crore as protection money to Kaushal. “Rohit used to work in close coordination with Kaushal and handled his hawala transactions from different locations. He was involved in criminal cases in Palwal, Faridabad, Pataudi and Gurugram. His task was to collect phone numbers of industrialists, hoteliers, businessmen and sweet shop owners after conducting reconnaissance of these cities. Later, he made extortion calls and threatened the victims. In many cases, he along with aides, also shot small videos of the victims’ family members to threaten them. He had details of people from Gurugram, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Rewari,” said Rao. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police, said that crime investigation unit of Sector 17 received a tip-off that one of the wanted criminals will reach Gurugram around 2.30 am, along with his aide, to rob a businessman. “The crime team placed a barricade on Tauru-Naurangpur Road around 2.15am and deployed a team of 10 policemen. A speeding Swift car was seen coming towards the barricade and despite the presence of police team they broke the barricades. There was another team 50 metres ahead. The criminals also tried to drive over them, but lost control and rammed into divider. They tried to flee from the spot and fired at police teams,” he said. The police said they warned them to surrender but they continuously fired at them and in retaliation they shot five rounds, out of which three hit them and they fell on the ground. The police said inspector Narender Chauhan had a narrow escape after two bullets just crossed near his right ear and one hit his chest . He was wearing a bulletproof jacket, which saved him. The car used in crime was robbed from Pataudi five months ago, said the police.A case under sections 186(obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant), 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and sections 25/27-54-59 of Arms Act was registered at Kherki Daula police station on Tuesday, said the police. A team was formed on Tuesday to conduct raids at locations where these two criminals were operating from. They have been changing locations and have revealed that there are 20 more people in their gang, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sharpshooter-of-kaushal-gang-killed-another-injured-after-shoot-out-in-manesar/story-RWzY2a2ykkb69xuCtBKjkK.html
10-11-2020||Gurugram||Cyber city accident: Two policemen suspended for negligence in investigation||Two policemen, including the station house officer (SHO) of DLF Phase 2 police station, were suspended on Monday for negligence in the investigation of an accident in which a 49-year-old chief financial officer (CFO) of a private company was killed by car driven allegedly by a minor in DLF Cyber City on August 23, said the police. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that apart from shoddy investigation, there were several other reasons too for the suspension, due to which the action was taken. “There are clear instructions to all the officials to carry out a fair investigation and ensure justice to the victim’s family. The family had approached the SHO several times but he had not given them any satisfactory reply nor did he share any information regarding the investigation. There was no transparency shown in the case and the victim’s family had no clue what the police were doing in the case,” he said. Aman Beniwal, SHO, and sub-inspector Hari Om were handling the case and the family members had complained that they were not conducting a fair investigation. Further, required sections had not been added in the first information report (FIR). Mihika Wahi Gupta, wife of the deceased, Alok Gupta, said that she had met the commissioner on Monday and told him how she was running from pillar to post to get justice in the case. She said due to the weak sections and lack of proper investigation, the culprits got bail on the spot. “The car owner, who is equally responsible, should have been booked under section 308 of Indian Penal Code(IPC) as he had given his car to minors. Section 304(2) was not added for the co-passenger. The police also did not take digital footprints of the juvenile behind the wheel, school character certificate, call logs and previous track records,” she said. Gupta said the police were yet to conduct the DNA test of the blood found inside the car on the driving seat. “The police should have investigated who served liquor to the minors and which was the other car that was racing with the car involved in the accident. The car owner’s statement is yet to be recorded before the judicial magistrate, confirming that he was not driving the car,” she said. The accident took place on August 23 around 6am, when the victim, Alok Gupta, was on his way to Noida on his Harley Davidson motorcycle. A Ford Figo, in which two juveniles were allegedly travelling, had rammed into the divider and hit his motorcycle across the carriageway. Gupta had succumbed to injuries and, at the time, the police had registered an FIR against the juvenile driver and owner of car, who is a friend of the driver’s father, under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304 A (death by negligence) of IPC. The family of the deceased had been demanding that the police invoke more stringent sections against the accused persons. They had also demanded that the police make the parents of the juvenile driver, and the juvenile co-passenger of the car, a party in the case. On October 5, the police had booked the accused juvenile driver under Section 304 part-2 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). The section, which is non-bailable, was added to the FIR after the police sought legal opinion in the case. Later, the police added sections 184 (driving dangerously) and 185 (driving by a drunken person or by a person under the influence of drugs) of the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act against the juvenile driver and section 199 A of the MV Act against the car owner. Both were held and released on bail, said the police. The accident and the subsequent handling of the case by the police evoked widespread protests by the family and friends of the victim. On September 26, at least 400 people including family members, friends, cyclists, carrying placards and banners, had taken out a solidarity march from DT Mega Mall to the crime spot near DLF Phase 2 Rapid Metro station, demanding justice and action against the alleged perpetrators. Similar protests were held in Gurugram, Delhi, Noida, Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore and Jaipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cyber-city-accident-two-policemen-suspended-for-negligence-in-investigation/story-fPcQe0WRRpQeJbl0VckO4J.html
10-11-2020||Gurugram||DC confirms cracker ban in Gurugram||Withdrawing a previous order that allowed the use of firecrackers for two hours on Diwali, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri on Tuesday declared a complete ban on firecrackers in the district till November 30, in compliance with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order and state government directiveNon-compliance will be dealt with strictly by the Gurugram police and Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), the order stated. At least 10 shops and godowns of firecrackers in the district were also sealed on Tuesday, according to the Gurugram police.Earlier this week, licensed traders were allowed to sell green crackers and eight designated spots were designated for cracker bursting on Diwali. The revised order issued on Tuesday, however, stated that the new order supersedes all the previous orders issued by the district administration.On Monday, the NGT imposed a blanket ban on the sale or use of crackers in Delhi-NCR from midnight of November 9 till the midnight of November 30. The NGT, in its order, highlighted that the use of any type of crackers is hazardous. It stated that it is harmful to the lungs and eyes, and especially poses a problem for the elderly. The use of crackers will further aggravate the pollution problem in the region, which is already under toxic air.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that following the latest order, the task of sealing cracker shops and warehouse has already started in the district. “Gurugram Police is keeping a vigil on the shops and godowns dealing in firecrackers. Till Diwali, all firecracker shops will be sealed to avoid any violation of the order. If anyone is found involved in sale and purchase or bursting of firecrackers, action will be taken against them under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” said Rao.Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act is applied when a person refuses to comply with the directions issued by the government and is a punishable offence. As reported by HT on Tuesday, at least 32 people were booked in the last two days for bursting firecrackers in residential areas despite repeated warnings. According to Rao, 40 teams have been formed to keep a check on the activities in different parts of the city. Police have also reached out to residents’ welfare association to circulate orders on a complete ban on firecrackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dc-confirms-cracker-ban-in-gurugram/story-V6KBxSgK2TTjp1KJvyuI1O.html
10-11-2020||Gurugram||‘Severe’ air persists, no change in strategy||Even as the city endured a fourth consecutive day of ‘severe’ air on Tuesday, recording an air quality index (AQI) of 427 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s daily bulletin, Gurugram’s local strategy to deal with the crisis remains largely unchanged, officials revealed. Measures implemented under the Centre’s Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) for ‘severe’ air are already in place, and will be intensified in the days leading up to Diwali, officials said, but added that mere enforcement of Grap protocols is unlikely to provide immediate relief from smog that has settled this past week.“At the moment, we are intensifying dust control measures in old Gurugram and stepping up inspections in newer sectors, where we have noticed violations of garbage dumping and burning. We have also started taking air samples to check for firecracker emissions,” said Shakti Singh, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board’s (HSPCB) regional officer for Gurugram.Although he did not provide specific details, Singh said that night patrolling and field inspections to check for polluting activities have been increased in the past two days. “Merely enforcing Grap measures is not going to make the smog go away. They are only so that we don’t worsen the present situation,” he added.Experts, too, were in agreement with the view. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, at the Centre for Science and Environment, said, “There is an airlock above Delhi-NCR, and simply implementing the Grap is not going to have much of an impact on the pollution load. But these measures are important nevertheless, if implemented with a zero-tolerance policy. As for relief from the present smog episode, we have to wait for meteorology do its job.”Deputy commissioner Amit Khatri, when asked if the district administration is considering any major change to their policy against air pollution or if any additional measures beyond those specified in the Grap are on the cards, directed the questions to additional deputy commissioner Prashant Panwar and city magistrate Brahamprakash Ahlawat.Panwar said, “We are monitoring the situation and have passed some orders regarding pollution control.” However, he did not disclose further details or elaborate on the orders.Ahlawat said, “Our strategy going forward is to intensify Grap measures which are already in place, namely mechanised road sweeping and sprinkling of water. There has not been any discussion yet of implementing harsher restrictions, such as a complete ban on construction. We will, however, be implementing the NGT’s blanket ban on firecrackers.”A senior HSPCB official, seeking anonymity, said that the state government and district authorities are unlikely to roll out further measures independently. “Policy level guidelines were earlier given by the EPCA {Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority}, and implemented by local authorities after suggestions from the HSPCB. Since that body has now been dissolved, we are awaiting instructions from the newly appointed CAQM {Commission for Air Quality Management}. The Commission had earlier this week made some recommendations to control air pollution given the present situation, but those measures are already part of the Grap.”The HSPCB, nodal authority for the implementation of the Grap, is expected to issue fresh orders to all deputy commissioners on Wednesday regarding the ongoing situation. S Narayanan, member-secretary, HSPCB, said, “The CAQM on Tuesday held a meeting with the chief and principal secretaries of NCR states. Pursuant to their discussion, deputy commissioners concerned will be given instructions regarding air quality regulation on Wednesday. We can share the order copy once issued.”While Gurugram’s air quality did improve slightly from Monday, when the AQI was 482, due to a change in wind direction, pollution levels remain extremely hazardous. Official forecasts do not predict a significant improvement in the situation. The ministry of earth science’s early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR states, “Significant improvement in Air Quality is not likely owing to slow wind speed in particular during night time. The air quality is likely to remain in Severe category on 11.11.2020 and Severe to Very Poor category on 12.11.2020.”As per CPCB’s forecast, Gurugram’s AQI on Wednesday is expected to hover around 393, in the upper end of the ‘very poor’ category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/severe-air-persists-no-change-in-strategy/story-ByZwNodWn7vqlD3I8UaJzN.html

Mysuru’s Yashas Chandra struck a 68 to also be tied second, he made a gain of four spots. Both Arjun and Yashas played their second rounds at the Panchkula Golf Club.Each half of the field has so far played a round each at the Chandigarh Golf Club and the Panchkula Golf Club. The action (third and fourth round) now shifts to Chandigarh.The halfway cut came down to two-over-146 as 53 professionals made it to the money rounds.Twenty-one-year-old Karandeep Kochhar (66-68), the runner-up in Panchkula last week, continued his consistency in the tricity swing with another solid effort where he picked up five birdies in exchange for a lone bogey.Kochhar, whose only win on the PGTI came in 2016 while he was still an amateur, got his round going with a birdie on the second where his good chip left him an easy tap-in. He collected another birdie on the third and made a couple of great par saves on the ninth and 10th.An accurate approach shot on the 12th earned Kochhar his third birdie. He also drove well to pick up birdies on the 13th and 16th, both par-5s. The tall and lanky golfer’s first bogey of the week came on the 16th.“I’ve been quite consistent since last week so I’m happy about that. I dropped my first bogey today in three rounds (including the last round from last week’s event) and that gives me a lot of confidence going forward. Overall, a good round despite missing out on birdie chances on the last two holes, especially the lip out on the 18th. I’ll have the comfort of playing in my home conditions in Chandigarh on the last two days, so look forward to making the most of it,” said Kochhar.Arjun Prasad (69-67), another 21-year-old, produced a top-notch 67 featuring six birdies and a bogey. Prasad’s round was highlighted by two birdie conversions from a range of 15 to 20 feet as well as his bunker shot on the 11th and tee shot on the par-3 13th that set up four-footers for birdie.“It’ll be fun to play alongside Karandeep in the leader group tomorrow. We’ve both grown up playing a lot of golf together but it’s been a while since we played our last round together. So look forward to it,” said Prasad.Yashas Chandra (68-68) posted a second straight 68 to share second place with Arjun. Yashas’ round included seven birdies, a bogey, and a double-bogey.Chandigarh’s Akshay Sharma (68), the winner on the PGTI last week, was in a four-way tie for fourth at seven-under-137 along with Gurugram’s Veer Ahlawat (71), who slipped two spots from his overnight tied second, Chandigarh’s Ranjit Singh (67) and Kolkata’s Shankar Das (69).Chandigarh’s Ajeetesh Sandhu, Patna’s Aman Raj, Kolkata’s Viraj Madappa, and Bengaluru’s Khalin Joshi were all bunched in tied 21st at two-under-142.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tata-steel-pgti-players-championship-2020-day-2-kochhar-moves-to-first-place/story-v9pD9aUazAnXFK9Kqk7DML.html

It was also the day on which he was arrested by the Punjab vigilance bureau (VB) for his involvement in a scam involving 1,295 acres of shamlat land in Mohali’s Seonk village. Tehsildar Sukhpinder Kaur and assistant commissioner Manish Rana conducted the probe on the orders of district magistrate Girish Dayalan and submitted the report to the district magistrate on Tuesday.First registry at 1.45 pm, arrest at 2.30 pmInvestigations revealed that 66 documents were allegedly marked to Dhoot for registration with his signature on the day of his arrest.The first registry was done at 1:45 pm and the last one around 6 pm with photographs of the applicants without that of Dhoot – exempted anyway due to Covid-19. Dhoot’s final signatures were required on the documents even as the other parties and witnesses had signed on the papers.The report stated that, on November 2, Dhoot was in Hoshiarpur and later in Chandigarh before being arrested at around 2.30 pm. Dhoot was not present at the time of the registration of documents, the report said. It was also clear that the documents had been registered without the registering officer seeing or identifying the parties – in violation of the Registration Act, 1908.It was believed that the registry clerk and five other employees had earlier written in a statement that Dhoot was present in office till 12:30 pm and the registries were marked by him. The documents were registered on his directions with the understanding that he would return to finally sign off the papers.The statement was later withdrawn when call details records (CDRs) were presented to the party concerned. Some parties that had their documents registered on November 2, when contacted on phone, said they did not meet Dhoot at any point of time.When asked to comment on the matter, Dayalan said, “we will hold a departmental inquiry against registry clerk and other related officials for concealing the facts, following which action will be initiated.” What the Registration Act statesAccording to the Act, no document can be registered unless the persons executing such document, or their representatives... appear before the registering officer within the time allowed for presentation under sections 23, 24, 25 and 26. The registering officer may, in order to satisfy himself that the persons appearing before him are the persons they represent themselves to be, or for any other purpose contemplated by this Act, can examine any one present in his office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sub-registrar-in-vigilance-custody-but-66-land-deeds-registered-in-his-office/story-K1Hfxv7V2S273cN28AeN4H.html

UT health officials marshalling resources for the testing said five teams would be going to the markets to do everything possible to stop eventualities of super spreading events in the markets.The UT has witnessed a surge in Covid-19 cases since the onset of November after a decline in October. Cases and deaths peaked in September. “The teams deployed will request salespersons and shop owners besides customers in the markets to get tested. We have started the process and covered a few peripheral markets. In the next few days, the focus will be on the main markets, including Sector 17 and Elante Mall. The schedule will be prepared a day before,” said Dr VK Nagpal, UT joint director, health department.In the last one month, random samples collected by the department have had positivity rates of around 3%, with 101 infections detected in 3,000 tests through rapid antigen kits. So far, people from the market areas have not come forward for voluntary testing.However, a large number of people turning up at dispensaries had been tested. “The health department vehicles do not attract many people in the markets.

Senior officers said, police station-wise teams have been constituted to intensify patrolling in coordination with resident welfare associations (RWAs) and NGOs in order to ensure zero cracker bursting or illegal sale of firecrackers. Schools have been asked to encourage children not to burst crackers, they said.Additional spokesperson of Delhi Police Anil Mittal said that as a part of their action plan against the sale of firecrackers, all district deputy commissioners of police have constituted police station-wise teams to supervise implementation of the NGT order. Beat staff will be briefed by station house officers and special flying squads will patrol areas to check any sale by licensed or unlicensed sellers in their district, Mittal said.“All temporary fireworks licence holders have been informed in writing about the cancellation of all licences. Police teams will inspect all licencees, seal the stock and ensure its storage in safe custody of the licensee so that they are not misused. Any unauthorised stock of crackers will be seized and legal action will be initiated against them,” he said.The officer said all permanent licences, issued by the licensing unit as well as by the Joint Chief Controller Explorer office, Faridabad, are to be suspended and licensees be informed in writing.“The inventory and stock registers should be checked regularly to prevent any sale or diversion of the stock. Dedicated teams of thhe licensing unit have been constituted to carry out inspections,” he said.Mittal said special teams have been set up by SHOs to ensure no fire crackers are burned before, during or after Diwali. Senior officers will coordinate with RWAs and NGOs about the new directives.“School authorities conducting online class have been approached to motivate students not to burst crackers. Legal action will be taken against violators,” Mittal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-gets-cracking-to-implement-firecracker-ban/story-DJ0K2gGTbwS1edabT50Z9H.html

Jain said if entrepreneurs wants to change their industry, they will not be charged a conversion fee as the Delhi government has decided to waive it off.“We are not removing the old industries, we are just making them shift to hi-tech services. Second, we have increased the floor area ratio (FAR) of certain industrial plots irrespective of their sizes. The new FAR has been approved as per industrial standards,” Jain said in a meeting with representatives of industrial associations.Sanjay Vig, general secretary of the Industrial Area of Mangolpuri, said this will reverse the traditional trend for the industries in Delhi. “It will cut down industrial and labour cost, generate employment and prove to be a positive development for the industries in Delhi,” he said.According to a recent notification issued by the government, only hi-tech and service industries will be allowed to operate in new industrial areas in Delhi. The old manufacturing industries have the option to switch to the hi-tech and service sector.“As per amendments to the Master Plan 2021, hi-tech industries will be set up in the new industrial areas, something that we were trying for the past four years,” Jain said.The old industrial areas will have the option to shift to new sectors, including computer hardware and software industries, offices of lawyers, media and chartered accountants, IT-enabled services, internet and e-mail providers, and call centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-conversion-charges-if-manufacturing-units-shift-to-hi-tech-and-services-sectors-in-delhi/story-Dt0UbRig3uxZ70hb5E9NxN.html

All the five alleged attackers were apprehended by the evening and were being questioned. They were not officially arrested or apprehended till the time of filing this report. At least two of them were below the age of 18 years, the police said. Additional deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Jitendra Kumar Meena, who is looking after the charge of DCP (outer-north) in his absence, said that around a week ago, the teenager, Karan Pal, and the five persons had an altercation after he asked them to stand away from his father’s tourist bus. “The five persons are students of a private coaching institute, which is near the workplace of the teenager’s father. The bus was parked after washing. The students were standing near it with their female classmate. The teenager asked them to stand away from the bus. It led to an altercation between them. However, locals intervened and the five persons left the place,” said additional DCP Meena. On Tuesday around 2 pm, the teenager was walking towards his father’s workplace when the five persons allegedly cornered him and rained kicks and punched on him. The teenager fell unconscious. By the time his father and brother could come to his rescue after being informed about the fight by a local person, the alleged attackers had fled, said the officer. The teenager was rushed to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead. A case of murder was registered and investigation was taken up. The investigating team collected information about the suspects through local enquiry. Investigators learnt that the suspects were students of a local coaching centre and their altercation with the teenager a week ago. “We identified the suspects and apprehended them from their respective homes in outer Delhi. They are being questioned to ascertain the exact sequence of the events leading to the fight and the teenager’s murder,” said an investigator, who did not want to be named. There were rumours that the teenager had seen the five persons allegedly harassing a girl and had protested against it on the day of the altercation. The five persons had threatened him with dire consequences. Additional DCP Meena, however, denied it, saying that the girl was a student of the coaching centre and she was known to the five persons. “We also heard about the harassment issue. But we enquired about it and found that nothing such had happened. There is no such complaint as well from any girl,” added Meena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/teenager-beaten-to-death-by-five-persons-for-asking-them-to-stand-away-from-his-father-s-bus-in-delhi/story-Df3M103PDcl2YGgNrsQ4NP.html

The report is still awaited, the ministry told the HC.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Punjab government are yet to submit their responses. Now, the plea will be taken up for hearing on January 27.The response came to a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking CBI probe into the scam. The plea was filed by Satbir Singh Walia, a Chandigarh resident, in September.The central government-sponsored scheme is aimed at giving scholarships to meritorious students belonging to economically weaker sections so as to provide better opportunities for higher education.The plea had demanded transfer of probe to CBI and registration of FIRs against the officials responsible for the embezzlement. Despite reports of embezzlement three years back, no action has been taken against anyone till date, the petitioner had alleged.Centre and Punjab have appointed new teams to reinvestigate the matter. However, neither has clarified as to whose report will be deemed final and both are investigating on their own without lodging any FIRs, the petitioner added.It seems both have no intentions to take any action against the people involved in the scam even as the report by additional chief secretary Kirpa Shankar Saroj, prima facie establishes that the scam did take place and there is involvement of high-level official among others, the petitioner said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/post-matric-scholarship-scam-report-sought-from-punjab-centre-to-hc/story-vNzQHsyGm850s5RqxgtGRI.html

10-11-2020||City||LSR College students to protest on Thursday, demand revocation of hostel policy||New Delhi: The students union of Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College has announced a protest outside the college premises on Thursday, demanding revocation of the hostel policy that was introduced this year. Union members said it will be in continuation of the ongoing virtual protests by the students to demand justice for a 19-year-old undergraduate student who died by suicide in her hometown in Telangana on November 3, after facing difficulties in pursuing online education amid the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the parents of the student, she was stressed over being asked to vacate the college hostel. The college administration had asked all second-year students to vacate the hostel by October-end, which was later extended to November 10. Starting this year, the college will only offer the hostel facility to first-year students. The students union on Tuesday held a virtual general body meeting and decided to hold a protest on Thursday. “The students union demands revocation of hostel vacating notice and first-year hostel policy. We demand the distribution of tablets and data packs for online classes to all students in need and the college should only charge tuition fees from the students till the physical classes resume. A committee should be formed for solutions to issues and exclusion faced by socially and economically backward students,” the union said in a statement.Unnimaya P, general secretary of the LSR students union, said the students continued the boycott of online classes for the second day on Tuesday, to condemn the incident. “Students of many departments at the college have boycotted the classes. Some had also attended online classes with placards and posters demanding justice for the deceased student. Around 300 students and alumni of the college attended the general body meeting on Tuesday. The protest will continue till our demands are met and on Thursday we will hold a physical protest outside the college,” she said. College principal Suman Sharma said that the administration has not received any formal information about the protest from students. On being asked about the possible change in the hostel policy, Sharma said, “The hostel policies were changed to accommodate Other Backward Category and Economically Weaker Section category reservation. We can sit and discuss what can be done for students who require the facility. But we have very limited space to accommodate students from all three years. We will look into the other demands of the students. We are constantly in touch with the family of the deceased student.” The parents of the dead student said that they had mortgaged their house and gold ornaments for Rs 2 lakh for her education and helped her fulfill her dreams of becoming an Indian Administrative Services officer and study in Delhi. The student was a recipient of the INSPIRE scholarship sponsored by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.DST on Tuesday issued a statement, asking shortlisted candidates for the scholarship to complete their formalities quickly so that the scholarship can be disbursed at the earliest possible. “The DST is extremely grieved at the loss of life of a student of LSR College for Women, New Delhi and an aspirant of Scholarship for Higher Education (SHE) under ‘Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE)’ scheme of DST. She was one of the brightest and promising students of the country. It is, for this reason, she was offered the Inspire SHE scholarship.”“As in other years, the provisional fellowship letters of scholarship were sent out to 9762 eligible applicants in August this year. The students are asked to upload three simple documents like bank account details, mark-sheet, and a bonafide/performance certificate from the college, following which scholarship for the entire year is promptly released. Regretfully, these documents were not received from the concerned student. DST would like to appeal to all the shortlisted candidates to complete their formalities quickly so that the scholarship can be disbursed at the earliest possible. We especially urge all the institutions to cooperate in this important matter in a time-bound manner,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lsr-college-students-to-protest-on-thursday-demand-revocation-of-hostel-policy/story-BmT7uJJXgq0QiXqqDxv2eK.html
10-11-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand by-polls: 3rd member of Soren family elected in a ruling alliance show||The ruling allies Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and the Congress retained their assembly seats in the Jharkhand by-polls on Tuesday, even as Basant Soren, youngest of the three sons of JMM patriarch Shibu Soren, became the third person of the political family to become a member of the current Jharkhand assembly.41-year-old Basant defeated former BJP minister Lois Marandi by over 6,842 votes in party stronghold of Dumka, the constituency vacated by his elder brother and incumbent chief minister Hemant Soren after he won Dumka and Barahit in December 2019 assembly elections and decided to retain the latter.Sita Soren, wife of late Durga Soren, eldest son of Shibu Soren, represents Jama seat in the Jharkhand assembly. JMM chief Shibu Soren is currently a member of the Rajya Sabha.In Bermo assembly seat, Jai Mangal Singh, son of Congress veteran Rajendra Singh, won by over 14,225 votes, defeating former BJP legislator Yogeshwar Mahto Batul. The seat fell vacant after Rajendra Singh, who was representing the seat for the sixth time, died of illness in May.The ruling JMM-Congress-RJD combine had won a comfortable majority in the assembly polls in December, and just over 10 months later they retained the two seats in the by-polls. The result would give the alliance a political boost as the opposition BJP had been targeting the Hemant Soren-led government over a host of issues including law and order, implementation of electoral promises and health management during the corona pandemic, besides alleged nepotism. Bihar Election Results: Full coverageThough the ruling allies retained their seats, their margin of victory in both seats dipped compared to the margin in 2019. Rajendra Singh had won from Bermo by over 25,000 votes, while Hemant Soren had won from Dumka by over 13,000 votes.“We are grateful to voters who despite corona pandemic exercise their franchise and participated in the festival of democracy. I thank them for showing faith in a Jharkhandi government. I also thank the workers of the allies JMM and Congress for their hard work” said CM Hemant Soren in a tweet in Hindi. Jharkhand BJP spokesperson Pratul Shadeo said the party accepts the verdict with humility. “Sympathy dominated the misgovernance and helped the Congress candidate in Bermo. In Dumka, the margin of the JMM candidate’s win has reduced by half as compared to 2019 despite the ruling party using the entire might of the state in favour of Basant Soren,” Shahdeo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-by-polls-3rd-member-of-soren-family-elected-in-a-ruling-alliance-show/story-kuDYWsIoevks4fJkuc2EOI.html

10-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi air quality witnessing unusual condition, no quick recovery likely: SAFAR||Delhi is witnessing an “unusual” condition and no quick recovery is predicted from the “severe” air pollution, a central government forecasting agency said on Tuesday.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said three major factors are responsible for this situation -- secondary particle formation, extremely calm local surface winds and stubble burning-related intrusion.“Delhi’s overall AQI is in the higher end of the ‘severe’ category, which is an unusual condition,” it said.“Due to a high moisture content, humidity has touched a new high and the air holding capacity has increased under such cool conditions, triggering rapid secondary fine particulate formation -- a scientific process when gas-to-particle conversion happens and in-situ chemical production takes place on available surfaces and multiplies PM2.5,” the SAFAR added.Also Read | Centre’s timely intervention could have reduced pollution surge in Delhi: Gopal RaiThe extremely calm local surface winds continued to arrest all old and new accumulated pollutants, it said.“Significant stubble burning-related intrusion took place until Tuesday morning due to a favourable, transport-level wind direction and speed,” the SAFAR said.However, the transport-level wind direction has changed now, which is likely to reduce stubble intrusion.“But due to the first two factors, no quick recovery is predicted unless the moisture content declines with radiative heating,” the SAFAR said.It said the air quality index (AQI) of the national capital is likely to improve to the lower end of the “severe” category to the higher end of the “very poor” category on Wednesday owing to a change in the transport-level wind direction and marginally better ventilation conditions.The SAFAR said the farm fire count in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas stood at 2,247 on Monday.“The number has reduced marginally but is still significantly high,” it said. The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was 22 per cent on Tuesday.An apocalyptic smog enveloped Delhi in grey on Tuesday, blotting out the sun from the sky and smudging landmarks from view as the air quality hit “emergency” levels.The city recorded an overall AQI of 476 at 4 pm, which falls in the “severe” category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (474), Ghaziabad (476), Noida (490), Greater Noida (467) and Gurugram (469) also recorded “severe” air quality.This is the sixth “severe” air day on the trot in Delhi. The city witnessed seven “severe” air days in November last year.Also Read | Severe air quality in 9 Uttar Pradesh cities; Ghaziabad, Greater Noida worst in countryThe levels of PM2.5 -- which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases -- were 644 µg/m3 at 12 noon -- around 11 times higher than the safe limit of 60 µg/m3.The PM10 levels rose to 777 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) at 8 am, the highest since June 14, 2018, when it peaked to 847 µg/m3, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.If the PM2.5 and PM10 levels are more than 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 respectively for over 48 hours, emergency measures such as a ban on construction activities and entry of trucks, and a car-rationing scheme can be implemented under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for Delhi-NCR, notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-air-quality-witnessing-unusual-condition-no-quick-recovery-likely-safar/story-7LNf36PeIemhBck7PBd0yO.html

10-11-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena slams BJP for celebrating four years of demonetisation||Maharashtra’s ruling Shiv Sena on Tuesday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for celebrating four years of demonetisation saying it is akin to “cutting a birthday cake on the graves of those destroyed by the decision”. In an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana, the Sena called the surprise demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on November 8, 2016, a “black chapter” in the nation’s history.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday defended the move, saying it reduced black money and increased transparency even as opposition parties called demonetisation a national tragedy.The editorial targeted Modi saying he promised to bring back the black money and deposit Rs 15 lakh in the bank accounts of every citizen. It said leaders here should keep in mind how US President Donald Trump lost.Also Read: If we can learn anything from Trump’s defeat…: Sena’s jibe at ‘losing’ NDA in Bihar“Demonetisation was a black chapter in the history of our nation... The celebration over the decision is like cutting birthday cake on the graves of those who lost their jobs, died by suicide, or whose businesses were shut [because of the move]. Accepting mistakes shows the mettle in leadership. But the new political culture is to support mistakes. President Trump did the same in America.”The editorial said Modi claimed demonetisation will curb terrorism as black money sources will be cut off. It added terrorist activities continue as note ban has not stopped terrorist operations. “It was claimed that after demonetisation terrorism in Kashmir will end, but has it happened? While Prime Minister Modi and his colleagues were celebrating the fourth anniversary of the decision [demonetisation], four soldiers were martyred in an encounter with terrorists in the Machil sector of Jammu & Kashmir. Infiltration and skirmishes have gone up in the Kashmir valley.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-slams-bjp-for-celebrating-four-years-of-demonetisation/story-fNX0zbhw0AQgH9EhAB30fK.html

10-11-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal to go Haryana way on job quota for local youngsters||Close on the heels of the BJP-JJP government passing a Bill for 75% quota in the private sector for Haryanvi youngsters, the Himachal Pradesh government is considering introducing a legislation to provide 70% jobs for locals. “We are studying what Haryana has done to see if a similar law can be implemented in Himachal Pradesh,” said state labour commissioner-cum-director of employment Neeraj Kumar. Unemployment is a major poll issue in Himachal, which ranks fourth among states with the highest unemployment rate in the country, and parties, including the BJP, promised maximum jobs to Himachalis in the run-up to the 2017 assembly elections. The BJP’s Vision Document promised to “strictly implement the criteria of 70% jobs to Himachal youth in the industry”. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a thinktank, Himachal Pradesh’s unemployment rate in October was 13.5%. Haryana was still at the top at 27.3%, followed by Rajasthan at 24.1% and Jammu and Kashmir at 16.1%. The national average is 6.6%. HIGH SALARY EXPECTATIONS A HURDLE Kumar says the problem in Himachal Pradesh is the high salary expectations among youngsters, who prefer white collar jobs to working in industries and prefer heading out of the state for better pay. Himachal Chapter of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) chairman Lt Col Shailesh Pathak (retd) says as a result, the state has a dearth of local skilled labour and the industry is forced to hire labour from other states. “The demand for industrial jobs is not as much here (in Himachal Pradesh). We overcome the shortfall in labour by hiring from other states,” he says. He says the CII holds recruitment camps across the state, including the tribal areas, to hire workers for industries but the response has been low. “There are several units in the industrial areas of the state that need skilled labour but are not getting it locally,” he adds. HIRE FROM HIMACHAL FIRST: EX-MINISTER Former Congress minister GS Bali, who has been flagging the issue of unemployment, says the industry gets cheaper labour from other states so it does not need to recruit local youth. “It should be mandatory for the industry to hire skilled workforce from Himachal first,” he says. Criticising the Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government of failing to keep its poll promise, he says, “The government has made no efforts to ensure maximum jobs for locals in Himachal’s industries. Neither does it have any intention nor a comprehensive policy for this.” Bali admits reserving 70% jobs for locals is a tall order as many youngsters are engaged in seasonal occupations. “Most jobs in the state are in the tourism and agriculture/horticulture sectors. During the lean tourist season, youngsters head towards agriculture. Industries demand round the year commitment, so not many youngsters give it preference,” he says. NEARLY 8.5 LAKH REGISTERED UNEMPLOYED According to the department of labour and employment, the number of registered unemployed youth in the state is a staggering 8,49,701 as on March 31, 2020. This is about 12% of the state’s total population. About 76,000 of them are postgraduates, 1.35 lakh graduates, six lakh matriculates and undergraduates, 30,000 under matriculates and 6,230 illiterate. More than 44% of those registered are women. An estimated 60,000 new youngsters enter the market seeking jobs after completing their studies every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-to-go-haryana-way-on-job-quota-for-local-youngsters/story-a5zggyQc1KD5jdZVYKPAQM.html
10-11-2020||Bangalore||BJP wins Sira assembly seat in Karnataka for first time||The ruling BJP in Karnataka created history of sorts by bagging the Sira assembly segment in Tumakuru district for the first time with party candidate C M Rajesh Gowda emerging the winner in the recent byelection.Gowda defeated his closest Congress rival T B Jayachandra, a six-time MLA and former minister, by a margin of over 12,000 votes, officials said.JD(S) that had won the seat in the 2018 assembly elections has been relegated to third place.The bypoll, held on November 3, has been necessitated in Sira following the death of JD(S) MLA B Sathyanarayana in August.Apparently eyeing sympathy votes, the JD(S) had fielded Ammajamma B, wife of Sathyanarayana.BJP’s Rajesh Gowda is a radiologist and the son of former Congress MP C P Mudalagiriyappa and had recently joined the ruling party.His win is significant as this is the first ever success for the BJP in Sira, which falls in old Mysuru region, where the party had been weak traditionally.With its negligible presence in the constituency where Congress and JD(S) had been the traditional rivals, the BJP had not polled more than 24,000 votes in the past.After winning K R Pet and Chikkaballapura assembly seats in December 2019 bypolls, the BJP has been focussing on making further inroads in the old Mysuru region.Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa’s son and state BJP Vice President B Y Vijayendra, who played a key role in winning K R Pet in 2019, along with other leaders had camped in Sira to ensure the party’s victory.This win will add another feather to his cap, with him being seen as Yediyurappa’s political heir, sources said.BJP was a distant third in the 2018 assembly polls by securing only 16,959 votes in Sira.Sathyanarayana had then defeated Jayachandra of the Congress.Jayachandra was the candidate this time too and AICC general secretary in-charge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala had reportedly expressed his reservations to the state unit leaders about the choice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/bjp-wins-sira-assembly-seat-in-karnataka-for-first-time/story-nxtO8N9tuYKYJYrgwmeQJP.html
10-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: Only two Jain temples permitted to open during five-day Diwali festival||The Bombay high court has allowed only two Jain temples to open for devotees in Mumbai for five days during Diwali between Dhnateras and Bhau Beej with strict conditions. A division bench of justices S J Kathawalla and Abhay Ahuja issued the order while rejecting a plea seeking reopening of 102 Jain temples for Diwali, saying they should approach the court individually.The bench was hearing a petition filed by two Jain temple trusts. Advocate Prafulla Shah, who represented the petitioners, told the bench that the petition was seeking a limited relief in the form of permitting Jain temples in the city to open for five days during Diwali. Shah submitted that as the five-day period of Diwali is auspicious and important for Jains, they should be permitted to visit the temples.Also Read: Arnab Goswami moves Supreme Court challenging Bombay HC order denying him bailWhile referring to previous orders of the high court and Supreme Court wherein the Jain community was allowed to publicly observe their religious events and open three temples during the Covid-19 pandemic, Shah said that the community would abide by the lockdown and social distancing norms. In light of this undertaking Shah sought directions to the state to permit the opening of 102 Jain temples for five days.Shah also said that while the state had permitted the opening of bars, restaurants, and theatres, it was being discriminatory in not permitting temples to open.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni opposed the petition. He said that the claim of the petitioners that the five days of Diwali are very important only for the Jain community was baseless as the festival is important for all Hindus. He added hence the petitioners could not seek reliefs solely for their community. Kumbhakoni opposed the prayer for permitting 102 temples to open saying that the petition was not public interest litigation and hence the two petitioners could not seek relief on behalf of the entire community.“The state is cognizant of the situation and has said that it will consider the opening of temples after Diwali. Devotees from all religions...Hindus, Christians, and Muslims are eager to visit their religious places but are patient in the current situation and stand taken by the government. The Jain community should also be patient,” said Kumbhakoni.Kumbhakoni countered the argument of discrimination. He said it was surprising that the petitioners were comparing temples to bars and added that the commercial activity was permitted only on economic grounds.

10-11-2020||Kolkata||‘Will meet on the battlefield’: TMC’s Suvendu Adhikari challenges his party||West Bengal minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Suvendu Adhikari on Tuesday challenged his party saying they will meet “on the battlefield”. Adhikari said journalists and political observers were waiting for him to announce his political programme. “They want to hear me talk about the roadblocks I am facing and the path I am going to take. I will not announce my political programme from this sacred platform. This is not the place. I will speak from a political platform,” Adhikari said at a rally.Adhikari’s followers had organised the rally to pay tributes to TMC workers and villagers, who died during the two-year-long agitation against the erstwhile Left Front government’s attempt to acquire land for a chemical hub. Adhikari led the agitation which started after 14 villagers were killed in police firing at Nandigram on March 14, 2007. The Nandigram land movement helped chief minister Mamata Banerjee come to the power by defeating the Left Front.Also Read: Internal differences widen in TMC, BJP watches minister Suvendu AdhikariAdhikari announced from today all tributes to those killed during the agitation will be held under the banner of Bhumi Uchhed Protirodh Committee under which the Nandigram land movement was organised.Adhikari referred to TMC’s two hurriedly organised counter rallies at Nandigram and asked: “Where were you during these 13 years?” He added he was not new there. “A known Brahmin does not need the sacred thread to establish his identity,” he said, quoting a popular Bengali proverb. Benerjee also paid tribute to those killed in the agitation. In a tweet, she said, “Today is Nandigram Dibas - the 13th anniversary of the barbaric massacre in the name of new dawn. My homage to all those who have lost their lives due to political violence across the world. Peace must always win.”TMC leaders said Adhikari is unhappy with Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, and election strategist Prashant Kishor. “Suvendu wants the party to field candidates of his choice in 65 assembly seats spread across several districts. This is unacceptable to the leadership. We are aware that he was approached by the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]. There is nothing one can do if he is determined to leave. But we have information that he is not yet ready to join the saffron camp,” a TMC leader said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/will-meet-on-the-battlefield-tmc-s-suvendu-adhikari-challenges-his-party/story-v7Q7R5rhrRmIHVBaHj0cnI.html
10-11-2020||Chandigarh||Atal Tunnel the way to income generation through homestays: HP govt||The Himachal Pradesh government is now exploring possibilities of generating incomes through homestays, as suggested by Prime Minister Narendra Modi while inaugurating the Atal Tunnel which links Manali to the Lahaul-Spiti valley that is currently facing heavy tourist influx.Traditional architecture of the state will be promoted and all plans will be made with due consideration to the state’s fragile ecology even as the tourist rush is a cause for worry, it has been learnt. “We are roping in experts and the tourism department is drawing a comprehensive plan to promote tourism in the region keeping in view the fragile ecology,” says state chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who also holds the tourism portfolio. “Modiji has envisioned promotion of homestays instead of big luxury hotels beyond the north portal of the tunnel at Sissu,” he adds.Tourist rush a threat to ecologyMeanwhile, with an effective waste management system missing, dumping of garbage could get to be a real problem for the pristine Lahaul, Spiti, Chandra and Bagha valleys. The tourist rush will not help. Garbage has been dumped at various spots on the stretch between Manali and Keylong as no dustbins have been installed along the highway. Waste gets mixed with rainwater and trickles down the hill slopes into the rivers. “A large number of tourists have entered the valley after the tunnel opened,” says BK Kapoor, retired chief engineer from the Electricity Board, who is from Tholang village .“About 3,000 to 4,000 vehicles pass through the Atal tunnel daily,” says superintendent of police, Kullu, Gaurav Singh.Urgent infrastructure upgrade requiredTourism experts fear that the tourist rush and lack of infrastructure will hurt . There are no toilet facilities along highways, forcing travellers to defecate in the open. The roads are narrow, drinking water capacity is limited, hotel rooms are limited, wayside amenities are poor, training or skill development units are not available, trek routes are unidentified, temples and monasteries need to enhance capacity and health facilities are in bad shape. This is the time when the state government should ask the Centre for a special package, suggest experts, for infrastructure development in Lahaul valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/atal-tunnel-the-way-to-income-generation-through-homestays-hp-govt/story-GRGFgvBc2kFo2ROGmRDkjO.html

10-11-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court paves way for redevelopment of Mumbai’s Chandan Cinema property||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to approve a plan submitted by Sameer Joshi, the owner of Chandan Cinema, for its redevelopment as part of the Juhu Vile Parle Development (JVPD) scheme. Joshi assured the two-member HC division bench, comprising justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Anuja Prabhudessai, that he would not start any construction work without the court’s permission. Earlier, Joshi had moved the HC, challenging a notification issued in June 1976 under the Works of Defence Act, 1903, imposing restrictions on construction work in the vicinity of a military installation at Juhu. Chandan Cinema, which was built in 1973, was shut in March 2017 after BMC had issued a notice for its demolition because of its dilapidated condition. Also Read: Arnab Goswami moves Supreme Court challenging Bombay HC order denying him bailThe notice led Joshi to come up with a plan to redevelop the property, including a 50.70-metre (m) basement and a ground plus 11-storey building. He had also secured a no-objection certificate (NoC) from the Airports Authority of India (AAI). However, he was advised to obtain an NoC from the station commander of Juhu Military Station, as the property was located close to the defence installation. According to a June 1976 notification, construction is permitted only to the height of 15.24m within 457.20m, or 500 yards, from the boundary wall of the military installation. On July 18, 2019, BMC took into account Joshi’s plea and forwarded a proposal to the military commander for the latter’s consideration. The commander rejected the proposal a month later, citing it to be in violation of the June 1976 notification. In November 2019, Joshi applied to the BMC to sanction the plan for construction up to 15.24m, which was within the permissible limits. He moved the HC after he did not receive a response from the civic body. The HC accepted Joshi’s contention that the June 1976 notification exempted the construction made before its issuance regarding height restrictions. The court directed BMC to consider Joshi’s proposal for construction up to the existing height of the defunct Chandan Cinema.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-paves-way-for-redevelopment-of-mumbai-s-chandan-cinema-property/story-EGFHkrFsAktNq1ayvsiMsI.html
10-11-2020||Pune||Pune residents may get Bhama Askhed dam water by December-end||PUNE: After six years since the Bhama Askhed water project began, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will finally begin testing the water pipeline and treatment plant. With eastern parts of the city facing water scarcity mainly Vimannagar, Kharadi, Ahmednagar road, Lohegaon and Vadgaonsheri areas, PMC had planned to lift water from Bhama Askhed dam located near Chakan Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), Khed. The residents of these areas have to depend on water tankers even during the rainy season. Bhama Askhed dam is located 42 Km away from the city. PMC executive engineer Suresh Kadu said, “PMC has connected the pipeline at jackwell and it has started functioning. Water has reached through the pipeline till Kurli where a new water treatment plant has been erected. PMC will carry out testing, cleaning and water quality check for one month, before starting the supply to residents.” A PMC water department official on condition of anonymity said, “The project faced a lot of obstacles, including protests by farmers, but political leadership ensured that it sees the light of the day.” According to the official, earlier PMC decided to start the project on its own. The state government gave the go-ahead to lay water pipeline from Bhama Askhed dam. Meanwhile, the project was submitted to the central government. The Centre under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (Jnnurm) approved funds and gave a deadline to complete it by 2018. The civic administration faced opposition from farmers and local politicians making it difficult to lay pipelines. PMC and district administration completed the water project work under police protection. Many times the work was halted by farmers despite PMC having paid compensation to them. Pune to get water supply from five dams Pune is getting water from Khadakwasla, Panshet, Warasgaon and Temghar dams, mainly known as the Khadakwasla reservoir. Bhama Askhed dam will be the fifth once the water supply project is completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-residents-may-get-bhama-askhed-dam-water-by-dec-end/story-LD9ScYjdjibEiYfMi1CJhK.html

Though the base price for the bungalow was set at Rs 5.35 lakh, it was sold for Rs 11.20 lakh. The bid was won by Ajay Shrivastav, who also bagged the ownership rights of Ibrahim’s another 24.90-gunta land parcel at Mumbake village in Khed taluka, bearing the survey number 153 (a 24.90-gunta land parcel). It had a reserved price of Rs 1.89 lakh and sold for Rs 4.30 lakh, SAFEMA officials said.Also Read: Arnab Goswami moves Supreme Court challenging Bombay HC order denying him bailFour other land parcels in Mumbake village, bearing survey number 150 (20 guntas and a reserved price of Rs 1.52 lakh), survey number 151 (27 guntas and a reserved price of Rs 2.05 lakh), survey number 152 (29.30 guntas and a reserved price of Rs 2.23 lakh) and survey number 155 (18 guntas and a reserved price of Rs 1.38 lakh) were sold for Rs 7.18 lakh. Bids for these land parcels were won by Bhupendra Bharadwaj, a Delhi-based Supreme Court (SC) lawyer.Altogether, Ibrahim’s seven properties were to be auctioned, but Survey number 81 -- a 30-gunta land parcel, that housed a petrol pump and other buildings at Lote in Khed taluka and had a reserved price Rs 61.48 lakh -- was withdrawn at the last moment due to a technical error, said an official.Two flats of Ibrahim’s deceased aide Iqbal Mirchi – 501 and 502 in Milton Apartments on Juhu Tara Road in Santacruz (West), Mumbai – that were also up for sale remained unsold because of lack of buyers.Buyers found the bidding price too high like last time, when it was put up for sale on November 19, 2019, the official said. Competent authority Hari Govind Singh supervised the auction which was conducted by RN D’Souza, additional commissioner, Income Tax (I-T). The bidding was conducted through e-auction and sealed tenders and many bidders took part, despite the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. “The auction was a success,” the official added. Under SAFEMA, 1976, the Union finance ministry had planned to auction all 13 properties of Ibrahim in the first quarter of this year. But the Covid-19 outbreak, which was followed by 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions, put paid to the plans. Section 68F of SAFEMA, 1976, empowers the authority to attach properties of family members and relatives of a fugitive.In April 2019, SAFEMA officials had auctioned a flat, measuring 600 square (sq) feet (ft), at Gordon Hall Apartments in Nagpada, Mumbai. The apartment, which belonged to Ibrahim’s sister Haseena Parkar, who had died in 2014, was sold for Rs 1.80 crore. Ibrahim’s brother Iqbal Kaskar was staying in the Nagpada apartment. In 2018, SAFEMA authorities had auctioned Ibrahim’s property, Amina Mansion, on Pakmodia Street in Mumbai. The reserved price of the property was Rs 79.43 lakh, and the bid was won by the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT) for Rs 3.51 crore. In November 2017, SBUT had made the highest bid for the three sealed properties of the fugitive don. The Rounaq Afroz restaurant, also known as Delhi Zaika, was sold for Rs 4.53 crore. Six flats in Damarwala building were sold for Rs 3.53 crore, while Shabnam Guest House fetched a price of Rs 3.52 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/central-government-sells-dawood-ibrahim-s-six-properties-at-ratnagiri/story-fzwPbp3qC9ruDGnfEhlcLP.html

We will now forward all these issues and errors students faced to SPPU examination department,” said Vaibhav Edke, president, MSWA. From October 12, the SPPU started its final year exams for 3,300 subjects for which 2.5 lakh students enrolled. From the first day both online and offline students were facing a lot of issues while appearing for the exam. For the offline exams 113 centers were identified where the physical exams were conducted in Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts. These exams were of 50 marks with multiple choice questions (MCQ) for a duration of one hour. While for all those students who couldn’t attend the exams in the first regular schedule due to any reasons were allowed to reappear for the exam from November 5 to 7. But this time the exams were conducted only in the online mode where students complained of tech issues. “There won’t be any exams again for the students those who have missed the exam in the re-examination. Now the students who didn’t appear for the exams can give the exams in the next schedule of exams which will be held in January now. While we are now preparing for the backlog students exams which are scheduled in the month of December. Also, the results of the exams conducted are being declared by our department now,” said Mahesh Kakade, director of the board of examination and evaluation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/students-association-steps-in-after-tech-issues-plague-sppu-re-exam/story-HvK4IAhPwR6OFoyYjpGmmN.html

10-11-2020||Pune||Diwali “Pahat” moves online in light of pandemic||With the Government of Maharashtra allowing auditoriums to open for drama/ theatre, the annual feature of “Diwali pahats” - classical music, dance and other cultural events held at the break of dawn in the city – is also moving online. The Diwali pahat is a Punekar tradition usually held on lawns, open gardens, as well as auditoriums. This year, none of this will be possible held due to the pandemic. Sunil Mahajan of the organisation Samvad, one of the oldest organisers of pahats, has cancelled the event in view of the pandemic. “There are more than 500 such programme organisers, but this year most of us are doubtful of holding a pahat. There is the option of going online, but it does not have the same feel or essence of a live performance. People come dressed in their Diwali finery to celebrate this festival of light, and enjoy these programmes, but online kills the idea. Why would one get up early to log in at 5.30 am?” said Mahajan. Dr Satish Desai said, “We have put together a programme of our past recordings of the late Pandit Jasraj and other artistes. We will stream it from 6.30 am to 8.30 am on November 14, the main day of Diwali.” Madhavi Vaidya, an author, is going to try a different kind of entertainment. “This year, on the four days of Diwali, our foundation Ananway Kavya Mehfil will post videos of poetry from various well known poets, between 8 am and 8.30 am for people to enjoy online. Ravindra Khare, trustee of the Bharat Natya Mandir, is contemplating staging a drama. “We are thinking of a Diwali sakal instead of Diwali pahat by putting up a performance of a play with 50 per cent audience, but we haven’t yet planned the logistics yet,” said Khare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/diwali-pahat-moves-online-in-light-of-pandemic/story-Bwujv7TnCDPu6Gqqx4c2rM.html
10-11-2020||Pune||Schools to resume on November 23 for Class 9 to 12||After Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced on Sunday that schools and junior college can begin classes from standard 9th to 12th on November 23, the state education department has begun gearing up for school reopening. According to state education commissioner Vishal Solanki, a meeting was held with senior officials of the Maharashtra government on the issue. “Schools from standard 9th to 12th will start from November 23 but in areas where Covid patients are more or in the containment zones schools will not start. Classes will start in only those areas where there are no or less Covid cases. Currently, we are working on to make SOPs related to starting schools. Later, looking at the response of 9th to 12th classes, a decision will be taken about standard 1st to 8th classes. And written permission is needed from parents to send their child to school,” Solanki said. However, now parents’ groups are asking the CM to rethink his decision, as they cannot risk lives of their children when it is said that a second wave of Covid-19 pandemic can come during the winter season. On the other hand, teachers and school principal associations have demanded to give proper guidelines according to which schools and junior colleges will be started. Also, it has demanded that the state government should allocate extra funds to schools for purchase of safety equipment related to Covid protocol. “The hurry made by state government to start the schools is not necessary, if a student tests Covid positive after coming to school again he/she needs to go into 15 days isolation. And if any teacher tests positive then the entire class will be closed. On what basis and on whose trust or responsibility parents will send their children to school in such a crisis situation. If schools are started now, then parents will again be pressurised to pay school fees. So, our demand is that state government should rethink about this decision,” said Mukund Kirdat, co-ordinator, Pune Parents United. Meanwhile, school principal association and teachers’ association have demanded to release guidelines about starting schools and junior colleges. Also, to purchase safety related equipment like hand sanitizers, face masks, thermal scanners and Oxymetres state government should allocate funds for it.“We are ready to start classes physically for students from November 23 but for that there should be necessary guidelines given by the education department. Along with that funds are required to purchase several safety related equipment on large scale to disinfect school premises. So, state government should give funds to schools for purchase of these equipment,” said Mahendra Ganpule, state spokesperson of principals association. Sanjay Shendge, principal of Seth Dagaduram Katariya High School said, “We have started preparations for starting physical classes in our school from November 23. School cleaning and sanitising will be done regularly and our teachers are preparing for it. We will be calling half a number of students for three days continuously and the rest half on the next three days. So that social distancing is maintained and students will study in a link of continuous three days.” “This decision on the date of reopening will be taken after consultation with the Parent-teacher association. It is very likely that when we reopen school, we will work in two shifts, and to maintain social distance, we will only have 12-18 students in each classroom depending on the size of the class. Even if school reopens, online classes will still be available for students. However, the final call will be taken after consultation with the association.” said Dr Aanieetaa Vaissnava, principal of Orchids - The International School, Nigdi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/schools-to-resume-on-november-23-for-class-9-to-12/story-PLSEVlSEzcXuYjh0bIx1bL.html

As the video-conferencing facilities are available in the nearby bigger jails, it would be easier to produce the inmates of the closed jails before the courts concerned,” said Odisha’s director general of prisons, Santosh Upadhyay.According to official data, there were 17,563 undertrials and convicts in the 88 jails against the capacity of 19,291, which accounts for an occupancy rate of 91%. Till the end of 2019, there were 4,78,000 inmates in 1,350 jails across the country against a capacity of around 400,000. Delhi had the highest occupancy rate in prisons of 174.9% followed by Uttar Pradesh (167.9%) and Uttarakhand (159.0%) till December 31, 2019.Also Read: Odisha: Standing committee recommends 7-year jail for purchase of paddy below MSPUpadhyay said many of the jails being closed were built when the state was under the British rule. “While the jail at Pallahara has a capacity for 58 inmates, even half of it is not filled. Jails like one in Madanpur-Rampur of Kalahandi, and in Bargarh’s Sohela, the inmate population is also very low,” he said.A new prison for convicts has also come up at Athgarh. A second such jail is coming up in Sundargarh to house 1,000.Officials said the closure of jails would help in redistribution of the existing staff guarding the jails.

The court said that the allegations levelled against Sirsa and other members of the DSGMC are “serious in nature”.Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Dhirendra Rana said that the bills submitted to the court do not bear the signatures of anyone from the DSGMC.The judge also said that the role of the then president also requires investigation to check why he had claimed payment on such bills.Also Read: On Kartarpur anniversary, Pak says India yet to reopen its side of corridorIt is a matter of investigation as to who approved these bills and how, the court said, adding the bills “are looking fictitious prima facie”, while directing the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Economics Offences Wing (EOW), to look into the matter and give the court a copy of the FIR on the next date of hearing, i.e, November 21. The court’s order came after a Sikh devotee, who is also a stakeholder in the funds received by the DSGMC, lodged a complaint. The plea by one Bhupinder Singh had contended that Sirsa had caused loss of public funds to the tune of Rs 65,99,729 by showing sham transactions with various entities without any actual goods or services being provided.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday had demanded that Sirsa be suspended as the president of DSGMC.While addressing a press conference on Monday, AAP leader Jarnail Singh said, “It hurts to see the insult of the treasury of the Gurdwara because whenever a devotee puts money in the Gurdwara treasury, they expect that the money will be used for a noble cause such as langars or schools or hospitals under DSGMC. But the court order from November 7 is a living example of the misuse of the money that has been happening for the last few years.”When contacted, Sirsa said, “There are no allegations against me. The court has said that payments should be investigated to ascertain whether there are proper bills available or not. The bills were approved by the then president Manjit Singh GK and not by me.” Manjit Singh GK, former DSGMC president, denied his role and said that Sirsa was trying to mislead everyone. “The court has named Sirsa and asked for an FIR to be registered in his name. I have evidence that he had got the payments made under his signatures for erecting tents at the homes of top Akali leaders. As per the DSGMC Act 1971, that governs the working of Gurdwara committee, the general secretary is the administrative head as he is in charge of accounts, purchase and personal matters.”“Everyone wants to take political advantage of the situation, especially when the DSGMC is heading for the polls. The law will take its course. AAP MLA (Jarnail Singh) should not be too keen to comment as matter is in the jurisdiction of the court,” said SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-court-orders-fir-against-gurdwara-committee-head-says-allegations-serious-in-nature/story-tA31bSJq1dYgaraM8rDHNP.html

Seven independents and four candidates belonging to other parties, including former Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini, who heads the Loktantra Suraksha Party, are also in the fray from the constituency.Anant Ram, a retired professor of political science at Bhiwani Government College, said the bypoll is a challenge for Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda to save his bastion and the results will reflect on performance of the BJP-JJP government.“A win here will underscore Hooda’s hold in the Deshwali belt and restore the Congress tally in the assembly to 31. However, the bypoll is significant for the BJP-JJP government as the outcome will reflect the performance of the government and mood of the voters towards the alliance partner,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-congress-leading-after-first-round-of-counting-in-sonepat-s-baroda-bypoll/story-RgcWutNIzH1pweAdwLS6zO.html

There may be a marginal improvement in air quality on November 12 or 13,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.A combination of an extremely high number of stubble fires in Punjab, low to calm winds in the region and subsidence of air has led to Delhi recording “severe” air quality since November 5.Also Read: Emergency in the air: NGT extends cracker ban, curbs“There is anti-cyclonic wind circulation in the lower levels and subsidence of air in large parts of northwest India presently. Both are linked to slow winds and accumulation of pollutants. We have been seeing a very large number of crop stubble fires. The combination of these factors is leading to the air quality index (AQI) reading hovering between ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ categories for the past five days,” explained RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.There were over 5,000 stubble fires recorded in Punjab on Monday, according to the ministry of earth sciences.

For instance, both Pune and Mumbai, which were the major contributors in the cumulative Covid-19 cases, the total number of active patients have come down to around 17,000 in each of the cities,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.As per the state health department data, districts such as Kolhapur (323), Dhule (317), Washim (107) and Nandurbar (429) have the lowest number of active Covid-19 cases.Meanwhile, the number of patients who are in institutional quarantine has also decreased by 35% from 12,230 on November 1 to 7,912 on November 8.“Despite the relaxation in the lockdown norms, we have been able to keep the infection rate under control. But the next 15 days will be crucial for us as the infection rate might surge. So, citizens need to be more careful and follow all the safety measures,” said Dr Archana Patil, director of state health service.However, health activists are sceptical about the numbers. They claim that as the state government is gradually relaxing the lockdown, it is trying to show less number of active Covid-19 cases. “The home quarantine patients aren’t tested before being declared ‘recovered’. In the race to open up trains and offices, the health department can miss out on patients who haven’t recovered. So, they need to be more careful,” said health activist Dr Abhijit More.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/59-dip-in-covid-19-patients-in-home-quarantine-in-8-days-maharashtra-government-data/story-AcDEQuK0gpSLasK3zueNjL.html

GMADA has not paid the tax ever since it was introduced in 2014-15. The development authority has to pay for its godown in Phase 11, Dussehra Ground, old bus stand and Tibetan market space in Phase 8, old deputy commissioner office, hockey stadium in Phase 9, all sports complexes, places of liquor vends, and various booths in different phases and sectors. Municipal chief Garg said, “We have written a letter to the head of GMADA and asked them to pay the property tax. Hopefully, the matter will soon be sorted out.”A senior GMADA official said that they have sought from the municipal corporation details of the properties, along with the amount. “We will soon clear the dues,” he added. Major defaultersThe district administrative complex in Sector 76 is currently defaulting on property tax to the tune of ₹15 lakh pending for the past two years. Mohali police also owe ₹1 crore to the civic body since 2014-15. Their properties include several police stations, cybercrime office, women cell and other buildings. Even the excise and taxation department hasn’t paid its ₹5-lakh property tax.As per the record, Mohali has 52,678 properties — 41,082 residential, 4,929 commercial, 1,683 industrial and 4,984 vacant plots — of which 24,406 are taxable.Three industrial units sealedThe MC on Monday sealed three industrial units in Mohali’s Phase-7 industrial area after their owners failed to pay pending house/property tax. Officials said they owed ₹8 lakh as tax to the MC. The sealed units are plot number D-92, D-99 and C-148. These units were non-functional. MC inspector Avtar Singh Kalsia said, “The drive was launched following the directions of the municipal commissioner. We sealed the sites as their owners failed to deposit the tax despite notices and reminders.” The civic body had issued notices to tax defaulters under sections 137 and 138 of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act and given them a 10-day window to clear the dues. The civic body is now in the process of identifying property tax defaulters to whom notices will be sent and strict action will follow in case of default.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gmada-owes-mohali-civic-body-5-crore-property-tax/story-dUtZhParNZ7AOSJmsgt3HL.html
10-11-2020||City||3,277 new cases take Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally to 1,723,135||Maharashtra reported 3,277 Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the state’s tally to 1,723,135. Owing to technical glitches on the Centre’s Covid-19 portal, data related to fatalities and fresh recoveries could not be added on Monday, said state health department officials. “Daily discharged cases and deaths of the state are updated as per the central government’s covid portal (https://covid19.nhp.gov.in) but due to technical reasons, the Covid portal was not functioning. Therefore, the daily figures of discharged cases and deaths are not available,” the state health department’s bulletin stated. “As today the Covid-19 portal is not functional and patients are admitted in more than 1,500 hospitals in the state, it is difficult to compile information of discharged and death cases manually,” it added. The state, however, added 85 fatalities, including 20 deaths from Mumbai in the previous 24 hours and 65 from the reconciliation data, taking the toll to 45,325. Meanwhile, Mumbai reported 599 fresh cases on Monday, pushing its tally to 265,144. The city’s fatalities surged to 10,465 after 20 deaths were recorded on Monday. Meanwhile, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) collectively recorded 495 fresh cases. Pune district witnessed a decline in daily cases and reported 165 infections on Monday, while Pune rural and Pimpri-Chinchwad reported 177 and 68 fresh cases, respectively. Nagpur city reported 233 new cases on Monday, even as Satara district, Solapur rural and other cities and districts reported cases in double digits on Monday. Until Monday, Maharashtra had tested 9,482,940 samples and the state’s positivity rate stands at 18.17%. In the past 24 hours, the state tested 42,405 samples, of which 3,277 (7.72%) were found positive for the virus. The infection rate in the state has seen decline over the past few weeks. In the first eight days of November, the positivity rate in the state has consistently remained under 10%. So far, the state’s positivity rate for November has averaged at 8.35%, which means for every 100 samples tested, eight were found to be positive. The ratio was around 15% in October and 24% in September. In November, the state has on an average tested 59,141 samples of which 4,889 were found positive, according to the state health department data. However, there are concerns that the declining Covid-19 curve could see a reversal after Diwali (November 14). Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in his address to the state on Sunday said that the fortnight after Diwali will be crucial and the “real test”. He also warned citizens not to lower their guard, as the second wave could prove to be a ‘tsunami’. The CM has appealed to citizens to follow the basic Covid-19 protocol – social distancing, wearing masks and washing hands – to keep the spread of the virus at bay. Thackeray said that lax behaviour during the festive season and the onset of winter could reverse the declining Covid-19 curve. Health department officials said that they have directed the district administration to increase surveillance. Officials said that the ratio of tracing immediate contacts of positive patients is not as per expectations. “People will have to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour while moving out. Wearing masks, maintaining sanitisation and physical distancing are the only solution. Besides that, the department has asked for stricter surveillance and tracing-tracking. There is a sense of fatigue among healthcare workers involved in the Covid-19 fight. We have to trace 15 people at least on finding one positive case,” said an official from the health department. Public health expert Dr Sanjay Pattiwar echoed that tracing and surveillance will remain crucial to keep the potential second wave of Covid-19 at bay. “People are roaming around as if the pandemic is gone, but the threat still exists. If there is fatigue among healthcare workers, then there should be a reserve force like in armies. The state should rope in teaching staffs and clerks for surveillance, which is non-technical. Besides that the state must also ramp up testing,” Pattiwar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-277-new-cases-take-maharashtra-s-covid-19-tally-to-1-723-135/story-4sfD91Qg3mBD3kYME7u1rN.html
10-11-2020||City||Mumbai civic body allows firecrackers only on Diwali day: Traders upset, activists welcome it||After the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Monday prohibited citizens from bursting firecrackers at public and private places, the Mumbai and Thane districts’ Fireworks Dealers’ Welfare Association has said that the decision would lead to excess inventory and close to 60% interest loss. The ban has been exempted for the main day of Diwali which falls on November 14 (Saturday), when Mumbaiites can burst two variants (sparklers and flower pots) of firecrackers.“Every day we are getting fresh guidelines. This is not how a business can function. It is wrong to take such decisions so close to the festival date,” said Minesh Mehta, secretary of the association, adding, “Considering the Maharashtra government has already urged citizens to celebrate a safe Diwali and reduce the use of firecrackers, there was no need for BMC to implement a separate decision to ban them.”Raju Ghone, a dealer from Kurla, said that the customers who had already purchased firecrackers’ from his shops at south and central Mumbai prior to the BMC’s decision are now coming back to return the fireworks. “There is absolute chaos and confusion in Mumbai after the decision. We are already running on 80% losses this year, and on top of that, buyers who purchased the crackers are returning them and demanding their money back. We are not sure how we’ll manage,” said Ghone.Mehta added that many dealers pay manufacturers for the fireworks at the end of the festive season. “They won’t be able to that now. We’re anticipating that our warehouses won’t be able to hold excess inventory till next year, even as a 60% interest loss cannot be made up for following this ban. We’re also facing added pressure from the manufacturers at Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu, as many states have banned crackers this year,” he said.A spokesperson from Essabhai Fireworks Pvt Ltd, the largest firecracker dealer in south Mumbai, said, “60% of our stock only has majorly light emitting (low sound and smoke) crackers. Flower pots and sparklers account for less than 10% of our inventory. So far, we had only three days of good sales and this week we were expecting to see the most sales. But now, we are worried after BMC’s decision.”Meanwhile, citizens are divided over the decision.Girgaum resident Abhinav Bandekar said, “For once, we hope this Diwali would be a quiet one, especially after all the issues Mumbai has already faced this year.”However, Lokhandwala resident K Bharadwaj believes that the BMC must have made the decision earlier. “I had already purchased firecrackers worth ₹10,000 for my children. There should have been prior intimation by BMC on such a decision. This is harassment,” he said.Independent experts said restrictive measures – either a complete ban on crackers or limiting timing for bursting them on Diwali night – were needed to reduce episodic pollution and the chemical loading of the environment. “Mumbai has been in the grip of a serious Covid-19 crisis. Therefore, there is a need to take action to deepen public understanding of the risk. But regulatory action on cultural practices is difficult to enforce as we have seen in the past. Regulations can be effective only through strong public awareness and support. Outreach programmes and medical evidences and advisories are critically important to build support for such measures,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi.Environmentalists said the use of crackers should not be permitted under any circumstances. “One violator can cause health complications to thousands of residents. The responsibility to strictly implement the time of use (of firecrackers) falls squarely on the government,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation, an organisation that carries out firecracker noise testing.Chowdhury said the combined crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic and winter pollution presents a special challenge, and this required emergency response. “Our healthcare systems are already stressed and cannot take additional pressure. Even short-term bursting of crackers can increase toxic exposure for the ailing and the vulnerable,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-civic-body-allows-firecrackers-only-on-diwali-day-traders-upset-activists-welcome-it/story-CjYzXaG5mCXADnKpqK2mKP.html
10-11-2020||Mumbai||National Green Tribunal restricts use of firecrackers for all festivals this year||While directing a ban on firecrackers for the National Capital Region (NCR), the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed cities and towns in India with ‘moderate’ air quality (or below) to only allow the sale of green crackers and restricted timings to burst them during festivals. The NGT published its November 5 order on Monday that specified that average air quality for each city was to be calculated for November 2019 and then declared whether it was ‘poor’ or ‘moderate’ or otherwise. For NCR and those cities with ‘poor’ (or worse) air quality, the NGT directed a total ban against the sale and use of firecrackers from November 9-10, 2020 to the midnight of November 30-December 1, which would be reviewed thereafter. Mumbai had recorded ‘moderate’ air quality during November 2019, according to SC Kollur, chief scientist, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). “As per the NGT guideline, sale of green crackers can be allowed in Mumbai. We have already calculated individual city data based on air quality classification for other cities in Maharashtra, and prepared a draft to be circulated to state and urban local bodies for them to issue enforcement guidelines. The draft will be finalised soon,” said Kollur. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) categorises AQI levels in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor. Green crackers have 30% lower emissions of toxic gases than traditional ones and they do not contain barium nitrate, a metal oxide that increases both air and noise pollution. “There is enough material indicating nexus between pollution and Covid and that increased pollution will increase Covid impact by reducing immunity rendering citizens susceptible to more diseases which may affect lungs, heart and cause cancer,” the bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said. To address the aggravated effect of air pollution during Covid-19, NGT said for cities and towns with ‘moderate’ air quality apart from green crackers, the timings for use and cracker bursting be restricted to two hours during festivals, as may be specified by the state concerned. “If nothing is specified by the state, timing will be 8pm to 10pm on Diwali and Gurupurab, 6am to 8am on Chatt and 11.55 pm to 12.30 am during Christmas and New Year’s Eve. All states may initiate special drives to contain air pollution from all sources in view of potential of aggravation of Covid-19,” read the order. The chief secretaries and director general of police were directed to issue orders with enforcement guidelines, while pollution control boards were asked to monitor air quality status during this period. “The NGT order will be shared with all state departments,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB. NGT was hearing numerous applications from Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and the tribunal on its own motion, and took cognisance of several states that had already banned the use of firecrackers this Diwali. “Even green crackers only partly reduce pollution. With Covid-19, even reduced pollution becomes hazardous. What may be permitted in normal times, can also not be permitted during Covid-19. That is the reason for the ban by the states which was never considered without Covid,” the bench said. Scientists said state-specific guidelines were needed towards implementation of entrusted work. “It is good that the NGT is monitoring both issues (air pollution and Covid-19) for protection of human health across India. Citizens must understand the gravity of this order, and need to participate in the programme for protection of their neighbour’s health. Our utmost duty should be to maintain the better air quality during bad air days, and for that citizens need to function as a unit,” said Dipankar Saha, former additional director, CPCB. “As far as the NGT order is concerned, although Mumbai’s air is not as polluted as in some other parts of India at present, air quality has consistently been shown to deteriorate immediately after Diwali. Thus there was a need to ban crackers overall for major cities like Mumbai too,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation. What does this NGT order mean for Mumbai?The National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed cities and towns in India, such as Mumbai that had ‘moderate’ air quality (or below) in 2019, to only allow the sale of green crackers and restricted timings for the use of such crackers during major festivals like Diwali, Gurpurab, Chatt, Christmas and New Year’s eve. While the Maharashtra government through urban local bodies among other states were asked to draft their own time frame for cracker bursting and guidelines, in case if nothing was specified by the state, the timing to burst crackers will be 8 to 10pm on Diwali and Gurupurab, 6am to 8am on Chatt and 11.55pm to 12.30am during Christmas and New year eve. For Diwali however, BMC has already banned bursting of firecrackers in public and private places in Mumbai except on Saturday, November 14 (Diwali Day), when only two variants of firecrackers (sparklers and flower pots) can be used.What are Green crackers?Green crackers have 30% lower emissions of toxic gases than traditional ones and they do not contain barium nitrate, a metal oxide that increases both air and noise pollution. On October 5, 2019, the Centre announced the use of these eco-friendly crackers across India, developed by the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), based on a 2018 Supreme Court (SC) order, banning the manufacture of polluting firecrackers. NEERI developed different variants of two types of crackers – flower pots and sparklers – with new formulations for their chemical components. These crackers were made with reduction in size of shell, elimination of ash usage, and reduced usage of raw materials in their composition, of uniform acceptable quality, use of additives as dust suppressants with specific reference to particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/national-green-tribunal-restricts-use-of-firecrackers-for-all-festivals-this-year/story-ZwwZA5YnJyvDavXYqyF2eL.html
10-11-2020||Chandigarh||UT creates database of 10,000 health workers on Covid vaccine priority list||The Chandigarh health department has prepared a database of about 10,000 medical professionals working in around 45 facilities in the city, who will be given the Covid-19 vaccine on priority, senior officials said on Monday. The exercise has been conducted in response to the health ministry’s communication to the states and UTs to prepare a database of healthcare workers working in public as well as private sector, who can be given Covid-19 vaccine precedence. The health ministry in the communication in mid-October had told UTs and states that since numerous efforts were underway to develop multiple Covid-19 vaccines, the ministry had started the preparatory activities so that it can be expeditiously rolled out once available.Officials said that among those on priority are frontline workers, including auxiliary nurse midwives, multi-purpose workers, accredited social health activists and their supervisors, nurses, medical officers, and both allopathic (MBBS and/or postgraduates, teaching and non-teaching and doctors on administrative posts) and Ayush doctors at Ayush dispensaries as well as other public health centres and hospitals. Officials said that the list of workers with UT health department in Government Multi Speciality Hospital at Sector 16 and associated hospitals in sectors 45, 22 and Manimajra, and Government Medical College and Hospital at Sector 32 has been communicated to the ministry. The private doctors associated with the city’s Indian Medical Association have also been enlisted on priority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-creates-database-of-10-000-health-workers-on-covid-vaccine-priority-list/story-pwiKD9sRuTM9NT5B1VreyL.html

10-11-2020||Chandigarh||Operation in J&K’s Machil still on, says BSF||A day after four security force personnel and three militants were killed in a face off in Machil sector of Kupwara in north Kashmir, a top official of the Border Security Force (BSF) said security forces were still combing through the sector to rule out the presence of other infiltrators in the area. BSF constable Sudip Sarkar of the 169 Battalion, Captain Ashutosh Kumar, Havaldar Praveen Kumar and rifle man Ryada Maheshwar of the 18 Madras Regiment were killed in action while foiling an infiltration bid in the Valley. BSF additional director general of Surinder Pawar, who was speaking at the sidelines of a wreath laying ceremony for constable Sarkar at Humhama, said a sanitisation operation was on in the sector as the security forces were concerned about the presence of other infiltrators in the tough terrain. The BSF had observed the movement of a group of militants attempting to enter the country through the Line of Control in Machil Sector around 1am on November 8.“We received inputs about 15 days ago that militants will try to infiltrate. So our ambush-cum-patrolling party patrolled the area during the night. Around 1 am (on Sunday), the patrolling party observed some suspicious movement and challenged the militants. The militants retaliated and Constable Sarkar was badly injured. But he fought bravely and killed a militant, before succumbing to the injuries,” Pawar said. “The men had seen three shadows and since it was dark and the ground was riddled with ditches, the other two managed to escape. The Army and other BSF posts were alerted and firing continued till 4.30 am.”“With the first light on Sunday, the Army and the BSF launched a joint operation, in which the two militants were killed. In the exchange of fire, Army Captain Ashutosh Kumar and two soldiers were also killed,” he said.Pawar said fewer militants had been able to infiltrate the country this year as compared to previous years:“As per intelligence reports, 250-300 militants are waiting on launch pads. This year around 25 militants were able to infiltrate the country as compared to 135 to 140 last year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/operation-in-j-k-s-machil-still-on-says-bsf/story-LRcOSnTGIZb60tRky56aaM.html
10-11-2020||Delhi||Weekend record in Delhi: 5,000 plus new cases||The Capital reported 5,023 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday, fewer than 6,500 cases for the first time in six days. However, this drop comes after fewer people were tested for the infection on Sunday, when only 39,115 tests were conducted, as compared to an average 56,298 tests conducted each day during the week. To add to concerns, despite the drop in testing, the test positivity rate remained above 12%.Monday’s tally was the highest number of cases reported after a weekend, which usually see a drop in testing, and cases. Delhi also reported 71 deaths due to the infection in Monday’s health bulletin, tipping the total toll of the pandemic in the city over 7,000. So far, 7,060 people have died of the infection in the city since the first case in the city was reported on March 2 and the first death on March 13. The case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive for the infection – has been on the decline despite the recent increase in the number of deaths. Over 65 persons died of the infection each day on an average this week as compared to 42 people the week before, and 39 people the week before. The average CFR has gone down from 1.81% to 1.59% during the three-week period. “We are reporting more cases and hence there has been an increase in the number of deaths. However, if you look at the death rate it has come down to 1.59%, which is similar to the national average. Earlier it used to be 1% higher than national average. In fact, the ten-day death rate is 0.95% and even the WHO says that less than 1% deaths is good,” said Jain. What is concerning is that despite the drop in the absolute number of cases, the positivity rate -- the number of samples that return positive among the total tested — remained high. Positivity rate is and depicts the rate of transmission of the infection in a region. Delhi’s average positivity rate remained at 12.6% this week, up from 10.3% the week before, and 7.18% the week before that – showing the increase in transmission. “This means that more and more people are getting infected and that the transmission of the infection is on in Delhi. Chances are more infections would be reported in the coming days with a huge chunk of population still susceptible to the novel disease. The positivity rate too is likely to keep on increasing if the government focuses on targeted testing of contacts and those most at risk of getting the infection,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at Indian Council of Medical Research. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said that at least 20 to 30% of the total tests conducted were done in a targeted manner at market places, crowded areas, ISBTs, and railway stations. “To reduce the numbers, the interaction of the people needs to be reduced. The government does not want to impose another lockdown for economic reasons, but there needs to be certain curbs like the number of people allowed at wedding and funerals could be cut down, the timings for bars and restaurants can be reduced,” said Dr Kant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/weekend-record-in-delhi-5-000-plus-new-cases/story-EMSKRk2PKrrQLY32Mz27fI.html
10-11-2020||Chandigarh||Former senators, syndicate members protest at Panjab University||Former senators and the members of Panjab University syndicate on Monday held a protest on the campus, demanding that senate elections be held immediately.Dozens of members marched inside the varsity campus, raising slogans against vice-chancellor Raj Kumar and later sat on a dharna outside his office, where they were joined by various student leaders.This comes after the senate polls of PU were postponed by the V-C for the second time on October 15. The polls were scheduled to be held on August 24.Syndicate member Harpreet Singh Dua said, “The indefinite postponement of senate polls is unjustified and a betrayal with the state of Punjab.”The term of the PU senate has ended on October 31 and the varsity is without its supreme governing body. However, the term of syndicate which is PU’s top executive body will end on December 31.Former senator Ronki Ram said, “There is no governing body in place right now. We held a peaceful protest as to why the elections are not being held.”While addressing the protesting members, V-C Raj Kumar said that senate polls are different and should not be compared with other elections. “The employees have also written to us that they are not willing to perform the election duty,” he added. Demand for syndicate meetingAfter the protest, former senators and syndicate members met V-C Raj Kumar and demanded an immediate syndicate meeting. The last syndicate meeting of PU was held in July. They also asked the V-C to write to the UT administration, seeking permission for conducting polls at the university.“Various issues are pending and the governance is at standstill. The V-C assured us that he will call a syndicate meeting immediately,” said syndicate member Navdeep Goyal.Meanwhile, the Joint Student Action Committee (JSAC), which is the amalgam of various student organisations of PU, also held a protest at the UT secretariat. The students also met UT adviser Manoj Parida.“The UT administration has nothing to do with holding or not holding the senate elections by PU. It is their policy decision and they have to take it. But the Covid-19 grounds on which we had asked them to stop no more exists, so they can take a call on any way they feel like,” Parida said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/former-senators-syndicate-members-protest-at-panjab-university/story-XviCIzII5lzMw9WVpt8URN.html
10-11-2020||City||New commission meets for first time, advises minimal use of personal vehicles||New Delhi: The newly formed Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas urged people to minimise use of personal vehicles as much as possible immediately, even as pollution levels in the region continued to touch toxic levels.Responding to the air quality crisis in Delhi-NCR, the commission headed by former Delhi chief secretary MM Kutty held its first meeting on Monday, where it urged people to take 10 immediate measures, including minimising personal travel, restricting travel unless absolutely essential, and encouraging working-from-home. The panel also urged that rules regarding dust control measures be enforced strictly, apart from ensuring municipal solid waste and biomass are not burnt.These apart, the commission, the six members of which were constituted last week, advised that water sprinkling be intensified, particularly in dust prone areas, anti-smog guns be used at pollution hotspots especially at construction sites, court orders on stubble burning and use of fire crackers be adhered to. It also sought co-operation from civil society and citizens to report air pollution incidents on the Sameer App and encouraged industries in NCR to minimise the use of coal in the coming months.The commission, formed last month, will be a statutory authority that replaces the 22-year-old Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (Epca). The four full-time and 2 NGO members, selected by a panel of Union cabinet ministers last week, reviewed the air quality scenario in the region, actions taken by various agencies so far and further steps to be taken for improving the air quality. The Commission noted that future action will necessitate consultation with various stakeholders, stressing the need to strictly enforce existing laws, rules, guidelines, directions and standard operating procedures to minimize air pollution on an emergency basis.It is, however, unclear if measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) will be implemented. Under the plan, if similar air quality persists in Delhi for another day, the Centre will have to impose a number of stringent measures such as stopping all construction activities, introducing the Odd-Even road space-rationing scheme, and stopping the entry of trucks into the city completely. These “severe+” or emergency measures are implemented when ambient PM2.5 or PM10 concentration values of 300 micrograms per cubic metres or 500 micrograms per cubic metres respectively persist for 48 hours or more.According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) Grap monitor, Delhi has been heading towards “severe +” since 8pm on Sunday in terms of both PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations. “I am not sure about the Grap measures. The task force of CPCB and IMD [India Meteorological Department] members used to meet and brief Epca on the measures to be taken. Now that’s not happening so I am not sure if severe + interventions will be implemented. The Commission may take it up,” said a senior CPCB official who asked not to be named. RP Gupta, secretary, Union environment ministry had earlier said told the media Grap will be implemented as Epca did earlier.Commission members didn’t respond to HT’s calls requesting clarification on the implementation of the action plan on Monday.“Even as questions around the jurisdiction and composition of the Commission remain, it will be important that some of these are addressed in its working, including the methodology of public engagement that is adopted. The commission and its three sub-committees can push for more public spirited and inclusive mechanisms on how various matters related to air pollution are addressed. Air pollution is an evocative public issue, and it would be important not to only address it through closed door meetings and negotiations,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.The Centre issued an ordinance on October 29 to set up the new centralised agency with sweeping powers to monitor and act against sources of air pollution across five north Indian states. The ordinance was issued days after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Supreme Court that the Centre will “do everything on a war footing to curb air pollution”. The Centre had earlier sought time from the top court to create a permanent mechanism to tackle the problem.The Commission replaces all ad-hoc committees and bodies created as per court orders, including Epca, which was formed in 1998 to oversee measures to check air pollution in NCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-commission-meets-for-first-time-advises-minimal-use-of-personal-vehicles/story-9olWc2podpDpOYe10bc2zJ.html
10-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Body of motorcycle showroom owner missing for three weeks found||Noida: The body of a motorcycle showroom’s owner who had been missing since October 17 was found in a decomposed state in Sector 88 on Monday, the police said. The deceased was identified as Ankit Kumar, who had gone missing after he had left home in Yakubpur village to go to his showroom in Greater Noida. Ankit’s family had filed a missing person’s complaint at Phase 2 police station on October 19, the police said, adding that his body was found near Pushta road in Sector 88.“The body was in a very bad state. It was completely decomposed and the autopsy report came back inconclusive. Forensic experts are working on it and we are trying to identify if there is any foul play in the case,” said Anita Chauhan, station house officer, Phase 2 police station.Chauhan said that it seemed as if he had been there for the past few days and the family was only able to recognise him through the clothes. So, a DNA sample has also been taken to confirm the identity, she said.The man’s motorcycle had also been recovered from that area a few days back.Police officials said the family has mentioned that he was upset over the past few days because of a failed relationship with a woman of a different caste whose family refused marriage.“We are looking at all angles. Maybe he was harmed or was a victim of an accident. It could also be a case of suicide. But it is unclear at the moment and a probe in the matter is underway,” said the SHO.She said that a case will be registered as soon as the family files a complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-body-of-motorcycle-showroom-owner-missing-for-three-weeks-found/story-bXfvYDxslUxndNOrbfdOiM.html
10-11-2020||Delhi||As Delhi’s air turns severe, uptick in patients with breathing ailments||Doctors in the city said they have seen a significant increase in the number of patients complaining of respiratory illnesses over the past five days, when pollution has been in the “severe” zone, highlighting the dangerous impact of Delhi’s toxic air.They also cautioned that while even healthy individuals were more to illness due to the existing pollution levels, senior citizens were particularly susceptible to serious medical complications. “We have seen an increase of 15 to 20% in the number of people coming in with respiratory tract infections and aggravation of existing asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the last four to five days. People are also coming in with complaints of itchy eyes, throat irritation, and headaches,” said Dr Nevin Kishore, head of bronchology and respiratory medicine, Max healthcare.Doctors also warn that exposure to such high levels of pollution can lead to infections and allergic ailments even in healthy individuals, adding that they see such an increase in influx of patients reporting such illnesses every year in the Capital around this time.“Pollution is known to down-regulate immunity even in healthy individuals, leading to more upper respiratory tract infections and viral infections during this time. And, this year, pollution will increase the risk of Covid-19. There is enough evidence to show that the incidence of heart attacks and strokes goes up when pollution levels are high,” said Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant of internal medicine at Moolchand hospital.“Chronic exposure to air with AQI over 100 — which has been the case in Delhi every day except one, since September 9 this year — can lead to healthy people developing lung diseases including lung cancer, endocrine diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases. In children below the age of five, it also leads to lung development being deranged, which can lead to higher probability of lung diseases in the future,” he said.Elderly people are more likely to die of respiratory ailments and cardiovascular diseases when pollution levels go up, health experts said.“In the long run, pollution is more dangerous than smoking and is known to lead to lung cancer. It also increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. We see an increase in the number of these cases in the emergency department,” said Dr Prasun Chaterjee, associate professor of geriatric medicine at the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). A study from AIIMS last year showed that at peak levels of pollution -- between October and January -- the emergency sees a 40% increase in patients with respiratory problems. Dr Rajeev Chawla, senior pulmonologist and critical care specialist at the Indraprastha Apollo hospitals, said, “The lung function of any person deteriorates with age. This means the elderly already have a compromised lung function, which when combined with the high levels of pollution means they are more likely to get severe complications.”A 2017 study from the Unites States shows that in people over the age of 65, the all-cause mortality went up by 13.6% for every 10μg increase in the level of PM2.5 in areas where pollution levels were below national air quality standards.What concerns Dr Chaterjee more, however, is the recently established link between increase in the pollution levels and dementia among the old.“Apart from the usual suspects, exposure to high levels of pollution over time increases the risk of people developing dementia later in life. Currently, 0.9 to 1% of the 130 million old people in India are demented, which is likely to increase drastically. Other risk factors for dementia are aging; social isolation, which is very high right now because of Covid-19; lack of physical activity, also happening because of Covid-19 and now the high levels of air pollution,” he said.“Those at high risk — especially patients who have existing asthma, COPD, or fibrosis — should try to limit exposure to air pollution as much as possible. They should remain indoors when the pollution levels are high. And, if they have to step out, they should cover their faces and carry their inhalers with them,” said Dr Kishore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-delhi-s-air-turns-severe-uptick-in-patients-with-breathing-ailments/story-kmxTzkPZKGlRuKxnNfTn5O.html
10-11-2020||Noida||Out on shopping, woman and her friend assaulted, harassed by parking staff in Noida Sector 18; two arrested||Noida: A Delhi-based fashion designer has alleged that she and her male friend were assaulted and harassed by staff of the multi-level parking in Sector 18 on Sunday afternoon. The Noida police have arrested two suspects in the case.According to the woman, she was shopping at a jewellery shop in the market with her friend. “When we came out, we realised that the car we had parked nearby had been towed. So we went to basement of the parking lot to retrieve it. We paid the fine, and when we collected the car, I saw that there was a dent on it which wasn’t there earlier,” said the woman.She alleged that when she confronted one of the attendants at the parking, he started shouting at her.“ A couple of his friends also came there and they all started abusing me and making obscene comments. My friend then got out of the car and asked me to get back in while he handled them. However, the attendant’s some more friends came there and they all started hitting my friend,” said the woman.She said in her complaint that two women also came there and they started breaking through her car windows after which they dragged her out and harassed her, slapping her multiple times.“One of the men brought an iron rod and damaged my car’s bonnet. They started filming us all the while making obscene comments and even threatened our lives. Our clothes were torn and while they were focused on me, my friend ran out and called the police helpline. Meanwhile, one of the suspects took the jewellery and Rs 17,500 cash I had in my car. By then there were at least 12-15 people there. However, by the time police reached there, most of the suspects had fled the spot,” the woman said.The woman later filed a complaint with Sector 20 police station, following which a case was registered against the unidentified suspects under IPC sections of harassment, assault, theft and intimidation. According to the police, the victim has also provided the description of at least five of the suspects, including the two women.The police on Sunday evening arrested two of the suspects, who were identified as Shivam Sharma and Shivam Bajpayee. They were sent to jail on Monday.“We are on the lookout for the rest of the suspects. They are members of the staff at the parking, and we have details about a few of them. The CCTV cameras in the area are dysfunctional, but we are gathering more evidence,” said Rakesh Kumar Singh, station house officer, Sector 20 police station.Singh said that both the victims have sustained injuries while the woman’s Baleno car was heavily damaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/out-on-shopping-woman-and-her-friend-assaulted-harassed-by-parking-staff-in-noida-sector-18-two-arrested/story-nNLJcx1ic6QD386Uke63IP.html
10-11-2020||Noida||Husband, in-laws booked after woman, 4-yr-old son fell to death from 17th floor||Greater Noida: The Bisrakh police on Monday booked five persons murder and dowry death in connection with the death of a 28-year-old woman and her four-year-old son who fell to their death from their 17th floor apartment in Greater Noida west on Saturday. The complaint in the matter has been filed by the woman’s father, who is a resident of Vijay Nagar in Ghaziabad. According to the complainant, his daughter had a man in Sambhal in Uttar Pradesh on April 22, 2015. The woman had shifted to Greater Noida west with her husband and in-laws after the wedding. The four-year-old was the couple’s only child.The complainant alleged that after the wedding, the victim’s husband and in-laws had started demanding ₹10 lakh and a four-wheeler as dowry. “They used to torture my daughter. They also took her to a quack a few months ago and forced her to go for an abortion when they came to know about her pregnancy,” he alleged in the FIR. The woman’s younger brother alleged that her in-laws also beat her up two weeks ago and inflicted severe injuries on her right leg.On Saturday, the complainant alleged that he was told by his son-in-law that the woman and the child had fallen from the bed and were injured. “We reached the Greater Noida west society where they lived and found all family members absconding. We were told that my daughter had jumped with her son from the 17th floor and died. We suspect they were pushed to death,” the complainant alleged.The woman and her son had died due to critical injuries. When a police team reached the spot after the incident, it had found the husband’s 20-year-old sister in the apartment with a burn injury on her face, officers had said.Based on the complaint a case was registered against the woman’s husband, mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law under Section 302 (murder), Section 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 304-B (dowry death), Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), Section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, and Sections 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act 1961.Love Kumar, additional commissioner of police, law and order, said, “A case of dowry death is registered if the death of a woman takes place within seven years of marriage. In this case, the husband’s sister alleged that the deceased woman had poured boiling oil on her face and then she committed suicide with the child, following a quarrel. We have registered a case and are investigating the matter from all angles,” Kumar said.When contacted, the deceased’s husband wept inconsolably. “I have lost my wife and child. My sister is in the hospital. The allegation of dowry harassment is false,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/husband-in-laws-booked-after-woman-4-yr-old-son-fell-to-death-from-17th-floor/story-i7KoSIgE8mYvbekF5SvJmK.html
10-11-2020||Noida||Delhi-Varanasi bullet train will have a stop at Jewar||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) said that the proposed bullet train line between Delhi’s Sarai Kale Khan and Varanasi will have a station at Jewar to provide high-speed connectivity to the proposed Noida International Greenfield Airport. The high-speed rail project will run parallel to the 25-km Noida-Greater Noida expressway, 165-km Yamuna Expressway, and 361-km Agra-Lucknow Expressway, among other highways, said officials of Yeida. The average speed of the bullet train will be 320 km per hour and it will take 21 minutes to reach Jewar airport from Delhi, they said.The decision was taken recently after central government officials working on this ambitious project had several round of discussions with the Noida authority and Yeida officials on the alignment of the route. “Teams working on this project have decided that the bullet train should be built on divider (central median) on the expressways because it will be cost effective. If the route is proposed along the expressways, then the government will have to acquire the land increasing the project cost. With route above the expressways, there will not be any requirement of land acquisition,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida. According to the officials, the 865-km long route of bullet train will have 10 stations between Delhi and Varanasi. The train capacity will be 750 passengers and the station names are Noida, Jewar Airport, Mathura, Agra, New Etawah, South Kannnauj, Lucknow, Raebareli, Prayagraj, New Bhadohi.With a total of 12 stations, the estimated cost of this project is ₹1.2 1 lakh crore. The National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), which will be constructing the project, has started making a detailed project report, the officials said. However, it has not fixed the deadline as to when DPR will be ready and submitted to the ministry of railways. “We have been working on the detailed project report of this project and survey work of the route is also underway. We are working on all the aspects of this project and we will soon submit DPR that will have all details related with stations, cost and others,” said Sushma Gaur, spokesperson of NHSRCL.However, Gaur did not give any deadline for the completion of DPR work.Yeida officials said that the bullet train project will help boost connectivity in and around Jewar airport area. “Commuters from Delhi-NCR will smoothly travel to Jewar airport through bullet train that will have minimum speed of 250 km per hour and maximum 350 km per hour. The operational speed of this bullet train will be 320 km per hour,” said an official from Yeida on condition of anonymity.The Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), the nodal agency for the proposed Jewar international airport, has already signed an agreement with the Swiss company Zurich International AG that is likely to start construction on the airport project site in June next year. The airport project with a budget of around ₹30,000 crore is projected to be operational by 2023-24. NIAL is happy to have connectivity through bullet train till Jewar airport because it will provide comfort to the passengers. “Having bullet train connectivity from Delhi to Jewar will be a big thing because a passenger who wants to take flight can reach here in 21 minutes from Delhi. It will also help increase passenger traffic at Jewar airport,” said Singh, who is also chief executive officer of NIAL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/delhi-varanasi-bullet-train-will-have-a-stop-at-jewar/story-bpSqt6kTNBJ6SwR8HPuVwO.html
10-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body bans bursting of firecrackers except on Diwali evening||Bursting of firecrackers stands banned across Mumbai from November 9 to November 30, except on November 14 (Diwali), but that, too, of only two types — “sparklers” and “flowerpots” — in private spaces, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced on Monday.The civic body’s order, a safety measure in view of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, said crackers that create noise pollution won’t be allowed on Diwali day (Saturday). However, interestingly, the sale of firecrackers has not been banned in Maharashtra or Mumbai. The BMC has appealed to the public to not use sanitisers when bursting firecrackers, but use water and soap instead, as sanitisers are inflammable owing to the alcohol in them. “Let us celebrate a firecracker-free Diwali this year to save Mumbaiites from a possible second wave of Covid-19. We all can jointly make this possible,” said Iqbal Singh Chahal, commissioner, BMC.The BMC circular has empowered assistant municipal commissioners and local police to take action against those violating its order. The civic body has urged officials concerned to book violators under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Disaster Management Act, 2005.Earlier, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had appealed to the public to celebrate a firecracker-free Diwali, as the resultant smoke could create health hazards for Covid-19 patients and those suffering from respiratory ailments.A state cabinet meeting last week had discussed issuing a blanket ban on sale of firecrackers, but no decision was taken then.The BMC has appealed to Mumbaiites to avoid social gatherings during Diwali and have online celebrations instead. The civic body authorities have urged the public to comply with social-distancing norms, while celebrating Diwali.However, those in the business of selling crackers were not happy with this ban. Mohammad Aslam, a wholesaler of fire crackers from south Mumbai, said, “I understand the Covid-19 situation, but this ban could have been done much earlier. We already have stocked up for the festival anticipating sales, and at the last moment we have a ban. It is matter of our employment and hence this decision should have been taken at least three weeks before.”Meanwhile, Sumaira Abdulali, noise-pollution activist and convener, Awaaz Foundation, said, “This year, the stakes are very high due to Covid-19. I am glad that the authorities are concerned and have banned bursting of crackers except on Saturday, but enforcement of this ban is something that I’ll be looking forward to. The BMC has banned bursting, but has not banned selling, and hence in this scenario the enforcement has to be good.”Abdulali added, “I agree that in case of public places there is a complete ban on bursting crackers, but these crackers will now be burst in residential areas, if there is no enforcement. The enforcement of the ban is something that has to be better, considering selling of crackers is not banned.” The decision received a mostly positive response from political parties. Ravi Raja, leader of Opposition in the BMC and Congress corporator, said, “We have seen in Delhi where due to increase in pollution, the number of Covid-19 cases has gone up. Hence, rather than this bursting of crackers being an administrative ban, I suggest it should be a voluntary ban, where citizens should ensure no bursting of crackers this year.”Bhalchandra Shirsat, BJP corporator and BMC’s standing committee member, said, “We support this ban considering this is in favour of the environment and also a measure against spread of Covid-19. Now, when it comes to banning sale of crackers, I think that is something which should not be a concern. We need to understand that selling of crackers is an industry and its manufacturing and selling happens throughout the year. Hence, banning bursting of crackers alone should be helpful.”Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party corporator and BMC group leader in the BMC, said, “I support this ban and more people should ensure that this year we celebrate Diwali in a traditional manner. Also, I demand that not only bursting of crackers, but even selling of it should be banned, considering it damages the environment throughout, irrespective of there being Covid-19 or not.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-bans-bursting-of-firecrackers-except-on-diwali-evening/story-jzbva63Xvly8fQwE4HzEVM.html
10-11-2020||Delhi||LSR student had flagged lack of devices, poor internet||Less than two months before she died by suicide, a 19-year-old undergraduate student at Delhi University’s Lady Shri Ram College had said in a digital survey by the college students that she was unable to regularly attend her online classes due to lack of devices and a poor internet connection and that it was affecting her mental and physical health.The student had returned to her hometown in Telangana, following the Covid-19 lockdown in March and had been facing difficulty in pursuing her online classes. On November 3, she died by suicide and left behind a note, saying she did not want to be a burden on her family.Her death has sparked outrage by political leaders, civil society activists, and students who have raised questions over the feasibility of online education. Congress president Rahul Gandhi expressed shock over the suicide. He accused the Central government of destroying countless homes due to the ‘deliberate’ lockdown and demonetisation.“My condolences to the family members of the girl in this very sad moment. The BJP government destroyed countless homes due to the deliberate demonetisation and countrywide lockdown. This is the truth,” Gandhi tweeted.Unnimaya P, general secretary of the LSR students union, said they had submitted the results of the survey, highlighting issued being faced by the students in pursuing studies online. “We also demanded that attendance should not be made compulsory and that allowances should be provided for internet packages to help students from marginalized backgrounds. But there was no response from the administration.” Several departments of the college participated in an online boycott of classes on Monday as a mark of protest and the students’ union has given the call for a boycott on Tuesday as well. Over 700 former students have also issued a statement condemning the incident. The parents of the dead student said that due to financial distress, they were unable to provide her a laptop which affected her studies despite “being a bright student”. In a press conference on Monday, her mother, who works as a tailor from home, said, “She was stressed over the being asked to vacate the college hostel. She was also worried that she would be mocked if she dropped out of the course because people looked up to her as she was the first from their social circle who had made it to a reputed institution.” The family also said that they had mortgaged their house and gold ornaments for Rs 2 lakh for her education and help her fulfil her dreams of becoming an Indian Administrative Services officer and study in Delhi. The college administration had asked all second-year students to vacate the hostel by October-end, which was later extended to November 10. LSR college on Monday said that the student had not approached the college for help and that the hostel guidelines had been specified during the time of admission. The college administration explained that that the hostel policies were changed to accommodate Other Backward Category and Economically Weaker Section category reservation. LSR Principal Suman Sharma said, “The student concerned never approached the college or her department of Mathematics, the scholarship committee for any financial help. Her fee was reimbursed and the college had given freeship amount of Rs 12,000, which was deposited in her account on April 24.” Her mother, however, denied receiving the amount. In a brief suicide note purportedly written by the student in Telugu, which was seen by HT, the girl said her education had become a burden on her family. “I cannot live without my studies. I have been thinking about it for a long time and I felt my death is the only solution to my problem. Nobody is the reason for my death. I should have got INSPIRE scholarship for at least one year,” the note read. The college, meanwhile, said on Monday, that they did not know about the INSPIRE scholarship. “There was no intimation by the student that she was a recipient of INSPIRE scholarship sponsored by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. This college, therefore, is not in a position to state anything on this matter. In any case, the role of the college in such cases is limited to certify bonafides only,” it said. Under the INSPIRE scholarship for Higher Education (SHE) scheme, 12,000 scholarships each valued at Rs 80,000 are announced annually for students pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate level courses in Basic and Natural Sciences. Ashutosh Sharma, secretary at the Department of Science and Technology, said there has been absolutely no delay in disbursal of funds for any student. “The process of disbursal of these scholarships includes sending of provisional fellowship letters in August, which were sent, and students have until December to upload documents like bank account number, marksheets, and bonafide certificate. Once the documents are received, the fellowship for entire year is released. The concerned student had not submitted these documents.”Sharma explained that while students apply for fellowship in first year of college, the amount is released next year for both the years together if they satisfy the required criteria of securing 60% marks in the first year and remain enrolled in the college to pursue science.The student’s family now hopes for some financial assistance to ensure that their younger daughter, who had to discontinue her education, would be able to pursue her studies. The college on Monday said it had initiated an assistance scheme to help the family. “We have initiated efforts to assist the family of the deceased student financially with a voluntary contribution by the LSR faculty,” the college said. Meanwhile, students’ groups – including Students’ Federation of India (SFI), National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), and All India Students Association (AISA) – protested at different spots across the capital demanding justice for the dead student. Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said at least 20 NSUI members staged a protest outside the residence of the Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal. “Seven protesters were detained. A case under section 188 of IPC and Section 3 of Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 and 51(b) of Disaster Management Act 2005 has been registered against the protestors at the Tughlaq Road police station,” he said. DCP (Southeast) RP Meena said, “We have not received any complaint regarding the incident (suicide). There is no investigation being done. Also, the Telangana Police have also not approached us so far in connection with the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lsr-student-had-flagged-lack-of-devices-poor-internet/story-8QSCo91ysZLRwRbL8kkpjN.html
10-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi chokes on season’s most polluted air||Delhi breathed season’s worst polluted air on Monday with a heavy layer of pollutants blocking sunlight, causing a thick haze to envelop the city with experts sounding a health emergency for the vulnerable population including the elderly, children and those with comorbidities. The average air quality index in Delhi was recorded at 477 on a scale of 500, the highest since November 3 last year, in the severe zone. This was the fifth consecutive day when Delhi’s air was in the severe category. The last time that Delhi had a such a long spell of polluted air in November was in 2016 and 2017, when the air remained in the severe category for six days.However, by late evening, the AQI deteriorated to 500 at five places -- Mundka, Najafgarh, Rohini, Drawrka Sec 8, Punjabi Bagh, according CPCB’s Sameer app. The overall AQI in the evening stood at 491.Doctors warned that exposure to such high levels of air pollution continuously over days is linked to higher hospital admissions and people reporting with respiratory and cardiovascular complications.Weather scientists and pollution monitoring agencies have warned that an immediate relief was unlikely as meteorological conditions are not ideal for disperal of pollutants and farm fires are raging in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana. It is, however, unclear if strict measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) such as stopping all construction activities, introducing the odd-even road space rationing scheme, and stopping the entry of trucks into the city completely, will be implemented or not.At 416, the AQI was in the lower-end of the severe category on Sunday.Scientists on Monday said the farm fires from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana are choking the national capital because of calm winds. Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre, said the wind speed in Delhi was less than 5 km per hour. “Due to the low wind speed, the smoke and pollutants cannot be dispersed which is why the condition is severe. Wind direction will switch to easterly direction and this will be a transitional phase when winds are usually calm. There may be marginal improvement in air quality on November 12 and 13, but if firecrackers are burst then condition will remain same or worsen,” he said.Around 5,000 instances of farm fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana on Monday, contributing 38% of PM 2.5 load in Delhi, according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.Vijay Soni, scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s air quality division, said, “Around 5,000 instances of farm fires were reported in Punjab and Haryana contributing to the air quality being in the severe category on Monday. The air quality is likely to be in the severe category till Tuesday. If the winds become easterly tomorrow, then we can expect some improvement. As per our forecast, winds will start blowing from northwest on Tuesday,” he said.“There is anti-cyclonic wind circulation in the lower levels and subsidence of air in large parts of northwest India presently. Both are linked to slow winds and accumulation of pollutants. We have been seeing a very large number of crop stubble fire points. The combination of these factors is leading to air quality index (AQI) hovering between very poor and severe categories for the past five days,” explained RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.The AQI is likely to be in the upper-end of very poor category on Friday and Saturday before turning severe around Diwali on November 15 and 16, according to ministry of earth sciences.Sagnik Dey, associate professor at the Institute of Technology-Delhi, said the spell of polluted air will cause problems to those infected by Covid-19.“This time around, doctors have also pointed out that high pollution levels are bad for Covid-19 transmission as well. However, more than the acute exposure, the health burden is larger for chronic exposure – which refers to the pollution levels that people of Delhi are exposed to all year round. That needs immediate attention,” he said. He explained that chronic exposure is linked to multiple health outcomes such as heart diseases, stroke, lung cancer, and also Type 2 diabetes, according to some studies. “All these eventually lead to mortality and different morbidities. One way to reduce the chronic burden is to control these pollution peaks. For instance, if we control the October-November pollution peak, we can reduce the annual PM 2.5 exposure by 15-20%,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-chokes-on-season-s-most-polluted-air/story-9CYn5TCj645QYwOpXMkDxI.html
10-11-2020||Delhi||Cracker ban SOP issued in Delhi: Fine up to ₹1 lakh or a month in prison for violators||The Delhi government on Monday released guidelines for enforcement agencies to implement the blanket ban on all kinds of firecrackers this Diwali. The guideline document directs the agencies to spread enforcement teams across Delhi, penalise violators and prepare a daily reporting system with focus on those who were granted licences for the sale of green crackers before the ban was imposed – with an objective to identify discrepancies and illegal sales, if any.The guidelines were issued by environment minister Gopal Rai, who on Monday convened a meeting with officials of the environment department, revenue department and police. These agencies, along with the municipal corporations, will be involved in the enforcement of the ban in different roles, government officials said.Rai said after the meeting, “If anyone violates the ban on firecracker bursting, they will be penalised under the Air Act. I urge every resident of Delhi to follow the ban on firecrackers… Earlier the Delhi government had allowed green crackers but looking at the increasing number of Covid-19 cases and the pollution levels, the Delhi government decided to ban all kinds of firecrackers.”Green crackers are said to contain fewer polluting substances as compared to traditional ones. Last year, under the Supreme Court’s directions, the Delhi government had allowed the sale of only green crackers and set a window of 8 pm to 10 pm for burning them during Diwali. This year’s ban on the sale, purchase, transport and burning of all kinds of firecrackers, will be in effect till November 30 midnight. Violation can lead to a penalty of up to Rs 1 lakh or a jail term that can extend up to 1 month.The guideline document, which HT has seen, said: “The city of Delhi is reeling under a third peak of outbreak of Covid-19 and large-scale celebrations by bursting of firecrackers will result not only in agglomeration of people, in violation of social distancing norms, but also would result in high level of air pollution, leading to serious health issues in Delhi… It is a matter of fact that burning of firecrackers would cause extensive air pollution and releases metal particles, dangerous toxins, harmful chemicals and noxious gases which would form one of the main sources of air pollution particularly when AQI is already reeling under ‘severe’ category.”On Monday, the air quality in Delhi remained in the “severe” category for the fifth consecutive day, with an AQI of 477 on a scale of 500.Rai mentioned the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) total ban on the sale and use of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR from the midnight of November 9 to November 30 midnight. The NGT order said the ban will be applicable in cities and towns where the air quality is in the “poor” category.Under the standard operating procedure (SOP) in the guideline document, the Delhi revenue department and police have been directed to send patrol teams across Delhi to enforce the ban, involve resident welfare associations (RWA) and non-government organisations (NGO) and use police vans for announcements against burning of firecrackers in all localities. “Delhi Police (directed) to lodge FIR against violators,” said the document.The joint commissioner of Delhi Police’s licensing department has been directed to check on the inventory of traders who were granted licences to sell green firecrackers before the ban was imposed, to ensure no illegal stocking, possession and sale take place.“We have already been enforcing the complete ban on sale and use of firecrackers in Delhi. So far, we have recovered more than 792 kilograms of crackers and arrested 12 persons in as many cases. Apart from that eight cases have been registered for illegal bursting of firecrackers and one person has been arrested till Monday,” Delhi Police spokesperson Eish Singhal said on Monday.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress have criticised the Delhi government for the last-minute ban, saying it would affect traders who were given licences.The BJP’s Delhi unit chief Adesh Gupta said the traders should be compensated by the government.Delhi Congress chief Anil Kumar also said, “The Delhi government should provide compensation to traders who suffered heavy losses due to the ban on crackers at the last moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cracker-ban-sop-issued-in-delhi-fine-up-to-1l-or-a-month-in-prison-for-violators/story-334Bfy80b3ktH1bUegfW6J.html
10-11-2020||Delhi||Thousands of MCD employees on indefinite strike to protest non-payment of salary, pension||Thousands of municipal employees, majority of them from the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, went on an indefinite strike on Monday, protesting against the non-payment of salaries and pensions. Striking staffers included engineers, parks and greenery maintenance staff, clerks, teachers and beldars and labourers. However, doctors, nurses and paramedic employees and sanitation workers did not participate in the strike.The agitating employees under the aegis of Confederation of MCD Employees Union also staged a protest at the Civic Centre, the headquarters of north and south Delhi corporations. They said that the employees have not been paid salaries for the last 3-4 months and pensions of retired workers are pending for over six months in the north corporation. The civil contractors of the north corporation have not been paid their bills since March 2015, the confederation said.The protesters said that during the strike they would come to the office but won’t work. On Monday, the strike was not only observed at the Civic Centre but also in zonal offices as employees abstained from performing their duties. Representatives of employee’s union said that issuance of birth and death certificates, inspection of project sites, maintenance of parks and garden and ministerial work remained suspended on Monday.AP Khan, convenor of the Confederation of MCD Employees Union — an umbrella body of civic workers in the three municipalities — said that the salary of employees is pending for 3-4 months in the north corporation while staffers of East DMC have not been paid for one month. He said that in north corporation even A-class officers have not been paid for the last three months. There is no pendency of salaries in SDMC, but other dues are yet to be paid. Pensions of retired employees in the north corporation is pending for six months while in the east and south it has not been paid for the last two months and one month respectively. “For how long anyone can work without a salary? The north corporation has paid salaries of highly paid doctors and nurses while the class four employee who get Rs 15,000, are waiting for salaries for the last four months. This discrimination in disbursal of salary is not fair and is a breach of trust. We had a meeting with all the three mayors on Saturday, but since it remained inconclusive, we have decided to go on an indefinite strike to claim our rights,” Khan said. According to civic officials, there are around 1.5 lakh employees in the three civic bodies. The north corporation alone has a workforce of around 55,000 employees and it spends nearly Rs 360 crore every month on salaries and pensions.Civic officials said that the north corporation is in the worst of financial health since there is a huge gap between its expenditure, Rs 5,000 crore, and its annual revenue which is Rs 2,000 crore. The Covid-19 pandemic has further hit the revenue collection. “This year the state government is yet to give our share of Basic Tax Assignment (BTA), which the government collects on behalf of the civic body, along with other dues. The situation can improve if we get money from the state government,” a senior official of the north corporation said.Jai Prakash, north corporation’s mayor, said the situation could improve if the Delhi government releases the pending amount of Rs 2,900 crore (approx). “We are making all possible efforts of releasing pending salaries of employees. We have already released salaries for September 2020 to doctors, nurses and paramedic staff and sanitation workers and the salaries of remaining workers will be given soon but they should also understand that strike is not a way to help improve the situation,” Prakash said.The Delhi government has repeatedly clarified that it has paid the due funds to the municipalities and that it does it not owe any money to them. Vikas Goel, AAP councillor and leader of opposition in the north corporation, said, “The Delhi government had been paying all its shares to the corporation on time. The crisis is because of corruption and mismanagement of funds.”KS Mehra, former municipal commissioner of the unified MCD pointed out a number of factors that are responsible for the poor financial health of the north civic body, including poor revenue collection and limited revenue generation options. He said that many residential colonies, which fall under the north corporation, are low-income neighbourhoods and residents don’t pay property tax while in south Delhi, the number of affluent colonies is high which also pay taxes. Besides, north corporation covers a bigger area than the south and also has big civic hospitals so it has higher expenditure but revenue generation is low.“The civic bodies, especially the north corporation, should consolidate their fund generation and collection. The government is still giving funds according to recommendations of 3rd Delhi Finance Commission despite the fact that the cost of equipment and manpower has increased over the years but the grants are the same. Municipal grants should also be increased to bail them out,” Mehra said.Nirmal Jain, EDMC mayor, said, “We have paid salaries till September 2020 and the October salaries will be released soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thousands-of-mcd-employees-on-indefinite-strike-to-protest-non-payment-of-salary-pension/story-DVkD4sQlBGc8SkO80P2nNP.html

10-11-2020||Delhi||AAP-BJP again spar over strike by civic body employees||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in Delhi (MCD) for the ongoing strike by thousands of employees demanding their salaries and accused the civic body of corruption.The BJP hit back accusing the AAP government in Delhi of not releasing funds to the municipal corporations.Thousands of civic employees, majorly from the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, went on an indefinite strike on Monday against non-payment of salaries and pension. The protesting employees range from engineers, clerical staff and teachers to sanitation workers. Some of them said that they did not receive salaries for around four months now. Last month, doctors and health care workers in MCD hospitals had staged protests on similar grounds.“If the BJP-ruled MCD cannot give salary to its employees, then it has no moral right to remain in power. If they are not in a position to pay salaries, it is only because of rampant corruption. BJP is only doing politics on the salary of the employees to defame the AAP government. Today, 1.25 lakh employees of all three corporations are on strike for non-payment of salaries, all offices are closed and all the work has been stalled and that is affecting people of Delhi,” said Durgesh Pathak, the AAP’s in charge of municipal affairs.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that work in the municipal corporation offices was not affected and labelled Pathak’s allegations as “false”. He further said, “The municipalities are facing a fund crunch in the first place because the AAP-led Delhi government has not released the money that is due.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-bjp-again-spar-over-strike-by-civic-body-employees/story-v3ubldgg63eXTAyjk2jtAP.html
10-11-2020||Delhi||Minors raped: Both suspects were familiar to victims, say police||The suspects in the rape of two minor girls in north and outer-north districts on November 3 were familiar to the victims, police said on Monday. It was earlier reported that the accused were strangers.In the first case reported from Gulabi Bagh, a six-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a 52-year-old man after he lured her away from a public park near her home. Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north), said the girl told her family about the incident and described the suspect to them. Since the man lived in the same neighbourhood, the girl showed his house to her family members following which they approached the police. “The girl’s family immediately took her to identify the house. The girl was able to identify the house after which her family approached the Gulabi Bagh police station,” said Alphonse. The police then arrested the suspected, an unmarried rickshaw puller, from his house. “He had lured the girl away to his home and raped her there,” said the DCP. He said the suspect and the victim girl were not strangers. “Their houses are located in the same neighbourhood, about 300 metres from each other. The suspect and the girl’s family knew each other since they lived in the same neighbourhood,” said Alphonse. In the second case reported from Narela, the police said that the four-year-old girl and her sister were playing outside a temple, about a kilometre from their home, with several other children when the suspect lured her away on November 3. Jitendra Kumar Meena, who is serving temporarily as the deputy commissioner of police of outer-north district, said the 14-year-old suspect used to play with the children. He said that the victim’s parents did not know the suspect, or vice-versa. “Their houses are located in separate blocks,” said Meena. On November 3, the suspect handed a Rs10 note to the girl and asked her to purchase a water bottle. “When the girl went to get water, he took her into the bushes and raped her. He then left the crime scene while the victim returned home,” said the officer. The girl’s grandmother took her to the hospital after she noticed bleeding. When the police were informed, investigators asked the children about the suspect. “A 10-year-old boy described the hair and clothes of the suspect. On that basis, we nabbed the suspect the day after the crime even though he was trying to hide as he knew he had done a crime,” said the DCP. The police formally apprehended the suspect two days after the crime when they were able to establish his alleged involvement, said Meena. The Delhi Police has said that an analysis of all rape cases this year show that in 97.25% of the cases, the suspects were known to the victims and in only 2.75% cases were strangers involved. Eish Singhal, Delhi Police spokesperson, said that the police have been running programmes such as Nirbheek, Nazuk and Sashakti to sensitise young students and children on such issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/minors-raped-both-suspects-were-familiar-to-victims-say-police/story-9i6yMkCzIGFroau194VyoM.html
10-11-2020||Delhi||In special sitting, Supreme Court to hear Delhi govt’s plea on Covid beds||The Supreme Court will hold a special sitting on Tuesday to consider the appeal filed by the Delhi government to implement its September 12 decision, asking 33 private hospitals and nursing homes to reserve 80 per cent beds in the intensive care unit (ICU) for Covid-19 patients.The Delhi high court on September 22 stayed this decision on a plea filed by Association of Healthcare Providers. Later, the Delhi government challenged this order before a division bench of the high court. This bench on October 9 refused to stay the September 22 direction and posted the matter for hearing on November 27. With the surge in Covid-19 cases and in view of the urgency, the Delhi government approached the Supreme Court against the HC decisions of September 22 and October 9.As the Supreme Court is closed for Diwali vacations, a notification on the top court’s website indicates that the special leave petition (SLP) filed by the Delhi government will be heard on Tuesday by a bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and BR Gavai. The hearing will begin at 10.30am.In its appeal filed through advocate Chirag M Shroff, the Delhi government highlighted the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi, which has breached the daily average mark of 7,000 cases.The government said that out of a total of 1,263 registered hospitals and nursing homes, 88 are run by the government while 1,175 are under private sector. There are 168 private hospitals in Delhi out of which the September 12 order impacts only 33 hospitals. In these 168 hospitals, there are 3,239 ICU beds of which more than 50 per cent beds (almost 1712 beds) remain available for non-Covid patients.However, the Delhi high court stayed the Delhi government’s decision on the ground that it would impact non-Covid patients.The Delhi government’s petition before the SC said, “As per the recommendations in the 3rd report of the Empowered Group (headed by NITI Aayog member VK Paul ), a total of 20,604 beds would be required for managing the disease burden in a scenario with 500 cases per million per day in Delhi requiring an escalation of 4891 beds from the current strength of 15,713 beds.”The government said in the petition that facilities at its hospitals have been augmented but there remains a section of society which prefers admission in private hospitals including those with health insurance, subsidized health schemes of central and the Delhi government and ex-servicemen. The government received several complaints that such patients were being denied hospital beds in ICU by these private hospitals that led to the order being issued, the petition said.The petition claimed that the association which has approached the high court has masked their financial interests under the garb of fighting for the misery of non-Covid patients when not a single such patient has complained of being discriminated against.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-special-sitting-sc-to-hear-delhi-govt-s-plea-on-covid-beds/story-fLk1ayEoSUw9IrqA3CyLyN.html
10-11-2020||HT||Lockdown hit income of 80% families: Survey||Lockdown has impacted the income of 80% families, mostly single-income, reducing it by more than 50% in 40.8% cases and less than 50% in 39.9%, according to a month-long survey of around 23,000 students spread across Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Navi Mumbai, Palghar, Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri. Conducted by the Bombay University and College Teachers’ Union (BUCTU), the idea was to understand how the lockdown affected students’ lives, especially as regular classes are being conducted online since the first week of September. “The survey was conducted in July 2020, before online classes were to begin. Through the survey, we wanted to find out if the students were prepared for this change in education pattern. The University of Mumbai had conducted no such survey before asking all colleges to start online classes in September,” stated the report. According to the survey, 80% of the respondents have only one earning member in the family. While in Sindhudurg and Palghar districts, 82% reported loss of income during the lockdown, the numbers in Ratnagiri, Raigad and Mumbai stand at 78.8%, 76.5% and 75%, respectively. Students were also asked if the loss in monthly income will affect their ability to pay fees for the 2020-21 academic year and almost 27.5% students said they will be in no position to pay the annual college fees. Another 27.9% said they would need the option of paying the fees in instalments as paying a lump sum amount in fees would be impossible at present. “In the previous academic year, 71.3% of the same respondents had managed to pay their annual fees in lumpsum, whereas 28% had paid their fees in instalments. Family income during lockdown is the sole reason for this change,” stated the survey report. “Due to the pandemic, the entire survey was conducted by asking students to fill Google forms. This limited our sample size as we couldn’t reach out to many students in the tribal areas. That itself shows how some students are being deprived of education due to accessibility issues,” said Madhu Paranjape, general secretary, BUCTU, who co-authored this report along with Tapati Mukhopadhyay, president of Maharashtra Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation (MFUCTO). The survey also found out the devices used by students to participate in online lectures and shows that almost 95% students own mobile phones. It further shows that nearly 63.1% have access to internet via mobile data and 16.2% through WiFi at home. A small portion of the respondents have access to cybercafes in case they don’t have the option of a mobile phone or laptop/desktop. The survey also showed that almost 95% students own mobile phones, 63.1% have access to internet via mobile data and 16.2% through WiFi at home. A total of 14% students said they have access to mobile internet as well as WiFi connection. A small portion of the respondents have access to cybercafes in case they don’t have the option of a mobile phone or laptop/desktop. When asked about their ability to switch over to online mode for a longer period, almost 40% students said it would be impossible to do so either due to affordability issues (6.8%) or due to irregular network and electricity trouble (33%). Another 21% said they find the physical class mode more effective in comparison to the online mode, while 39.1% respondents said they found the online classes very effective. BUCTU hopes to share this survey with the state government and demand monetary compensation for students. “The more this lockdown extends, higher are the chances of students dropping out of higher education. Students are already worried about paying their fees for the current academic year and if the government doesn’t make arrangements to avoid such problems, too many students will suffer,” said Tapati Mukhopadhyay. “Online education, in the current scenario, is the only option to ensure education is not stalled. That said, the role of the government in ensuring that each student is following online education is something that can’t be ignored,” said SS Mantha, former director of All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). He added that while calling for sudden change from physical classrooms to virtual education, the government should have studied the change better before implementing it haphazardly. “The government can easily invest in a service provider and make online education subsidised for students across the state, which will ensure the monetary burden doesn’t fall on colleges or students and also bring uniformity in teaching across colleges,” he said. “Most classes are monologues wherein students have no option of interacting in the middle of the class and research has shown how students can be attentive only for a limited time in virtual classrooms. We need a change in online teaching pedagogy if we want online classes to work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-lockdown-hit-income-of-80-families-in-mumbai-metropolitan-region-raigad-ratnagiri-finds-survey/story-qdiOuf6GEWEXIDqmkRE3OI.html
