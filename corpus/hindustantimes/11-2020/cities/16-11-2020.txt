16-11-2020||Noida||Jewar gang-rape victims’ family leaves home over ‘security threat’||Greater Noida: The family of 2017 Jewar gang-rape victims has left their native home in Jewar allegedly over threats from local suspects. The family members said they have shifted to Palwal in Haryana over security reasons and decided to sell the Jewar house. On the night of May 24/25 in 2017, a group of men had waylaid a car in Sabota village and gang-raped four women and murdered one male member of the family for putting up resistance. On July 23, 2017, four criminals of Bawariya gang were arrested in connection with the sensational murder and gang-rape case. The deceased’s nephew said that on August 3 this year, a group of eight persons from his neighbourhood attacked his family and shot his uncle in the leg. The family alleged the gang-rape case and this attack was linked. However, the police have denied the allegation. In the complaint related to August 3 incident, the victim said that the suspects had a quarrel with a third party in neighbourhood. He went to see what had happened in the neighbourhood when the suspects beat him up without a provocation. “They took out a countrymade gun and fired at my uncle. He received two bullets in his legs and was rushed to a private hospital,” the nephew said. The deceased’s nephew said that the police had arrested some suspects, but others are yet to be arrested. “They have been threatening to kill us. We had complained to the Jewar, police but no action was taken. We have no option but to shift to Palwal for our safety. We also want to sell our Jewar-based ancestral house,” he said. Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that the Jewar gang-rape case and the second case has no connection. “In the second case, the police had arrested four persons while others are absconding. The local police provide security to the family and also arrange police vehicle for their appearance in court in the cases. We have found that the family deals in scrap business in Palwal. It appears they have visited Palwal for business,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/jewar-gang-rape-victims-family-leaves-home-over-security-threat/story-tcPMdnP5Q1sVqh7XmSfDYK.html

During the event, the Noida traffic police also associated with 80-year-old former wing commander B S Bakshi to make him traffic volunteer in the city. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), said that the programme was held in the GIP mall. “Road accident is a serious concern as its consequences affect not only the road users but also their family members. In accidents, people get injured and sometimes lose lives. The accidents have serious health and economic consequences. We sensitized the people to follow traffic rules and avoid speeding,” he said. The participants also observed two-minute silence in the remembrance of accident victims who lost their lives.Saha said that Bakshi has been engaged as a traffic volunteer. “This will inspire other people to follow traffic rules,” he said.Bakshi, who also fought for India in the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war, had retired from Indian Air Force in 1992. He has been living in Jalvayu Vihar in Noida Sector 21 for the past 32 years. “I have been concerned over traffic issues in Noida.

The incident took place on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday, police said. The security guard, Devendra Singh, was sleeping near the brick kiln in Beragpur when the masked robbers attacked, the police said, adding that he was unarmed at the time of incident. Singh has filed a complaint at Dadri police station. “Two armed criminals came at 12:30am and started beating me. They snatched the keys of two tractors parked on the premises, and fled with them,” he said in the complaint. The police have registered a case and launched an investigation into the matter.According to the police, the criminals had tied the guard’s hands and legs and threatened for consequences if he raised an alarm. The suspects then started the tractors and fled on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. Three hours later, the victim freed himself with the help of a passerby and reported the matter to the police. Rajveer Singh Chauhan, station house officer, Dadri police station, said that the two robbers fled with a Mahindra tractor and one Eicher tractor. “A police team reached the spot after getting information and launched a search, but the suspects managed to escape,” he said. The police scanned the CCTV footage from the expressway and found the two tractors had gone towards Mewat in Haryana. Chauhan said that only the security guard was at the spot at the time of crime as the brick kiln was not in operation for the past two months. The police have admitted the security guard to a private hospital for treatment. The police said that neither the victim nor his employer has cited any personal enmity with anybody.“We have registered a case against unknown criminals under Section 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of Indian Penal Code. We have launched a search to arrest them and recover the tractors,” Chauhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/armed-men-attack-security-guard-at-brick-kiln-in-greater-noida-flee-with-two-tractors/story-5iphfq98q0UK0fTKLWiLZO.html

There is a proposal to develop a golf course so that the allottees can use this facility in future,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida.The authority has planned to develop a logistics hub, industrial sector and warehousing centre near Tappal-Bajna area, where Sector 35 is to be developed, said the officials. If all goes as per the plan, the golf course will be first one to be developed by Yeida along the expressway, they said.“It will be the first golf course along the Yamuna Expressway. And it will be an attraction for the corporate houses, who are investing to set up their businesses along the e-way,” said another Yeida official, who was not authorized to speak to media.The Tappal-Bajna area is located near the site of Noida Internaitonal Greenfield Airport project at Jewar.Noida has one golf course built by the Noida authority in Sector 38A. And the Noida authority is on way to develop another golf course in Sector 151A along the 25km Noida-Greater Noida expressway. The Greater Noida authority, however, did not develop any golf course in its jurisdiction. However, a realty firm developed a golf course in Greater Noida just next to Pari Chowk traffic intersection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/golf-course-planned-along-yamuna-expressway/story-rDBcs4e4oiCdNbl619c20H.html
16-11-2020||Noida||Yamuna Expressway area’s draft Master Plan-2041 to be ready by March: Yeida||GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) on Monday said that it is likely to finalise by March next year the draft Master Plan-2041 that will detail out the future urbanization to be done along the 165km Yamuna Expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra. At present, the authority is developing the urban centres along the expressway as per the provisions of the Master Plan-2031, said officials. The MP-2041 will have exact details as to how much agricultural land is to be acquired in Bulandshahr, Gautam Budh Nagar, Aligarh, Mathura, Hathras and Agra for future projects. According to the officials, the master plan will define the land uses for residential, industrial, commercial, institutional and greenery development along the expressway area that has started witnessing a rapid industrial growth after Switzerland company Zurich International AG signed an agreement to develop Noida International Greenfield Airport at Jewar. Zurich is likely to start work at the site by mid-June next year. In MP-2041, the authority will define the nature of the uses of land to be sold to investors and property buyers and how the development around the aviation hub will take place, said the officials.“The work on Master Plan-2041 is underway and we are likely to be finalise the blue print by March, 2021. Once it is finalised, we will send it to Uttar Pradesh national capital region cell and the state government for approvals,” said Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer of Yeida. Yeida, in 2013, had prepared the Master Plan 2031 and notified land for urbanisation along the expressway. Master Plan-2041 is important because Yeida has decided to develop some cities in Aligarh, Vrindavan, Mathura and Agra and the advance planning is required before the development begins at the ground, said the officials.The state government, on April 24, 2001, had established Yeida for development in areas between Greater Noida and Agra. The objective was to set up industries to generate employment and develop urban areas in the region.Around 2 lakh hectares from 1,187 villages of six districts -- Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura and Agra -- were notified under Yeida. So far, it has acquired at least 25,000 hectares of land for its various schemes. Now, the authority has decided to acquire agricultural land in Chola area, which is part of Bulandshahr district .“We need land for manufacturing units in Bulandshahr’s Chola, where railway connectivity already exists. Many manufacturing units, including electronics product makers, want to buy land from us and start business. They want to buy the land in this region because the region will have access to air and rail connectivity to travel or transport goods,” said the Yeida CEO.As per the rules, the state government will get approvals for the draft MP-2041 from the National Capital Region Planning Board. Once the NCRPB gives green signal, then Yeida will engage in urbanization in line with the provisions approved in the master plan.“The master plan is crucial because it will make sure that the development takes place without damaging the ecology of any region. It is also important for implementation of urban town planning rules,” said Atul Gupta, president at Architects Association Noida Zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/yamuna-expressway-area-s-draft-master-plan-2041-to-be-ready-by-march-yeida/story-BaXPlGTtgJmysIgSi6TGzN.html

According to the state’s Covid-19 bulletin, while the first 10,000 cases were recorded in 188 days, another 10,000 took just 64 days. The official data also shows that after the first 5,000 Covid-19 positive cases were detected in a span of 145 days, it took only 107 more days for the tally to reach 20,000. November has seen a surge in the positive cases, as in the past 15 days GB Nagar added 2,497 fresh cases. On Monday, GB Nagar reported 84 new cases, taking the tally to 20,424 in the district. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY, however, attributes the increased number of testing behind the rise in positive cases since July. “Started with 597 tests in March, we could reach a total of only 26,170 tests by June 30. But after that, we ramped up our testing rate aggressively, and between July 1 and November 15, we have collected samples of as many as 4,68,243 persons. It’s very much obvious that the number of positive cases detected will be directly proportional to the number of persons tested,” he said. The DM further said that apart from increasing the testing, stress is being laid on proper contact tracing. “In the present situation, early and timely tracking and providing adequate treatment are the main goals before the administration. “Despite having adequate beds for Covid-19 patients, all private and government hospitals have been asked to increase the number of beds in their intensive care units (ICU) and high dependency units,” he said. Suhas also said that the administration’s main focus is on reducing the number of deaths and curing the maximum possible number of infected patients on time. “For that, we have adapted the universally accepted ‘tracking, testing and treating’ method. The health workers have been told to ensure maximum contact tracing – precisely finding out 25 contacts of one infected patient. We are testing nearly 5,000 people every day and treating infected patients as per symptoms. While recovery rate in GB Nagar is still over 90%, the current case fatality rate (CFR) is around 0.36%, which is much better than the state’s overall CFR of 1.43%,” the DM said. District chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that the health workers have been asked to increase the daily testing to over 7,000 and enhance the contact tracing in the district. “It is really a matter of concern for us that the second, third and fourth 5,000 cases came within 44 days, 30 days and 33 days, respectively. To check this speedy growth of new positive cases in the district, the health officials and workers have been categorically asked to keep strict surveillance in the crowded areas. The district magistrate is himself keeping a tab on daily testing and contact tracing in the district,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-20k-mark-last-10k-recorded-in-only-64-days/story-HDaN2zrFLYcBqaGvarYg3H.html
16-11-2020||Noida||FSI survey to assess trees in non-forest areas||Ghaziabad: On directions of the Uttar Pradesh government, the Forest Survey of India (FSI) is conducting a survey in Meerut and Saharanpur divisions to assess trees outside forest areas. The UP forest department said Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar will be included in the survey, which are part of the Meerut division. The department generally takes up tree plantations in protected and reserved forest areas while there is hardly any assessment of tree cover in non-forest areas. The survey is being done with the help of remote sensing.“Through remote sensing, sampling points will be generated. The assessment will be done by about 90 personnel of the forest department. Once the sample is ascertained, it will be extrapolated to give an assessment of the number of trees in non-forest areas which will also include trees on private land,” said Diksha Bhandari, divisional forest officer, Ghaziabad. The remote sensing will assess trees in scattered, linear, dense and in block formation. “The work has already been done in Saharanpur division and now it is going on in Bulandshahr and Gautam Budh Nagar. Besides assessment, the survey will also help assess availability of timber,” said SK Janu, chief conservator of forests (Meerut). The ‘State of Forest - 2019’ report states that Ghaziabad district, with its geographical area of about 1,179 square kilometres (sq km), has forest cover on about 25.22 sq km, which is about 2.14% of its geographical area. The district also suffered a negative growth of forest cover of 0.78% in comparison to the last 2017 assessment by the FSI, the report adds.Gautam Budh Nagar on the other hand has 1.56% of forest cover, about 20 sq km, of its 1,282 sq km of geographical area, as per the 2019 report. In comparison to the 2017 report, the district did not make any addition to its forest cover in 2019. “Despite plantation of lakhs of trees during the annual plantation drive, the forest cover has gone down in Ghaziabad. The survey is a welcome step as it will provide a baseline of tree availability. Once the baseline data is available, it will be helpful in assessing the per capita of tree cover available and ways to increase it further,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/fsi-survey-to-assess-trees-in-non-forest-areas/story-DH9Req1Uy80Ndl69EqSaFM.html
16-11-2020||Noida||Noida: 35 issued fines for bursting firecrackers day after Diwali||Noida: In a move aimed at controlling the pollution situation in the district and to ensure enforcement of the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) ban on firecrackers in the later part of the month, Noida police commissionerate on Sunday fined 35 people for bursting firecrackers. While 15 fines were issued by the Phase 3 police, 20 were issued by the Surajpur police. “Since before Diwali, police teams across the district have been patrolling the streets, asking people to adhere to the NGT ban Awareness drives were carried out on Diwali as well. We have been constantly making announcements on speaker systems. Many people who were seen flouting norms were also given warnings. However, there were a few who continued with violations. Fifteen such people from different parts of the jurisdiction were then fiend and sent to jail,” said Jitendra Kumar Dikshit, SHO, Phase 3 police station. They were booked for disrupting public order under Section 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, he said. Surajpur police had also fined three people on Diwali night for these violations. They were among five in the entire district who were booked. “On Sunday, 20 others were fined. Most of them were from the Surajpur Kasba area and a few from surrounding villages. These were people who ignored our initial warnings and continued to break the law. They were booked under Section 290 (punishment for public nuisance) of the IPC,” said Pradeep Kumar Tripathi, SHO, Surajpur police station. The NGT ban is effective till midnight of November 30 and senior police officials said that the enforcement and awareness drives will continue while action will be taken against violators. Air quality in the district had fallen to the “severe” category on Diwali night, which has now come under the “poor” quality, and will continue to improve further according to the India Meteorological Department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-35-issued-fines-for-bursting-firecrackers-day-after-diwali/story-JK7WFYIIlerGFWxJy9Z5SK.html
16-11-2020||Noida||Banyan tree on Hapur Road has nowhere to go: Forest department gives permission to shift it to NDRF campus, NDRF says it has no space||Environmentalists have vehemently opposed the Ghaziabad forest department giving permission to residents close to Hapur road to translocate a banyan tree, citing hindrance to traffic. The tree would be translocated to the campus of the eighth battalion of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) in Govindpuram, said a department official. The NDRF, however, said it had no not given permission to shift the tree to their campus.In the meantime, many branches of the tree had already been chopped, which the forest department official said was part of the translocation process.The tree is estimated to be between 50-75 years old and is located opposite to Navyug Market in Ghaziabad city. Some people had sought permission to translocate the tree as it obstructed their view, said environmentalists. “The tree had dense and a big canopy and pose no hindrance to traffic. All its main branches have been chopped during late night/early morning of Sunday. Last month when the issue came to light, I had raised a complaint with the authorities and was told that it would not be chopped,” said Ruchin Mehra, a city-based environmentalist. “However, it happened. And when the branches were chopped, there were no forest officials on-site. Now, only the main stem of the tree is left.” The environmentalists have now written to the top officials of the forest department and sought intervention. “We have sought action against the district forest department officials as there are procedural aspects that were overlooked. The tree should have been preserved. It is a big tree and its transplantation or translocation may not be possible. The age of the tree is also to be ascertained,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. Translocation is a highly complex process and requires machinery in case of a big and old tree. Diksha Bhandari, divisional forest officer (DFO), said that she had given permission for translocation on November 7. “Initially, the local people requested us to fell the tree, but we decided for translocation. The DFO has powers to decide to fell a tree in view of public interest. In this case, the tree posed hindrance to traffic and tilted towards the road. The soil near it base was loose. I have suspended the activity for now and will visit the site,” she said, while confirming that the tree would be translocated to the NDRF campus. “The chopping of branches is part of the translocation exercise and once the new shoots come, it will be shifted. It seems to be about 50-75 years but we are yet to ascertain its age.” NDRF, however, said they had not given any permission for the translocation. “We received a letter from the forest department for translocating the tree but we did not given permission as there are other trees on the campus and infrastructure development is ongoing. We had verbally suggested that if they translocated the tree to a ground opposite to the campus, we will help take care of it,” said PK Tiwary, commandant of the eighth battalion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/banyan-tree-on-hapur-road-has-nowhere-to-go-forest-department-gives-permission-to-shift-it-to-ndrf-campus-ndrf-says-it-has-no-space/story-NK6sid4H3PORUT3vCJyduL.html

Noida Police took cognizance of the matter and investigated it.“The video was traced to Barola village and it was made in 2017. We identified the person who fired the shots. He is a local property dealer who also runs a dairy. He owns both the weapons seen in the video. They are licensed. However, once we contacted the man, we seized both the weapons,” said Sudhir Kumar, station house officer, sector 49 police station. “Firing in the air is against the law. It does not seem that there was any legal action taken when it was shot in 2017. We are investigating the case and due action will be taken.”He said that another video of a weapon being fired had come to their attention. “A second clip of air-firing had reached us. This one seemed to originate from sector 50. We have traced the man seen in the video and this one also seems to be a few years old.

16-11-2020||Chandigarh||Lalru dhaba blast: No action by govt despite complaints earlier, say oil companies||The recent blast in which four men were killed while stealing fuel from an oil tanker at Sirsini village, Lalru, on the Ambala-Chandigarh highway was a tragedy waiting to happen, say representatives of oil companies, alleging that their complaints to the state government earlier about thefts had fallen on deaf ears. “We have taken up the matter with the state government and sometimes the dhabas have been raided and the thefts stop. But then it starts all over again soon,” says Sujoy Choudhury, executive director, Indian Oil Corporation Limited.“ Our company can only take up the matter with the state government, but action has to be taken by the state government,” he adds.Many companies are relying on technology. “A vehicle tracking system is installed in our tankers and we check where the vehicle has been diverted. We have also introduced electromagnetic locks for the tankers which open at the final destination with a one time password (OTP),” says a senior officer of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited on condition of anonymity.He says oil pilferage is a serious matter and the company will contact the state government again. Shalabh Raj Gupta, divisional manager, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, too, says they will take up the matter with the government. Meanwhile, Kuldeep Bawa, subdivisional magistrate probing the blast, has found that the usual practice is to steal about 100 litres of oil from one tanker, which can hold up to 1 lakh litres of liquid. This is then sold at rates cheaper by Rs 5 to Rs 7 than current rates. The stolen fuel is stored in drums of five litres each.Such thefts are causing huge losses to the state exchequer, says Ashwinder Mongia, president, Mohali District Petroleum Dealers Association, while calling for intervention by the finance ministry.Four persons, including Sandeep Kumar, Jaswinder Singh, 35, owner of Rama Punjabi dhaba, and his relatives, Babloo, 20, and Vikram Kumar were killed in the blast last Friday.,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lalru-dhaba-blast-no-action-by-govt-despite-complaints-earlier-say-oil-companies/story-tONYtf5d9Rp52WsaRrxKGM.html
16-11-2020||Noida||Snow in hills to reduce temperature further||Noida and neighbouring areas are set to feel a chill as the mercury is set to fall by six degrees over next two days, weather analysts said. According to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) data, Noida recorded 1mm rain in past 24-hours. While the western disturbance caused the light rain, snowfall in the northern regions helped cool the winds headed to Noida. “The wind direction is currently easterly and south-easterly, which will change to north-westerly by Tuesday evening, and between eight to 10kmph. This will bring in cool wind ave of chilly winds from the northern states where the western disturbance have caused snowfall. Due to this, the mercury in the plains will fall sharply over next two days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. According to the IMD, the maximum temperature for Noida on Monday was 25 degrees Celsius, two notches below the season’s average, against 29 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The minimum temperature was recorded at 16 degrees Celsius, two notches above the season’s average, against 14.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The humidity oscillated between 81-79 per cent on Monday. “By Wednesday, the minimum temperatures are likely to shrink around ten degrees Celsius. The main reason behind this fall is the icy cold winds from norther states like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir,” said Srivastava. According to the IMD, another western disturbance – the weather phenomenon that causes rains in the region – is expected around November 18-19, which will further hit the mercury due to snowfall on the northern mountainous states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/snow-in-hills-to-reduce-temperature-further/story-9iaE0ePGhxYQMD4KYboB9N.html
16-11-2020||Noida||Noida breathes cleanest air of month||Noida: Noida and its adjoining areas breathed the cleanest air of the month so far as the air quality improved to the ‘poor’ zone after oscillating between ‘very poor’ and the more hazardous ‘severe’ for the past 15 days. The rain and moderate easterly winds washed away a heavy chunk of pollutants trapped in the city and adjoining areas for several days, bringing down the pollution levels. According to weather analysts, the air quality is likely to improve slightly further on Tuesday but would slip slightly on Wednesday due to a change in wind direction. “The region received good wind speed on Monday. The region received easterly winds of 14 kmph, which led to the dispersal of pollutants. The wind calmed down towards the evening and will change to north-westerly on Tuesday evening. On Tuesday evening, the wind speed will be around 8 to 10 kmph, which may bring smoke from stubble fires, if any, from the neighbouring states, which could lead to a slight drop in the air quality on Wednesday,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Centre (IMD). According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Monday improved to 243 or ‘poor’ against 441 or ‘severe’ on Sunday. The AQI of Greater Noida was 226 against 417 on Sunday. The AQI above 400 is considered severe, while that between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very poor’ and between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’. The last time ‘poor’ category air quality was recorded in Noida was on November 2 with an AQI of 299. On October 20, Noida’s AQI was 219, the best since November 16. The pollution mass also dropped drastically with the PM2.5 levels in the past 24 hours in Noida dropping to 113.71 microgrammes per cubic meters against 391.71 microgrammes per cubic meters a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida also dropped to 105.73 units against 316.47 units on Sunday. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI may improve further on Tuesday, but will soon deteriorate further slightly. “Scattered rainfall in Delhi and surrounding regions washed out some of the pollutants. Effective stubble fire counts with sufficient potential estimated from SAFAR-multi-satellite products are significantly reduced and are around 282. However, in reality it could be an underestimate due to the inability of satellites to identify spots under cloudy conditions. A change in boundary layer wind direction is forecasted by tomorrow afternoon but since the fire-related emissions have reduced, significant impact is not expected. AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate on 18 and 19 November,” SAFAR said in statement on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-breathes-cleanest-air-of-month/story-BwckVyWxVvKwdrrchoN8aN.html

Panic gripped the area as the unit is situated on a congested street, where several other hosiery units are also located. Though no casualties were reported, goods and machinery worth lakhs are believed to have been destroyed in the blaze. The firefighting operations continued for about two hours. As per information, the fire broke out on the second and third floor of the unit, reportedly due to a short-circuit, and then spread to the other floors. Shopkeepers in the area said there had been frequent power cuts in the area and a short-circuit may have taken place due to fluctuations in power supply. Sub-fire officer (SFO) Atish Rai said, “We received an alert about the fire around 12:50pm following which we rushed five fire tenders to the spot. As the unit is situated near the Sundar Nagar fire station, the fire brigade reached the spot within a few minutes and controlled the blaze.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fire-at-hosiery-unit-in-ludhiana-s-new-madhopuri-no-casualty/story-Lv1sYT4UD1CxKeQ3yyLQON.html

Before the lockdown was imposed due to the Covid pandemic, it earned around ₹1.4 crore daily.PRTC managing director Jaskiran Singh said the increase in revenue has come as a great financial relief to the corporation, which is now managing to cope with operational losses incurred in the recent months.“We have restarted buses in a phased manner. Buses are being sanitised daily, and we have managed to convince people that they can board them without any fear of contracting the virus,” said the MD.At present, the corporation is running 90% of its fleet of 1,125 buses.In the first 60 days of the lockdown, the corporation had incurred losses to the tune of ₹51 crore, with daily losses pegged at ₹85 lakh. Even after resuming operations on May 18, PRTC was finding it hard to meet its committed expenditure due to low occupancy. The corporation had also sought ₹90-crore bailout package from the Punjab government to compensate for the losses. “We are yet to receive any response from the state government,” said the MD. Nirmal Singh Dhaliwal, convener of the PRTC trade unions, said it is good sign that the general public has started believing in the corporation’s services, but the state government must help it financially too.“The government already owes PRTC more than ₹200 crore against the free and concessional facilities it is providing, mainly to police personnel and students,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/prtc-s-daily-receipts-cross-1-crore-for-first-time-post-lockdown/story-5sdMqbOy4ulQG4H3B3thuK.html

However, even after nearly four years, only about 20% work has been completed, said Adampur MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu, who also met Jalandhar deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori on Monday to push for speeding up its construction.With domestic flight operations set to resume from the Adampur airport on November 20, the situation is likely to worsen as the travelers will have to cross this stretch, said Tinu, who also demanded construction of a service lane besides deployment of traffic cops to ease congestion at the junction. Angrez Singh, executive engineer, public works department, Jalandhar, said the main reason for the delay was the revision in the length of the flyover from two kilometers to three kilometers last year.Thori said he held a meeting with officials concerned and asked them to speed up the work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jalandhar-s-adampur-flyover-project-hanging-fire-for-4-years/story-ZyeNNP45wlYjY6os2nf6RI.html

Holding flags of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) — one of the 30 farm bodies up in arms in the state — Jashanjeet Singh’s wedding procession marched through his village Retgarh, 22 kilometers from Sangrur, before proceeding to his bride’s town on Monday.Harnek Singh, Jashanjeet’s father and head of the union in the village, said that he is making a statement against the Centre’s “anti-farmer policies” while celebrating his son’s wedding.“We will keep fighting against the Modi government, which is trying to give our land to corporate houses,” he said.Some guests were taken by surprise, but appreciated the move, saying the union flags had become a part of their “happiness and sorrows”.Meanwhile, thousands of farmers continue to sit on dharnas outside railway stations and at toll plazas in Sangrur and Barnala districts, as the protest entered its 47th day on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wedding-procession-gives-fillip-to-farmers-agitation-in-sangrur/story-zVpXiXxWkbhDBGhR4ZkreN.html

16-11-2020||City||SGPC’s centenary celebration a low-key affair||The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC)’s 100th foundation day function is set to be a low-key affair, amid the ongoing row over missing holy saroops (copies) of Guru Granth Sahib.The apex gurdwara body was founded on November 15, 1920. The day passed off without any public event to mark the centenary this year. However, a function is planned on November 17, for which an akhand path (recitation of Guru Granth Sahib) started at the Akal Takht on November 15. An SGPC official cited Diwali festivities as the reason for postponing the main function, even as the celebrations had culminated by the night of November 14.Moreover, the main function is set to be a simple affair, after bhog (culmination) ceremony of the akhand path. “After performance of ragis (traditional gurbani singers) and dhadis (ballad singers), all panthic personalities will address the gathering at Manji Sahib Diwan Hall and share their views on 100-year journey of the SGPC,” said spokesperson Kulwinder Singh Ramdas.However, unlike other centennial events in the past, when even the Prime Minister and President were invited, no big personality is expected at the event.“This centenary cannot be compared with past events in terms of enthusiasm and circumstances. If we talk about the reasons behind it, the first is Covid outbreak. Second, the SGPC has been under a cloud for some time. Its credibility is at stake. So, people in general are not showing that much interest in this centenary,” said Tarlochan Singh, former Rajya Sabha MP and chairman of the National Commission of Minorities. However, the pandemic did not deter the SGPC from organising Diwali and birth anniversary of Guru Ramdas on a large scale this month.Sikh leaders and organisations at loggerheads with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), which controls the SGPC due to its majority in the General House, will stay away from the main function. Even dissenting SGPC members, such as Kiranjot Kaur, expressed uncertainty over their participation.Splinter Akali groups, which are gearing up jointly to contest SGPC general polls against the SAD, have also showed their apathy towards the centenary by not planning any separate event.“The programme to celebrate 100 years of SGPC is as vague as its policies,” said Kaur, who has also been its general secretary.The SGPC is still under fire over alleged misappropriation in its publication department that led to 328 Guru Granth Sahib saroops going missing. Bargari sacrilege and pardoning of Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim by the Akal Takht were other major issues that dented the credibility and image of the SGPC, also known as the Sikh parliament, in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sgpc-s-centenary-celebration-a-low-key-affair/story-NyNzJlMEoUIpN9kbMAFk3M.html
16-11-2020||Chandigarh||Paddy yield hits all-time high in Punjab, but raises concerns||As Punjab is heading towards an all-time high production of paddy this kharif season, experts welcomed the resultant higher income for farmers, but also raised concern over its long-term impact. According to experts, increase in production means efforts for diversification will take a hit, as more farmers will shift back to growing paddy that offers an assured income by way of minimum support price. As per the crop cutting experiments conducted by the state agriculture directorate, there’s an increase of 10.5% in the paddy yield. “It is expected to break the previous record of 2017, when a total of 199.65 lakh tonne paddy was produced (including basmati),” said director agriculture Rajesh Vashisht. Non-basmati varieties production in 2017 was 174.62 lakh tonne. Crop cutting experiments are conducted in all blocks of the state and the trend could be assessed on basis of results of 60% of them. This kharif season, paddy was grown over 27.89 lakh hectare, including basmati over 6.6 lakh hectare.The yield is expected to touch 210-215 lakh tonne, while paddy procurement by state agencies has already crossed 197 lakh tonne. Vashisht said this season, crop delivered best results as all the conditions, such as weather, humidity and rainfall, were most conducive, there was no pest attack, and direct sowing rice (DSR) method was adopted over 5.5 lakh. Also, short-duration varieties were sown, which contributed to a higher yield. “On one side, we are happy as the production has increased. However, more production will lead to a vicious cycle, wherein more farmers will turn towards the paddy crop with assured income in mind and our diversification plan will take a hit,” said Vashisht. Stubble burning cases could riseMoreover, the per-hectare productivity of paddy is also expected to touch an all-time high of 70 quintal. “More productivity means higher stubble volume. When more stubble is burnt, it will emit more smoke,” said an official of the pollution control board. At least 20-25 lakh tonne stubble is produced along with the grain. The number of stubble burning cases in the current season has touched an all-time high of 73,988, and due to this, air quality index remained over 300 (very poor) for many days before the Sunday’s rainfall. ‘Need alternatives for farmers’Dr Sukhpal Singh principal economist, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, said assured income as well as environment protection are important. “No doubt there is need to save subsoil water and ambient air. For that, we have to ensure an alternative to farmers, so that they can also get good remuneration. I think cotton and maize are good alternatives, if assured procurement could be ensured,” said Singh. PAU vice-chancellor BS Dhillon said the challenge is to conserve water and sow short-duration varieties. “I am happy for the farmers, as increase in yield means higher income,” he said. Storage to pose problemAccording to sources in the food and civil supplies department, the storage of rice after shelling of the current paddy crop will pose a logistical problem. Out of 205 lakh tone expected to be procured this season, 135 lakh tonne rice would come for storage. Already 55 lakh tonne rice from the previous season besides 136 lakh tonne wheat is stored in state godowns. “More production is certainly a concern, if we look at the logistics, as the storage space is restricted,” said a food department official, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/paddy-yield-hits-all-time-high-in-punjab-but-raises-concerns/story-xeCxm7ZbJSnwxcsTsiKSVM.html
16-11-2020||Chandigarh||Monday was Chandigarh’s wettest Nov day in 11 years||With 15.1 mm of rain recorded in the city, Monday was the wettest November day in the city since 2009, shows data available with the India Meteorological Department (IMD), even as more rain was expected in a few days. The air quality index (AQI) to measure pollution too improved to 31, in the “good” categoryWhile clear skies are expected on Tuesday, another western disturbance (WD) is likely to hit the region from Wednesday.Monday’s rainfall was an unusual occurrence as November is one of the driest months of the year with normal rainfall of 9.4 mm usually recorded in the city.Interestingly, just one day’s precipitation made November as a whole the second wettest since 2009, after 20.9 mm of rain was recorded throughout the month in 2019.According to Surender Paul, director of IMD Chandigarh, rain at the beginning of this week intensified as western disturbances active in the region, though feeble, coupled with low level easterly winds laden with moisture. “The system also drew winds from the north east monsoon system to intensify,” he added.On another WD likely to hit the region from Wednesday, Paul said “it’s unlikely to combine with other wind systems so chances of rain and intensity will be significantly lower than the showers received on Monday.” Though the cloud cover and pressure pushed up minimum temperature from 12.6 °C on Sunday to 14.4 °C on Monday, 3 °C above normal, a 2°C to 4 °C drop was expected due to snowfall in Himachal Pradesh, with a good chance of lows below 10 °C soon.The maximum temperature dropped from 26.4 °C on Sunday to 24 °C on Monday, 4 °C below normal, the lowest of the season. AQI drops to 64 Monday’s rain also cleared the AQI, with monitoring stations recording levels at 31 at 10 pm, which is bracketed as good, something that usually happens in the monsoon. Debendra Dalai, member secretary of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee, said the AQI would increase as soon as temperatures fell. “However, the air quality in the city this year had been far better than previous years due to the cooperation of the people on Diwali,” he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/monday-was-chandigarh-s-wettest-nov-day-in-11-years/story-BoPTWaZKPT7LYNLVLNAlfP.html

The police said the woman had lodged a complaint on October 2 at Sector 50 police station but no progress was made in the matter, said the police. According to the police, the woman, a resident of Sector 57, lodged a complaint again on Saturday, alleging that she received a call from unidentified person asking her for money. She alleged that the man was asking her to pay ₹10 lakh, failing which he would publish her personal pictures, videos and other content on social media platforms. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that they registered a case under sections 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the India Penal Code(IPC) at Sector 50 police station. “The cyber crime team is investigating the case and the mobile number from which the call was received has been put on surveillance. The call details are being scanned to identify the suspect,” he said. The police said the suspect had tried to negotiate money with the victim, who, in turn, reported the incident to the police after discussing it with her husband. Rao said the victim had lost her mobile on September 27 in a mall and registered a complaint with the police regarding the matter. “The victim was shocked to receive the extortion call as there were personal pictures and other stuff stored in the mobile. Initially, she dismissed the call, thinking it was a prank but when the blackmailer started negotiating money, she discussed the matter with her family members and approached us,” he said. Rao said they’re trying to find the culprit and have formed teams to be sent to the place from where the phone was stolen. The police said a similar incident was reported in June 2017 when a Cyber Hub employee had received an extortion call demanding ₹50 lakh after he lost his mobile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-gets-extortion-call-seeking-rs-10-lakh-for-lost-phone-with-sensitive-data/story-nlqMtIU5qoSEtLKtrX3WKJ.html

16-11-2020||Gurugram||Goons attack family in tiff over parking a car||An argument over parking a car at a public place in Bhamrauli village near Sector 10A turned ugly on Sunday night, with 30 persons breaking into the house of a former sarpanch and attacking the family, leaving five injured.The police said that a gang led by Akash Yadav alias Ashu, a repeat offender involved in more than 50 cases of murder, attempt to murder, assault, and extortion, was behind the attack. Over the past decade, Yadav has been booked in many cases, most notably for shooting a classmate in a private school in 2007 and for allegedly murdering an acquaintance at the Sector 21 market in 2015. The police said that Yadav, a notorious gangster, runs an illegal water business in developing sectors. He had also spent three years in a juvenile observation home when he was a minor. Now 26, Yadav is out on bail and heads a gang, said police. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the incident took place around 9pm when a villager, identified as Joginder Yadav, parked his SUV at the village entrance, near Yadav’s house. He was waiting for his cousins, when a group of men asked him to remove the car. “Joginder refused, saying that it was public property, following which the group of men allegedly started hitting him and his relatives,” he said. The villagers immediately intervened and sent both the groups to their respective houses, but within a few minutes, Yadav, along with a few armed men, broke into Joginder’s house and started assaulting the family with sticks and rods. The police said that both the parties abused each other and the situation went out of control as Yadav shot around 30 rounds. The incident was recorded by a local on his mobile and was also picked up by four CCTV cameras in the vicinity. “Yadav was holding a pistol and he, along with another man, his brother, father and mother, shot around 30 rounds out of which three hit two of our family. When we raised the alarm, they fled the spot,” said Neeraj Yadav, a victim. Manoj Yadav (21) suffered a bullet injury, while Shamsher Singh, the former sarpanch, and his family members Sanesh Yadav, Parveen Yadav, and Sumit suffered head injuries and are admitted to a private hospital. Their condition is stable, the police said. Yadav and his family members fled the village in three SUVs following the incident, the police said. A case under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (assault), 452 (house trespass) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Arms Act was registered against four family members and unidentified men at the Sector 10 police station. Sangwan said the attackers have been identified from CCTV footage at the spot and police teams are on the trail of the suspects. Joginder Yadav, the complainant in the case, said that more than 30 goons are deployed at Yadav’s house, who often trouble villagers. “These men are often seen standing outside the house and balcony. They often pass lewd comments and we have, several times, complained to the father and mother of Yadav, but they do not pay any heed and situation is getting worse day by day. Women and young girls do not even use the stretch,” he said, adding that the family is now fearing for their lives. Many of them had left the village on Sunday night and returned after the panchayat held a meeting and assured their safety. Yadav lives in a three-storey house, fitted with imported tiles inside and CCTV cameras outside. He has spent over Rs 3 crore on the construction, said villagers. Manoj Yadav, a village resident, said that Yadav’s family backs him as they are dependent on him for money and that his younger brother, Sumit Yadav, is also a part of the gang. “He holds supremacy in the area, people are scared of him and often avoid him. He is always surrounded by goons and roams around openly loaded with arms,” he said. The police recovered empty cartridges from the spot and said country made pistols were used in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/goons-attack-family-in-tiff-over-parking-a-car/story-H989YVE8DDx7huNv7urjfL.html
16-11-2020||City||DTCP carried out demolition drive in DLF Phase-2||The department of town and country planning(DTCP) on Monday carried out a large-scale demolition drive in DLF Phase 2, in which around 15 dhabas and commercial establishments, which were operating illegally, were razed to the ground. The department also carried out a sealing drive in Suncity, during which two houses and three shops were sealed. DTCP officials said that an enforcement team of the department, along with a large police team comprising around 50 police personnel, started the demolition drive at Dakshin Marg in DLF Phase 2 around 11am. According to DTCP officials, the demolition drive was carried out on the basis of complaints by local residents, who told the authorities that illegal dhabas and shops were being run in residential plots, leading to pollution, frequent traffic jams and entry of outsiders in the area. RS Bhath, district town planner, said that around 15 illegal shops, dhabas and kiosks being run illegally on residential plots were demolished. “A number of illegal kiosks being run in setback area of plots were removed. Some kiosks that were operated illegally in a commercial complex without any permission were also removed. A survey in this regard was conducted last week and it was decided to remove the encroachments,” said Bhath. Apart from the demolition drive in DLF phase 2, the enforcement team also sealed two houses in Suncity colony on Golf Course Road and recommended that a criminal case be registered against owners for not adhering to rules and violating the approved building plan. Bhath said one of the building violated construction rules and in the other building, construction was carried out after obtaining the occupancy certificate (OC).The enforcement team also sealed three shops in Suncity commercial complex for not complying with the directions issued by department with regard to encroachment of the common area. “The shop owners and all other stakeholders will have to ensure that norms are followed. We will not allow violations of building plans and misuse of residential plots for commercial purposes,” said Bhath. The enforcement team included assistant town planner Ashish Sharma and junior engineers, Akash Kumar and Ankur Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dtcp-carried-out-demolition-drive-in-dlf-phase-2/story-BucEi7YztCCnno2J56PHCK.html
16-11-2020||Gurugram||Crackers burst extensively in condos as well as villages, shows data||Areas around Teri Gram, sectors 67, 32, 30, and 44 witnessed the highest surge in pollution levels after Diwali, an analysis of the 24-hour average air quality data obtained from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram’s air lab shows.The air lab measures 24-hour average AQI data from 3pm to 3pm the following day.Until Saturday afternoon on Diwali, the average air quality index (AQI) of the monitor at Teri Gram was 169 (‘moderate’). However, this deteriorated to 405 (‘severe’) the following day, the worst in the city. Similarly, in Sector 67, the average AQI on Saturday was 159, which jumped to 360 on Sunday.Although the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had last week imposed a blanket ban on firecrackers across the National Capital Region (NCR) till November 30, residents living near the two air quality monitors said that cracker bursting went unchecked.“Despite areas around Teri Gram being lush green due to the Aravallis, there is a cluster of five villages located in close proximity. Throughout Diwali night, firecrackers were continuously burst in these five villages, completely unchecked. When residents woke up on Sunday morning, there was a thick cloud of black smoke all around. Only after heavy winds and a slight drizzle in the afternoon did the situation improve and the air became breathable,” said Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmentalist who resides in a condominium in Gwal Pahari, next to Teri Gram.Karam Singh, a resident of Gwal Pahari village, said, “Although there was a general awareness among villagers about the NGT order, there was continuous bursting of firecrackers throughout the night. I had to visit family members in nearby villages due to an emergency and the situation was the same there too. There was no presence of police or government official to control the situation.”Aditya Singh, joint secretary of Tulip Violet in Sector 69, said that bursting of firecrackers could be heard at regular intervals from nearby areas from 7 pm-10pm on Saturday. “Bursting of firecrackers could be heard from residential areas and villages nearby, especially during a three-hour period on Diwali evening, where the occurrence took place in regular intervals. Bursting of firecrackers continued even later in the night but these were sporadic. We suspect the bursting of firecrackers could be the main cause for the sudden surge in AQI,” said Singh. To check the directions of NGT, around 1,600 police personnel were deployed to check sales as well as use of firecrackers. In total, 104 people were penalised for these violations while around 350 were let off with a warning on Diwali, as they claimed to be unaware of the NGT order.“Around 40 special teams, including crime branch officials, kept a check on firecracker violations. Leading up to Diwali, the teams also initiated various awareness drives in residential areas to inform people about the NGT order. Overall, we were able to keep a strong vigil on Diwali and will continue to do so, whenever such future directions are received,” said KK Rao, commissioner, Gurugram Police.Rao said that firecrackers were also extensively burst inside townships, gated societies and condominiums, prompting police intervention.Dhruv Bansal, the official spokesperson for Gurgaon Citizens Council, an umbrella body of residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) said, “Bursting of firecrackers was common throughout the city, even in highly urbanised areas, where the awareness of the NGT order was largely prevalent. Instances of bursting of firecrackers were also found in the townships of DLF Phases 1 and 2, which resulted in the local RWA taking up the matter with the residents concerned and cautioning them that a repeat of the violations could lead to a police complaint.” MCG officials said that they will be sharing the pollution data with the departments concerned for future preparedness. “The rationale behind opening the air lab was to monitor varying AQI across the city on highly polluted days, such as Diwali. The data garnered over the two days is extremely important as the same would be shared across various departments in the city to accordingly analyse and create future preparations and combating plans for Diwali next year,” said Chahat Sanghvi, consultant to the MCG commissioner, who is also supervising the MCG’s air lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/crackers-burst-extensively-in-condos-as-well-as-villages-shows-data/story-XzZcitjnT6ba9zIoQPEZoL.html
16-11-2020||Gurugram||Air quality improves to ‘poor’ as winds push away pollutants||The air quality in the city improved on Monday, with Gurugram recording an air quality index (AQI) of 246 (‘poor’), an improvement from the AQI of 425 (‘severe’) on Sunday, as per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily bulletin. Experts attributed the improvement to high-speed winds and rain on Sunday. On Monday, however, Gurugram was the most polluted city in the National Capital Region (NCR), even as the AQI in neighbouring Delhi, Noida, and Ghaziabad stayed in the same category. Gurugram’s AQI had plunged into the ‘severe’ zone of the CPCB’s AQI on Sunday, a day after Diwali, on account of extensive cracker bursting across the city. The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 574.35 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Monday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11, almost at 10 times the permissible limit of 60 µg/m³. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to remain in the ‘moderate’ category on Tuesday. The air quality is expected to deteriorate marginally and remain in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category on Wednesday. Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, said that the AQI is expected to deteriorate later this week due to a fall in temperature. “In the morning hours, we will once again see a peak in the level of pollutants due to thermal inversion as cold winds bring down the temperature. The mixing height will also come down,” said Panwar. On Monday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 24.5 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature was 13.9 degrees Celsius. Both the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover in a similar range on Tuesday. As per the weekly IMD forecast, clear skies will prevail on Tuesday. Navdeep Dahiya, a Rohtak-based meteorologist, said that temperature is expected to drop by several degrees between November 18-20. “The temperature has already started falling post the passage of the western disturbance. North-westerly winds from the snow-clad mountains will further bring down the temperatures in the coming days,” said Dahiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-improves-to-poor-as-winds-push-away-pollutants/story-JM5ifWhnwKIvHhrYjK4alI.html
16-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram prepares to conduct 6,000 daily Covid-19 tests||The state health department is now preparing to conduct 6,000 daily tests in Gurugram by the end of the month, said officials privy to the matter. The development comes amid concerns that the district is ‘undertesting’ for Covid-19, even as new infections emerge at a faster rate than ever before.At present, the district is conducting 4,000 daily tests, which, officials and experts both agree, is an insufficient number. “At the current stage, given Gurugram’s increasing positivity rate, we definitely need to conduct more tests. We are preparing to conduct 6,000 daily tests in the district soon, starting with an additional 1,000 or so tests this week,” said Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary (health), Haryana government.In fact, despite a recent increase in testing (from 3,000 to 4,000 samples per day), the district’s test positivity rate (TPR) — or the ratio of positive cases to samples tested — has not dipped. On the contrary, health department data shows that Gurugram’s TPR has been rising by two to three percent every week for at least the past five weeks.For example, Gururgam tested 21,584 samples for Covid-19 between November 1 and November 7. Of these, 15 percent (or 3,251 samples) came back positive for coronavirus infection. The following week saw a slight increase in the number of tests, with the health department testing 23,035 samples for Covid-19 between November 8 and November 14. Of these, 18 percent (or 4,130 samples) came back positive. The positivity rate has been trending upward since at least mid-October, department data shows. Even between October 25 and 31, for example, the district tested 18,936 samples for Covid-19, with a positivity of 12.5 percent. This continuing upward trend elicited concern from experts, who strongly advised that citizens should continue to maintain social distancing. “This trend is the opposite of what one would like to see. If the TPR is rising even with an increase in tests, it means that we are not keeping up with the spread of the virus. A TPR of 18 percent is quite high, and if there is still an upward trend then it is not a good sign,” cautioned Dr Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former head of the department of community medicine, PGIMER, Chandigarh.Kumar also added that winter conditions are likely to get more severe in the coming weeks. “Failing to reign in the spread of Covid-19 now will mean more people will fall sick at the peak of winter. While mortality may not go up the way it did during the summer, thanks to six months of clinical experience with patients, it can still put a lot of strain on the healthcare system. To stay in control of the situation we need to start testing and isolating more people soon,” he added. State health department officials said they are monitoring the situation closely. As stringent lockdown restrictions, including curbs on public mobility, have been lifted, the health department agreed that expanding testing is the most appropriate way to stem the growth of new infections.Addressing concerns of undertesting, Arora said, “There is no dearth of resources. We are pushing up the numbers in response to the situation. The use of rapid antigen kits has slowed, but we are also going to supply Gurugram with more of them, which will be used in market places and crowded economic zones in the next few days.”Arora, as well as authorities at the district level, also said that Gurugram’s testing strategy may be further narrowed as new infections balloon. “Even if the TPR reduces, the actual number of daily new infections will take some time to come down. We were already prioritising tests for the elderly and patients with co-morbidities, but going forward we have to really look out for the most vulnerable people in the most high-risk areas,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-prepares-to-conduct-6-000-daily-covid-19-tests/story-TH8ksz7Y9lwluETyPvk2PL.html
16-11-2020||City||Potholes turn deadly as Ludhiana MC fails to act; residents seek compensation for injured||With municipal corporation (MC) turning a blind eye towards the issue, the potholed roads have turned into a nightmare for the residents as they are leading to accidents regularly. The apathy of MC had landed a girl in the ICU recently. A girl suffered a head injury after she lost balance while riding a two-wheeler on the Model Town - Jawaddi road on November 9. Raising hue and cry over the issue, the area residents rued that they have been complaining about the pothole situation for around three months but the civic body had failed to take any action. The residents also sought compensation for the injured as it was the responsibility of MC to get the roads repaired.A resident of Model Town area and social activist Jaskirat Singh, who had come to the rescue of the girl, said, “I have been complaining about the pothole situation to the MC officials since August. Even after the girl suffered a serious injury to her head on November 9, the MC officials filled the pothole with sand and rubble rather than repairing it properly.” “The sand went off due to heavy rainfall on Sunday evening and, another accident took place on the same spot-on Monday. A person riding a two-wheeler lost balance and fell. It was fortunate that he did not suffer any serious injury,” he added.“As the officials and the area councillor failed to respond, I took up the issue on social media on Monday, which woke the officials from their deep slumber and, they reached the spot. Even now, the pothole has not been repaired with hot mix material. Sand has been poured on the area by placing interlocking tiles. The MC should give compensation to those suffering injuries due to their apathy,” said Singh.Deep potholes can also be seen on different roads of the city including, Haibowal, Dugri, Civil Lines, Ferozepur road, Model Town extension, Field Ganj, Brown road, Focal Point, and Dhandari.Baljeet Singh, a resident of Dugri, said, “Even if the civic body gets the repair work done, it does not stand for more than a week. The MC should keep a check on the quality of the material and should announce compensation for the injured. The civic body had also repaired the main Dugri road after a lot of accidents took place there and, the shopkeepers staged a protest against the civic body.” Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The repair work has been going on in the city for over a month and, major roads have been repaired. The work might have been hit due to the rainfall witnessed in the city on Sunday. I will direct the staff to immediately repair the main roads so that no accident takes place.”Despite attempts made to reach MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, he was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/potholes-turn-deadly-as-ludhiana-mc-fails-to-act-residents-seek-compensation-for-injured/story-V81yG6Gr4tAZy8mXDI54TN.html

16-11-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Migrants stranded ahead of Chhath Puja as train services yet to resume in Punjab||Labourers from states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh who planned to go back to their native places to celebrate Chhath Puja are in a fix as train service in the state have not resumed yet due to ongoing farmers’ protest against the agriculture bills. Labourers’ unions have appealed to railway officials to restart the service so they can return to their homes to celebrate with their families.With three days left for Chhath Puja, there is almost no chance of train services resuming in time. The railways have already cancelled 23 festival special trains in Punjab.Manoj Gupta, a resident of Bihar’s Begusarai, said due to trains not plying in the state, he could not go back to vote. But, he was hopeful that the service would resume as talks between farmers and the government were on, but to no avail.He also appealed to the government and farmers’ unions to resolve the matter at the earliest so that the people do not suffer anymore.Interstate bus service are operational, but labourers are not opting for it due to high cost. Another labourer, Pankaj Yadav, said that a bus ticket to Bihar will cost between Rs 3,000 to 4,000. As he lives in Ludhiana with his wife and three children, he has to shell out at least Rs 15,000 to reach Bihar, while a train ticket costs between Rs 600 to Rs 700 per person.The protest is also causing loss of revenue for railways. Over three lakh labourers from industrial cities return to their native places every year on Chhath Puja.RK Yadav, general secretary of Samajwadi Party, Punjab, said the festival is celebrated every year in Bihar and some parts of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Labourers used to go to their native places to perform Pooja every year, but they are forced to stay back in the city this time.According to a spokesperson of the railways, 23 festival special trains have been cancelled due to the ongoing farmers’ protest in Punjab. Also, 18 special trains have been cancelled temporarily . Routes of two trains have also been changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-migrants-stranded-ahead-of-chhath-puja-as-train-services-yet-to-resume-in-punjab/story-npZaGcbsm8Lp8TLwjuB6NO.html
16-11-2020||Chandigarh||Few students turn up as colleges reopen in Ludhiana||Few students turned up to colleges in the city on Monday as classes resumed for the first time in eight months after the Covid lockdown was imposed in March. The colleges authorities expect better attendance in the coming days.The Punjab government has allowed colleges and universities to reopen from Monday with Covid-19 safety guidelines in place. On an average, colleges in the city had an attendance of 40 to 50 students. According to principals, as it was the first day, few students turned up. Also, the rainfall in the city on Sunday evening and ‘Bhai Dooj’ on Monday were also contributing factors to the low attendance. Teachers took classes in-person and online simultaneously. The colleges have taken all safety precautions as per government guidelines. Thermal screening was conducted at the main gates and hand sanitisers were placed outside classrooms. Due to few students attending, the colleges called off offline classes after half day.Charanjit Singh, a student of SCD Government College, said he was waiting for college to restart as some concepts can be cleared by interacting with teachers in person. He added that he is carrying his own hand sanitiser and wearing a mask as precautionary measures.Dharam Singh Sandhu, principal at SCD Government College, said that the college is prepared for classes to resume and students are following all guidelines.

16-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s death toll climbs to 250 with two fatalities, 82 test positive||As many as 82 new Covid-19 cases surfaced in Chandigarh on Monday, even as two people lost the battle to the virus. With this, the case tally has risen to 15,866, while the death toll has reached 250.The deceased were both males, aged 56 and 50 and residents of Ram Darbar and Mauli Jagran, respectively.On the bright side, 116 patients recovered on Monday, increasing the recoveries to 14,584.104 test positive in MohaliIn Mohali, 104 residents were found infected and one person succumbed to the virus, taking the toll to 255. Among the 13,678 cases now, 1,046 patients are still recovering, while 12,377 have been cured. These included 57 patients who recovered on Tuesday.The fresh infections included 86 from Mohali (urban), 11 from Dhakoli, six from Gharuan and one from Kharar. Panchkula reports two deaths after 11 daysPanchkula witnessed two Covid casualties after no deaths for 11 days, pushing the total fatalities to 119.The two deceased – a 27-year-old man from Pinjore and a 69-year-old man from Industrial Area – were both suffering from diabetes. It was on November 5 last when one resident had died due to the virus.Also, 53 new cases were reported. These included Dr Usha Gupta, the director health services of Haryana and in-charge of Covid-19, and her husband, who is an IAS officer. Of the 7,939 cases in the district, 432 are active, while 7,388 patients have been discharged. ‘Next few weeks crucial’Even though the cases have been rising over the two weeks, experts said it was too early to term it a second wave.“In September, when the first peak was reached, almost 450 cases were reported in Chandigarh in a day. But, now the daily number is not more than 120. The next three to four weeks will be crucial,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER, Chandigarh.Mohali’s district nodal officer Dr Harmandeep Kaur Brar said it could not be termed a second surge in Mohali for now, as the cases were still low. “We have to see how the cases surface over the next few weeks,” she added. “During the last three-four days, less sampling was done because of Diwali, so that may be why the number of new positive cases in Panchkula is low. We may see a spike from Tuesday onwards as normal testing resumes,” said Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula district. Alerting residents to exercise caution, she said in winter, cases of viral and respiratory tract infections increase, so the second wave will be more severe, leading to higher number of cases and deaths.Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajiv Narwal said they had started screening employees of government offices. “On Monday, 80 employees from the office of the deputy commissioner of police and 28 from the office of director, general health services, Haryana, were tested. Their reports will be out on Tuesday,” he added.Incoming passengers at ISBT to be tested for freeThe UT health department will depute a mobile testing team at the Inter-State Bus Terminal in Sector 17 for voluntary testing of all passengers deboarding there.“Since Covid is spreading fast in Delhi and several other states, health department teams will be deputed for incoming travellers willing to get tested. To help keep the cases in Chandigarh low, travellers are advised to get tested via the mobile team at the bus stand or at GMSH, Sector 16, and thereafter, isolate themselves for 10 days,” said Dr Amandeep Kang, director, health services and family welfare, Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-death-toll-climbs-to-250-with-two-fatalities-82-test-positive/story-jtCpyP9CE4PO6Mq93V9nyO.html
16-11-2020||Patna||Nitish says he’ll miss Sushil Modi, points to BJP for answers||Does the BJP’s decision to appoint Tarkishore Prasad, four time BJP MLA from Katihar, as leader of BJP legislature party in place of Sushil Kumar Modi left the former deputy CM sulking? Modi maintained a stoic silence at the swearing-in ceremony of the new NDA cabinet. He walked into the hall, greeted the newly-elected ministers and quietly sat down. After the swearing-in ceremony, he quietly walked for a high tea and refused to open his mouth before the media. He sat with a group of legislators but did not go to the enclosure where chief minister Nitish Kumar, Union home minister Amit Shah or BJP national president J P Nadda were sitting. After some time, he quietly walked off. The BJP’s high command’s decision to replace him with a new face may have come as a surprise to several party leaders and also to BJP’s alliance partner, the JD(U).“I think that the people of Bihar have given their approval for the continuation of Nitish Kumar and Sushil Kumar Modi,” said state president Bashistha Narain Singh. But, if BJP leaders are to be believed, Sushil Kumar Modi is in for some role at the centre. “Sushil Modi Ji is not at all upset. He is an asset to us. Party will think about him, a new responsibility will be given to him,” said former Maharashtra chief minister and Bihar in-charge Devendra Fadnavis.Party sources said that Modi was one of the few leaders to receive Shah at Patna airport when he came to attend the swearing-in. Also Read: In 2-line tweet, Prashant Kishor throws many punches at ex-boss Nitish KumarEven CM Kumar said that he would be missing Modi as they enjoyed a very good rapport. Modi served as deputy CM for 11 years under Nitish Kumar.“Yes,” said Kumar, on being asked if he will be missing Sushil Modi. “It is the decision of the BJP not to field Sushil Modi as the deputy chief minister. They should be asked about this,” he said after the swearing in.While Modi being overlooked for the post of deputy CM has become the talking point, a group of BJP leaders tried to assuage the hurt sentiment of the leader. Union minister Giriraj Singh put out a tweet for Sushil Kumar Modi and said, “Respected Sushil ji, you are the leader, you had the post of deputy chief minister, you will continue to remain the leader of BJP in the future as well, nobody’s status is determined by the post he holds,” Singh tweeted in Hindi in response to Modi’s tweet on Monday that “No one can take away the post of a party worker.” Also Read: ‘Only Congress can keep nation united’: Gehlot attacks Sibal, takes Congress versus Congress a notch higherSources close to Modi, on conditions of anonymity, said that he himself proposed the name of Tarkishore Prasad and opted out from the race of deputy chief ministership after seeing a lot of “dissension and to ensure that no ugly scene is created in the party following a commendable performance.”A BJP MLA present at the NDA meeting said, “As soon he proposed the name of Tarkishore Prasad, we immediately realised that something is wrong. He thanked everybody as if giving a farewell speech,” said a BJP MLA.Party sources said that there could be many reasons and one of could be that the party wanted to go for a generational shift and secondly, because Modi was the lone BJP leader who had been openly attacking Paswan, dismissing LJP’s existence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/nitish-says-he-ll-miss-sushil-modi-points-to-bjp-for-answers/story-nxtNjupSgDJSVgM6HVbtuI.html

He was first taken to the nearest hospital and then referred to Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital, where he died.Also Read: 25-year-old killed, several injured in Kanpur clashHis death caused tension and the people from the two communities fought a pitched battle and resorted to heavy brick-batting. Two people were hurt in the violence, according to the police, but the locals said the number of those injured was more than 15.Later, the police arrested Mohd Mohsin, Sarfaraz Alam, Meraj and Anjum. They were charged with murder and violence in the FIR. One more person identified as Lal was also arrested by the Chakeri police. Lal is brother of a criminal Raja Bookie. In other developments, Jajmau police post incharge Anurag Singh and constable Rajveer were removed. Constables with the UP 112 emergency response service would face an inquiry.But locals became enraged after the autopsy was completed and the body was handed over to the family members. They took the body to Wazidpur where they put up a road block, accusing the police of being soft on the accused.They alleged that though prompt information was given, the police did not make proper arrangements and allowed the people to assemble in a surcharged atmosphere. “The situation is now under control,” the SP East added, according to ANI.The news agency PTI reported that police personnel, including the Provincial Armed Constabulary, have been deployed in large numbers to keep a tab on the situation.Senior state cabinet minister Satish Mahana met the family members of the victim and assured them of strict action against troublemakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/murder-leads-to-communal-tension-in-kanpur-area-4-arrested/story-NKaAWa8M87Bkbt0Fnv2vjO.html
16-11-2020||City||Colleges, varsities in Mohali to remain closed for now||Even as the Punjab government allowed reopening of colleges and universities from Monday, those in Mohali have decided against resuming classes for now. The government had allowed the educational institutions to take a call on their own after securing undertakings from students’ parents regarding adherence to the Covid-19 safety protocols. But, none of the private or government colleges opened on Monday, while stating that it may be another month before they resume normal operations, as a sizeable number of students lived out of the city. Chandigarh University’s chancellor Satnam Singh Sandhu said, “Almost 60% of our students belong to states other than Punjab. While we have yet to get their parents’ undertaking, it is also a cumbersome and expensive process to sanitise the entire premises. Besides, students are also not keen on resuming physical classes. So, we have decided against reopening the university for some more time.” However, PhD scholars were already visiting the campus for research, he added. “Students are comfortable with online classes. For clearing their doubts, they can always visit the campus as and when required. Even in hostels, it is not financially viable to house one student per room,” said Anshu Kataria, president, Punjab Unaided Colleges Association (PUCA) and chairman, Aryans Group of Colleges.Similarly, the media in-charge of Government College, Phase 6, Ghansham Singh Bhullar said, “Neither the students are keen nor their parents have agreed to them attending classes in person. Therefore, we will continue the online classes for now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/colleges-varsities-in-mohali-to-remain-closed-for-now/story-XDoVavNherbxNLCOaV5I6N.html

16-11-2020||Kolkata||Bihar battle won, BJP turns focus to Bengal, vows to transform it into Gujarat||With Bihar elections getting over and the festive season coming to an end, the Bharatiya Janata Party is now shifting its entire focus to West Bengal, diving headlong into the poll campaign for the crucial 2021 assembly polls. While on one hand, the BJP has made a series of organisational changes with an eye on the polls over the past few weeks, on the other, party’s top guns are visiting the state one after another to take stock of the battle preparations as the polls are drawing nearer. Leaders of the saffron party’s Bengal unit are also gradually upping the ante against the ruling Trinamool Congress and are promising to intensify the poll campaign further in the coming days with sharper attacks on the ruling party. BJP’s IT cell chief, Amit Malviya, who has been recently appointed as the co-incharge of West Bengal, arrived in the state on Monday. Party leaders saw Malviya’s appointment as a thrust by the BJP’s top leadership on the battle on social media in the run up to the Bengal polls. BL Santosh, BJP’s national general secretary (organization), is also arriving on Tuesday and a series of party meets are scheduled. “For the last two to three elections fought in Bengal, Malviya has managed the social media and IT strategies of the party. He is well aware of the issues in Bengal. His arrival would further strengthen the IT wing of the party’s state unit. Santosh is also arriving to hold some meetings,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of the BJP’s state unit. Earlier in November, Union home minister Amit Shah was on a two-day visit to Bengal to take stock of the party’s organisational preparedness. Shah’s Bengal visit also helped to assuage strained nerves in the party’s state unit. It was only after Shah’s visit that the BJP released the list of its district youth leaders. On Monday, the BJP upped its ante against the TMC as Ghosh, while speaking to the media, said that the BJP aims to transform Bengal into Gujarat. “Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee sometimes says that efforts are to transform Bengal into Gujarat. I would say this is 100% true. We would turn Bengal into Gujarat. Now people from Bengal need to migrate to Gujarat to get jobs. In the coming years, people will not have to go to Gujarat. They will get jobs in Bengal,” said Ghosh. Also Read: Ahead of assembly polls, tasks cut out for BJP’s national team, friction in Kerala, Bengal Leaders of the ruling TMC have criticised the BJP saying the words Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh invoke pictures of police encounters. “The problem with Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh is police encounters. Around 2000 people have been murdered in Gujarat. Several people like Ishrat Jahan have been killed in encounters. So we don’t want Bengal to be turned into Gujarat. Tata’s Nano car manufacturing factory has also closed down in Gujarat,” said Firhad Hakim, state minister and TMC leader. Strong supervision by the BJP’s central leadership is being viewed by state office-bearers as a measure to stop internal rumblings and to iron out differences between leaders who earlier worked for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and those who joined the BJP in recent years, leaving the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). Although the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, party leaders said the assembly polls would not be a cakewalk, especially in the 15 south Bengal districts, where most of the assembly segments are located. Under instructions from Shah, the party is now strengthening the organisation right down to the polling booth level in south Bengal districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bihar-battle-won-bjp-turns-focus-to-bengal-vows-to-transform-it-into-gujarat/story-P7qv6pVowpng7LGEHZbV3K.html

Buildings were being sanitised and staff tested for Covid-19.According to the Khalsa college principal, Dr Mehal Singh, “the college was reopened for exit classes in the first phase, but just 15% students showed up. Since it was raining today (Monday) and the students were still confused about reopening dates not many of them attended classes. However, it will take nearly eight to 10 days for the situation to normalise,” he added. Students took precautionary measures and wearing of masks was mandatory. “College staff was also tested for Covid-19 last week and the buildings are being sanitised regularly,” Dr Singh added. According to information from Saroop Rani Government College in the city, nearly 15% to 20% students attended classes. In Jalandhar, Doaba College remained open while Saint Soldier, Khalsa and others were closed due to the Bhai Dooj festival. A Lovely Professional University spokesperson said the authorities had decided to resume classes from the next semester.

Safeena Baig also denied that Muzaffar Baig is contesting the District Development Council polls from Baramulla. “These are rumours spread by some people with vested interests who have lost their minds.

There is a pressure from people of Sangrama. I am not sure whether I will contest but there is lot of pressure from workers and the common people.”Safeena Baig said that Mehbooba Mufti had offered her three seats - Baramulla, Sangrama and Narwav. “I pity those people who think that DDC seat is an issue. I have worked hard for this party for years.”However, PDP leaders who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Muzaffar Hussain Baig was not happy that his wife was denied a ticket from the Sangrama block in Baramulla, a seat reserved for women. The seat has been allotted to a National Conference (NC) candidate. Muzaffar Hussain Baig , a former member of Parliament from the Baramulla Lok Sabha seat, has stayed away from active politics since the Centre’s move on August 5, 2019, to nullify Article 370, which accorded special status to the state of J&K, and bifurcate it into two Union territories – J&K with a legislative assembly and Ladakh without one. Sources said that denial of ticket in the DDC polls could have meant a loss of political fortune for Muzaffar Hussain Baig and his wife. On Sunday night, the PDP dissolved the party unit in Sangrama constituency. On Sunday, PDP general secretary Ghulam Nabi Hanjoora termed Muzaffar Hussain Baig’s resignation as self-serving as he reportedly resigned over seat-sharing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-pdp-leader-muzaffar-baig-will-reveal-future-plans-later-ddc-polls-not-an-issue-safeena-baig/story-z3FOktkrydiL7vYa3KUJqO.html

A total of 1,35,023 pilgrims visited Kedarnath, while 8,000 devotees turned up for darshan at Yamunotri during this season which had a delayed and restricted opening for due to the Covid-19 pandemic in July this year, Devasthanam Board official Harish Gaud said.Goddess Yamuna’s Utsav Doli was taken after the closure of the Yamunotri Temple gates for Kharsali where she will be worshipped during winters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/kedarnath-yamunotri-temples-close-for-winters-amid-heavy-snowfall/story-dk9XxBSXdwfcx8Qsw8u4BP.html
16-11-2020||Delhi||As Delhi pollution spikes, AAP launches 2nd phase of ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday launched the second phase of ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign in the national capital.“We successfully asked people to switch off cars at red lights. 15 days of first phase have gone well. Now we are launching second phase,” said Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.Environment minister Gopal Rai was also present on the occasion. He thanked the people of Delhi for contributing and playing their part in switching their vehicles off on the traffic signals to combat pollution.Rai had said that to control pollution levels in Delhi, Kejriwal had launched the ‘Yuddh, Pradushan Ke Viruddh’ campaign. “Under the campaign, various initiatives have been started to combat several internal sources of pollution in Delhi, and on-ground actions have been taken,” he added.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had launched the campaign on October 21,saying that even if 10 lakh vehicles in the city join the campaign, the PM10 levels would fall by 1.5 tonnes and PM2.5 by 0.4 tonnes in a year.“The campaign was to continue till November 15. However, the Delhi government has decided to extend it till November 30 considering the pollution situation,” Rai had said during a press conference.“It will be called Phase 2 of the campaign,” he added.Like earlier, this phase will also aim to make people aware to switch their vehicles off on traffic signals, and around 2500 marshals will be deputed on the 100 junctions in 11 districts for the effective implementation of the campaign. Around 20 environmental marshals, each will be deputed on 10 major junctions. The joint monitoring system of the ACP, SDM, and Traffic Police will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-delhi-pollution-spikes-aap-launches-2nd-phase-of-red-light-on-gaadi-off-campaign/story-JylSo3eoSc9by0JbrbevKM.html

16-11-2020||Delhi||No lockdown in Delhi even as Covid-19 cases go up, says Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain||A day after the meeting with union home minister Amit Shah to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi, the city’s health minister has stated that there will be no lockdown. “There will be no reimposition of lockdown in Delhi. I don’t think it will be an effective step now; wearing of masks will be more beneficial,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain to ANI. He added that Delhi has crossed the peak of the third wave of infections. The number of Covid-19 cases started soaring about three weeks ago, with the highest number of cases so far—8,593—being recorded on November 11. Delhi reported 3,235 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Diwali as per Sunday’s health bulletin. Experts, however, have warned that this decline could be because of fewer people getting tested closer to the festive season and the numbers might go up again. Also Read: Covid-19: 75 paramilitary doctors, 350 paramedics head to Delhi after Amit Shah’s meeting“There was a dip in numbers, but it is too soon to say whether the number of infections has peaked. In fact, I think that it isn’t even true decline. With Diwali, fewer people might have gotten tested. We are likely to see more cases on Monday again,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director, department of pulmonology and sleep disorders at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh. Adding to the worries are Delhi’s pollution levels that usually go up during winter and the dip in temperature, both of which can result in more infections and severe disease.A committee headed by Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul had said Delhi might see as many as 15,000 cases a day in the winter. In the meeting with the union home minister Amit Shah, it was decided that the number of tests will be increased to about 100,000 a day, with assistance from the centre. Currently, the city tests about 60,000 samples a day. There will also be an increase in the number of ICU beds in the army-run facility at Dhaula Kuan, the number of oxygen beds at the 10,000-bed Covid Care Centre at Chhatarpur, and doctors from paramilitary forces will be flown in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-lockdown-in-delhi-even-as-covid-19-cases-go-up-says-delhi-health-minister-satyendar-jain/story-Vc1jdf9VP7FevclfZJ6aXO.html

16-11-2020||City||Tripura engineer generates power from wet clothes, receives innovation award||An engineer from Tripura has developed a technology to generate power from wet clothes that can be used to charge mobile phones or to use medical diagnostic devices.This innovation won him the Gandhian Young Technological Innovation ( GYTI) award this November; it was presented by Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan. Shankha Subhra Das, from Khedabari in Sepahijala district of Tripura, used a cloth cut to a particular size and inserted it in a plastic straw to fix in a half-filled water container. He attached copper electrodes to both ends of the straw. “The water is transported to the top after some time, due to capillary action, and around 700 millivolts are registered in the voltmeter,” Das said. To increase power, Das and his team connected a series of 30-40 such devices. According to Das, this generates 12 volts, enough to charge mobile phones, microchip, mini gadget, medical diagnostic kits and even light a small LED bulb. “This is part of a funded research project wherein we have explored the scope of powering medical diagnostic devices that can be used in remote places. We have found cloth-based devices useful for our project. Our challenge was to eliminate external pumping input for water flow,” Das said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tripura-engineer-generates-power-from-wet-clothes-receives-innovation-award/story-pmjarMi1JPKUZXEN2NtjwO.html

Chhat Puja, observed mainly by the people of Bihar, Jharkhand and bordering areas in Uttar Pradesh, will be celebrated on November 20.“Chhath Puja in water bodies including public ponds, lakes, rivers, dams, reservoirs shall not be permitted in view of Covid-19 pandemic,” said a notice issued by the government.As part of this puja, devotees congregate on the banks of water bodies, take a holy dip and perform a few rituals, all standing inside the water. “Due to the fixed timing of performing the aforementioned rituals, it is not possible to ensure social distancing,” the notice read.“The ritual of holy bathing in common waters is a matter of serious concern,” the notice pointed out, adding that it would increase the chances of spreading of Covid-19 and contaminate the water. “It is important to strike a balance between permitting religious activities and ensuring that checks and balances are in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” it further read.Kolkata and New Delhi governments have also imposed restrictions on the celebrations this year.India on Monday recorded 30,548 fresh Covid-19 cases. The total number of people infected with the disease has gone up to 8,845,127 while 130,070 people have died so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/no-chhath-puja-celebration-near-water-bodies-in-jharkhand/story-XJV5nG072SE3XgrrVPjc5L.html

According to two officials present at the meeting on Sunday, Niti Aayog’s Dr VK Paul described the Delhi situation as “unprecedented” and added that “it is likely to become worse”. He said Delhi’s containment strategy has gone haywire and contact tracing must be followed up with mandatory home isolation. Also Read: Steep decline in daily Covid-19 numbers; recovery rate above 93%On Monday, the three top officials will sit together to rework Delhi’s containment strategy. Delhi has over 80 containment zones and there is a distinct possibility that more areas may be brought into containment zones. Officials also revealed that the issue of reimposition of some lockdown provisions in the capital was raised but no further discussion took place. Paul’s presentation pointed out that Delhi’s positivity rate has increased from 5% in July to 14% now. Paul also advised officials that they should not count the data for the last two days as there would have been lesser tests anyway due to Diwali. He pointed out that in July- August, the death rate was 10 per day and now it is over 100 daily. He said the case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.5% would increase. According to the presentation, on November 11, Delhi registered 361 per million cases, the highest ever anywhere in India, surpassing the worst of Mumbai (140 per million) and Chennai’s 214 per million. He said that Delhi must substantially increase ICU facilities, double the daily testing rate, and augment home care facilities as a large number of people are in home care.He said more doctors and nurses need to be mobilised and that retired doctors and nurses, and senior and junior residents must be tapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-home-secretary-to-chair-meeting-to-rework-delhi-s-containment-strategy-today/story-hAWghohvVbizqhtInpRKMJ.html
16-11-2020||Delhi||Noise pollution up from last year||In at least three of six residential localities surveyed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), noise levels on Diwali night were higher compared to 2019, data shows. The CPCB surveyed five residential colonies and one industrial area — Lajpat Nagar, Mayur Vihar Phase-2, Pitampura, Kamla Nagar, Janakpuri and Okhla — for noise levels on Diwali night. Of these, the noise levels this year were higher compared to 2019 in three areas. Data shows that in between 6pm and midnight, Lajpat Nagar recorded 71 decibels of noise levels as against 69dB (A) recorded last year, in Mayur Vihar Phase-2 the levels rose to 72dB (A) from 68dB (A) recorded last year. Similar trends were seen in Janakpuri, where on Saturday night 72dB (A) noise levels were recorded, while in 2019, 71dB (A) noise levels were recorded on Diwali night. The noise standards for residential areas are 55 dB (A) during the day and 45 dB (A) at night. The industrial area standards are 75 dB (A) during the day and 70 dB (A) at night time. The CPCB report said the pollution monitoring body had monitored pre-Diwali noise levels on November 9, to get a sense of the contribution of firecrackers. Since 2016, on a regular day, the ambient levels in five of these six localities, noise levels had reduced or remained unchanged. “Pre-Diwali day values are only indicative when background noise making activities, such as fire crackers, are not affecting ambient noise level,” the CPCB report read. A senior official of the CPCB explained that while green crackers were allowed in Delhi last Diwali, there was a complete ban on all kinds of crackers this year, and that the data therefore indicates that several residents did not adhere to the ban. “In ideal circumstances, the noise levels should have remained the same as that on a regular day because crackers were completely banned. This issue was foreseen because Delhi cannot be seen in isolation, even if you ban crackers in the Capital, there are means for people to easily procure crackers from towns in the National Capital Region (NCR). In the data we can see that the levels in residential areas suddenly saw a spike from 6pm, when cracker bursting started,” the official said. The body also said that they are monitoring noise level 24x7 at 10 localities across the city to assess noise pollution for a fortnight, before and after Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/noise-pollution-up-from-last-year/story-lGbfTKssox6O1srT69CpQI.html
16-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Air quality improves marginally after Sunday’s rain||Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) improved from “severe” on Sunday afternoon to “very poor” category by late evening. The AQI further improved on Monday morning, but still remained in the “very poor category. The national capital’s AQI improved to 325 on Monday morning from 395 on Sunday evening. An AQI between 401 and 500 and 301 and 400 is considered in the “very poor” and “severe” category, respectively. Severe air quality was recorded on the Diwali day, which was celebrated on Saturday (November 14), but dispersed quickly by the evening because of rainfall and thunderstorms triggered by a Western disturbance in the western Himalayan region. Also read | Diwali pollution: Delhi-NCR exhibits irresponsibility, againSome parts of Delhi had received rainfall, measuring up to 2 millimetres (mm), till at around 6.30pm on Sunday accompanied by winds blowing up to 30 kilometres per hour (kmph). The wind speed helped disperse Diwali-induced air pollution accumulated over the past two days. Favourable meteorological conditions helped improve the national capital’s AQI this year after Diwali, which was far worse during the corresponding period last year. In 2019, Diwali was celebrated on October 27. The AQI on October 27 and 28 was 337 and 368, respectively, and was in the “very poor” category. On October 29 and 30, the AQI further worsened to the “severe” category and showed 401 and 419, respectively. The Union Ministry of Earth Sciences’ (MoES) air quality early warning system has forecast that wind direction would likely to be easterly or north-easterly on Monday and wind would blow up to six kmph. “The AQI is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday. Wind speed is unlikely to pick up significantly. As a result, no major improvement in the AQI is expected,” said Vijay Soni, a scientist at India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) air quality division. Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) evaluation report on air and noise pollution levels was released on Sunday. CPCB data showed that the AQI was far higher than last year, despite a blanket ban on sale and use of firecrackers because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and pollution woes. Besides, there was no significant dip in noise pollution levels. Delhi’s average particulate matter (PM) 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations on Diwali day was 645 micrograms (mg) per cubic metres (m), 6.45 times of the national standard and 483 mg per cubic m, eight times of the national safe standard. CPCB attributed the AQI to unfavourable meteorological conditions along with an impact of raging stubble fires in neighbouring Haryana, Punjab and parts of western Uttar Pradesh. This year the surface temperature and average mixing height were recorded to be the lowest in the last five years. A lower mixing height limits vertical dispersion. The hourly average concentration of PM2.5 started increasing since 11pm on Saturday (November 14) and reached its peak in most of the weather stations at around 1am, the report added. “This year air pollution levels both during pre-Diwali and the Diwali day have been higher than last year. One of main reasons for this is the contribution of stubble fires to Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentrations on both the days. On the Diwali day, stubble fires contributed to 32% of Delhi’s PM 2.5 load and on the pre-Diwali day it was 38%. Meteorological conditions are also adverse because Diwali was in mid-November this year, when mixing height is low (mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air). The contribution of firecrackers or festivities is lower this year, as compared to 2019. Besides, pollution levels had spiked substantially last year on the Diwali day, as compared to pre-Diwali,” said a CPCB scientist on condition of anonymity.The minimum temperature in Delhi on Monday morning was 16 degrees Celsius (C) -- 2 degrees C above normal. It is likely to fall below 10 degrees C in the next two-three days, according to IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-air-quality-improves-marginally-after-sunday-s-rain/story-9879mXAsbSm24tCGIBcU6O.html
16-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A train station steeped in history||Intro: Slow life in an atmospheric railway landmarkHere’s a little survey of the National Capital Region — for one city, it turns out to be particularly embarrassing. New Delhi railway station has 16 platforms. Ghaziabad railway station has 6. Faridabad has 4. Gurugram has 3.And they say Gurugram is the Millennium City.Even so, while the station is comparatively minuscule, it is an object of historical curiosity. In a place such as Gurugram, where everything noteworthy appears to have spring up after the year 2000, this station traces its origins to the Rajputana-Malwa metre-gauge line, laid way back in 1879. Indeed, according to the Gurgaon Gazetteer, 1883, the Rajputana-Malwa State Railway was the first railway in India to be constructed following the metre-gauge standards, and the first railway to be built and operated under the government of British India. Today, the station exists like a lonely island, hardly bearing any resemblance with the hyperactive metropolis that Gurugram has become. If a foreigner were airdropped into it, she would refuse to believe that this is the only station in a sprawling city otherwise stuffed with swanky malls and high-rises. The station is so laidback that it is difficult to spot even a coolie, or porter. There are anyway only six of them—Vishnu, Ajay Tiwari, Ram Kripal, Raju, Sunil and Bhagwan Shah. Not surprisingly, time in the station moves as slowly as any lazy passenger train, though some buzz can be experienced around the bread-pakora cart on platform 2. As for Platform 1, it used to have a bookstore (the only non-academic bookshop in this part of the city) but it shut down a year ago and now sells biscuits and namkeens. A snack cart nearby, however, makes excellent green chilly pakoras.But let’s go back to Platform 2 and its own cluster of high-rises—it has quite a few trees, and among them the tallest, the densest is a most luxuriant banyan. A huge plinth is built around its trunk, which itself is so huge that more than ten people would have to hold hands to make a circle around it. Existing like a self-sustaining eco-system under the tree’s welcoming shade, this sanctuary can rival the AC of any First Class Waiting Room. Squirrels run after one another along scores of narrow, twisty sub-branches. The foliage itself is alive with bird sounds, but so leafy that you can barely spot the birds. Very often waiting passengers lie under it for a nap.In fact, the atmosphere around the tree is what city folks like us might imagine a sleepy village square to be. While the entire station remains one of those places in urbanised Gurugram where you can spot folks dressed in ethnic costumes—men in turbans and dhotis, and women in long ghagras.One of the most evocative sights in the station is found on a wall of the entrance foyer. It lists trains passing through Gurugram, and connecting it to places such as Sultanpur, Sikar, Ajmer, Bhuj and Farrukhnagar. There are actually two boards—one lists trains going towards the direction of Rewari, the other lists trains going towards Delhi. The layout resembles the pages of the railway timetable book that most train users kept at home before the internet made it museum worthy.Gazing a moment upon this wall is reason enough to treasure the small railway station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-train-station-steeped-in-history/story-a3S5HZBaJeZeIf7wb05WBK.html
16-11-2020||Delhi||Rain, strong winds help Delhi get cleaner air day after Diwali||The weather gods came to Delhi’s rescue a day after Diwali, helping the city get a breather from the incessant cracker bursting on Saturday. While Delhi’s air quality index remained in the ‘severe’ zone on Sunday, high wind speed and rain in various parts of the city helped improve the air. This improvement is expected to continue till Monday when the AQI levels are likely to come back to the ‘very poor’ zone, the weather forecast said.Senior scientists at India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that a western disturbance, which started impacting the Western Himalayas on Saturday, brought widespread and moderate rains to Delhi NCR. Delhi recorded 0.4mm rainfall till 5.30 pm (at Safdarjung observatory) on Sunday and average wind speed over the city touched 40kmph by evening.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that the wind direction blowing over Delhi changed from north-westerly to easterly, which also reduced the transport of stubble smoke from Punjab and Haryana.“At the Safdarjung observatory, the maximum temperature was recorded 29.1 degree Celsius, while the minimum temperature was 11.4 degree Celsius, which is two degrees below the season’s normal. Wind speed will remain high in Delhi and NCR throughout Sunday night, which will help in the dispersion of pollutants,” Srivastava said.IMD recordings show that the Palam observatory recorded 1.8mm rainfall, Ridge recorded 1.2mm rainfall and at Jafarpur and Najafgarh, 1mm rainfall was recorded till 6.30pm on Sunday.Unlike previous years when air pollution levels remain very high turning to “severe” category the day after Diwali, this time air pollution levels gradually reduced on the day after Diwali due to favourable meteorological conditions.For instance, in 2019, Diwali was on October 27. The air quality index (AQI) on October 27 and 28 were 337 and 368 respectively both in “very poor” category. But on October 29 and 30 air quality had deteriorated to “severe” category with AQI of 400 and 419.“Delhi escaped prolonged exposure to severe air pollution this time because of the western disturbance. It has brought rain and thundershowers to many parts of northwest India. The wind speed started picking up since Sunday morning recording over 10 kmph which led to gradual dispersal. Winds were stronger in the evening when it started raining. We expect that air pollution levels will reduce significantly tonight,” said Vijay Soni, scientist at IMD’s air quality division.The ventilation index on Sunday was approx. 10000 m2/s. The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq metres/second is considered poor.Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air.Winter chill is likely to set in over northwest India in a couple of days due to the impact of the WD. “The minimum temperature is likely to fall in the next couple of days by about 2 to 4 degree C due to cold winds from the Himalayan region,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.The western disturbance was lying over Afghanistan and neighbourhood on Sunday. Under the influence of the Western Disturbance, an induced cyclonic circulation and its interaction with lower level easterlies, widespread rainfall accompanied with thunderstorm, hailstorm and lightning was recorded over the Western Himalayan region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rain-strong-winds-help-city-get-cleaner-air-day-after-diwali/story-zd5k8MHMmGRmHJRuRii6hO.html
16-11-2020||Delhi||Pollution levels soar on Diwali as cracker ban falls flat in Delhi||Pollution levels soared in the national Capital on Saturday night and early Sunday morning as tens of thousands of people defied the ban on firecrackers, before providential winds blowing in the right direction flushed the pollutants out on Sunday, with a smattering of rain in the late afternoon and evening washing everything down. On Saturday and early Sunday, though readings from air quality sensors across the city showed a rapid rise in concentration of harmful emissions, before going on to surpass levels seen during last year’s Diwali. The average air quality index rose from 414 at 4pm on Saturday to reach 435 on Sunday, with PM2.5 and PM10 emission concentration recording a sharp spike that began at 6pm. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s emergency dashboard, concentration of PM2.5 – ultra-fine particles that can stick deep into a person’s lungs – went from 306ug/m3 at 5pm to a peak of 672 ug/m3 at 2am.The crackers just made already bad air worse. “This year air pollution levels both during pre-Diwali and Diwali day has been higher than last year. One of main reasons for this is the contribution of stubble fires to Delhi’s PM 2.5 concentrations on both days. On Diwali day, stubble fires contributed to 32% of Delhi’s PM 2.5 load and on pre-Diwali day it was 38%,” said a senior CPCB scientist on condition of anonymity. But then, the region had an unexpected stroke of luck this year, one absent during last year’s Diwali, when pollutants from the farm fires and from firecrackers enveloped the city in a noxious shroud. A senior official from SAFAR, Union ministry of earth sciences’s air quality monitoring centre, said that even though the spike in pollution levels witnessed on Saturday was highest compared to the Diwali days, the dispersion post-Diwali was also the fastest because of high wind speed.“Looking at the dispersion of pollutants, this was the best Diwali compared to the last four years. The winds were strong and the rain also helped wash off pollutants,” said the Safar official. By late Sunday evening, the AQI was at 395, in the ‘very poor’ category.On Diwali day, the emissions trajectory was in near tandem with what was seen last year, when it began climbing around 5-6pm before peaking around 1-2am. In 2019, baseline pollution levels were lower than what they were this year, which meant the peak pollution was nine times more than before Diwali celebrations began – compared to twice as more this year. In absolute terms, however, the concentration of the ultra-fine particles was more this year than it was last year.It was around 6pm on Saturday that PM2.5 levels crossed the emergency threshold – 300ug/m3, a level where it would stay at least for the next 24 hours despite an increase in wind speeds and some rain the following day. This post-Diwali spike in pollution has been a consistent trend for the last five years and it comes at a time of the year when the air is already a mix of smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states and dust from an increasingly drying, post-monsoon ground.“Meteorological conditions are also adverse because Diwali was in mid-November this year when mixing height is low (mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air). But our understanding is that the contribution of firecrackers or festivities is lower this year compared to 2019. This is evident from the fact that pollution levels spiked substantially last year on Diwali in comparison to pre-Diwali day,” the CPCB scientist added.According to CPCB’s analysis of its three manually operated stations at ITO, Pitampura and Janakpuri, and three real time stations at Dilshad Garden, Shadipur and Dwarka, most pollution parameters were found to be higher than last year in a majority of the stations monitored both on Diwali day between 6am on Saturday to 6am on Sunday and on a pre-Diwali day on November 9 during the same period. “On Diwali day (this year), almost all the pollutants reported higher values as compared to 2019 Diwali day. Pitampura recorded increase in PM and SO2 indicating impact of firecracker bursting on Diwali day,” said the CPCB report referring to data from three manual monitoring stations. Similar trends were seen in data from automatic stations also. Noise data from six stations reveal that at three locations (Lajpat Nagar, Mayur Vihar Phase-II, Janakpuri) it increased on Diwali night this year compared to 2019, while it remained same at one (Kamla Nagar) and decreased at two (Pitampura and Okhla). Highest noise levels were recorded at Mayur Vihar Phase II and Janakpuri at 72 Leq dB(A) between 6pm and midnight.According to CPCB data, the air quality index (AQI) at 10am on Saturday was 369, but the value reached 378 at 12pm, 385 at 1pm, 396 at 2pm. By 3pm, the AQI recording had slipped into the “severe” zone, at 405.As firecracker bursting continued unabated across the national Capital, by Saturday midnight the AQI had spiked to touch 460, with air quality monitoring stations such as Jahagirpuri maxing out at 500, which is the highest possible recording on the AQI scale. Stations including Narela, Bawana, Vivek Vihar and Alipur also clocked AQI levels above 485, by 12am.With a ban ordered by the National Green Tribunal on November 9, the Delhi Police said it registered 1,206 cases on Saturday for selling and bursting firecrackers, and held 850 people for such offences.In all, the number of people booked and held for selling and bursting firecrackers on Diwali night and in the days preceding it far outnumbered similar action last year when there was a ban only on non-green firecrackers.The police said that people were also able to burst firecrackers because it was difficult for the police to act against those who were bursting them from their homes or from multi-storey buildings. “We had an active presence in the streets, but there is only so much you can do about such activities in buildings,” said another police officer.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that the firecracker bursting on Saturday showed that no ban can be implemented without the participation of public and therefore the stress should be on creating awareness among people. “Collective and cohesive framing of problems and solutions at the community level is still a work in progress.This argument by no means is pushing the onus and burden of action to individual decisions and choices and detracting attention from stronger governmental action for good governance. Governments will have to act. But this is about strengthening societal acceptance of difficult action that otherwise get slow because of lack of public support,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/pollution-levels-soar-on-diwali-as-cracker-ban-falls-flat-in-delhi/story-SrIy5PRFKjc4J9KUmMJvcM.html
16-11-2020||City||Four lives snuffed out in road mishaps in Haryana||Four persons were killed in two separate accidents that took place in Haryana, police said on Sunday. In the first case, Pankaj and Ajit Kumar from Rohtak lost their lives after the Mahindra Scorpio SUV they were travelling in crashed into a divider near Chhichhrana village in Sonepat on Saturday. A spokesperson of the Sonepat police said the accident took place when the victims were going towards Panipat from Rohtak. “We have sent their bodies for postmortem examination and launched an investigation into the matter,” he added.The second mishap occurred on the National Highway 44 near Karnal wherein two employees of a private company were killed. The deceased have been identified as Kuldeep Singh, 35, of Punjab’s Hoshiarpur and Bhim Singh, 26, from Jharkhand.The police said the victims used to work at Daruhera in Gurugram and were on their way to Himachal Pradesh. As per the police, the accident took place late on Saturday when a truck hit their canter in which they were transporting some raw material from their Daruhera plant to Una in Himachal. Investigating officer Satish Kumar said the driver of the truck managed to flee the accident spot, but a commuter provided the registration number of the vehicle with the help of which it was traced and its driver arrested under sections 279 and 304 A of the IPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-lives-snuffed-out-in-road-mishaps-in-haryana/story-dYYA9jtkLSZIfEsHFTazIP.html
16-11-2020||City||Haryana logs 46% rise in farm fires this year||Notwithstanding the Haryana government’s claims of zero farm fires this year, the state has reported 46% rise in such incidents than the last year, forcing the authorities to ban the sale and use of fire crackers in 21 districts of the state during festivals.As per the data released by the Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC), the state has this year logged 8,831 active fire locations (AFLs) so far against the last year’s total 6,630 (from September 25 to November 30).The number may go up further as the stubble burning is still going on with around 200 AFLs being reported in the state in the last 24 hours. The maximum number of farm fires has been reported in Fatehabad district (1,682), followed by 1,521 in Kaithal, 1,096 in Jind, 1,041 in Karnal, 837 Kurukshetra, 801 in Ambala, 496 in Yamunanagar, and 473 in Sirsa.Districts with a small area under paddy cultivation also reported the stubble burning incidents as 279 AFLs were witnessed in Hisar, 152 in Sonepat, 126 in Rohtak and 118 in Palwal.As of now, there is no visible impact of the central government’s decision to form a commission for action against violators causing air pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR) with hefty penalty up to ₹1 crore and jail term up to five years. The farm fires have increased despite the officials in the state agriculture department claiming that area under paddy cultivation has declined to around 11.5 lakh hectares against 12.5 lakh hectares last year, following the cash incentive scheme for diversification. The farm fires have affected the air quality of several cities, especially those falling in NCR as the bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board revealed that the air quality of Jind, Murthal, Gurugram, Fatehabad and Hisar fallen to “severe” category with the Air Quality Index (AQI) of these cities was found above 400, while Rohtak, Bahadurgarh, Sonepat, Karnal, Kurukshetra and Sirsa were in the “very poor” category on Sunday.Officials in the state agriculture department claimed that they were making all efforts by providing subsidised machines to farmers for the management of crop waste. Haryana State Pollution Control Board member secretary S Narayanan said that they were making efforts to minimise the incidents of farm fires and ground level officers of the board were working hard to make farmers aware of the harms of stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-logs-46-rise-in-farm-fires-this-year/story-XjRRfMnbfY0PJHPOSHTYNO.html
16-11-2020||Chandigarh||Appointment of non-cadre officers to cadre posts needs Centre’s approval: Khemka||Bringing up the issue of appointment of non-cadre officers on cadre posts meant for the IAS officers, senior Haryana IAS officer Ashok Khemka has written to the chief secretary to refer such cases for the consideration of the central government. The Haryana government has appointed a number of IPS, IFS and IRS officers to the cadre posts of the IAS. In a November 3 demi-official communication to the chief secretary, Khemka said that IAS cadre rules stipulated that a non-cadre officer may be appointed temporarily to a cadre post if no suitable cadre officer is available and that too for a maximum period of three months. “For continuing a non-cadre officer on a cadre post beyond three months, prior approval of the central government is mandatory. Besides, advice of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is required if a non-cadre officer is to be continued beyond six months,” the officer wrote. Khemka has requested the chief secretary to refer the cases of IPS, IRS and IFS officers appointed on the cadre posts of IAS officers to the central government. The officer has also sought that the Civil Services Board (CSB) be activated as transfers and postings of IAS officers can be done only on its recommendation. The chief minister may though modify, amend or reject CSB’s recommendations by recorded reasons on writing. “Transfers and postings without prior recommendation of the CSB violated the rules in letter and spirit. Ex post facto rubber stamping by the CSB is undoing the civil service reforms. It needs no reiteration that transfers and postings are to be done in best public interest and discretion ends where the rules begin. Certain amendments were made in the IAS Cadre Rules following Supreme Court directions in TSR Subramanian case,” Khemka wrote. The IAS officer, who is known for plain speaking, said a public post does not exist in vacuum and is created after consultation with the public service commission. There exists a service rule for every public post laying down duties and responsibilities, eligibility, qualifications, experience, mode of selection, and remuneration, he said. Khemka said that some additional chief secretaries and principal secretaries were grossly underutilised with not more than a few hours of workload during the day. Under these circumstances, there is no justification to appoint non-cadre officers to the cadre posts of principal secretaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/appointment-of-non-cadre-officers-to-cadre-posts-needs-centre-s-approval-khemka/story-52s6HZSi55zx0AZhChPjzM.html
16-11-2020||Mumbai||Woman arrested for duping south Mumbai jeweller, stealing 180 grams of gold||The property cell of the Mumbai crime branch arrested a 39-year-old woman on Saturday for allegedly duping a jeweller and stealing 180 gram (18 tolas) of gold by exchanging real gold ornaments with imitation jewellery.According to police, the accused is identified as Sana Shaikh, a housewife from Nal Bazar in south Mumbai. The incident came to light last month when she managed to steal gold ornaments worth ₹43,100 from the shop without the owner’s knowledge. The shopkeeper Deepak Rathod later found the gold ornaments missing so he checked the CCTV footage and learnt that a burkha-clad woman replaced the gold ornaments with imitation ones, said Kedari Pawar, police inspector of the property cell.Rathod then approached the Byculla police station, and a case was registered against the woman. After an extensive search, the property cell managed to arrest the woman. During the inquiry, she confessed that she had visited the shop five to six times in the last few months. After finalising the gold ornaments, she took photos of them and said she would buy them within two to three days, added Pawar. In her next visit, she carried imitation jewellery in the same design and exchanged them with the real ones. Police are now trying to find out if Shaikh committed similar offences in other jewellery shops using the same modus operandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/woman-arrested-for-duping-south-mumbai-jeweller-stealing-180-grams-of-gold/story-iyAUQ1wb8mvcNZTmb0C9sK.html
16-11-2020||Mumbai||Drug menace in Mumbai will continue until agencies break the source of supply chain, say experts||Even as the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) continues its crackdown on the drug menace in Bollywood, the anti-narcotics cell of the Mumbai Police, too, has taken action against several drug peddlers across the city this year. However, despite all the efforts, the drug menace in the city is unlikely to end as none of the state or central agencies have cracked down on the supply chain that provides drugs, said former senior police officers. Till September, Mumbai Police had registered 2,720 cases of drug-related cases, including 2,503 cases of consumption. The police also seized drugs worth Rs15 crore, including 6.3kg of heroin, 7.3kg of charas worth Rs33 lakh, cocaine worth Rs10 lakh, 2.26kg of mephedrone worth Rs65.1lakh and 336kg of ganja worth Rs1.29crore. The figures are much lesser as compared to the 10,394 drug-related cases registered last year till September. An officer said that there was a decline in the seizure and registration of cases primarily because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, which halted the flow of drugs into the city. Despite the action against drug supply and consumption, law enforcement agencies did not achieve any major success in busting an entire supply chain or unearthing any links related to drug trafficking cartel operating out of Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir and Andhra Pradesh, where weed and hashish are produced. “Hashish, which fetches a lot of money, is primarily controlled by the Russian drug mafia or the Israeli drug mafia, unlike marijuana whose production and supply is controlled by locals from different parts of the country. Till we do not dismantle these drug syndicates, the supply into the city will continue,” a senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer said. The chain will stop only when the source of the drug or supplier is busted, added the officer. “If a well-coordinated major crackdown against the drug’s supply chain or the core source unit of the drugs manufacturers is not taken, then the flow of drugs into the city will continue as always,” said former Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad chief, KP Raghuvanshi. “A peddler has a very small unit of drugs. In fact, they are also victims. Most of them start as consumers and end up being peddlers. They peddle primarily to fulfil their own need to consume drug and also to make small monetary gains,” Raghuvanshi added. Former director general of Maharashtra Police PS Pasricha also said that peddlers are the last unit in the drug chain before the consumers. “They don’t run the drug business. Hence, the police agencies should focus more on busting the entire supply chain to stop the actual supply of flow of drugs in the city. But the city’s police often don’t prefer going after the suppliers as they work in a set format and are bound with too many restrictions – one of the biggest ones being the problem of jurisdiction.” Raghuvanshi opined that even if the local ANC units set aside their regular duty of keeping a check on the local peddlers in the city and go after the supply chain or busting the source of the drugs then they face many challenges. “If local police wants to take any action against any drug rackets in other state, then they would have to involve the local police of that state. Also, many drug rackets flourish their businesses are in connivance with the local police, which tip them off whenever police from other states arrive in their territory for crackdown,” Raghuvanshi said. According to Pasricha, as local ANCs have limited resources and network, the central anti-narcotics agencies such as the NCB and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence are entrusted with the task of going after the supply chain. In India, majority of the domestic as well as international narcotics syndicates, especially those trafficking cocaine and heroin, penetrate into metros such as Delhi and Mumbai. In Mumbai, cocaine is ferried mostly by nationals of African countries, who are hired by Colombian and other South American drug cartels. Most cocaine peddlers and smugglers who have been arrested in Mumbai by ANC and NCB are from African countries, especially Nigeria, which is known to be the key transit point for Colombian drug cartels, said another IPS officer from Mumbai Police. The other major drug heroin is trafficked into India from the cartels operating out of Afghanistan. Though the NCB has not carried out any significant crackdown on the drug supply chains in Maharashtra in the past couple of years, the DRI has busted scores of drug manufacturing units being operated from chemical factories. A senior DRI officer said that around 15 (synthetic) drugs manufacturing factories were busted by the agency in the past five years. In Maharashtra, DRI raided factories and make-shift set ups in Palghar, Raigad and Kolhapur districts in the past couple of years. KPS Malhotra, deputy director (operations), NCB, said, “Narcotics trafficking is a network crime. It involves two kinds of networking: tiered and flat. To bust a supply chain, the law enforcers keep on looking for the intelligence thread linked to the entire chain at any level, from consumers to the manufacturers or cartel runners. The majority of cartels, especially the domestic ones, keep on changing their methods, locations and members to stay off the radar of the NCB or other law enforcement agencies. The groups would set up some makeshift facilities in the interiors of the country, produce drugs and then dismantle everything. Despite this, efforts are always taken to derail their plans.” However, a senior police officer from Mumbai Police said that said that the DRI’s operations too have remained restricted to domestic syndicates which manufacture synthetic drugs or psychotropic substances. Even they find it difficult to cut the supply chain of drugs that involves international cartels. Another senior DRI officer said, “Crackdowns on the supply chain of traditional drugs such as cocaine or heroin, which are being trafficked into the country, is difficult. Developing information obtained from the domestic member of the racket and then taking on the supply chain or cartels operating internationally have a very low success rate as it requires the involvement of cross-borders and multiple national and international agencies. But there are mechanisms to share information across the border. UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) and Interpol generally help in information-sharing and ensure action against the cartel runner.” Explaining the challenges faced by the law enforcers with respect to taking on the cartels operating domestically and trafficking synthetic drugs, the senior DRI officer said, “Busting cartels or factories manufacturing synthetic drugs is challenging because India’s chemical-pharmaceutical industry is quite huge and the monitoring is not rigorous. Drug prepared in factories does not require any state-of-the art equipment or major set up. Ephedrine and mephedrone can be prepared using basic chemicals and equipment as the raw materials required for their preparation are legally available in chemical and pharmaceutical industries.” The data or intelligence sharing is another major problem owing to which drug cartels manage to remain off the radars. “There is a considerable gab in the pace at which data or intelligence is shared among all the stake holders conducting involved in anti-narcotics tasks and the pace at which the cartels run,” the senior DRI officer said. The central government has shown their intent to work in this direction and recently revamped the NCORD (Narco Coordination Centre). The government has also constituted an apex committee under the Union home secretary to support the coordination mechanism under NCORD to enable focused resolution of policy and operational issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/drug-menace-in-mumbai-will-continue-until-agencies-break-the-source-of-supply-chain-say-experts/story-4uetJ8Uo9Gth4swzXWgbLJ.html

The fire supposedly started due to firecrackers from the top floor of the accessories shop, and spread to the whole building, market office-bearers said.“The fire was so huge that it extended to adjoining two buildings; one belongs to the relative of the main building’s owner and other is a godown of a shoe seller. The economic losses could be in lakhs,” Krishan Gambhir, president of the wholesale general merchant dealers association said. Station in-charge of Ambala City police station Ram Kumar said, “Various teams are investigating the site to ascertain the cause of the fire. The losses are being estimated too.”Meanwhile, 11 cases were registered under the Explosives Act regarding the use of firecrackers in the district on Saturday and Sunday. The deputy commissioner had announced a blanket ban on the use and sale of explosive items.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fire-breaks-out-in-three-commercial-buildings-in-ambala-city-on-diwali/story-4qQFGdftZHN1SlCjA3lNVO.html

Ulhasnagar was noisy as well, according to reports.According to Bedekar’s findings for Saturday, residents were seen bursting crackers in large numbers at Upvan lake, Hiranandani Meadows, Hiranandani Estate and around Ghodbunder Road.At 8.30pm, the noise level was 90-95dB (decibels) at Hiranandani Estate. The same level was noted at Upvan lake at 9.45pm.“There were groups of people coming together at Upvan lake to burst crackers. Social distancing norms were not followed as well. For Hiranandani Estate and Meadows, although few noisy crackers were burst, majority of them were created a lot of smoke, causing pollution,” said Bedekar.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had appealed to citizens to not burst crackers, stressing the need to be cautious during the pandemic.Naupada reported a noise level of 65-70dB at 10.30pm. For residential areas, the permissible noise limit is 55dB till 10pm and up to 45dB post 10pm. “The analysis of pollution [due to Diwali firecrackers] will be completed on Tuesday. We will share the findings then,” said Manisha Pradhan, pollution control officer at Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC).Noise activists in Ulhasnagar have alleged that people were bursting crackers till late in Goal Maidan, Bhatia Chowk area, OT Section 3, and Maratha Section.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-guidelines-go-up-in-smoke-during-diwali-in-thane-ulhasnagar-noise-pollution-spikes/story-CsVsgrH1Cp6oxdohbWPHMM.html

With CSCL failing to even allot the tender, the completion of the project is expected to stretch to at least the end of 2022.In July this year, CSCL had made amendments and allowed joint venture companies to participate in the bidding process. But the tendering process that was restarted in August also didn’t find any takers.What project entailsThe scope of the project entails retrofitting of existing network, laying of new network, including civil, electro-mechanical, instrumentation, smart water metering, SCADA and operation and maintenance for 15 years.A total of 13,700 water connections are planned to be covered under the project. One of the main focus areas will be to reduce water leakage from the existing 50% to 15%.The success of the Manimajra 24/7 water supply project will also majorly impact CSCL’s planned pan-city 24/7 water project, for which CSCL and the municipal corporation are in advanced talks with a French development bank, Agence Française de Développement, for availing a loan of ₹550 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-smart-city-limited-refloats-tenders-for-24x7-water-supply-project-in-manimajra/story-6jY91oGbsHTjBn51QOYJwJ.html
16-11-2020||Mumbai||Likely spike in Covid-19 post Diwali will not result in bed shortage in Mumbai: BMC||As the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is expecting a possible spike in Covid-19 cases post Diwali, it has also maintained that the possible spike post Diwali would not pose a challenge in Covid-19 bed availability in the city.Of more than 14,000 beds available in Covid-19 hospitals, 66% are currently vacant, BMC officials said. In categories like intensive care units (ICU), oxygen and ventilators the vacancy rate is between 30% and 60%. BMC said there will not be any impact on bed availability, and if need arises it can increase the bed capacity depending on the requirement.According to data from BMC’s dashboard, of the 14,456 beds in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and centres, 9,580 were vacant, as of November 14. In case of ICU beds, of the total 2,003 beds, 803 are available, followed by 5,987 oxygen beds of total 8,689 oxygen beds and 373 ventilators of 1,183 ventilators.After the Covid-19 outbreak, BMC had come under criticism due to non-availability of beds. To deal with this, starting June, BMC created 24 mini control ward war rooms to regulate the allocation of beds rather than having a single centralised bed allocation control room.Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner of BMC, said, “The 14-day cycle after Diwali is crucial, and there may be surge up to some extent. But bed availability will not be an issue and citizens don’t need to worry about it. However, they need to be cautious and take precautions to control further spread.”However, with daily case load going down, several hospitals and nursing homes requested to bring down the cap and reduce Covid-19 beds, but BMC has not allowed the same yet.BMC had also decided to put several temporary Covid-19 centres on standby or shut them owing to the case load going down. But the state Covid-19 task force has warned against permanently closing down such centres fearing second wave.Dr Kedar Toraskar, a member of the Covid-19 task force, said, “We understand that daily operations of these centres can be a costly affair but we don’t have to shut them. Instead put them on standby wherein they can be activated anytime in case of any spike in coming days.”On Sunday, the city reported 577 cases, taking the tally to 269,710, and 15 deaths were reported, taking the toll to 10,573. Further, 244,843 patients have been discharged in Mumbai. The city’s discharge rate is 90.78%. There are 13,532 active cases in Mumbai and the fatality rate is 3.92%. Dharavi recorded only one new case on Sunday and the tally is 3,620 of which 3,282 have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/likely-spike-in-covid-19-post-diwali-will-not-result-in-bed-shortage-in-mumbai-bmc/story-QTFyHHDQCTPxOt82hS4Z1L.html

The air quality of Noida and Greater Noida dipped to “severe” on Diwali, November 14, and further dipped the next day due to the considerable rise in the pollutants. However, the arrival of the western disturbance -- a weather phenomenon originating over the Mediterranean-- led to light rain between 4 to 5 pm on Sunday. The additional effect of south-westerly winds led to the ventilation and thereby improving air. “Noida and adjoining areas had around 1mm rainfall. The wind speed also increased to about 22 kmph by around Sunday evening. There is very low chance of rain on Monday, but the south-westerly winds will continue although it will be comparatively slower,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Centre (IMD). He added that weather conditions for better ventilation and thereby dispersion of the pollutants are likely to continue for next two days on Monday and Tuesday. According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Sunday was 441 against 425 a day earlier (on Diwali) and 337 on the eve of Diwali. The AQI of Greater Noida was 417 against 394 on Diwali and 336 on Diwali’s eve. Last year, the AQI of Noida, a day after Diwali (October 28) was 397, while in Greater Noida it was 375. In 2018, the AQI of Noida, a day after Diwali November 8) was 432, while that for Greater Noida it was 410. The AQI above 400 is considered severe, while that between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’. The region also saw high pollution levels with PM2.5 for past 24-hours in Noida increased to 391.71 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m³) against 319.94µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida for also increased to 316.47 µg/m³ on Sunday against 269.89µg/m³ a day earlier. However, the AQI of Noida areas showed improvement as the wind speed increased following light showers. The AQI at sector-125, at 4 pm on Sunday was recorded at 443 which dipped to 431 by 8pm. The AQI at sector-62 was 454 at 4 pm that dropped to 435 by 8 pm. The AQI for sector-1 was 447 at 4pm dropping to 425 by 8pm and AQI sector-116 was 438 which dropped to 419 by 8pm, according to the data obtained by CPCB. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI may improve further if the weather conditions remained positive. “The AQI is likely to start improving from the afternoon and make AQI in the lower end of very-poor on 16th November. It may touch the poor category in case of enough rains and washout. AQI is forecasted to stay in the middle-end of the Very Poor category on 17th and 18th November,” said a statement by Safar on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-air-quality-dips-to-severe-day-after-diwali/story-E3kJyMbBAqUpZKvmm3rKSM.html

16-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s air post Diwali second-best in six years: SAFAR report||Despite the use of firecrackers on Saturday in parts of Mumbai, hotter temperatures and faster winds kept the air quality in check on Sunday, making it the second-cleanest post-Diwali day air since monitoring began in 2015, the System Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences said.SAFAR had on Thursday predicted that Mumbai may witness its worst post-Diwali air quality since 2015 with a 50% firecracker emissions scenario on Diwali day. However, on Saturday, as Mumbai recorded its hottest day temperature of the season (36 degrees Celsius), SAFAR revised its forecast, predicting marginally lower air pollution after Diwali.“Mumbai’s air quality a day after Diwali was found to be better than the forecast made (considering 50% of the average firecracker emissions of past years [2016-2018]). The air quality index (AQI) was in the moderate category. However, there was close to 0% firecracker emission scenario (between Saturday and Sunday). This tends to suggest that there were negligible local additional fire emissions,” read SAFAR’s Diwali 2020 air quality report released on Sunday. Also read: Change in weather factors may keep air pollution lower than expected in Mumbai post-Diwali: SAFARIt further said that sudden change in weather (winds from the sea at relatively faster speed) and probability of negligible firecracker emissions in Mumbai “worked positively to keep air quality in check”. “This was the best AQI post Diwali day in the past six years if the 2019 cyclone year is excluded,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.According to SAFAR, the AQI was recorded at 90 (satisfactory) on Saturday, which increased to 107 (moderate) on Sunday. However, by Sunday late evening, fireworks were burst across some areas. The AQI worsened to 115 (moderate) with a thin layer of haze across the skyline.Last year, Mumbai recorded its cleanest air since monitoring began (during Diwali) as the AQI was as low as 75 (satisfactory) on Diwali (October 27, 2019) and 104 (moderate) a day after Diwali owing to fast winds under the influence of Cyclone Kyarr in the Arabian Sea.Also read: Mumbai: BMC bans bursting of firecrackers except on Diwali eveningIn 2018, the AQI was 221 (poor) on Diwali (November 7, 2018) and 305 (very poor) a day after Diwali. In 2017, the AQI was 204 (poor) on Diwali (October 19, 2017), and 319 (very poor) a day after. In 2016, it was 278 (poor) on Diwali (October 30, 2016), and 315 (very poor) the day after, and in 2015, it was 279 (poor) on Diwali (November 11), and 313 (very poor) the next day.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Mumbai’s AQI on Sunday was 148 (moderate) based on the average of data from 15 monitoring stations.This year, Mumbai had the best Diwali and post-Diwali air quality among four cities —Delhi (severe), Pune (very poor), and Ahmedabad (poor) —where SAFAR monitors air. In Mumbai, the concentration of PM2.5 (fine pollutant particles that can easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments) was 54 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) on Saturday and 62 μg/m3 on Sunday against the safe limit of 60 μg/m3 for 24 hours.The highest PM2.5 levels in Mumbai were recorded between 11pm Saturday and 4am Sunday. Chembur was the most polluted area during this period with an AQI of 257 (poor), followed by Andheri 133 (moderate), while Bhandup had the cleanest air in the city at 73 (satisfactory).Also read: Mumbai: BMC forms squads to monitor Covid-19 guidelines violations around DiwaliThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said they received around 50 complaints for excessive cracker bursting on Saturday. “While fireworks were used mostly in residential areas between 8pm and 10pm, there was a significant reduction in the number of complaints received by us compared to previous years,” said Tanaji Kamble, spokesperson, BMC.An independent analysis of hourly particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration by city-based air quality researchers Respirer Living Sciences (RLS) Pvt. Ltd. revealed that fireworks in Mumbai started around 7.30pm with most neighbourhoods reaching their peak levels (worst air quality) around 10pm. “Our assessment showed that of 14 locations real-time air quality is monitored, the area around Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Borivli, which indicates the baseline level of the city, had twice as clean air than most parts of the city, while Kalyan reported worst levels at 342 μg/m3,” said Ronak Sutaria, founder and director, RLS.Meanwhile, anti-noise campaigners Awaaz Foundation measured noise pollution during the permissible hours for cracker use on Saturday from 8pm – 10pm and until the next morning, but submitted decibel (db) readings of only one location in its report to the state government on Sunday. Maximum noise levels recorded was 105.5dB and just before the deadline of 10pm at Shivaji Park grounds near a Silence Zone board. The maximum level recorded in 2019 was 112.3 dB; in 2018, it was 114.1 dB and in 2017, it was 117.8 dB. “It was difficult to take measurements throughout the city since, although aerial shots and bombs were audible in parts of Mumbai, they were scattered in private residential societies which were inaccessible,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation, adding that she received complaints from Borivali, Worli, Dahisar, Thane, Juhu and Versova. “Considerably fewer firecrackers were burst compared to previous years, but illegal and green crackers were used beyond the 10pm deadline in many areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-air-post-diwali-second-best-in-six-years-safar-report/story-NijtPXw9JtHcxhrbR5HMtI.html
16-11-2020||Mumbai||Most Metro networks in India have not met projected ridership: Report||Even though the country is investing hugely in laying a Metro network in major cities, most of the Metro networks are not meeting their projected ridership, a recent analysis by the World Resources Institute (WRI)-India has revealed. Mumbai Metro is the only exception on the list of Metros analysed by the organization that has included Jaipur, Kochi, Lucknow and the Hyderabad Metro network. Mumbai has surpassed the projected ridership of around 4.2 lakh. Before the pandemic hit the city, Mumbai Metro had a ridership of 4.5 lakh on weekdays. The analysis, which looks at projected versus the actual ridership of Metro networks, notes that one of the major reasons for this shortfall is lack of first and last mile connectivity to the corridors. First and last mile connectivity refers to the beginning and end of the commuter’s public transport journey; or the ease with which they can access the Metro/railway stations. The data analyzed by WRI shows that Bengaluru’s ‘Namma Metro’ with more than 40km of operational line had a projected ridership of more than 8 lakh trips, but has reached only half the number in 2019. Even Chennai Metro had a projected ridership of close to 6 lakh trips, however, it is close to 1.15 lakh trips per day, the data shows. “This shortfall has been attributed to a lack of comprehensive first-and last-mile solutions to connect homes, offices, and other activity centres with Metro stations,” the WRI analysis read. According to a WRI survey of 2016, 70% of potential commuters in Bengaluru had said that they are not using the Metro owing to poor first and last-mile connectivity. Sudeept Maiti, senior manager at WRI, said, “Apart from access to stations, the overall cost of door-to-door travel along the Metro compared to buses is also a reason for the poor ridership. People may not prefer to take the Metro owing to the transfers and wait time associated with it. Unlike a direct bus, Metro trips in most cases will have at least two transfer points i.e. when transferring from bus/auto to metro and vice versa.” However, the reasons for Mumbai being an exception are multifold. For one, Mumbai Metro, for now, is only a single operational 11.5-km line connecting the three suburbs of Versova, Andheri and Ghatkopar. Subhadeep Bhattacharjee, project associate – sustainable cities and transport program, WRI said, “Mumbai Metro acts as a major connectivity between eastern and western suburbs. People travelling from other cities in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (Thane, Kalyan, Navi Mumbai) can change to Metro at Ghatkopar station and travel till Andheri station, to travel further on the western railway line. Many commercial centres are located along the present Mumbai Metro Line-1 corridor; stations like Sakinaka, Marol Naka, Chakala and Western express highway have high boarding and alighting numbers. Another reason could also be that Mumbai commuters are familiar with multimodal travel.” However, with 337km of metro lines planned in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, of which 180km are currently under construction, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is planning multimodal integration at each of the upcoming metro stations. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA said, “Each of the upcoming metro stations will have bus bays, auto stands, cycle docks and walking space. Last-mile connectivity is being given the highest priority in Mumbai now.” Before the pandemic hit the city, the Mumbai Metro One Pvt Ltd (MMOPL), which runs the Metro-1 corridor and MMRDA had inaugurated the MyByk services, a public bike-sharing mechanism from the Jagruti Nagar metro station. MMRDA had also recently inaugurated e-bikes in the Bandra Kurla Complex for enhancing connectivity to the suburban Bandra and Kurla stations. “New mobility services make efficient use of technology innovations, such as digital payments and vehicle tracking, to provide convenient last-mile solutions for commuting,” the WRI analysis states. Arjit Soni, founder of MyByk said, “Unless first and last mile connectivity issues are addressed, public transport will continue to be less accessible and inconvenient. Mumbai needs a combination of different new mobility solutions as the demand during peak hours is huge.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/most-metro-networks-in-india-have-not-met-projected-ridership-report/story-7zKkATHiuu9J4ilL4fMGFL.html

16-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi in battle mode to rein in Covid-19 wave||Delhi will get hundreds of more intensive care unit (ICU) beds for Covid-19 patients, testing for the coronavirus will be doubled, and doctors from central paramilitary forces will be flown in, the government announced following a high-level meeting that on Sunday underscored what numbers have been indicating of late: the Capital is in the grip of an unprecedented wave of infections.The meeting was chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah and attendees included chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the health ministers of the Centre as well as the state, Delhi’s lieutenant governor and top officials from Niti Aayog, Indian Council of Medical Research and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Delhi’s air quality takes a hit post Diwali, dips further into ‘severe’ zoneAmit Shah calls meeting to review spike in cases of Covid-19 in DelhiThe meeting began with a presentation from Niti Aayog’s VK Paul, who described Delhi’s situation as “unprecedented” and “ likely to become worse”, according to an official familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Among the worrying details presented was this: on November 11, a day when it reported 48,355 new cases, Delhi recorded 361 cases per million of population, a level not seen before in India, not even in Maharashtra during its worst days. “First, it was decided that the testing capacity for RT-PCR tests would be doubled in Delhi. Labs in Delhi will be utilised to their maximum capacity and wherever the risk of an outbreak is high, mobile testing vans from health ministry and ICMR will be deployed,” Shah said in a series of tweets. ICMR is expected to decide how this can be done by Monday afternoon. Legendary actor Soumitra Chatterjee passes away at 85Experts said that while the decision to increase testing was welcome, authorities will need to focus on speeding up results since people are likely to continue spreading the infection in the time it takes between when their samples are collected and the reporting of results.The minister also said that a decision had been taken to strengthen hospital infrastructure. “It was decided that 250-300 additional beds with ICUs would be added to the existing medical facility of DRDO at Dhaula Kuan... The 10,000-bed Covid Care Centre established at Chhattarpur would also be strengthened with enhanced availability of beds with oxygen capacity,” the home ministry said in a statement.Officials also are believed to have briefly considered the idea of additional restrictions, although no decision on this was taken. “There was nothing discussed on more restrictions, although the home ministry may hold a meeting on the matter,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said following the meeting. Manipur CM N Biren Singh tests positive for Covid-19Kejriwal described the lack of ICU beds as the “biggest challenge”. “We have seen that after October 20, cases have really started rising. Hospital beds are in adequate number but ICU beds have been dwindling. The Centre has assured that 500 ICU beds will be added at the DRDO hospital followed by another 250,” he said, adding: “Second big decision was to increase daily tests to over 100,000. ICMR has assured us they will extend facilities. Delhi government’s facilities are at capacity”.As on Sunday evening, of the total 3,524 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients across more than 100 hospitals in Delhi, 3,099 were occupied. Hospitals have particularly been swamped this month, with active cases having risen from a little over 22,000 in mid-October to close to 40,000 on Sunday. HT also learns that a team of senior government officials from the Centre and the state may visit private hospitals to ensure that every available bed is being utilised.The spike has been particularly pronounced due to the festive season. In the week ending October 25, when the city held Dussehra celebrations, there was an average of 3,663 cases every day. As on the middle of last week, this number rose to 7,196. In comparison, the number was 2,627 in the first week of October.Arthritis drug can reduce mortality rate in Covid-19 patients by 71%: Study“It was pointed out that the number of active cases per day has increased substantially. While the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) continues to remain in control, the health and medical infrastructure, such as dedicated Covid-19 beds, beds with ventilators, and ICUs, is already showing signs of strain,” the home ministry statement said. The ministry added that house-to-house surveys will be carried out across Delhi by teams of AIIMS, Delhi government and municipal corporations after which all symptomatic persons people would be tested and provided necessary treatment. People familiar with the development said Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and Delhi chief secretary Vijay Kumar Dev will meet on Monday to discuss a strategy on containment zones. “With the positivity rate on the rise, there is no other option but to scale up testing to contain the spread of the infection. And, in an ideal world, all the tests would be conducted using RT PCR, which is more sensitive and can pick-up more cases,” said Dr Rajinder K Dhamija, professor of medicine and head of the department of neurology at Lady Hardinge Medical College.Doubling RT-PCR tests to mobile testing vans: Amit Shah announces steps to curb Covid-19 surge in Delhi“If there is a delay, it has to be ensured that anyone who undergoes the test -- and you undergo the test only if there is some suspicion -- remains in quarantine till they get the results to limit transmission of the infection. And, it is the responsibility of the government and the people,” Dr Dhamija added. The Centre also decided to rush additional doctors and para-medical staff from central paramilitary forces, who will be airlifted to Delhi from other parts of the country. The Union government also directed some hospitals of the three municipal corporations of Delhi – which do not fall under the Delhi government -- will be turned into dedicated Covid-19 hospitals to treat patients with mild symptoms. Subsequently, teams comprising officials from various departments will visit the private hospitals across Delhi to inspect the availability of medical infrastructure, beds, admission of patients and to assess if the decisions taken earlier are being implemented or not. There will also be new protocols prepared for plasma donation and providing plasma to critical patients. A high level committee with Niti Aayog’s Paul, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria and ICMR’s head Balram Bhargava will soon submit a report in this regard. “The containment measures taken previously like establishment of containment zones, contract tracing and quarantine and screening will also be reassessed,” Shah said in his tweets, before adding: “Prevention is the only solution to coronavirus; hence Delhi needs to have a robust communication awareness program to inform people about Covid-19 behaviour and negative aspects of the pandemic,” Shah tweeted. The home minister also suggested that the Delhi CM consult the three mayors in the city for better Covid management. Later in the day, Kejriwal tweeted: “Delhi has shown before that we can overcome corona when we all work together. Centre, state government, DRDO, ICMR will double their efforts n work together but we need support from all delhites. We can’t afford to be careless. We need all citizens to help by taking all precautions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-in-battle-mode-to-rein-in-covid-19-wave/story-6tNd5wEHx5f8O9MUI0TQmI.html

16-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s South civic body approves policy for movie shoots||In order to boost its revenues, the cash-strapped South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has approved a policy to allow film shooting under its jurisdiction. The policy suggests that filmmakers will have to seek permission for shooting and will also have to pay prescribed fee ranging from Rs 25,000 to Rs 75,000 per day depending on shooting locations.According to SDMC officials, at present, there is no policy for granting permission to film shooting under the areas of SDMC.“NDMC issues permission for shooting in areas under its jurisdiction on payment of a fee of Rs 2 lakh per day. When one civic body can charge for film shooting then why can’t we? This policy will not only bolster revenue to the corporation but also help filmmakers in conducting hassle free shooting. If they obtain permission before shooting then no one be it police or civic body will trouble them,” a senior SDMC official said.Anamika Mithilesh, mayor SDMC, said that the policy has a potential for generating the revenue as well as to bring showcase tourist friendly locations under south civic body before the public through electronic medium which include TV serials, films, documentaries among others.“Area under SDMC is dotted with myriad number of sites of historical importance, which are ideal for film shooting. In many Bollywood films, scenes have been shot at different locations in South Delhi such as like Humayun’s Tomb, Nizamuddin Dargah, Qutab Minar, Lotus Temple, Tughlakabad Fort and Vasant Kunj Malls, etc. Other than these historical sites, we have more locations such as Waste to Wonder Park, Garden of Five Senses, upcoming Bharat Darshan Park, business hubs and bustling markets which are appropriate for film shooting,” she said.She said that the policy will be sent to SDMC House later this month for final approval and then it is likely to be implemented by December end.SDMC officials said that as compared to NDMC, the shooting permission fee is nominal.As per the policy document accessed by HT, filmmakers will have to pay Rs 50,000 per day in premises of ASI monuments and parks falling under the jurisdiction of SDMC. They will have to shell out Rs 75,000 per day for shooting at other promises such as SDMC heritage buildings, private properties like malls, hotels, motels, streets and open areas which also include markets.Other than this, filmmakers will also have to pay a security amount of Rs 25,000 per day which may be refunded after the shoot.As per the policy, the SDMC commissioner will have the right to modify prescribed rates, if required.The filmmaker will have to apply online to the office of additional commissioner (IT) along with the necessary documents and requisite security and permission fee. The permission will be issued within three days of application, an SDMC official said.Ravi Sarin, line producer, who facilitates film producers and directors to shoot in Delhi, described the policy as a good move and said that it would help do away with unnecessary hurdles during the shoot.He, however, said that the permission fee has to be reasonable. “Filmmakers now don’t prefer much to shoot in NDMC area because they charge Rs 2 lakh/day which is quite high. In SDMC’s case the maximum amount is Rs 75,000 for a day’s shoot which is not much for a film shooting. Getting a proper shooting permission from the civic body will also make the process hassle free as filmmakers will not have to pay additional money to local authorities for hurdles during the shoot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdmc-approves-movie-shooting-policy/story-fhKbTjTUyfM36XKJB9YX4H.html
16-11-2020||Delhi||850 held for flouting curbs, 1.2k cases filed||Despite a blanket ban on bursting all forms of firecrackers in the capital, fireworks were seen in different parts of the city on Diwali with the city police registering 1,206 cases on Saturday for sale and use of crackers and arresting/detaining 850 people for violating the government orders.Data provided by the police shows that the number of people booked and held for selling and bursting firecrackers on Diwali night and in the days preceding it far outnumbered cases last year when there was a ban only on non-green firecrackers.On Diwali day and days preceding it, the police registered a total of 1,292 cases and held 926 people. In contrast, last Diwali season, the police had registered 433 cases and arrested 261 people.The outer-north police district reported the most number of cases (165) and the highest number of people, 165, were apprehended from there, said police officers.This year, the sale and bursting of PESO-certified firecrackers was initially allowed in Delhi and there was a ban only on other polluting firecrackers. So, the Delhi Police had issued licences to 167 shops to sell firecrackers by November 4.But the Delhi government on November 5 banned bursting of all firecrackers. Following this, the Delhi Police revoked all the licences on November 8.But firecrackers continued to be sold in the neighbouring towns of the National Capital Region until November 9 when the National Green Tribunal (NGT) banned firecrackers across cities and towns where air quality was categorised as “poor”. These included the NCR towns as well.A senior Delhi Police officer said that it was too late by the time the Delhi government and NGT bans were announced. “A lot of firecrackers were already sold legally before the NGT imposed the ban. So, many people had already purchased firecrackers,” said a senior officer.The officer also said many Delhiites who burst crackers on Diwali night had bought them from neighbouring cities. This was despite the police’s repeated assertions that they were carrying out checks at borders to prevent people from bringing in firecrackers into Delhi.“We carried out random checks of vehicles, the way we do to prevent smuggling of illicit liquor, but it was not practically possible to search each and every vehicle,” said the officer.The seizure of firecrackers was much lesser this year compared to the previous year. This time, 4,725 kilos of firecrackers were seized compared to 9,758 kilos last year.The maximum amount was seized from outer district where the police found 286 kilos of firecrackers.The police said that many bursted crackers from their terrace or balconies to evade police action. “We had an active presence on the streets, but there is only so much you can do about people bursting crackers in their buildings,” said another police officer.Unlike last year, when the police shared a break-up of the cases and arrests made separately for bursting and selling firecrackers, this time the police only shared a combined data for Diwali night.The number of cases registered included FIRs as well as Kalandara notices to people caught bursting firecrackers. The police explained that a Kalandara notice sent under CrPc section 107 is a legal action that does not include an FIR, but a report is sent to court about the offence and the offender.While a person against whom a Kalandara notice is sent does not need to apply for bail, he or she has to appear before a court.The police did not specify how many people it registered FIRs against and how many received a Kalandara notice.The police also did not specify how many people it arrested formally and how many were “boundown”. While a person who has been arrested needs to seek bail from the court, those boundown are let off from police station after taking assurances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1206-case-registered-for-bursting-crackers-on-diwali-850-people-held/story-2lQKkR1Ms66kuHCb7LE93M.html
16-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s Covid-19 test positivity rate 15.3 %, highest in 140 days||The Capital reported 3,235 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Diwali, as per Sunday’s health bulletin, a dip in infections that came on a day when testing fell to a 76-day low, even as the state battles a third wave of the pandemic that has seen deaths and hospital admissions rise sharply.In a matter of continuing concern, the positivity rate on Saturday soared to a 140-day high.While new infections dipped to their lowest since October 26, this only happened because daily tests saw a massive drop and fell to 21,098, the lowest since August 31. In contrast, Delhi had been conducting an average of around 54,000 tests a day in the week before Diwali.The positivity rate, meanwhile, continued to rise as it touched 15.33% on Saturday — the highest since 15.37% on June 27, indicating that if the government had maintained a regular testing number, the cases would have been significantly higher.Further, only around 9,000 of the tests on Diwali day were conducted using the more accurate RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) method.The positivity rate — the number of positive cases among total tests — usually goes up with increase in the number of RT PCR as it is a more sensitive test that can pick more positive cases as compared to its alternative rapid antigen test.Experts see positivity rate as a crucial metric to assess an outbreak in a community and, when this number is coupled with an increase in new cases, it can determine how fast a contagious disease is spreading.According to recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before an outbreak is considered under controlExperts have attributed the current exponential rise in cases to the festive season, hazardous pollution levels, as well as the dip in temperatures.“The number of cases is likely to remain high for at least two more weeks after Diwali, with people being out and about aiding the spread of the infection. It is also known that the low temperatures and high levels of pollution leads to increase in respiratory infections including Covid-19; this might lead to more infections in the coming time,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.Concerns remain over the ability of the city’s health infrastructure to handle the severe Covid-19 caseload.With over 8,700 people with the infection hospitalised across the city, facilities too are fast running out of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. Over 87% of the 3,542 ICU beds earmarked for the treatment of the Covid-19 patients across hospitals were occupied as on Sunday evening, as per data on the Delhi Corona app. Over 53% of all Covid-19 beds were occupied, as per the app.The number of available ICU beds are likely to go up, however, with the Delhi high court allowing the government to reserve 80% of the total ICU capacity in 33 big private hospitals.“Even as more are being opened up for Covid-19 patients,they are filling up fast. If the number of cases continues to go up further, there will be a problem,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director, department of pulmonology and sleep disorders at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.On Sunday, the city also recorded 95 deaths due to the infection, taking the total toll to 7,614. Earlier this week,the city had seen the highest single day mortality of 104 deaths in a day, higher than the 101 recorded during the June-July surge, when protocols for treatment were still being developed.“If the hospitals are overwhelmed and the beds get exhausted, naturally the mortality of the disease will go up. People who are in need of ICU care or oxygen support need it in a timely manner. Also, if we look at Covid-19 cases, most people are preferring to stay in home isolation. These days people also have the oxygen saturation monitors at home. So, chances are those who reach the hospitals are in need of immediate medical attention. If they do not get it, they are likely to die,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of virology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-positivity-rate-in-delhi-at-140-day-high/story-0oym42Bka8v1d4dOASy5xJ.html
16-11-2020||Delhi||Parents in debt, out of work, school kids in city forced into child labour||Prolonged closure of schools and job loss due to the lockdown enforced to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has pushed a lot of students from the economically weaker section into child labour, NGOs working for child rights and attendance data from online classes suggest.With classes being shifted online, education has taken a back-seat for the majority of these children who do not have access to electronic devices and the internet. Most of these children who live in slums and working class neighbourhoods are now working full-time to support their families.A joint report published by the Unicef and International Labour Organization (ILO) on June 12, had said that the Child labour has declined by 94 million since 2000, but job losses and rising poverty because of the lockdown and sickness is likely to force more children to seek exploitative and hazardous jobs as families use every available means to earn some money and survive.A 10-year-old class 4 student at a municipal school in Seelampur, has been engaged by her mother to peel electric wires with a sharp knife at her rented one-room house. “My mother gets these wires from a nearby factory and we get ₹5 per kg for peeling them. We did not get any work for months due to coronavirus lockdown. My father, who works in a factory, also did not earn anything for months. Mother says we have a debt to pay. She asked us to work faster and help her peeling at least 20 Kg wire a day to make good money,” she said.They first burn the wire to melt it and then separate the copper and plastic using a sharp knife. Acknowledging that it is dangerous work for a 10-year-old, her mother said, “We remained out of work for months and bought the regular ration on credit from the local shops here. I have to pay that back and for that, we need to earn more. I would not have taken their help if the schools were open. But now they are home the whole day and we do not have a smartphone for online classes. Her teacher calls every week and then I send her to school to get the homework.”A few kilometers away in Geeta Colony, a 12-year-old girl has been working as a domestic help to support her family. Her mother, who was working in a local condiment factory, and brother who was employed in a jeans manufacturing unit lost their jobs during the lockdown. Her father does not work due to his failing health. “After losing her job, my mother started working as a cleaner in a temple. She later started working in some households. She was earning only Rs 3,000, and it was difficult for her to support the family of eight. She then employed me as a maid in two households. I clean the house and also wash the utensils,” she said.The girl, a class 7 student at a government school in Gandhi Nagar, said that she studies during the nights. “We have one phone at home and six of us study using that only. My turn of using the phone comes in the end. So I try to study for some hours before I go to bed,” she said.According to NGO CHETNA (Childhood Enhancement Through Training and Action), at least 55% or 325 of the 586 children in their contact in east and north-east districts of Delhi have been engaged in some sort of work ever since the schools have been shut in view of the pandemic.Most of them are engaged in waste picking, domestic work, selling vegetables, fruits, or other items with parents, and cutting threads from readymade garments and peeling wires, among other works.A class 4 student who goes to dump yards in Dilshad Garden’s Qalandar Colony to collect scrap, said, “I earn Rs 40-50 every day by selling plastic scrap. Both my brother and I use the money to feed ourselves.” His mother, who also collects and sells scrap, said, “Earlier, they would get at least one meal from the school. I am the sole earner and with my meagre income of around ₹100-150 a day how do I provide food to them multiple times? We have received money for mid-day meals in their accounts only till June and nothing after that.”The central government’s mid-day meal programme has also been disrupted by the pandemic. The scheme is run through state governments. Officials at the Directorate of Education (DoE) said that as per the new directions from the central government, students will now be given dry ration instead of allowance. “We have already procured dry ration for students. They will be given wheat, dal, rice, oil among other items with effect from July. We will soon start distributing the kits through schools,” said a senior DoE official.In north Delhi’s Majnu Ka Tilla area, a class 6 student at a government school has been selling fruits on a cart to support his family. His father, who drives an e-rickshaw in the locality, said, “I had no work for months and had to borrow money to feed my children. In order to pay back the money, I have rented out this cart for my son to sell fruits till his school reopens. He anyway cannot study during the day because I have to carry the only phone we have to work.”Sanjay Gupta, director of CHETNA, said, “Every year NGOs like ours motivate thousands of children to get admission in government schools so that they can study, get a mid-day meal, and have constructive engagement. But the closure of schools has pushed children back to work due to the poor financial condition of their families. We request authorities to provide means for online education, creatively think about how mid-day meals can still be provided, provide education and recreational material, and most importantly do an assessment of how many children have been pushed to work or migrated.”Amrita Johri of NGO Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan said they are going to hold a public hearing by the end of this month to highlight issues faced by the low-income families of Delhi amid the pandemic, including the vulnerable children.Officials at the DoE and municipal corporations said that schools have been asked to track each and every student who is not attending online classes.An official at Delhi government’s education department, who wished not to be named, said, “Our teachers are in regular touch with the children and their parents. In some cases, teachers even visited the houses of irregular students. The majority of the students are in touch with the schools and are either attending the online classes or collecting assignment sheets or worksheets from their schools. There is a possibility that some of them might be working to support their families along with that. The schools will be asked to identify such kids and counsel their families.”The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) said that it has started the process of tracking students who are not attending online classes regularly. Anurag Kundu, chairperson of DCPCR, said, “We have set up teams which are visiting homes, tracking these children since the last week of October. We have decided to hold a fortnightly review meeting,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/closure-of-schools-job-loss-push-ews-students-into-child-labour/story-sehfYAYuDSGhHSJR6bfRpN.html
16-11-2020||Delhi||205 calls reporting fires on Diwali day||A 28-year-old man was charred to death and his colleague injured inside an air-cooler godown in outer Delhi’s Mundka on Saturday night, when the fire department reported 205 calls regarding blazes in the national capital on Diwali day. Despite a blanket ban on firecrackers this year — with fire department officials saying they anticipated much fewer calls — the number of fire incidents went down only marginally compared to 2019, when it received 245 calls. Of the last 13 years for which data of Diwali day was available, there were five instances when the department received fewer fire calls.Of the 205 calls, 129 were received during peak hours, between 6pm and midnight, Delhi Fire Services (DFS) officers said. Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Services, said that this year saw a large number of fire incidents being reported from garbage-dumping grounds. “This time, there were 71 calls from garbage spots. This is a big number as we usually never receive more than 50 such calls from these areas,” Garg said. “It is possible that people were bursting firecrackers at isolated spots away from their homes to avoid getting caught by authorities, and empty plots and garbage-dumping grounds are often the areas of choice in such cases,” he said.The fire department said despite anticipating fewer fire incidents this Diwali, they hadn’t lowered their guard. “Apart from our 63 permanent fire stations, we had deployed fire tenders at 26 temporary spots. Last year we had deployed them at 21 such spots,” Garg said. While no firefighters were injured during the day, the cooler factory fire in Mundka left one man, Sunil Kumar, dead and a 20-year-old man, Aditya, injured. This particular blaze, though, was due a leak in a cooking gas cylinder rather than due to Diwali festivities. A Koan, deputy commissioner of police (outer district), said there were 11 workers inside the godown when the fire broke out around 11.30pm. “While nine workers managed to escape unhurt, Kumar was charred to death and Aditya received 20% burns,” he said. The police have registered a case of causing death due to negligence, Koan added. Apart from the fatal fire, a restaurant, which was shut on Saturday, went up in flames in Keshavpuram. Garg said the fire broke out to due to a candle lit outside the restaurant. “We controlled the fire soon, but the restaurant was destroyed and a car parked outside was partially burnt,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-charred-to-death-in-factory-blaze-on-diwali-fire-services-receive-205-calls/story-Q6qhA0DjBL0LmdnusOYlpM.html
16-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: Residents flout cracker time limit with impunity||Despite restrictions on bursting crackers after 10pm, city residents did not give two hoots to the police commissioner’s orders and carried on with the fireworks till about 2am in several parts of the city on Diwali night.This even as the police control room (PCR) was flooded with complaints from concerned residents. As per information, at least 250 complaints regarding the bursting of crackers beyond the permitted time (8pm to 10pm) were received on Saturday night but the police have registered only eight FIRs, against unidentified persons, so far. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said patrolling parties have lodged FIRs against the violators in New Shivpuri, Baba Than Singh Chowk, Dehlon area, Sua Road and Overlock Road.The cases have been registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) on the basis of complaints filed by patrolling parties and officers of duty at the police stations concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-residents-flout-cracker-time-limit-with-impunity/story-yW8ZBygOTTNSvmOcf6ucKP.html
16-11-2020||Mumbai||Pregnant leopard killed road accident on Mumbai’s Western Express Highway||A female leopard identified as L98 was found grievously injured in a road accident near Delhi Darbar Inn on the Western Express Highway near Kashimira area at Mira Road.around 12.30am on Sunday and subsequently succumbed to her injuries. The leopard, aged between three and four years, was one-month pregnant, carrying three unborn cubs, said forest officials.According to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) director and conservator of forest, the injured leopard was rescued by the SGNP rescue team and brought to the park’s leopard rescue centre. “However, the leopard succumbed to its injuries during treatment at 2.15am. A post mortem was conducted by a team of veterinarians at SGNP on Sunday afternoon, during which the leopard was found to be pregnant with three foetuses,” said Mallikarjuna.The post mortem revealed that the cause of death was probably due to a vehicular collision. “It was due to strong mechanical impact [probably vehicular origin] causing multiple haemorrhages, multiple fractures, and muscular damage, resulting in hypovolemia [life threatening condition due to high blood loss] and respiratory arrest,” added Mallikarjuna.Nikit Surve, wildlife biologist from Wildlife Conservation Society, who has been annually assessing leopard numbers in and around SGNP, said L98 was first photographed in October 2018 at Ghodbunder village after residents had spotted the animal. “Early last year, the leopard was spotted on the opposite side of the road near Kashi Mira, Bhayander, which showed that she had successfully crossed. Also, just about seven days ago, the leopard was spotted in one of our camera traps near Kashi Mira. However, it is extremely unfortunate that she met with the accident, probably while crossing the road on Sunday because it is not easy for animals to understand oncoming traffic. It is even more disheartening that she was pregnant,” said Surve, adding that leopards do not stop hunting or movement till the moment they stop to give birth.Dr Shaliesh Pethe, senior veterinarian, SGNP, said the gestation period for a leopard is three months. “This leopard was one-month pregnant. Externally one can identify that a leopard is pregnant only within the last 15 days before she delivers,” he said.SGNP and peripheral areas are home to at least 47 big cats that include the transient population moving between SGNP into surrounding landscapes, according to a 2019 estimation by Surve and SGNP. Data from SGNP, NGO Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) and Mumbaikars for SGNP revealed that 19 leopards had been killed around SGNP, most of them on the Western Express Highway and Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS), from 2008 to 2018. “Unless we provide adequate mitigation structures [under or overpasses] on roads, railways and canals, we will lose most of our large mammals to linear infrastructure very rapidly,” said Anish Andheria, president, Wildlife Conservation Trust.An earlier assessment under the Mumbaikars for SGNP initiative in 2013 revealed that 40 leopards died in road accidents along the periphery of SGNP from 1994 to 2012.“Over the last two years, accident cases with animals have reduced as road widening work is underway on the WEH. Owing to less traffic during Diwali, vehicles were moving at a faster speed that probably led to this unfortunate incident. However, we have suggested several mitigation measures along this route, and we are trying to expedite their construction with project proponents as early as possible,” said Mallikarjuna.TWO LEOPARD DEATHS DUE TO ROAD ACCIDENTS IN MAHA DURING DIWALI PERIODAnother leopard was killed in a road accident on Saturday near Satara on the National Highway 4 that connects Pune and Bengaluru. The country recorded 83 leopard deaths in train and road accidents in 2019, the highest in a decade, according to the Wildlife Protection Society of India. Of these, 73 were killed in road accidents, and 10 were run over by trains. Also, there had been a 278% rise in such deaths due to road and rail accidents from 2010 to 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pregnant-leopard-killed-road-accident-on-mumbai-s-western-express-highway/story-QLpsmvC5hjnuxiWrDQ3GpI.html
16-11-2020||Gurugram||21 villages opposed to MCG takeover to be included under the proposed Manesar civic body||Around 21 of the 39 villages of the district, which were originally proposed to be included under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), will now be included under the proposed Municipal Corporation of Manesar (MCM),revealed official documents of the MCG.The 39 villages have been protesting against the MCG’s decision of bringing them within its jurisdictional limits — the decision regarding which was taken during a meeting on August 22. Some of the prominent villages, which have been protesting against the civic body’s decision, include Bajghera, Daultabad, Dhankot, Gopalpur, Wazirpur, Hayatpur, Nakhrola, Mewka, Rampura, Shikohpur, Naurangpur, Palra, Bhondsi, Dhumaspur, Maidawas, Ullawas, Kadarpur, Behrampur, Nayagaon, Manesar, Kasan, Naharpur Kasan, Kankrola, Bhangrola and Bar-gujjar, among others. These villages have been protesting against being included under the MCG, citing a preference of continuing to operate under the existing panchayati raj system.The internal MCG order issued by RK Singh, chief town planner, on behalf of MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh to the civic body’s taxation department on Friday, stated that the proposed MCM will comprise 27 villages, including the 21 villages that were earlier proposed to be included under MCG’s ambit.The 21 villages include areas such as Manesar, Kasan, Khoh, Naharpur Kasan, Nawada Fatehpur, Dhana, Baskusla, Bas Haria, Kankrola, Bhangrola, Dhorka, Wazirpur, Badha, Sikanderpur Badha, Shikohpur, Nakhrola, Bar-Gujjar, and Hayatpur, among others. In the order, a copy of which is in the possession of Hindustan Times, Vinay Pratap Singh has asked the taxation department for details on the expected income that can be generated from the 21 villages with regards to property tax, electricity charges, and any other civic dues. The details have to be submitted by Monday so that the same can be discussed during an internal MCG meeting on Tuesday. Following the takeover, the MCG had originally anticipated a cumulative expenditure of around ₹30 crore in the 39 villages with regards to civic development as opposed to a cumulative income of around ₹97.5 crore in return.“The meeting on Tuesday would be an internal one. Decisions on finalising the areas along Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway that can come under the jurisdiction of MCM would be taken during the meeting. Other important issues will also be discussed. Essentially, the new Gurugram areas, located between sectors 77 and 93 would come under the ambit of MCM,” said an MCG official privy to the matter.RK Singh, chief town planner, when asked about the matter, declined to comment.“Over the last decade, areas along the Gurugram-Manesar border and Manesar have undergone urbanisation and development. As such, the Haryana government thought of developing a new municipal corporation in Manesar. The MCG is undertaking all necessary steps in aiding for the formation of MCM,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, adding that apart from 21 villages, two more villages, namely Garhi Harsaru and Gopalpur, have been added to the list of villages that will come under the proposed MCM. Sunder Lal Yadav, sarpanch of Sikanderpur Barha and the president of the district sarpanch association, said, “Apart from having a preference for the panchyati raj system, we also did not want to come under the ambit of MCG as we felt that the jurisdictional expansion would result in its resources getting stretched and would hamper civic development in our villages. Due to this reason, we felt that coming under MCM would be far beneficial than MCG. Since its area of jurisdiction is smaller, more attention would be given to the villages coming under it. We are carefully monitoring the developments in the matter but no formal decision has been taken by us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/21-villages-opposed-to-mcg-takeover-to-be-included-under-the-proposed-manesar-civic-body/story-k9DviN2a2blKxMwMxK52UK.html
16-11-2020||Mumbai||BEST to buy 100 new upgraded double-decker buses for Mumbai||The city is likely to get new double-decker buses by next year. In a major upgrade in its fleet, the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) has decided to procure 100 upgraded double-decker buses equipped with advanced features that will make commute smoother and safer for passengers. BEST has floated tenders for procurement of these buses on November 11 which will open on December 7. The new double decker buses will have capacity of around 70 passengers. They will be operated on automated manual transmission and will be BS-VI compliant that aims at reducing pollution. The new fleet will have two-door entrances, rear door and front door, with pneumatic door closers and two staircases provided for smooth movement of passengers as against to one staircase in the double-decker buses at present. Emergency exit doors on the back side of the buses will be equipped with closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. The buses will also have electronic bus halt destination boards and inter-communication system that will help in communication between bus driver and conductors on both the decks, the officials said. The diesel-operated buses will be procured in 2021 and will be operated majorly on long-distance routes. “The buses will be the upgraded version for the present double-decker buses. The design and features of the buses are finalised by keeping in mind safety and easy access for passengers. Two staircases and two entrances will help in smooth movement of passengers while boarding and alighting,” said a senior BEST official. BEST double-decker buses were introduced in 1937 and gained popularity both among commuters and tourists in Mumbai. With an initial fleet of 141 in 1947-1948, it grew to 882 by 1993. At present, there are only 120 double-decker buses in a fleet of over 3,500 buses operating on seven routes in the city. In 2018, BEST administration had planned to scrap them as they require twice the time for maintenance than a single-decker bus. However, the BEST committee had raised objections. The committee had assured that new double-decker buses will be procured as replacement of scrapped buses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/best-to-buy-100-new-upgraded-double-decker-buses-for-mumbai/story-aI3JKKINfMS7OA8C7beCoO.html
16-11-2020||City||80 families left homeless by blaze at Panchkula’s Saketri slum||Over 200 people were left homeless after a fire broke out at a slum in Saketri village, gutting 80 hutments.While the cause behind the fire could not be established, locals said it could have spread from an unattended kitchen fire.“Around 3pm, we noticed that a hutment had caught fire, which spread to other structures in no time. We heard no blast, so it could not be due to a cylinder,” said a slum dweller.The fire department received a call at 3.16pm, following which 12 water tankers were sent to the spot from Panchkula, Barwala and even Kalka. The last water tanker went in around 6.30pm, so it took nearly four hours to douse the fire.A fire official said the cause of the fire was not known, but it started from one hutment and engulfed all others. “Nearly 225 people living in the slum lost their homes and belongings. But no one was hurt,” he added.Members of the Shirdi Sai Sewa Samaaj donated blankets, tarpaulin sheets, ropes and ration among the affected families.Meanwhile, 12 more fires were reported across Panchkula on Diwali and another two on Sunday. Besides some fodder catching fire at a house in Ramgarh, all other incidents were minor, the fire official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hundreds-left-homeless-by-blaze-at-saketri-slum/story-vxIiiacOuMAkjxiIgFue7L.html

16-11-2020||City||Blast during fuel theft: Well-oiled nexus rampant at 19 dhabas in Dera Bassi, reveals probe||Investigation following the Friday blast at a dhaba in Lalru has revealed that fuel pilferage from oil tankers, in connivance with their drivers, has been rampant at 19 such eateries in Dera Bassi and Lalru for the past two years.As per the investigation, around 100 litres of oil is stolen from one tanker, which can hold up to 1 lakh litres of liquid, and then sold for Rs 5 to Rs 7 cheaper than the current oil price. The stolen fuel is stored in drums of five litres each.Sub-divisional magistrate Kuldeep Bawa, who is conducting a magisterial probe into the Friday blast that killed four, said they will be raiding the dhabas and work in collaboration with oil companies to rein in fuel theft. Ashwinder Mongia, president, Mohali District Petroleum Dealers Association said, “The price difference between fuel sold in Chandigarh and Punjab encourages smugglers to hoard fuel illegally. As per projections, this leads to a loss of Rs 600 crore per annum to the Punjab government due to smuggling and shifting of business to neighbouring states.”Petrol or diesel cannot be purchased, stored or sold without a valid licence as mandated by the Motor Spirit and High Speed Diesel (Regulation of Supply, Distribution and Prevention of Malpractices) Order.Fourth victim succumbs to burnsThe fourth victim, who suffered 80% burns in the blast at a Lalru dhaba on Friday, also succumbed to his injuries at PGIMER, Chandigarh, on Saturday night.Apart from Sandeep Kumar, Jaswinder Singh, 35, owner of Rama Punjabi dhaba, and his relatives, Babloo, 20, and Vikram Kumar, were also killed in the blast, which occurred while they were stealing fuel from an oil tanker at the dhaba located in Sirsini village, Lalru, on the Ambala-Chandigarh highway.The explosion ripped through the dhaba’s basement after a spark in the pump that led to fire in the petrol and diesel drums stored in its basement.In July last year, Jaswinder was booked for illegally storing 525 litres of petrol and 630 litres of diesel in his dhaba’s basement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/blast-during-fuel-theft-pilferage-rampant-at-19-dhabas-in-dera-bassi-reveals-probe/story-DzgIULclXDommchiXOlxLL.html
