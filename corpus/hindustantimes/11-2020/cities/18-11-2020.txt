18-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh GMCH protest: Services of six sanitation workers terminated||Services of six representatives of sanitation workers at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, have been terminated by the outsourced agency for “irresponsible behaviour” as the strike for Diwali bonus entered third day on Wednesday.“It has been found that you are instigating other employees to join your nefarious activities and have been threatening and manhandling other safai karamcharies so that they do not provide their services even in the emergency/ICU wards... This kind of behaviour at work can result in putting lives of patients at risk,” a letter by Kulwant Singh Security Agency to the agitating employees reads. Major Kulwant Singh (retd), proprietor of the agency, said it was an important measure as patient services were being affected due to the strike. He said he was acting on the directions of Dr Jasbinder Kaur, officiating director-cum-principal of the hospital, for ensuring smooth services. Meanwhile, the higher authorities have rejected the demand to grant any bonus to the employees, citing there is no provision for it. “The view of the legal remembrancer was sought. The bonus cannot be granted to employees of organisations established not for purposes of profit, which is the case here as well,” Anil Moudgil, public relation officer of the institute said. Meanwhile, services in the hospital remained affected with only 15 to 20 workers deputed in the emergency area. Om Kailash, chairman of GMCH-32 Safai Karamchari Union, whose service has been terminated, said the agitation will continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-gmch-protest-services-of-six-sanitation-workers-terminated/story-nryOY1qQ2awJyLjWe3ZPdO.html

The notification will specify the total number of wards, including the new ones created and their boundaries.MC elections are slated to be held in September-October 2021. “The DC has held several rounds of meetings with district and senior UT officials. After final consent from UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, the new MC wards will be notified and objections invited.

After the objections are submitted and considered, the final delimitation of wards will be notified by the DC. The entire process is expected to take a couple of months. The last delimitation of wards was done in 2006 on the basis of the 2001 census. While the process for another delimitation was initiated in 2015 on the basis of the 2011 census, but it wasn’t completed as the issue of inclusion of all villages in the MC was still pending. At the time, the proposal was to increase the number of wards to 33.Currently 26 wardsCurrently, there are 26 wards in the MC, which cover sectors and nine villages. The process becomes crucial in the wake of the addition of 13 new villages under its jurisdiction last year.These villages are Bahlana, Raipur Khurd, Raipur Kalan, Makhan Majra, Daria, Mauli Jagran, Kishangarh, Kaimbwala, Khuda Ali Sher, Khuda Jassu, Khuda Lahora, Sarangpur and Dhanas. They have a population of more than 50,000.“All wards currently don’t have uniform population. This will be corrected after the delimitation process is completed, while incorporating the recently added villages,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/delimitation-chandigarh-mc-wards-set-to-increase/story-hsKDXMgdneUJ8akaCix4YO.html

18-11-2020||Chandigarh||Tenancy Act: Chandigarh admn sets ball rolling for rent authority||Turning down the suggestion of lawyers and tenant associations to keep tenancy related cases under the purview of judiciary instead of forming a rent authority, the Chandigarh administration has sent the draft Tenancy Act 2020 to the Centre.Confirming the development, Uma Shankar Gupta, additional secretary, estates, said: “After compiling the list of suggestions received and administration’s comments thereon, we have sent the draft of the Chandigarh Tenancy Act 2020 to the Centre for its approval.”The Act proposes to establish a framework for the regulation of tenancy matters (residential and commercial) and to balance the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants, including fast adjudication process for resolution of disputes.The key provision of the proposed Act is setting up of a rent authority, which will have exclusive jurisdiction over tenancy issues. All rent agreements will have to be submitted to this authority. The landowner and the tenant will have to separately file the particulars within a month of signing the agreement. Currently, these can be registered at the sub-registrar’s office.Power of adjudication key to the ActThe authority will adjudicate all disputes between a landlord and tenant. Currently, rent-related disputes are resolved by civil courts, where the pendency rate is high. Appeals against authority’s orders will be made in the rent court, headed by a senior judicial officer, and the case will have to be disposed of within 60 days. Against a rent court order, an appeal can be filed with the rent tribunal. “There was a suggestion from the lawyers’ body, objecting to the creation of the rent authority having exclusive adjudication powers over tenancy disputes and issues. The body suggested that the tenancy issues should be kept under the purview of civil courts only,” said Gupta.Commenting on the suggestion of lawyers, the administration has responded that the rent authority’s adjudication powers are necessitated as it would speed up the resolution of tenancy related disputes, and it is central to the creation of the new Tenancy Act. “All disputes between tenants and landlords will be decided in a timebound manner — within three months — by the Rent Authority. Here, simplified procedure will also ensure speedy relief to people,” it was stated.The Commercial Tenants’ Association in its objections to the draft Act had stated that the creation of a rent authority and rent court to be presided over by an executive officer was totally in contravention of the already existing procedure and adjudication of litigation.The proposed Act stipulates: “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in the areas to which this Act extends, only the rent court and no civil court shall have jurisdiction, to hear and decide the applications relating to disputes between landowner and tenant.”Making Act retrospective among 31 suggestionsThe proposed Act is only prospective in nature and will cover tenancy agreements that have taken place after it implementation.The draft Act states: “No person shall, after the commencement of this Act, let or take on rent any premises except by an agreement in writing.”The administration received 31 suggestions and objections to the draft Act.One suggestion was about making the Act retrospective. The administration has left it to the Centre to take a call on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tenancy-act-chandigarh-admn-sets-ball-rolling-for-rent-authority/story-bd8lSAhcbjXPxIp5G4Dx1M.html

The realtor had sought quashing of September 24 orders passed against it, arguing that the Punjab commission did not have complete quorum.

However, the high court bench of justice Anil Kshetarpal, while disposing of the pleas, said the firm has effective statutory alternative remedy of filing an appeal before the national commission instead. The bench also said that “the petitioner does not deserve the indulgence of the court”, particularly when, after receipt of almost entire payment towards price of the residential properties, it had failed to deliver possession in three cases.

18-11-2020||Gurugram||TERI report suggests recharge wells, revival of catchment areas to avoid flooding of Golf Course Road||An interim report by TERI School of Advanced Studies has recommended a range of sustainable solutions to conserve rainwater and prevent urban flooding of the Golf Course Road (GCR) and neighbouring localities. The measures include building recharge wells along the length of the Wazirabad bundh, establishing green corridors along existing drainage channels and reviving naturally existing catchment areas to hold water run-off during monsoon.TERI’s study was undertaken in the wake of unprecedented waterlogging in Gurugram on August 19, during which GCR was among the worst-affected areas. Titled “Blue Green interventions for addressing flooding along Golf Course Road and Neighbouring Sectors in Gurugram”, TERI’s study “investigates the causes of frequent flooding along Golf Course Road and the neighbouring sectors (26-56)”.Commissioned by IAmGurgaon — a city-based NGO behind eco-restoration projects such the Aravalli Biodiversity Park and the Wazirabad bundh — TERI’s study has also received the support of officials in the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG).Before the study, representatives from TERI and IAmGurgaon held meetings and conducted field visits with VS Kundu, chief executive officer, GMDA and Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG, to discuss the scope of the undertaking. The study has not been funded by either of these local bodies, although both received copies of the interim report on November 17.Kundu and Singh did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. However, a senior official in the GMDA’s infrastructure department, who is privy to the matter, said on the condition of anonymity, “We have had a cursory look at the report and are in agreement with the suggestions. Similar conclusions were made by the GMDA’s flood protection committee constituted after August 19, which is headed by HSVP’s former chief engineer KK Bhugra.”The report (a copy of which is also with HT) has two major areas of focus. The first is an assessment of four drainage channels that originate in the Aravallis just above the Golf Course Road, and traverse its carriageway before draining into a water body that collects along the nearby Chakkarpur-Wazirabad bundh. The first of these natural creeks, which is also the lowest lying, runs through Sector 26, while the other three are located in sectors 42, 54 and 56. These are classified as Creeks 1-4, respectively.Researchers from the School of Regional Water Studies at TERI-SAS conducted rainfall analysis, land-use mapping and run-off analyses in the project area, based on which they have proposed interventions to be undertaken along each of these four drains. As per the report, “Construction in the area gathered momentum in the last few years and some stretches of the creeks (specifically Creek 2) are found to be not fully functional.”To revive these drains, a series of nine rain gardens have been proposed to be built at the project site. These would involve planting native vegetation in naturally occurring depressions and low-lying areas to promote groundwater recharge and hold run-off from nearby roads and pavements. Of these, one rain garden has been proposed in Sector 26, three in Sector 42-43, two along the Sector 54 creek and three more along the Sector 56 creek.The report also recommends the revival of eight naturally existing catchment basins in the Aravalli foothills. Lying upstream from the Golf Course Road, these ponds can be used as storage points to hold the run-off before it reaches GCR. Researchers have further suggested that “the downstream portion of Creek 4 beyond Golf course road needs to be protected as a green corridor.”It has also recommended that these four creeks be widened and maintained as open, earthen drains. Conducting “soil enhancement” along these networks, the report suggests, would result in a higher “infiltration rate” and promote groundwater recharge.“It is important to note that these interventions have been made on the assumption of land availability, based on what GIS maps have shown. The report is only an interim one and the feasibility of these interventions will need further assessment. We have also yet to determine the carrying capacity of these four creeks, and a hydrogeology profile of underlying rock layers also needs to be studied. Our final report is still being prepared and will address some of these concerns,” said Dr Fauzia Tarannum, of the School of Regional Water Studies, TERI-SAS.Other than revival of these creeks, the other major intervention proposed by TERI-SAS includes the construction of 14 recharge wells — known as injection wells — along the length of the Wazirabad bundh, which is where water run-off collects. TERI’s interim report states, “On the Chakkarpur-Wazirabad Main Bund, recharge wells... parallel to the bund is suggested, with infiltration galleries (so that water reaches these wells). These recharge wells can be at points where the creeks join the Bund.”Researchers at TERI-SAS have also suggested that existing borewell locations in the study area be identified, which will help in determining the aquifer line, along the Chakkarpur Wazirabad bundh. At these locations, “large diameter shallow recharge wells” are suggested. “These well would explicitly facilitate groundwater recharge in the area, which is needed, given how the groundwater table has depleted in recent years. This is a more sustainable option than simply draining the water out,” said Tarannum, who is also an advisor with the district administration’s Gurujal society.A spokesperson for DLF Estate Developers Ltd, the private developer who is the custodian of GCR, said, “We are aware of the report’s findings and will work with the GMDA and other authorities to resolve this issue. We have already taken stock of the flooding situation that happened earlier in August, which was caused due to unprecedented rainfall and not any infrastructure deficiency. We will consider any suggestions that is in the interest of Gurgaon and its residents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/teri-report-suggests-recharge-wells-revival-of-catchment-areas-to-avoid-flooding-of-golf-course-road/story-NicfmdQdHjMy8leUqcRLML.html
18-11-2020||Gurugram||Only three contacts identified for each Covid-19 case in Gurugram||For every Covid-19 positive case reported in the district, three persons on an average are identified in the contact tracing exercise, according to the state health department data. It is less than the ideal contact tracing average, of at least 10 persons for each case, and the lowest among 22 districts in the state.Experts say the current pace of contact tracing in Gurugram is unsatisfactory, considering the accelerated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus.The contact tracing is a targeted approach to control the spread of disease. Close contacts of those who test positive for Covid-19 are identified and quarantined until they develop symptoms. The Niti Aayog, in a meeting held with the officials of Delhi-NCR, also emphasised on contact tracing, quarantine and isolation to control the record spike in cases.The data prepared by the state health department shows that for 39,000 positive cases detected in Gurugram, nearly 131,394 contacts were identified. Of these, only 129,875 could be traced, which is nearly 98.84%. Among these, over 61% (79,003) were high-risk contacts and 6% contacts were symptomatic. In about 4.5% of cases, no contacts were identified. Based on the figures, it was found that on an average, only 3.3 persons were identified in contact tracing for every positive case.Faridabad and Palwal also traced only four individuals, on an average, for each positive case. Other districts, such as Panipat, Jind, Panchkula and Charkhi Dadri, are tracing five persons, on an average, per each positive case. The findings show that Nuh does much better, with an average of 11 contacts traced for every positive case, followed by Sirsa, with at least 10 contacts.With Gurugram recording over 500 new infections every day, the highest among all districts, the health department is already facing challenges in timely contact tracing. The district health department has asked the state for additional workforce, including lab technicians and auxiliary nurse midwife (ANMs), as reported by HT on Wednesday, for timely testing of high-risk symptomatic contacts.“Gurugram has been reporting record spike in cases compared to other districts. It leads to pendency as tracing high-risk contacts within 72 hours becomes challenging,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.“The contact tracing activity and its data entry is a time-consuming process, which sometimes leads to delay due to limited staff. Therefore, we have requested for deputation of additional staff,” he said.As new infections have nearly doubled since mid-October, the health department has set a three-day target to complete the process.Contact tracing takes into account the people who have been in contact with a lab-confirmed case for more than 15 minutes and at a distance less than one metre. They have to be identified within 24 hours, with symptomatic to be isolated and others to be quarantined.“The outbreak can be controlled through proper contact tracing. It is poor and unsatisfactory if only three to four contacts are traced for every positive case. It means only family members are being considered in contact tracing. Studies show that in 15% of cases, high-risk contacts are mostly family members. Ideally, on an average 10 contacts per case should be identified,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine department and school of public health, PGIMER – Chandigarh.He said that testing based on tracing is a crucial strategy in controlling the epidemic.Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research said that only widespread testing helps in effective contact tracing. “If the weekly positivity rate is 18% then in every six tests one person is tested Covid-19 positive. The testing has to be increased based on the contacts of lab-confirmed cases, which should include 10 persons for every positive case. The overall testing has to be looked in the context of the people covered under the testing net and increasing positivity rate to slow down the active transmission of the virus.”Experts agreed that due to shortage of staff, proper contact tracing becomes a task. “It is difficult for the health department to alone conduct contact tracing of 700 cases every day. The task can be performed by non-medical professionals too, therefore, state administration should consider involving field staff of other government departments till the transmission is not controlled,” said Kumar.Currently, the health department has 206 rapid response teams (RRTs) — 163 in rural and 143 in urban areas — under different primary health centres (PHCs) on the task. It comprises ASHA, ANM or anganwadi workers, who are accompanied by a lab technician.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/only-three-contacts-identified-for-each-covid-19-case-in-gurugram/story-bJcl5tyqAo5hRdeSzBYmON.html

18-11-2020||City||Buyers allege developer sold units fraudulently, land lesser on ground than on paper, approach HC||Gurugram: Home buyers of the Godrej Icon project, located in Sector 88A and 89A, have alleged that the developer had sold the housing units by telling them that the land meant for the project was 9.385 acres but is less on the ground. Buyers, who have approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking relief, said that they had bought the properties because it was promised to be a low-density project with 40 housing units in an acre, while in reality the project allegedly has more than 50 units in an acre, said buyers. The project was launched in 2015 by Godrej Properties. Buyers said that putting faith in the corporate developer, a majority of them had paid around 80% of the amount within the next one-and-a-half years. “Towards the end of 2017, a meeting was called by the developer for change of the development plan, where objections were raised. This forced us to investigate the project as well and we obtained project documents, maps and building plans and digitised the same,” said Ajay Vohra, a buyer, who said that they were surprised to find that land for the project was allegedly less than six acres and that their land had been diverted for some other purpose.Vohra and other buyers also approached the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HRERA) in this matter, and from documents obtained from the authority and from the environment ministry, they found that the developer had allegedly submitted different land areas for the same project with different departments. “We want to leave the project, as what was promised in proposals and builder-buyer agreements is different from what is on offer. We did not get relief from the developer and authorities, and as such have filed a petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court,” alleged Vohra, adding that some of the land shown in the project plan was meant to be acquired by the state government for development of roads and other infrastructure.“I filed for withdrawal before HRERA, Gurugram which awarded me return of the principal amount, along with interest as on January 29, 2019, however, along with forfeiture, which was later found unjust and overturned by the HRERA Appellate Tribunal, which also the remanded the case back to the adjudicating officer for award of compensation, along with principal and interest amount,” said Anita Sardana, one of the petitioners.The developer, when asked about the matter, said that the project in question is developed in Sector 88A in Gurugram on a larger licensed land admeasuring 13.759 acres, comprising two phases – Godrej Icon and Godrej Oasis. The area of the project on ground is in accordance with the area mentioned in the buyers’ agreement, the developer said.“Both the projects have been completed and delivered strictly in consonance with the approved sanction plans. No part of the project land is acquired by the government and with respect to the same, we would like to bring forth that the allegations made against us seem to be misconceived. We would also want to state that we are not in receipt of any notice with regards to this petition before the Punjab and Haryana High Court. As a responsible developer, we believe in full compliance with the legal requirements as per the stated norms of the state and are confident of the correctness of our action and the merits of our case,” said Subhasish Pattanaik, region head-NCR 1, Godrej Properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/buyers-allege-developer-sold-units-fraudulently-land-lesser-on-ground-than-on-paper-approach-hc/story-HlH9dcGaYoC45G9HQNKBvK.html
18-11-2020||Gurugram||Bodies of two men found on expressway||Two men were found lying dead on the road, on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, near Kherki Daula, in the early hours of Wednesday, said the police. Officers said that the autopsy confirmed that the victims were in an inebriated state but the motive behind the deaths was yet to be ascertained. According to the police, they were informed by a commuter around 4.30am that two bodies were lying on the road and one of them had no clothes on. A team from the Kherki Daula police station and a forensic team were sent. The victims had severe injuries all over their body and head, possibly inflicted with a blunt object, said officers.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said they were still trying to ascertain the cause of death and they did not find anything crucial to establish the motive. Police said a preliminary probe suggests that the men were either hit by an unidentified vehicle or were killed by someone in a robbery attempt. “The stretch is isolated and a few cases have been reported here in the past of loot and snatching. We have roped in crime teams to investigate the reason for the deaths,” he said. Police recovered a motorcycle from near the spot and after examining it, police said it didn’t seem as if the deceased were rammed by any vehicle as it is not damaged from any side.The victims were identified as Dheeraj Sunder (24) of Siwan in Bihar, and Salim (22) of Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh. Police said both were friends and lived in different rented accommodations in Shivaji Park and Devi Lal colony. Dheeraj’s body was found unclad and his clothes were not found at the spot, the police said.The ACP said Salim worked in a private company in Manesar and Dheeraj had set up a vegetable shop in his colony.The family members of the victims have alleged foul play and demanded that the suspects involved be identified and arrested. “If it were an accident then where did the clothes go? His wallet and watch are also missing,” said Shyam Sunder, father of Dheeraj.Police said they found one mobile phone from the spot and informed the family, who told the police that they both were partying until late night at a friend’s place near Kherki Daula, and that Dheeraj had gone to drop Salim to Rajeev Chowk but didn’t return. The ACP said that the bodies were handed over to the family after autopsy, on Wednesday afternoon. According to the autopsy, the cause of death was head injuries possibly inflicted by a blunt object. A case was registered against unidentified persons under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code at Kherki Daula police station on Wednesday, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/bodies-of-two-men-found-on-expressway/story-LjNpZqfLIz3utP5kYHYrLK.html

DTCP officials said that the enforcement team along with a large police contingent reached the area around 11am and shop owners an hour to remove their goods. However, owners and local residents started protesting and raised slogans against the authorities. It was only after intervention by the police personnel that the demolition drive started around an hour later, said DTCP officials. “The shops were constructed illegally and without any permission. Despite that, owners were given time to remove their stock so that they don’t suffer losses. The demolition was carried out for around four hours in which 30 shops were demolished,” said Bhath. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, enforcement, said that a detailed survey was conducted prior to demolition and the drive was carried out only after verification of land and ownership. “We have repeatedly asked people not to invest in illegal properties as these can be demolished anytime,” he said. In a related development, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran on Wednesday removed the encroachments from a site for cremation ground in Sector 52A, on the directions of Vivek Kalia, estate officer, II, Gurugram. This site will be handed over to DLF Foundation for the construction of a modern cremation ground under corporate social responsibility, said officials. HSVP officials said that the 6.5-acre site was encroached and hutments had been constructed on it, which were removed by the enforcement team with the help of police personnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-razes-30-illegal-shops-in-sector-68/story-n9HBMuiDPlKIj6PgraP5CI.html
18-11-2020||Gurugram||Land for Delhi-Gurugram-SNB rail corridor project to be transferred||In a major fillip to the Delhi-Gurugram-SNB Regional Rapid Transport System (RRTS) project, the Haryana government on Wednesday directed the transfer of 31 hectares at Dharuhera to National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) for the construction of a rail depot, required for operation and maintenance of the entire network. The decision to transfer the land was taken during a state-level meeting in Chandigarh, in which officials of the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikarn (HSVP), Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (HVPNL) and NCRTC discussed various issues pertaining to the rapid rail project. The meeting was chaired by the principal secretary, department of town and country planning, AK Singh. NCRTC, which is developing the 107-kilometre Delhi-Gurugram-Behror section of the rapid rail, has sought 74 hectares of land at Dharuhera, but, at present, only 31 hectares are set to be transferred as the remaining land is under litigation, said officials, who added that efforts are on to get the remaining land out of arbitration. The 107-kilometre high-speed rail network will commence at Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi and terminate at SNB (Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror) station in Rajasthan, passing through Gurugram. The network will have four stations in Delhi, eight in Gurugram, three in Rewari and one in Rajasthan. Of the total network, 73 kilometres will be elevated, while 34 kilometres will be underground, as per the project proposal. Jitender Yadav, HSVP administrator, Gurugram, who was in Chandigarh for the meeting, confirmed that directions have been issued for the transfer of land at Dharuhera to NCRTC for construction of rail depot. “A proposal to transfer land will be sent to HSVP headquarters in Chandigarh and after getting approval, this land will be transferred at the earliest,” he said. Officials also discussed the transfer of HSVP land in Sector 22 for construction of a rapid rail station and for giving passing rights to RRTS corridor near Signature Tower, where it plans to construct a pillar on the land where a Japanese hostel is present. Referring to the transfer of land for the rapid rail station, Yadav said that a site visit will be soon conducted with NCRTC officials in this regard to assess the feasibility, after which the process to transfer land will be initiated. A senior official who attended the meeting said, on the condition of anonymity, said that NCRTC officials were also asked to ensure that the alignment of the RRTS project is done in such a manner that it has a minimum impact on the HSVP land and other stakeholders. In the meeting, directions were also issued to HVPNL, the power utility, to expedite the process of raising 12 high-tension power lines, which are infringing the Delhi-SNB corridor. It was also decided that a proposal for transferring land near Jwala Mill in Udyog Vihar, for casting yards, would be expedited, the official cited above said. NCRTC officials, when asked about the matter, said that the meeting on Wednesday was positive and they expected the transfer of land at Dharuhera and other places soon. “The process to seek land and other permission in advance is to ensure that there are no hitches during the project construction. NCRTC is presently carrying out the pre-construction activities on the Delhì-Gurugram-SNB corridor, including shifting of high-tension lines, seeking no-objection certificates, etc. Civil construction will be started without any delay, once this RRTS project gets the sanction,” said Puneet Vats, NCRTC spokesperson. The NCRTC plans to construct the RRTS corridor in three phases. In the first phase, a 107-km stretch from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to SNB Urban Complex (Shahjahanpur-Neemrana-Behror), i.e, just ahead of Bawal (Haryana), touching various regional nodes like Gurugram, Manesar, Panchgaon and Rewari en route, will be constructed. In the second phase, the line would be extended from SNB to Sotanala, with Shahjahanpur, Neemrana and Behror in between and in the third phase, the stretch from SNB to Alwar will be constructed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/land-for-delhi-gurugram-snb-rail-corridor-project-to-be-transferred/story-TjPBQQlioHLVDFTk06AeLO.html

On Sunday night, an argument over parking a car at a public place in the village turned ugly, with 30 persons breaking into the house of a former sarpanch and attacking the family. A police case was registered following the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/bhamrauli-attack-family-seeks-protection-fearing-retaliation/story-hunOXlHWUeHIwoOuDFF6WJ.html
18-11-2020||Gurugram||Police to check Covid protocols at pubs, bars||The police on Wednesday formed 50 teams to conduct surprise checks at pubs, bars and restaurants across the city to find out if social distancing is being maintained there. The police said these checks will be in addition to the regular checks at markets and other public places that are carried out on a daily basis. Senior officials said they are checking these establishments to ensure they are taking necessary precautions and complying with the Covid-19 protocols. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that there has been a spike in the coronavirus cases and it has been observed that many people are not wearing masks, infecting others too. “This drive is important as people have started moving out for get-togethers and parties in large groups. Many establishments are also not maintaining social distancing and they are not following the guidelines, resulting to spread of the virus,” he said. The teams will visit popular hot spots like Sector 29, Cyber Hub, Horizon 1 and Sohna Road, which are hubs of restaurants and bars, frequented by thousands on a daily basis. The teams will keep a check on visitors and the number of people visiting a pub and bar, besides checking if all precautions are being taken. The visitors will also be monitored by the police.

18-11-2020||Gurugram||Air quality at ‘moderate’ for first time in three weeks||Air quality in the city improved to the ‘moderate’ category of the air quality index (AQI) for the first time in at least three weeks on Wednesday, with a reading of 146 on the CPCB’s daily pollution bulletin. This was down from Wednesday’s AQI of 204, when the city was engulfed in ‘poor’ air. Experts and officials attributed the dip in pollution levels to favourable wind direction and speed, which helped to sustain dispersal of pollutants from Gurugram. Pollution levels in the city have recorded a sustained decline since November 15. The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 175 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Monday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. This is down from about 399 µg/m³ on November 15. The permissible limit for PM2.5, however, is 60µg/m³.As a result, Gurugram was the least polluted among other major cities in the National Capital Region (NCR) on Wednesday, with Delhi, Noida, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida all recording ‘poor’ air, with AQI readings in excess of 200. On Tuesday, while Gurugram recorded poor air, other major NCR cities had recorded moderate air.As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, a further dip in pollution levels is expected across the region on Thursday. As per official forecasts, “The air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to remain in moderate category on 19.11.2020 and moderate to poor category on 20.11.2020.”Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, said, “The specific direction of the wind on Wednesday was favourable to Gurugram, which received strong winds from the direct north. The wind speeds also went up from 8 to 10kmph on Tuesday, touching about 12kmph, which helped dispersal of pollutants. The influence of these winds may not have been as much over Delhi and other parts of NCR, which allowed pollutants to accumulate in the capital and places like Noida and Ghaziabad, pushing the air quality there back into the poor category.” On Wednesday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 24.1 degrees Celsius, down from 24.6 degrees Celsius a day prior and a minimum temperature of 12 degrees Celsius, down from 14.2 degrees Celsius a day before. As per the weekly IMD forecast, partly cloudy skies are expected to prevail on Thursday. While the maximum temperature is expected to remain between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius over the next week, official forecasts predict that nighttime temperatures will plunge to 10 degrees Celsius by November 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-at-moderate-for-first-time-in-three-weeks/story-rHBWrDYpG3uNQDLeXI80UK.html

18-11-2020||City||Ludhiana MC employees fleece visitors at parking lots||Despite the tall claims of officials of the municipal corporation (MC), employees of parking lots continue to fleece visitors.The illegal practice is being done right under the nose of the senior MC officials as Rs 50 instead of Rs 20 is being charged for car parking at the multi-storey parking lot near the MC headquarters - MC Zone A office near Mata Rani chowk. Further, Rs 20 is being charged for two-wheeler parking against the approved fee of Rs 10. E-ticketing machines have been provided to the staff but manual receipts are being issued at most points. Similarly, Rs 30 and Rs 20 are being charged at Bhadaur house parking lot for car and two-wheeler parking respectively. Receipts are only issued to visitors when they ask for it at the BRS Nagar and Bhadaur house parking lots. At Feroze Gandhi market parking lot, some unidentified persons are also involved in the collection of parking fees but no action is being taken by the MC.The parking contracts of six parking lots including multi-storey parking near MC Zone A office, Model Town Extension (tuition market), BRS Nagar (near orient cinema), Sarabha Nagar market block-I, Bhadaur house and Feroze Gandhi market expired last month and the lots are now being managed by the civic body as it has failed to allot the new contracts as of now. A shopkeeper in Chaura Bazar, Jaspreet Singh said, “It is a complete nuisance and the MC staff is also involved in the entire nexus. Tall claims are made by the MC that e-ticketing has been implemented at the lots but its own staff issues manual receipts that too when someone asks for it. The residents are left a harried lot as even the senior MC officials and politicians are hand in gloves with the parking mafia. The staff deployed at the multi-storey parking lot charge Rs 50 for car parking and the residents are left with no other option but to pay as there is no other parking available in the nearby areas.”The MC employees also misbehave with visitors if questions are raised over overcharging and non-issuance of receipts.A resident of BRS Nagar Satinder Singh said, “Apart from fleecing, the MC employees also misbehave with visitors if they oppose overcharging. Residents are left with no other option than to face harassment at the parking lots.”MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “I have not received any complaint against overcharging till now and I will direct the concerned officials to check the illegal practice. If any staff member is caught fleecing residents, strict action will be taken against him.” BOX Parking fee:Two wheeler : Rs 10Four wheeler : Rs 20Small commercial vehicle: Rs 50Big commercial vehicle/trucks: Rs 100||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-employees-fleece-visitors-at-parking-lots/story-b3LQZHcxrfTwGCkkazlWfN.html
18-11-2020||Chandigarh||CBI wants trial to resume in three Chandigarh cases stayed by HC over six months ago||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed applications in the bureau’s special court seeking resumption of trial proceedings in three cases put on stay by the Punjab and Haryana high court over six months ago.The pleas come following a Supreme Court order directing magistrates all over the country to “go ahead with trial on the expiry of six months of the stay order passed by any court, including high court.”There are at least nine high-profile cases, sub-judice in the special CBI court, that have been on stay for over six months.Of these three involve Satish Kumar Paddam, the then executive engineer, Panjab University; Shilpy Pattar, the then SDM (East) and Naveen Sharma, the then sub-inspector (SI) with economic offences wing (EOW).In July 2010, Paddam and PU’s then sub-divisional engineer Nand Lal Kaushal were booked for taking Rs 35,000 bribe from a man carrying out renovation work at PU.The case was stayed by HC on July 13, 2018.“The case is in its final stage, as the prosecution witnesses have been examined and defence arguments have concluded. But, Paddam moved an application in HC, stating that voice samples were taken in police custody. On July 13, 2018, he got a stay from the court,” said a court official.After CBI moved a plea to resume trial recently, Paddam, in his reply to court on November 18, sought the application’s dismissal, citing the Covid pandemic as one of the reasons.Another case, where CBI filed an application, dates back to 2012.In September 2012, EOW SI Naveen Sharma was arrested for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs 10 lakh from an accused in a case. As per CBI, Sharma was investigating a high-profile case registered on the complaint of former Punjab IAS officer Gurnihal Singh Pirzada.The third case, involving Shilpy Pattar, has been on stay since August 16, 2018.Pattar, a Haryana Civil Services (HCS) officer, who was deputed in Chandigarh, had allegedly demanded Rs 5 lakh as bribe for de-sealing a showroom in Sector 26. After negotiations, the deal was allegedly struck at Rs 2 lakh, of which Rs 50,000 were to be paid on August 5. But, a CBI team raided her house and recovered the money.“She approached HC seeking discharge from the allegations on two grounds. Firstly, that her voice samples were taken forcibly in CBI custody and that these should not be played out as it leads to self-incrimination. Then, she moved a civil writ stating that sanctioning authority did not apply its mind while giving sanction to prosecute her,” said a CBI official.CBI’s plea to continue the trial is listed for November 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cbi-wants-trial-to-resume-in-three-chandigarh-cases-stayed-by-hc-over-six-months-ago/story-5erYMTO0q4vyersN0pswXK.html

The authorities were criticised as a large number of unauthorised advertisement boards were installed at the shops situated near the MC headquarters.Recently, the MC house had also approved a resolution to impose a penalty of up to Rs 50,000 against illegal hoardings/advertisement. But the civic body is yet to receive final approval from the local bodies department for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-removes-unauthorised-ad-boards-installed-at-shops/story-ZOrYq4FqGm1pwnfi3KI80J.html

The university has been facing financial difficulties and Ghuman had been unable to get the institution out of the mess it was in, since taking charge in 2017.He submitted his resignation to Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore, who is the chancellor of the university. Badnore forwarded the resignation to the Punjab chief secretary and the chief principal secretary to the CM.In his resignation sent on November 17 (Tuesday), Ghuman has cited personal reasons for the decision. He has thanked the Punjab chief minister for giving him a chance to serve the university and also granting him the extension in service of three years in September. He then lists his achievements, before concluding by writing, “Due to personal reasons, I am not keen to continue.”Ghuman was under pressure as his loyalists had turned foes and launched an indefinite protest against him over issues like timely payment of salaries and some of his administrative decisions. He also failed to take action against guilty officials and faculty members, who had been indicted in inquiries.He was perceived as passing the buck, even as the Punjab government was pushing him to take action against persons who had been illegally recruited by violating the norms of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and on the basis of fake caste certificates.Ghuman had also been demanding a one-time help of Rs 300 crore from the state government to bail out the university, which is under a debt of Rs 150 crore. His decision not to attend office, even as the lockdown had been lifted also drew severe criticism.Ghuman didn’t take calls. Higher education secretary Rahul Bhandari confirmed that he had received Ghuman’s resignation. “The government will take a decision on it,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjabi-university-v-c-ghuman-resigns/story-Dlf8g7gXyRkZGiS0Ole5RI.html
18-11-2020||Chandigarh||‘Will think over passenger trains if Centre allows goods trains’: Punjab’s agitating farmers||Condemning the BJP-led central government for its “stubborn” attitude, various Punjab farmers’ bodies on Wednesday said if the Centre starts running goods trains in the state, they will think of allowing passenger trains.Addressing the media after a meeting here, farmer leaders insisted they will continue with their agitation against the new farm laws.“The Centre has adopted a stubborn attitude towards Punjab and its farmers, traders and labourers and we condemn the central government’s attitude,” said farmer leader Ruldu Singh.He said it had been nearly a month since goods train service has been stopped in the state. “The Central government should run (goods) trains first and then we will hold an emergency meeting in which we could think over passenger trains,” said Punjab Kisan Union Singh.“We will think over passenger trains if the Centre allows goods trains,” he asserted.The Railways had declined to resume goods train operation in Punjab, saying it would either operate both freight and passenger trains or none.Farmers held a meeting here days after a meeting with Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Prakash in Delhi that remained inconclusive. Singh said farmers, traders and labourers were adversely affected because of the Centre’s “stubborn” attitude.He further said representatives of 30 farmers’ organisations were ready to go to Delhi by tractors for holding a protest on November 26 and 27 against the new farm laws.“Lakhs of our farmers will go (to Delhi) by tractors,” he said.Asked that they were denied permission for holding a protest in Delhi on account of coronavirus, he described it as an “excuse.” “They give permission or not, we are fully prepared to go to Delhi,” he said.A ‘Delhi Chalo’ protest call has been given by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a body of more than 200 farmers’ organisations across the country.To another question, he said farmers have been holding protests outside the residences of several BJP leaders in the state.Asked whether they will gherao BJP president J P Nadda if he comes to Punjab, Singh said they will definitely do so.Nadda will digitally inaugurate 10 district offices of the party on November 19 and he would soon undertake a three-day tour to the state to take stock of the preparations and to galvanise party workers for the 2022 Punjab assembly polls, BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh had said on November 16.Farmers in Punjab have expressed apprehension that the new farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates. They have been demanding that these new laws should be repealed.Farmers had resorted to ‘rail roko’ agitation and staged sit-ins outside some shopping malls, toll plazas and outside the residences of BJP leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-think-over-passenger-trains-if-centre-allows-goods-trains-punjab-s-agitating-farmers/story-1ISrAva43wMQAsrcPpwo1N.html

18-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab to launch special scheme for physically challenged||The state cabinet on Wednesday cleared a new scheme, the Punjab Divyangjan Shaktikaran Yojna (PDSY), to be implemented in a phased manner with the first phase of the scheme aimed at strengthening the existing programmes to ensure their benefits reach people with disabilities In the second phase, 13 new interventions are proposed to be undertaken for the empowerment of such persons. This was decided at a virtual cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh in Chandigarh. The scheme will fill the backlog of people with disabilities (PwDs) in government jobs as the department of employment generation will give thrust on filling vacant posts of PwDs in six months. A consultative group headed by the minister for social security and women and child development, with all cabinet ministers as members will supervise the implementation of the scheme. In Phase-I, the scheme will focus on providing PwDs the benefits of existing schemes being run by government departments, covering services, benefits and rights in respect of healthcare, education, employment, safety and dignity in all spheres of life. Phase-II of the PDSY shall have new initiatives and programmes to cover those aspects and needs which have hitherto not been covered under any existing centrally/state sponsored scheme or PwD-oriented schemes by different departments. The scheme focuses on convergence and integration of existing schemes and programmes to maximise their benefit for PwDs. In Phase-II, the 13 interventions include the treatment on suffering disability, mobility aids and assistive devices, five days of special leave in a calendar year, free education, empowerment of disabled girl students, recreational activities, home schooling for children with special needs, and state award for outstanding work done by teachers with disability. Rules amended to give jobs to siblings of Galwan heroes The cabinet approved amendment to rules to provide jobs in the state services to married siblings of three bachelor battle casualties of the Galwan Valley. The decision was taken in recognition of the supreme sacrifice made by sepoy Gurtej Singh, sepoy Gurbinder Singh and lance naik Saleem Khan. According to existing rules, only dependent family members or next of kin of battle casualties are eligible for jobs, but in the case of these three men, since no dependent family member exists, the government decided to make an exception and give jobs to their married brothers. The spokesperson said that Gurpreet Singh, the brother of sepoy Gurtej Singh; Gurpreet Singh, the brother of sepoy Gurbinder Singh; and Niyamat Ali, the brother of lance naik Saleem Khan, had applied for appointment in the state services despite not falling under the definition of dependent members of war heroes. More posts for govt medical colleges in Patiala, Amritsar To effectively cope with the Covid-19 pandemic, the cabinet approved the creation of 16 posts of assistant professor (super specialist) in the departments of cardiology, endocrinology, neurology and nephrology of the government medical colleges of Patiala and Amritsar. Temporary conversion of 25 vacant posts of direct quota of super-specialist professor and associate professor to assistant professor on contract in these two GMCs was also approved. The filling of 168 posts of technician in paramedical cadres in these medical colleges was also approved. Of these, 98 posts will be created and 70 vacant posts will be revived.Rules for availing 2% addl borrowing amended To obtain additional borrowing of 2% of the GSDP, the cabinet amended the Inter-State Migrant Workers (Regulation of Employment & Condition of Service) Punjab Rules, 1983. Acceding to the demands raised by industrialists at various platforms, the cabinet decided to insert Rule 53A in the Inter-State Migrant Workers (Regulation of Employment & Condition of Service) Punjab Rules, 1983, to allow maintaining prescribed registers in electronic/digital format to reduce the compliance burden of industries. Instructions for additional borrowing of 2% of GSDP were received from the Union finance ministry (department of expenditure) on May 17 in which certain conditions were imposed for obtaining additional 2% borrowing. One of the conditions was to have automatic renewals under the labour laws. Prison development board rules approved The cabinet approved the Punjab Prisons Development Board Rules, 2020, under the Punjab Prisons Development Board Act, 2020 (Punjab Act No. 10 of 2020), for carrying out the objectives of the board to ensure its smooth day-to-day functioning. 20% hike in salary of OSDs approved An increase of 20%, from Rs 50,000 to Rs 60,000 as fixed remuneration payable to OSDs (litigation) in different state departments was cleared. Eleven temporary posts of OSD (litigation) had been created in the Punjab civil secretariat in the office of chief secretary, departments of general administration, home affairs and justice, water resources, social justice, empowerment and minorities, rural development and panchayat, food civil supplies and consumer affairs, public works, water supply and sanitation, health and family welfare and education. Initially, a fixed salary of Rs 35,000 was given to the OSD (litigation). Thereafter, as per the decision taken in the cabinet meeting on December 5, 2016, the salary of OSD (litigation) was increased from Rs 35,000 to Rs 50,000 per month. After 2016, no increase has been made in this fixed salary/retainership fee. Single-window policy for telecom infrastructure With a view to creating robust telecom infrastructure with adequate bandwidth to promote information technology, e-governance and e-commerce in the state, the cabinet approved new guidelines under a single-window policy to replace the existing norms. The new guidelines will supersede the telecom policy notified on December 5, 2013, and December 11, 2015. This decision would enable speedier permissions for the installation of telecom towers/masts/poles and right of way (row) clearances for laying optical fiber cables. There would be no NOC requirement from AAI and NOC from the Punjab Pollution Control Board for installing generator sets. According to the new policy, online clearances will be given through the Punjab Business First Portal. State agricultural education Act deferred to June 2021 In view of the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the cabinet decided to defer implementation of the Punjab State Council for Agricultural Education Act, 2017, till June 30, 2021. The objective of the council is to specify the minimum standards and guidelines for imparting agricultural education and training in state colleges and universities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-to-launch-special-scheme-for-physically-challenged/story-DDl6O9lGMhxvZtOK2oetrM.html

18-11-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Govt encourages women’s self-help groups to boost Covid-19-hit economy||Self-help groups (SHGs) for women, especially in the hilly areas of Uttarakhand, are playing a major role in reviving the Covid-19-hit economy. Identifying their potential in boosting the economy, the government has also taken some significant steps to encourage these SHGs. Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has also been emphasising on involving more women SHGs in economic activities. Traditionally, women in hilly areas of the state are majorly involved in agricultural activities, which Rawat said the government wants to change, by providing them skill development training through the rural growth centres and centres of excellence. According to government officials, there are at least 30,000 SHGs involved in various economic activities ranging from producing organic agricultural products to making puja material and prasad for the shrines of Kedarnath and Badrinath. Also Read: ICAR looks at bringing agri-education in sync with National Education PolicyAlok Bhatt, chief minister Rawat’s economic advisor, said that the government is taking major steps to increase women’s involvement in the state’s economic activities. “Their role cannot be ignored at all because the state itself was formed majorly due to their struggle. Also, they play an important role in almost all economic activities in the hilly areas,” said Bhatt. “Keeping all this in mind, the government has taken various important steps like providing the SHGs interest-free loans of up to Rs5 lakh and even directly buying their products worth up to Rs1 lakh. This is meant to promote them and involve more women in economic activities,” he added. “In the state foundation day event held in the summer capital of Gairsain, he had said that he wants to remove the bundle of hay from the heads of women in hilly areas by providing them skill development training. This would help them find a livelihood apart from just cutting grass for cattle of working in fields,” he said. Stressing the importance of SHGs, the chief minister’s economic advisor also informed that the rural growth centres opened by the government in migration-affected areas of the state also largely dependent on the SHGs. “Centres which focus on various economic activities like running a collective dairy, poultry farm or wool collection centre majorly involve women. The government believes that if the women are able to generate income, then their family’s financial condition will improve, which in turn will improve the economic condition of the state,” said Bhatt. Hailing the role of women and women-centric SHGs in boosting the state economy, MC Sati, an economic expert and professor of Economics in Garhwal Central University, Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal district, said, “Women in the state contribute to 56% of labour, which is the highest rate in the country. So, their role in economic development can’t be ignored.” “Also, with the migration of male members of the family from hilly areas, women are the ones who are involved in all economic activities like agricultural labour and selling of agricultural produce. They are the backbone of the hill economy,” said Sati, adding that promoting SHGs will largely help in improving the economy amid the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-govt-encourages-women-s-self-help-groups-to-boost-covid-19-hit-economy/story-HFcHyJdooMfFkM00sBwXiO.html

They had removed him from various committees.

It was then taken to Keoratala crematorium as thousands of people, including Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and senior Left leaders, walked in a procession. He was cremated with full state honours.“We think Soumitra Babu’s vast experience could have been used in a better way by this government but he was kept out of the state’s key committees on art and culture,” Chowdhury said.The state government should take an initiative to build an archive of the Dada Saheb Phalke awardee’s life and works, the Baharampur MP said.When asked about Chowdhury’s criticism of the state government, Basu said, “We don’t want to get into all these.” A TMC leader, however, termed Chowdhury’s criticism as “extremely unfortunate and in poor taste”.“While everyone in West Bengal grieved on the day of Soumitra Chatterjee’s death, many hit the streets to bid adieu to ‘Apu’ but Chowdhury has chosen the occasion to do politics after three days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-govt-did-cheap-politics-with-soumitra-chatterjee-s-body-alleges-cong-s-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury/story-rBvqE765Oa0LgrypfPSTDK.html

18-11-2020||Mumbai||Bhima Koregaon case: Varavara Rao to be shifted to Nanavati Hospital for 15 days||The Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the transfer of jailed ailing Telugu poet P Varavara Rao, 81, from Mumbai’s Taloja Prison to the Nanavati Hospital for 15 days for his proper medical care. The order was issued in response to an interim prayer of Rao’s wife, P Hemlatha, who sought the transfer.Lawyer Indira Jaising earlier told the court that Rao’s condition was deteriorating and his family feared he could die if he is not shifted to the hospital. She also sought interim relief in the form of bail citing Rao’s condition. The court said it will hear the bail plea on December 9 while seeking Rao’s medical report after he is shifted and treated at the Nanavati Hospital. It added Rao should not be discharged without informing the court.Rao is among over a dozen scholars and rights activists arrested for their alleged links with Maoists and for allegedly instigating violence at Bhima Koregaon near Pune in 2018. The violence was triggered during the 200th-anniversary celebration of a battle where Dalits fought with British forces and defeated an upper-caste ruler. The activists are accused of making provocative speeches that allegedly triggered the violence.Also Read: Maharashtra govt says Varavara Rao ‘fully conscious’, HC seeks reportsHemlatha moved the court last week after learning about Rao’s deteriorating health at the prison hospital and that it did not have the required facilities to treat him.Jaising submitted that when Rao was arrested two years ago, he was healthy. She added his condition deteriorated inside the jail and he had to be admitted to the jail hospital. Jaising said co-accused Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira took care of Rao but they are not medically trained. She added that the discharge reports of Rao after his previous hospitalisations were not provided to his family and it is clueless about his condition. Jaising blamed the state’s negligence for a head injury Rao has suffered while arguing for the need to shift her client to the Nanavati Hospital.Jaising said Rao’s mental health was failing and his ability to eat was also compromised. She added due to other complications, his proper care could be taken only at a super specialty hospital like Nanavati. Jaising said video consultations by the Nanavati doctors were insufficient and he needed to be examined physically for his neurological and urology problems.Jaising submitted Rao earlier tested positive for Covid-19 and that his family was worried that he may suffer complications in the form of organ failure given his age.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for the National Investigation Agency, opposed the plea and said that Rao could be shifted to J J Hospital as all the tests could be conducted there as it is well-equipped.The court observed that government hospitals were overburdened due to Covid-19 and asked Singh whether he will admit his relatives to J J or St George’s hospitals. He responded by saying that it was not that people were not being admitted and treated there. Singh added shifting Rao to the Nanavati Hospital would set a wrong precedent and hence it was better to shift him to a government hospital.Jaising objected and said Rao’s family found him earlier in a pitiable condition at the J J Hospital. She added he was lying in a pool of urine, which indicated the government hospital was unable to take Rao’s proper care.Jaising said if Rao died for the want of proper medical treatment, it would amount to custodial death. She wondered who would be held responsible for it. “Death is inevitable but there should be some dignity. It is an emotional matter.”She referred to Rao’s latest medical report from the Nanavati Hospital and added it suggested he may have brain atrophy, which could result in organ failure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhima-koregaon-case-hc-directs-maharashtra-to-shift-varavara-rao-to-hospital-for-15-days/story-JqwIm9FSmiJ5CDMVC7kV3J.html

The girl played with us till Monday evening and later had to be admitted following complaints of loose motion,” Gurvinder Kaur, manager of SAA Sahyog Village in Sonari locality here, said. She said food poisoning was unlikely to be the cause less as the infants were fed only lactogen and no other food. “We presently have 18 infants at Sahyog Village in Jamshedpur. Such incidents had never happened earlier here. The deceased girl was from an unwed mother whose delivery was arranged by us while the deceased boy was found abandoned near Baug-E-Jamshed here,” said Gurvinder, adding that she had verbally informed the concerned officials after admitting the girl on Monday late evening.Sahyog Village is a Delhi-based NGO run by philanthropist Dr Mankeet Singh ‘Pardeshi’ which runs state government aided SAAs – Sahyog Villages – in Jamshedpur, Ranchi, Khunti, Bokaro and Simdega.Also Read: Chhath Puja: UP govt urges people to celebrate at home, follow Covid protocolEarlier, Sahyog Village centre in Khunti had to be closed down following the deaths of two infants due to underweight complications in August 2018.

He said he will request them to allow the puja with certain riders and guidelines.Prakash said a number of people from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh live in Delhi and Chhath is one of their most important and popular festivals.

18-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: No lockdown, but there may be local restrictions, says Delhi health minister||The Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said that there will be no lockdown in Delhi, but “local restrictions” are likely at some places. His statement comes a day after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had written to the centre seeking permission to lock down markets if they turn into hot spots. Experts have blamed the current surge in the number of cases on people crowding in market places. This comes even as Delhi recorded fewer cases for three days on account of lower testing during festivals and holidays. The health minister, however, claimed that not only are the absolute number of cases in decline, but the positivity rate – which had touched a high of 15.33% during this surge – is also on the decline. Also Read: From over 3,700 Covid-19 cases to 6,396 in 24 hours: Delhi’s rising numbers explained“We are still in the third wave of infections, but the peak has been crossed,” the minister had said on Tuesday. So far, the highest number of new cases recorded in a day has been 8,593 on November 11. On Tuesday, 6,396 cases were reported with just over 49,000 tests, as per the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. On average, 54,000 tests were being conducted each day before Diwali. There were also 99 deaths reported on Tuesday, taking the total death toll due to the infection in the city to 7,812. The minister has maintained that masks are better at preventing the spread of the infection than lockdown. “The lockdown had been an experiment and what we have learnt from it is that wearing masks can give us the same benefits. Scientifically, masks are the best way to stop the virus. The lowest positivity rates are recorded in Covid-19 hospitals because the doctors there follow precautions. If everyone follows precautions, the spread of the infection can be prevented. And, despite a lockdown, some people still go out and can bring the infection back to their family members,” he had said on Monday. To control further spread, the city will also focus on increased testing. The number of tests will soon be scaled up to 100,000 to 120,000 a day from the current average of about 54,000. Ten mobile laboratories will be deployed by the central government, 10,000 more tests will be done in laboratories of health ministry and ICMR, and another 1,000 tests will be done in science institutions. The minister also said that celebrating Chhath Puja could lead to the spread, hence restrictions have been imposed. “The virus can spread easily due to large gatherings during Chhath Puja, hence the restrictions,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-lockdown-but-there-may-be-local-restrictions-says-delhi-health-minister/story-lGB5KIxE4KKx6AHrqXz7MJ.html

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday forecast a gradual fall in temperature by two to four degrees Celsius this week. “Under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, light isolated to scattered rain/snow is very likely over the western Himalayan region from November 18 to 20,” the IMD has forecast. Himachal Pradesh meteorological department director Manmohan Singh said that the weather is expected to remain sunny in the state on Wednesday but snowfall at isolated places in the higher reaches is likely on November 19, 22 and 23, while rainfall will occur in the middle hills on November 23. The minimum temperature in Shimla was 4.8°C, while Kufri, the popular tourist destination near the state capital, recorded a low of 0.4°C.

18-11-2020||Environment||Maharashtra: Uran to get its first mangrove park by June 2021||The Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), the largest port container terminal in India, plans to build a 200-hectare (ha) mangrove park at Belpada in Navi Mumbai’s Uran by June 2021.The area, along with other eco-sensitive zones in Uran, has faced the problem of debris dumping that has threatened mangrove patches in the Raigad district. The development of a mangrove park, the first in Uran, has been a longstanding demand by environmentalists. It has also been suggested by the State Wetland and Mangrove Grievance Redressal Committee appointed by the Bombay high court in January 2019.“We have committed to building an eco-park to showcase the mangrove biodiversity in Belpada region under our jurisdiction,” said SV Madabhavi, chief manager (port, planning and development), JNPT. “Over the years, we have been unnecessarily dragged into the controversy regarding the degradation of mangroves. We have never been involved in such activities. We remain a socially conscious organisation, committed to the environment, community, stakeholders, employees, and the industry.”Also Read: Mumbai coastal road: More corals to be tagged, shifted than originally identified, permittedJNPT has roped in the Forest Department Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) to conduct a feasibility study. It plans to develop the park in two phases. “Since we are mostly engineers or associated with port-related matters, we do not have much knowledge on how to build a biodiversity conservation plan. Thus, we needed experts,” said Madhabhavi.The first phase of the park is expected to be ready by June 2021 at a cost of ₹5 crore which will protect two dense mangrove patches and house visiting galleries, mangrove walkthroughs (boardwalks), structures such as an education and nature interpretation centre, and a nursery with rare mangrove species. “In these zones, our intention is to develop a biodiversity park where we can showcase the natural ecosystem, mangrove growth, and open it up for visitors by having mangrove trails, etc. JNPT does not have any issue with fund allocation for the annual upkeep of this park,” said Madabhavi. “The second phase would include the protection of water bodies to protect the migratory bird habitat in this region.”JNPT said the plan of action for the proposed park is awaiting submission from FDCM, post which all details will be finalised.Krishna Bhavar, divisional manager (Thane), FDCM, said, “The area of the mangrove park as suggested by JNPT is 200 ha. It will take us two to three months to submit the feasibility report. Once approved, if JNPT gives us a work order, we are ready to put together a detailed project report and plan for the park. We are yet to sign a formal memorandum of understanding (MoU). We visited the site twice, and it is conducive to have a mangrove park there.”In March, JNPT had approached the State Mangrove Cell and the Mangrove Foundation to help draw up the park plan. “We were told that mangrove cell cannot implement this,” said Madabhavi.Virendra Tiwari, the additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell), said, “It is good to know that JNPT is planning to develop a mangrove park near Belpada village, which can be an example of biodiversity conservation and provide sustainable livelihood opportunities to local communities. However, the Mangrove Cell or the Foundation do not have the requisite expertise for the preparation of the design of the park but we would like to be involved in the project in an advisory role.”“A mangrove park is like a dream project for us. We hope this will encourage eco-tourism, and also expect JNPT to start respecting mangroves as a natural protector of the coast and preserve them,” said B N Kumar, director of NatConnect Foundation, which had requested the high court panel last year to create a park with the twin objectives of protecting mangroves and creating public education zone.Nandakumar Pawar, head of Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishthan, said the project could be an eyewash as JNPT has allegedly destroyed several Uran wetlands already. “They have been caught red-handed killing 4,500 mangroves for which a case had been filed but no one was arrested. Now, a large stretch is being buried with debris and earth off National Highway 348. JNPT must stop this destruction and handover mangroves under their jurisdiction to the forest department without further delay,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/maharashtra-uran-to-get-its-first-mangrove-park-by-june-2021/story-RKU13DIxBJFDtjweqfCP2O.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi breathes better, air remains moderately polluted||Delhi’s air quality continued to be in the "moderate" category on Wednesday morning as favourable meteorological conditions and the reduction of farm fires helped the capital to breathe better. With a marginal deterioration from Tuesday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) value stood at 180 at 6am on Wednesday.From the "severe" AQI reading of 435 on November 15, the air in the capital improved to "poor" (221) on November 16 and "moderate" (171) on Tuesday. An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".Scientists have said that due to high wind speeds throughout the week and the negligible stubble burning activity, the air quality is expected to remain in the range of "moderate" to "poor". VK Soni, of India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s environment monitoring research centre, said that the average wind speed on Tuesday was around 15kmph, which helped disperse the pollutants in the air.Also Read: Stubble fires come down; NW India breathes easy for now"Our forecast is that even on Wednesday, the air quality will remain in the moderate range. Even though the wind direction changed to north-westerly on Tuesday, because the stubble burning activity is almost over, its impact on Delhi"s air quality was almost negligible on Monday and on Tuesday," he said.According to the Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the air quality can slip into the poor category on Wednesday."The AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate and in moderate to the poor category is forecasted for Wednesday. AQI is forecasted to further deteriorate to the higher end of poor to lower end of very poor category on November 19 and 20," the Safar bulletin said on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the temperatures are likely to drop in the national capital this week. According to the IMD forecast, the capital is likely to have a foggy Wednesday morning with minimum temperature dropping to 11 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature around 26 degrees Celsius.On Tuesday, Delhi’s minimum temperature, recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official reading for the city, was 13 degrees Celsius – one degree above normal. The maximum temperature was 26 degrees Celsius – two notches below normal.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that widespread snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and the upper reaches of Uttarakhand will lead to a fall in the minimum temperature by around 2 to 4 degrees Celsius over northwest India in the next few days."The winds have shifted to north-westerly from Tuesday so cold winds will be blowing from the western Himalayas, where snowfall has just happened. We are expecting minimum temperature to drop to around 10 degrees Celsius in the next couple of days," Srivastava said. IMD scientists have also said that the minimum temperature in Delhi may fall to 9 degrees Celsius by November 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-breathes-better-air-remains-moderately-polluted/story-rlPhycTyQUERN10abakVHI.html

18-11-2020||Kolkata||TMC anticipates spurt in fake news ahead of Bengal polls, draws a counter||Apprehending that fake news could be spread through social media platforms to project the Mamata Banerjee administration in a bad light ahead of the crucial Bengal assembly election 2021, the state’s ruling Trinamool Congress has charted a plan to fight such attempts with facts. “In the next few months, you will certainly hear a lot of fake news being circulated in our state. We would be putting out facts to bust fake news. We will try to do this often in the weeks and months ahead,” said Sashi Panja, state minister and TMC MLA. The apprehension is all the more because the BJP has recently appointed Amit Malviya, head of the party’s IT cell as the co-incharge for West Bengal ahead of the 2021 elections. On Tuesday, Sashi Panja, state’s women and child development minister, put out various facts on how the TMC-led government has attempted to empower women with its various schemes and projects over the past one decade, including setting up 48 women police stations, issuing smart cards for women and boosting institutional deliveries. This is, however, not the first time that the TMC has raised apprehensions of fake news being circulated on social media. Just before the Durga Puja, a few persons were arrested for posting fake news on social media saying that the state government has imposed several restrictions during the festive season. The incident had prompted chief minister Mamata Banerjee to direct the Kolkata Police and West Bengal Police to strengthen their cyber-crime cells to tackle complaints of cybercrime at highest priority. Also Read: Leave no booth unattended: BJP’s Bengal polls strategy aims to replicate 2019 formulaDuring the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and polls in four state assemblies, the election commission of India (ECI) spotted more than 154 instances of fake news or misinformation on social media platforms. “The apprehension is all the more because the BJP seems to be focusing on social media this time. The party’s IT cell chief, Amit Malviya, has been recently appointed as the co-incharge of West Bengal ahead of the elections,” said a TMC leader. Also Read: TMC MLAs question Prashant Kishor; rebel says Mamata Banerjee no more in controlIn West Bengal, just before the Lok Sabha polls, an entire page of a vernacular daily was photo-shopped to spread fake news in which Mamata Banerjee was quoted saying that she would show how to make Hindus cry if she wins all 42 seats in the state. “Anyone can move court if they think that the BJP is involved in spreading fake news. Why are they afraid of social media? Instead of booking the guilty as per the IT act, the person is being booked under arms act and NDPS act. They are actually not being able to counter the BJP. That’s why they are doing such things,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of West Bengal BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-anticipates-spurt-in-fake-news-ahead-of-bengal-polls-draws-a-counter/story-1W4twcmuQgFnkxgZbrU9zH.html

Those coming from various villages of Chandigarh will be encouraged to celebrate the festival at their villages.” Dubey added that there will be no stage performances this year and only tea will be served to the devotees: “People would earlier visit just to see the celebrations. Now, people will be allowed to enter into the water, but they won’t be allowed to bathe in it.”Masks will be distributed to all and sanitizers will be installed for them to use. Thermal screening will be done at the entry point of the lake.Some other associations including the Purvanchal Welfare Association had earlier announced that they won’t be celebrating Chhath Puja like previous years and would encourage devotees to stay at home.Meanwhile, the UT administration said that the organisers will be responsible for strict adherence of Covid-19 protocols during the celebrations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/only-those-fasting-for-chhat-puja-to-be-allowed-in-chandigarh-s-sector-42-lake-purvanchal-associations/story-FOAtYw4zfPYJ6KN2Xt331J.html

The officials said that the teams of the health department will be deployed randomly at any of the five major road entry/exit points from Delhi or at the eleven metro stations in Noida, connected with Delhi, for testing.The officials said that the initiative starting Wednesday is part of a strategy to deal with the possibility of rising Covid-19 cases in neighbouring Delhi leading to a spike in cases in Noida since a large number of daily commuters travel between Noida and Delhi.“Our health department is chalking out teams, about 2 or 3, which will be randomly deployed either at road borders with Delhi or outside the metro stations. The teams will randomly select commuters coming in from Delhi and take their samples with the help of rapid antigen kits. The traffic between Delhi and Noida would continue to be normal and it is reiterated that only a few randomly selected commuters shall be tested and not all commuters,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar.“The exercise will start Wednesday. Since, it will be the first day, we have not assessed how many of the commuters will be tested. This assessment will be done a day later. This is being done in order to assess spread of infection and would help in issuing advisories to employers and organisations, where a large number of people work and commute between Gautam Buddh Nagar and adjacent areas, so that spread of infection is contained to a large extent,” Suhas, added.Also Read: Noida authority asks officials to collect only segregated waste to improve Swachhta rankingThe five major entry/exit points that Noida shares with Delhi are the DND flyway, Noida-Mayur Vihar border, New Ashok Nagar border, Kalindi Kunj and another border near Kondli. The city has nine metro stations on the Blue Line of the Delhi Metro network and two stations on the Magenta Line connecting Delhi.“Before lockdown each of the three roads (connecting Delhi and Noida) catered to over one lakh vehicular traffic respectively. After the lockdown, the number of vehicles has decreased on the roads since schools, colleges and several offices are closed. We feel that around 70,000 vehicles use DND Flyway and about 60,000 vehicles use Kalindi Kunj every day. Similar numbers of vehicles run on the Mayur Vihar link road as well,” said Ashutosh Singh, Noida’s traffic inspector.Also Read: Women’s group cycles to promote fitness in Greater Noida west These roads are presently toll free hence the police don’t have exact figures, said officials.Ganesh Saha, DCP traffic, Gautam Budh Nagar, said that he has not received the district magistrate’s order on random sampling of commuters visiting Noida from Delhi for Covid-19 test.“We will coordinate with the district administration as part of the program,” Saha said.According to the state control room records, the district till November 17 registered a total of 20,566 Covid-19 cases, which includes 1,236 active cases besides 73 deaths.

18-11-2020||Bhopal||New Madhya Pradesh bill likely to replace 1968 law||The Madhya Pradesh Dharm Swatantrey (freedom of religion) Bill, which was announced by home minister Narottam Mishra on Tuesday, is likely to replace the 1968 Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act that had a maximum punishment of two years for forced conversion.Some key provisions of the proposed law, which is likely to be tabled in the state assembly in the upcoming winter session, were shared with HT by home department officials on condition of anonymity. The law, Mishra said, was necessitated by incidents of love jihad, a term used by some right-wing Hindu activists to describe a marriage between a Hindu woman and a Muslim man.The new proposed law clearly mentions that conversion for marriage by force, fraud, lure or instigation will be punishable by a maximum jail term of five years. This offence shall be cognizable -- which means that police can arrest someone without a warrant and start an investigation without the permission of the court -- and non-bailable, added the officials quoted above.If such forced conversion is proved, then the marriage concerned shall be declared null and void and anyone who assisted or was a part of the conversion exercise shall be treated at par with the main accused, the officials added.Also Read: Madhya Pradesh govt to table bill against ‘forced’ interfaith marriageFor the new proposed law to be invoked, either the person who converted or their relatives, will have to lodge a complaint. Either the person who is converting for marriage or the religious leader presiding over the conversion ceremony will have to inform the concerned district magistrate a month before the marriage. This provision is similar to one that already exists in the 1954 Special Marriage Act, which governs interfaith marriages in India.Justice (retired) AK Gohil, a former judge of the Madhya Pradesh high court said earlier there was no provision to check fraud during inter-faith marriages. “The previous law has a provision of prior intimation but it didn’t have any specific time limit,” he said.“Now the provision of prior intimation will give ample time to authorities to check the credentials. This will help both man and woman because sometimes under the societal pressure, the woman is forced by the family to lodge a fake complaint against her husband for hiding his religion,” said Sandeep Gupta, a senior advocate. Gupta said the previous law was rarely invoked. “If any woman lodged a complaint that a man hid his religion before marriage and forced her to convert after marriage, the FIR was lodge under section 420 of IPC only. Rarely, police invoke the Freedom of Religion Act.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/new-madhya-pradesh-bill-likely-to-replace-1968-law/story-fr553lXffspugzlc0Yr4cP.html
18-11-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh govt to table bill against ‘forced’ interfaith marriage||Two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana, signalled on Tuesday that they will enact laws to regulate interfaith marriages between Hindu women and Muslim men, becoming the first states to formalise the crackdown on a hot-button issue for Hindu activists.Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra said the Madhya Pradesh Dharm Swatantrey (freedom of religion) Bill, 2020 will be passed in the next session of the state assembly. He said the law -- with a provision of five years in jail for forced conversions for marriage -- was necessitated because of rising cases of love jihad, a term used by Hindu right-wing activists to describe marriages between a Muslim man and a Hindu woman. “We are going to table the Madhya Pradesh Dharm Swatantrey Bill ,2020, in this winter session in December against love jihad, which means a woman is forced or lured by a person of other religion for marriage and later she is tortured for conversion,” said Mishra. He insisted that the BJP government was not against interfaith marriages but only against incidents of love jihad.Later in the day, Haryana home minister Anil Vij said the state government intended to constitute a committee of officials to study and draft a law against love-jihad. “We will first have a discussion with chief minister, ML Khattar in this regard,’’ Vij said. Vij said a representative of the advocate general’s office would also be a part of the committee. This committee will study similar laws enacted by other states, he added. In MP, the proposed law -- key provisions of which were shared with HT by home department officials on condition of anonymity -- doesn’t mention any religion in particular in its provisions. Mishra said the bill proposes rigorous imprisonment for five years for “luring a person through fraud and forcing marriage by religious conversion”. Other proposed provisions include making it mandatory for kin of the person being converted for the purpose of marriage to file a complaint.“The forceful conversions and marriages will be a cognisable offence and non-bailable. There will be a provision for declaring such marriages null and void,” said Mishra. Besides, those assisting in such acts will be made co-accused in the case, he added.The announcement came roughly two weeks after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan signalled the government’s commitment to end love jihad, which Hindu activists describe as an organised conspiracy of Muslim men to trick Hindu women into marriages and effect a demographic change. Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka -- all ruled by the BJP -- have also promised to bring legislation to end love jihad. In Haryana, Vij told the assembly on November 6 that the state government was deliberating on enacting a law to check forced conversions. He also referred to the murder of a young college student by her stalker outside her college in Faridabad. Despite the political mobilization, experts say that the charges of love jihad are bogus and that adult men and women are free to convert under the constitutional right to freedom of religion. In February, the central government told Parliament that there was no definition of the term and no such cases were reported by agencies. Retired high court justice AK Gohil pointed out that there was already a law against forceful conversion -- the MP Freedom of Religion Act -- which has a provision for imprisonment of up to two years. “If the state government wants to bring a specific law against forceful interreligious marriage, they should first define the meaning of love jihad because it is more an agenda of saffron organisation. Forceful interreligious marriage, which is emerging as a big problem, should be dealt sensitively,” he said. Mishra said any person converting for marriage has to inform the magistrate of their district a month in advance. The Special Marriages Act, 1954, which allows interfaith marriages, has a similar provision, in which a magistrate issues a public notice about an interfaith marriage.Congress legislator Kunal Chaudhary said the party will support any law for the safety of women. “The home minister should ensure the implementation of existing law as crimes against women are increasing by the day and the government is not taking any strict steps to curb it.” BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “We are happy that the state government is serious about these torturous marriages. The new law will definitely save the lives of many women.” Jamiat Ulema-e-hind state president Hazi Haroon said, “The state government should understand the meaning of Love and Jihad first. This law will target people of one religion. This will definitely increase the gap between people of two religions as Love Jihad term was coined by a section of people to create communal tension.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-govt-to-table-bill-against-forced-interfaith-marriage/story-1EAnUSXE2n6ppYi6YRwWEI.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The tea house of the poets||Old Delhi’s tea stalls make very milky and sweet chai. The venerable Modern Tea Stall with its not-so-modern wooden chairs and chipped china is different. Its tea is dark and kadak (strong). Founded in 1967, this atmospheric destination on Haveli Azam Khan street was lying shuttered since the coronavirus-triggered lockdown in March. It reopened a month ago.Before the pandemic changed the texture of everyday routines, some of the area’s distinguished verse writers would gather in the tea house every evening (see photo) to chat about the latest trends in contemporary Urdu poetry—as well as gossip about the private life of the poets. Indeed, the daily soirées of these faithful attendees were a most convenient gateway for an outsider to experience the Walled City’s vibrant hyperlocal literary scene. The eminences included poet and publisher Munir Hamdam of Turkman Gate Mohalla, (late) poet Rauf Raza of Chitli Qabar who made his living as an interior decorator, journalist Javed Mushiri of Ballimaran, poet Javed Niyazi of Kucha Rohilla Khan who runs a “rubber business” and poet Iqbal Firdausi of Baradari who manages a small factory of musical instruments such as “drum sets and harmonium parts.”These days the tea house remains silent. Just like the grave man at the counter, who has an eerily quiet temperament. Dressed in white kurta, pyjama and topi, Muhammed Khaleel sits on a throne-like chair placed at the entrance, occasionally jotting on his notepad. “This is hisaab (balance sheets), not shayiri (poetry),” he clarifies.Open by 7am, the tea house offers relaxing distractions. Those with a fascination for old objects might be mildly enchanted by an aged wall-clock. Or perhaps by the once-white tiles on the walls whose current shade resembles the yellowing pages of old musty hardbounds. Faded posters of famous Sufi shrines too draw attention. The tea house would stay open until about midnight with the aforementioned poets as its last customers. That’s how it used to be in the Before Corona, or BC, era. These days the poets don’t show up, and the place shuts by 8pm latest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-tea-house-of-the-poets/story-dWbrfWkIHbm0CQvMQRa9aL.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi seeks curbs at weddings, markets||The Delhi government wants to reduce the number of people at weddings to 50 and has asked the Union government for powers to lock down markets if they turn into hot spots, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday — both much-needed curbs as the Capital struggles to tame a rising wave of Covid-19 infections that has pushed hospitals to the brink.Both the decisions, which were welcomed by experts, have been sent to the lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal for approval. In the week ending November 14, Delhi recorded previously unseen levels of new cases, and daily fatalities have hovered close to 100 a day. New deaths usually reflect infections that took place three-four weeks ago. New cases declined over the weekend, but this is likely to be misleading since the weekend and two festivals (Diwali and Bhai Dooj) led to fewer tests.Also Read| Delhi:Covid-19 testing capacity to be doubled to 120K, focus on RT-PCR tests“A few weeks back, when the Covid-19 situation improved in Delhi, the government in keeping with central guidelines issued an order allowing 200 people to attend weddings, up from the limit of 50 before. Today we have decided that the order should be rescinded and the limit of 50 reinstated,” Kejriwal said at a press briefing over video.“Secondly, we saw in the run-up to Diwali that people were not wearing masks or following social distancing at many markets, which led to a spurt in infections. We have now sent a proposal to the Union government to allow us to assess if people are not following appropriate behaviour at a market and shut it down if we feel it could turn into a hot spot,” he added.The Union home ministry, which is the main agency coordinating measures in response to the coronavirus pandemic, has ordered regional governments across the country to seek its permission before announcing any lockdowns.  By Tuesday evening, the office of the LG received both files, said a senior official who did not wish to be identified. While the LG is likely to take a call on the wedding-related proposal on his own, he shall be forwarding the market-related proposal to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Union home ministry, the official said.Kejriwal added that he hopes that such measures will not be required since the festival rush is now over at marketplaces. “All governments and agencies are making double efforts to contain the coronavirus infections. But we will not be able to achieve this unless everyone does their part,” the chief minister said in what he described as “an appeal with folded hands”.The CM’s stance appeared to be at odds with remarks on Monday by Delhi health minister Satyender Jain, who said the Capital’s third wave of infections has peaked and that there will be no new lockdowns. Hours after Kejriwal’s Tuesday briefing, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia told HT: “We want to clarify that this is not a lockdown. The concept of lockdown has not helped in the fight against Covid-19 in a long run. This is a generic permission we have sought from the central government for emergency situations.” Alarm at the situation has particularly grown since Sunday, when a high-level review of the situation involving the topmost state and central authorities – including Kejriwal and home minister Amit Shah – found that the situation in Delhi was unlike anything seen across the worst-hit regions in the country. At its peak, according to a presentation by Niti Aayog’s VK Paul, Delhi added more infections per million than Maharashtra or Kerala – the two other states hit hard by the pandemic.Daily hospitalisation data collated by the government showed that the number of people admitted crossed the 9,000-mark for the first time and that from among 3,500-odd ICU and ventilator beds earmarked for Covid-19 patients, only a little over 400 are vacant.Between November 1 and 16, over 101,000 Covid-19 infections were added to Delhi’s tally. In this period, the city recorded most infections (8,593 on November 11) and deaths (104 on November 12) for a single day. Health experts have repeatedly said the reinstating of some curbs may be inevitable to tackle this situation.“The Covid-19 situation in Delhi is in bad shape now. Such restrictions are much needed. A lot of transmission of the virus is likely to have happened during the festive season and the effects will be visible in the weeks ahead. The government should scale up testing, surveillance and containment efforts as well,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Also Read: Delhi to get 9,500 teams for door-to-door surveillance outside containment zones, contact tracingSince Monday, officials of the Union and Delhi government have been preparing to marshal more resources. “The current 3,500 ICU beds will be increased to 6,000 in the next few days with the help of Delhi government, army and central government. The army-run hospital in Dhaula Kuan will add 537 ICU beds, the central government hospitals 45, and 2,680 beds will be added by the Delhi government, mostly through the order reserving 80% ICU beds in 33 big private hospitals,” Paul said at a press briefing on Tuesday.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, who was also at the briefing, said: “It has been decided that the number of tests will be doubled in Delhi between 1 lakh and 1.2 lakh. And, a strategy for the same has been devised. However, we need to ensure that the ratio between rapid antigen tests and the RT PCR is right; it should not become lopsided in the favour of rapid antigen tests”.Two other major steps in the works are a redrawing of the containment strategy and citywide door-to-door canvassing in which officials will urge anyone with symptoms to get tested. According to officials, the specifics of both these measures are likely to be announced in the coming days.Wedding hall industry representatives said they were worried about the economic fallout of the new curbs.“The Delhi government’s proposal to restrict the number will ruin us. It is only after the Delhi government increased the number of guests at weddings, we started taking bookings for up to 200 guests. The cards have been distributed and we have called back our workforce from their villages, as we finally had work. This decision will adversely impact the livelihood of 1 million families associated with the wedding business,” said Sandeep Madan, vice president of Community Welfare Banquet Association.Brijesh Goyal, president of chamber of trade and industry, said: “Traders are anxious in Delhi after Tuesday’s announcement. We will do a video conference on Wednesday with more than 200 market associations in which we will be recording the views and opinions of the traders, which will be sent to the chief minister’s office, and we shall also be discussing measures related to social distancing, Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and precautions that can be taken to avoid temporary shutting down of any market.” But experts said the measures were required. “The decision on markets looks like a focused restriction measure which is temporary in nature and should not ideally be compared with the lockdown that we have witnessed earlier. There can be an economic impact for a short period, wherever the restrictions are imposed, if approved, but Delhi is also witnessing a health emergency and the Covid-19 numbers are worrisome,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of clinical virology department at Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-seeks-curbs-at-weddings-markets/story-b5tT9XVFS0R3u9YdDT6SoO.html

CM Manohar Lal Khattar, who presided over a meeting of DTOs of all 22 districts, said these machines would help keeping tabs on the overloaded vehicles. Khattar said initially, 45 weighing machines have been purchased by the transport department. “If this experiment proves successful, more such machines would be bought,” he added. The chief minister directed DTOs to implement a “faceless and cashless” system. He said that the state government has not only transferred 250 employees of the transport department, but also circulated a list of undesirable contact men following which their access has been completely blocked. He said that DTOs should make best use of technology and other digital equipment like CCTV cameras in their offices to keep a close vigil on the movement of the people entering their offices. Apart from this, separate registers should be maintained to keep the details of visitors entering their offices. He also asked the officers to maintain secrecy while conducting raids. On complaints regarding the entry of overloaded vehicles carrying goods and mining material from other states, Khattar said that regular checking be conducted at the interstate borders to check overloaded vehicles coming from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-govt-gives-portable-weighing-machines-to-karnal-gurugram-dtos/story-TNm98xptuutQy0hlC2cG9L.html
18-11-2020||City||Retired government employee, wife hacked to death in Yamunanagar||A man retired from the public works department (PWD) and his wife were hacked to death in Yamunanagar’s Sadhaura block on Tuesday, police said.As per information, the murder took place in Bakala village under the Bilaspur subdivision, where the man, identified as Roshan Lal (in his 70s) and his wife Paramjit (around 55) were murdered separately in the evening. Various police teams checked a grocery shop that the man used to run and where he was found dead along with their house where the woman was reportedly killed. The teams also searched a nearby pond, where the weapon(s) could have been dropped. A local said that Roshan Lal had two sons, one of whom died in 2007 and the other lives near their house with his family. SP Kamaldeep Goyal said that prima facie, it seems that a sharp-edged weapon was used to attack the couple. “Our teams are questioning villagers and family members, but as of now, the reason behind the murder is not clear. Villagers have told us that the man had married the woman around nine months ago. His first wife had died several years ago,” Goyal added. Wife among four booked for Karnal man’s murder A woman, her lover and her two relatives have been booked for the murder of her 34-year-old husband in Datta colony of Panipat city, police said on Tuesday.As per the police, Sunil Kumar of Karnal’s Nilokheri was found hanging from a ceiling fan in Panipat.Following the complaint of his family members, the police registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against his wife Menka, her lover Krishan and her two relatives.Victim’s father Mange Ram said that Sunil and Menka had married around 10 years ago, but Menka could not adjust with his family members following which they moved into a rented accommodation.He alleged that Menka also had extramarital affair with Krishan, to which Sunil objected. He said that late on Sunday, Menka’s uncle informed them that Sunil had committed suicide.“But when we reached the spot, we got to know that he had died around 8pm. Menka, Krishan, and Menka’s brother and sister murdered Sunil,” he told the police.Attar Singh, in-charge of Assandh Road police post, said an FIR has been registered and the cause of the death will be ascertained in the postmortem report. An investigation is going on, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/retired-government-employee-wife-hacked-to-death-in-yamunanagar/story-ROd5UNhIOsFw6qmMn8D3BJ.html

The home minister likes to term the proposed legislation a law against “love jihad”.“We will first have a discussion with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in this regard,” Vij said.The home minister said that a representative of the advocate general’s office would also be a part of the committee. This panel will study similar laws enacted by other states.Vij had on November 6 told the state assembly that the Haryana government was deliberating on enacting a law to check forced religious conversions. He was speaking on a calling attention motion on the murder of a young Faridabad woman, Nikita Tomar, by her stalker Tausif.He had said the state government was also compiling information about instances where forced religious conversions took place to give effect to an inter-faith wedding.Earlier in June, Khattar had said that the state government has decided that a Right to Freedom of Religion Bill will be passed to stop forced conversions.During an interview with HT in July, the chief minister had said that there were complaints regarding forced conversions and marriages from many districts.“People are free to adopt any religion in an informed manner but using coercion, allurement to force religious conversions is a matter of concern. Such incidents vitiate the atmosphere of society.

Besides, testing will also be done at other such government offices where people visit frequently.” A letter has also been issued by the state government, asking the staff involved in public dealing to get their Covid tests done.The letter reads that as public dealing has resumed in most government offices, there is a high possibility that this could lead to a spread of the virus. Government employees have been advised to exert caution while dealing with the public and isolate themselves if they develop any Covid-like symptoms, or if they come in contact with any positive patient.Focus on mandatory maskingDr Bagga further stressed that wearing a mask is the only vaccine available right now. “Even if a vaccine is developed, it is highly unlikely that everyone will be able to get vaccinated within a year. So, I would urge people to wear masks while going out in public,” said Dr Bagga.He said that as per a recent survey, only 65% of the people in Ludhiana wear masks. “Our endeavour is to ensure that everyone wears a mask. Only then can we control the spread of the contagion,” said Dr Bagga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-update-health-dept-plans-to-conduct-tests-at-govt-offices/story-x6n8Tvyx319OppHOUDzEgJ.html
18-11-2020||Chandigarh||Manesar land case: Ready to pass deemed award where collaboration agreements executed, Haryana tells SC||The Haryana government has told the Supreme Court that it has decided to pass deemed award with respect to land parcels in Manesar where collaboration agreements were executed between August 27, 2004 and January 29, 2010.An affidavit saying this was e-filed by the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) before the top court. “Since an application has already been filed by the HSIIDC seeking clarification qua these very parcels of land, the state government will abide by the court’s decision in this regard,” the affidavit said. The SC is hearing the prayer seeking clarification whether its 2018 judgment in the Manesar land release case would also cover land parcels purchased prior to the date of Section 4 notification of Land Acquisition Act on August 27, 2004, but transferred by the landholders during the August 27, 2004 to January 29, 2010 period by way of collaboration agreements in favour of other parties and whether they will form part of the deemed award ordered by the top court. Collaboration agreements executed during 2004-10 The affidavit filed by HSIIDC said there were three cases where land was purchased before August 27, 2004 but collaboration agreements were executed during August 27, 2004 to January 29, 2010 period in favour of other parties. The land, about 42 acres, collectively belonged to three real estate developers — Paradise Systems Pvt Ltd, Frontier Home Developers and Karma Lakeland Pvt Ltd. “Since it was uncertain whether such lands would be covered by the 2018 judgment and whether such collaboration agreements also be construed as transfer of land, an interlocutory application was filed seeking clarification from the Supreme Court,” the affidavit reads. Besides, about 14 acres of two developers – RP Estates Pvt Ltd (licence given in 2009) and Subros Ltd (licence given in 2008) formed part of the Section 6 notification of August 25, 2005.“The land of Subros was released in principle by the state government in 2007 on the basis of the decision of the ministers’ committee. RP Estates was the owner of land prior to Section 4 notification and continued to be so from August 27, 2004 to January 29, 2010. Since there was no sale transaction with respect to the land of Subros and RP Estates during August 27, 2004 to January 29, 2010, these parcels were not part of the deemed award of November 26, 2018. There was neither change of ownership nor any collaboration agreement,” the affidavit said.

18-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: Sealing drive against property tax defaulters to start next week||Reeling under fund crunch even as its branches are struggling to meet recovery targets, the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) has decided to start a sealing drive against property tax and house tax defaulters in the city from next week. As per MC officials, there are over 86,000 defaulters who have not paid their property tax since the financial year 2014-15, and the tax to be recovered from them runs into about ₹52 crore, excluding the penalty and interest. The civic body is also yet to recover over ₹50 crore (including penalty) in the form of house tax, which was imposed before property tax was introduced by the state government in 2014-15. MC officials said that this time notices won’t be issued in bulk as it leaves the staff tied up in documentation work. Instead, a limited number of notices will be issued at a time so that the officials can carry out proper follow-ups and take action accordingly.MC superintendent (property tax) Vivek Verma said, “Strict action will be taken against defaulters from now on and a sealing drive will start next week, as per the directions of MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal. Final notices will be issued to the defaulters and if they still fail to submit the pending dues, their properties will be sealed. Firstly, action will be taken against big defaulters. A list of defaulters and their pending amounts has been issued to the zonal commissioners, who have been directed to push their staff to meet the recovery targets.” As per information, there are around 20,000 defaulters each in Zone A, B and C areas, while Zone D has around 26,000 defaulters.Recovery target not likely to be met this yearAgainst the annual recovery target of ₹130 crore, the property tax wing has only recovered ₹55 crore so far, which is around ₹8 crore less than what it recovered by this time in 2019.Officials revealed that among the big defaulters this year are several malls and hotels that have not paid the tax citing the pandemic. The amount to be recovered from them comes to around ₹7 crore. This year, the MC has also increased the property tax for residential rental properties, including the paying guest accommodations, hostels, rental accommodations etc. The owners will now have to pay 7.5% of the annual rent received as tax. Earlier, owners had to pay ₹5 per yard for the property annually. MC officials state they won’t be able the meet the recovery this year too, as the pandemic has already induced a financial crisis in the market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-sealing-drive-against-property-tax-defaulters-to-start-next-week/story-X5d6wiM6WZ04Vgi0BSktBN.html

Addressing a public meeting at Kotla-Behad in Jaswan-Pragpur assembly segment of Kangra district, Thakur, in presence of chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, said the issue was hanging fire for 10 years due to the laid back attitude of state officials. He said the state government should inculcate a good work ethic among its officers. He urged the chief minister to convene a meeting with the officials and direct them to expedite the process. “If you issue an order right here and now, officials will work on it otherwise the matter will continue to hang fire,” he said.

18-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh PGIMER to get India’s first dedicated animal house laboratory with advanced research facility||The department of radiodiagnosis and imaging at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research is installing the country’s first digital subtraction angiography (DSA) facility dedicated to basic research in animals.Professor MS Sandhu, head of the department of radiodiagnosis, said the facility will aim at testing new drugs and hardware that can potentially be used for the treatment of human disorders.The DSA machine is a sophisticated digital X-ray emitting machine, which helps in the precise evaluation of vessels inside the human or animal body once an iodine-based contrast is injected into a specific vessel; it gives an exquisite display of the vascular system of that particular organ and the blood flow pattern.Interventional radiologists use this machine for performing angiography of various organs of the body like the brain, liver, kidneys etc. The various treatments include opening up of blocked vessels, plugging of leaking vessels and delivering super-selectively chemotherapy or radiation to the tumor in the affected organ.Before coming into the market for human use, the drugs and allied equipment have to undergo strict checks initially on animals, followed by human trials in various phases.‘In sync with national policy of Make in India’“Due to lack of appropriate testing facilities for newer devices aimed at interventional treatment of disorders in India, almost all of the certifications are done in the United States, Europe and/or East Asia. This often involves delays in treatment coming to Indian shores and is significantly expensive due to high import duties. With the setting up of this laboratory, there is a chance that these limitations may be superseded to some extent for some new drugs and equipment. The animal house DSA facility will also be in sync with the national policy of Make in India and it will be in the interest of patient care too,” said professor Sandhu.Animal DSA installations need a sophisticated setup requiring, in addition to the DSA equipment, the entire infrastructure to house appropriate animals. Expert personnel and conditions are required to take suitable care of the animals and provide them fair living conditions in an ethical humane setup.Subsequent administration of experimental drugs is undertaken or deployment of new devices is carried out like stents, coils, to understand the changes these lead to in the animals. Sometimes, for evaluating the results, angiographies have to be repeated after a certain interval. The results achieved aid to develop specific therapies for various vascular and parenchymal disorders in human beings. The animals who will be housed at PGIMER include sheep, rabbits, guinea pigs, mice, rats and hamsters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-pgimer-to-get-india-s-first-dedicated-animal-house-laboratory-with-advanced-research-facility/story-f57LaHlrvRSxEGH1yvevkK.html

A proposal for the trial was then placed before the hospital’s ethics committee in the first week of November for a final nod.“We will start the trial once we receive the final green signal. We have already received more than 100 inquiries from interested participants,” said hospital dean Dr Mohan Joshi.As many as 1,000 volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age will be part of the trial, of which 20% will comprise those with comorbidities while 5% of the participants will be medical health workers. As per ICMR rules, the hospital will follow-up with the volunteers for 12 months over their health.Meanwhile, the hospital has also started a special outpatient department (OPD), OPD-28, to assist volunteers interested in the trial with regards to their queries. It has deployed its staffers, Tejas Tambe and Sushil Pendharkar, at the OPD building to answer the queries of the citizens.“We have put up a board about the details of the trial at the entrance of the hospital with the helpline number. The process of approval has been delayed owing to the festive season, but we believe that within the next two-three days, we will get the nod from the committee,” said Dr NT Awad, head of the hospital’s pulmonary medicine.For the trial, the hospital is also upgrading the infrastructure. Its officials said that the hospital is procuring a special refrigerator to store the serum of the trial.“The third phase will have two stages. After 28 days of the first vaccination, the volunteers will be given the second vial,” added Dr Joshi.As Bharat Biotech’s website, Covaxin is developed in BSL-3 (bio-safety level-3) high containment facility. The vaccine received the approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for Phases 1 and 2 of human clinical trials, following which the trials commenced across India from July.Citizens interested in the vaccine trial can call on 022-24076381 and ask for the extensions 3700/3703 between 9am and 4pm for queries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-sion-hospital-awaits-approval-from-its-panel-to-start-clinical-trials-of-first-indigenous-covid-19-vaccine/story-JIz8VS3o5yIHpWroYbZE7O.html

The MMR continues to be the most affected region in Maharashtra. Of the total 11,447 cases reported on October 16, as many as 3,630 cases were reported from the MMR (31.7% of the day’s tally). The region’s daily case count was 791 of the total 2,535 cases reported in the state on November 16 (31.2%), showed the data released by the state health department. MMR comprises nine municipal corporations, including Mumbai and the rural areas of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts. The region has also reported 607,073 cases, the maximum count, among all regions till November 16. Pune region follows MMR in terms of daily case count. On November 16, it recorded 560 cases, the second-highest contribution to cases in the state. It is also the second most-affected area after MMR with 439,364 cases, as of November 16. It comprises five municipal corporations, including Pune and rural areas of Solapur, Satara, Kolhapur and Sangli districts. “There is a decline in cases and we have been observing it in all the areas of the state. MMR is also reporting less than 1,000 cases but it continues to contribute the maximum number of cases as compared to rest of the regions,” said a health official, wishing not to be named. On November 9, the state recorded 2,535 cases, the lowest number since June 16 when 2,701 cases were reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-dip-in-daily-covid-19-cases-in-maharashtra-mumbai-metropolitan-region-s-share-stays-same/story-Tvlmpf3GLtIBn46PUMcSjJ.html

18-11-2020||Mumbai||8 months after 1st Covid-19 case was reported in Mumbai, the civic body has spent ₹1,050 crore for fight against pandemic||Eight months after the first case of Covid-19 was reported in the city, India’s richest civic body, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has spent more than Rs1,050 crore on Covid-19 related expenses. Though the cases in the city have been controlled, Mumbai is among the cities that have reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the country. According to BMC officials, the major expenses have incurred towards the procurement of medical equipment such as personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, N-95 masks, 3-ply masks, gloves, face shields, hydroxychloroquine, thermometers, body bags, protective eye-wear, sanitisers etc; augmentation of existing health infrastructure and setting up new facilities such as Covid-19 centres and jumbo facilities; hotel bills to lodge frontline staff; recruitment of new staff on contractual basis and distribution of food in the initial days of the outbreak. From its total budget of Rs33,441.02 crore for 2020-2021, the civic body had allocated a special fund of Rs2 crore to upgrade medical facilities at Kasturba Hospital in the light of a possible Covid-19 outbreak. A month after the outbreak of Covid-19, BMC had spent around Rs100 crore, which went up to nearly Rs480 crore in June. After the expenses surged over Rs1,050 crore in November, the BMC has estimated the expenditure to reach Rs1,200 crore by the next month.Though the BMC’s revenue from several avenues such as real estate and property tax have been taken a hit due to the pandemic for the ongoing financial year, it says it will not raise money by taking loans from any third party. P Velrasu, additional commissioner, BMC, said, “We have spent around Rs1,050 crore on Covid-19 till now, and in the coming days too, we will be able to meet the expenditure from our own resources. We are taking steps to ensure the revenue flow and are also studying various options to invest money from our reserves into government bonds. We do not have any plans to take any loans for our projects and will manage funding from our own resources.”BMC has reserve funds of around Rs66,958.09 crore as fixed deposits in banks and it is exploring other investment options such as government bonds, within the ambit of investments permitted for government bodies by the Centre and under the Municipal Corporation Act, 1888. Velrasu said, “We already have a bank on our board as a consultant who will guide us on investment into government bonds.”However, the Congress, which is in the Opposition in BMC, has demanded that the civic body present a bifurcation of the entire expenditure. “We have referred back over 170 proposals in the standing committee related to the Covid-19 expenditure during the lockdown. We need the bifurcation of the expenditure from BMC, but it has not provided it. There could be wrongdoings in the expenses, considering we are not being provided with the bifurcation,” Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of Opposition said.For the next financial budget (2021-2022), BMC plans to allocate funds exclusively for Covid-19 that will be separate from the allocation made to the public health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/8-months-after-1st-covid-19-case-was-reported-in-mumbai-the-civic-body-has-spent-1-050-crore-for-fight-against-pandemic/story-5ik4lVjehFKp8HIKoPuOzK.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Close down all markets and not just a select few, says Maken||The Congress on Tuesday urged the Centre and the Delhi government to lock down all markets and not go for “selective closure” at a time when the number of Covid-19 cases in the city state is five times the national average and higher than that of Brazil, the United Kingdom, Italy and other countries. “Delhi has the highest cases per million population in India. The figure stands at 29,140 cases per million population. It is five times the national average, and higher than Brazil, UK and Italy,” the Congress leader said. Addressing a virtual news conference, Maken criticised Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for seeking power from the Centre to impose a lockdown in those markets that may emerge as Covid-19 hot spots. Also Read| Covid-19: Delhi seeks curbs at weddings, marketsThe Delhi government has sent a proposal to the Centre to give it the power to impose lockdown in market areas that may emerge as Covid-19 hot spots. It has also sent another proposal to Delhi lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal to allow only 50 people to attend wedding ceremonies, against the earlier limit of 200. “We want to say that all markets should be closed, and not just some markets. Kejriwal ji’s idea to selectively close markets is disastrous. By doing so, he will concentrate crowds in a select few markets. We request Kejriwal to have mercy on the people of Delhi and not choose to close only selected markets,” he said. Maken also urged the Centre and Delhi governments to implement a complete “work from home” for offices. “Encourage work from home so that people come out less and also regulate the services of Metro trains,” he said. He claimed that one of every five people succumbing to Covid-19 in India was from Delhi. “Delhi’s average infection rate is five times higher and Delhi leads among all states. There is no other state that is anywhere close to Delhi. Kejriwal and Union home minister Amit Shah are equally responsible for this situation. Apart from advertising, these people have done nothing,” he said. Also Read: Delhi to get 9,500 teams for door-to-door surveillance outside containment zones, contact tracingMaken also hit out at Kejriwal for organising a special prayer function at Akshardham temple in Delhi on Diwali, alleging that ₹32 crore was spent from the state exchequer on the event. “While we desperately need more beds, intensive care units (ICUs) and ventilators, Kejriwal chose to blow away ₹32 crore on Diwali publicity and stunts. Kejriwal ji, you have spent ₹32 crore on Diwali advertisements. Had you not spent that money on your advertisements, you could have bought 600 ICU beds,” he said.

18-11-2020||Delhi||RWAs ask for paid isolation facility for asymptomatic patients||As the number of Covid-19 cases surges in the capital, residents have urged the Delhi government to provide paid isolation facilities to asymptomatic patients who do not wish to stay at home.Resident Welfare Associations (RWA) say those who have elderly or persons with serious medical conditions at home would prefer to stay at a paid isolation facility to protect their family from the risk of contracting the infection.In the past one month, the number of Covid patients placed in home isolation has doubled—from 13,436 to 26,533 between October 17 and November 16. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 6396 new Covid-19 cases, taking the count to 495,598, the government’s health bulletin said.Asymptomatic patients are allowed to stay in home isolation or can opt for government-run Covid Care Centres. There is no paid isolation facility at present, unlike during the early stages of the outbreak when the government converted hotels into paid Covid wards. RWAs say the government should provide at least one paid facility in each district.Atul Goyal, president of United RWAs Joint Action (URJA), a collective of RWAs in Delhi, said, “People have to share toilets and space at government-run facilities. Those who can pay should have an option of moving into a paid facility. In each district, the government should create one such facility. They don’t have to do much; they already have a system in place. They just have to revive it.”Senior government officials say a Covid positive patient is allowed home isolation only if they meet the criteria such as a separate room and bathroom, no comorbidities, mild Covid symptoms, etc.Also Read| Delhi: Covid-19 testing capacity to be doubled to 120K, focus on RT-PCR testsBut residents say those who have elderly patients, children, patients with serious medical conditions at home and can afford, might prefer to stay at a paid isolation facility even if they have a separate room and bathroom.Rejimon CK, founder of Dwarka forum, said, “Many wouldn’t like to risk their family members and prefer to stay separately while they get cured. If you have a Covid patient at home, the workload on the caregiver at home increases, especially if you have elderly or children or family members with serious medical conditions. Even if we have space, many of us would prefer to stay in a paid facility. The government should at least provide this option to those who are willing to pay.”Earlier this year, the Delhi government had attached hotels with hospitals where Covid patients, who were not in a serious condition, could pay and stay.Rajiv Kakria, convenor, Save Our City Campaign, said, “The government can attach some hotels with hospitals to provide this facility. Hotels in commercial areas, state bhavans, etc., should be used for this purpose. But guest houses in residential areas shouldn’t be used for this as it will pose a problem for residents. Covid cases are on a rise and there is a need to step up our facilities.”The number of patients in home isolation is steadily increasing. Since November 1, nearly 6,000 patients have been placed in home isolation. Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayDr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital said, “It will be good if a paid facility is provided to Covid patients who don’t want to stay at home due to personal reasons. But the paid facility should be managed by a team of doctors. Patients at a paid isolation facility should have access to medical care. Several RWAs had created isolation facilities in their locality earlier this year. It will be good if that facility is revived.”Asked if the government was thinking about providing paid facilities again, a senior Delhi government official with the revenue department, requesting anonymity, said, “There is no such plan at the moment. If people don’t want to stay in home isolation, they can stay at the government-run Covid care facilities. We had attached hotels with hospitals when such a facility was provided earlier. But now hotels have been allowed to operate. This kind of an arrangement is not possible at the moment.”The Delhi government did not respond to requests for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rwas-ask-for-paid-isolation-facility-for-asymptomatic-patients/story-znzC2M93dRPLmsD64nmsDP.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi to get 9,500 teams for door-to-door surveillance outside containment zones, contact tracing||Delhi will need at least 9,500 teams to quickly conduct door-to-door surveillance of high-risk households to prevent a further spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the community, according to the minutes of the meeting of health ministry officials and the city’s health authorities and district authorities held on Tuesday. At present, 3,000 teams are conducting such surveys only in 4,449 containment zones.Of the population to be surveyed, around 160,000 live in containment zones and 5.5 million outside them. “With the current number of teams proposed, some high-risk households identified by the districts will only be covered after seven to 10 days. This means a current suspect person will continue spreading the infection for the next 10 days till he/she is contacted by the surveillance team,” said the minutes, a copy of which is with the HT. The target now is to cover all identified households within four to five days to quarantine and test contacts. Also Read| Covid-19 in Delhi: Hospitalisations peak at 9,000; 88% ICU beds fullTo coordinate the data received from the door-to-door surveillance, a zonal magistrate will have around 10 to 15 supervisors under him, who in turn will have 10 to 15 teams under them. Each of the teams will be given a unique ID to help capture and monitor the data. “When we do contact tracing, we forget to quarantine them (before the test result is received). So, even though we have identified the contacts, we let them move around in the neighbourhood, markets, offices, or other public places. Now, we will not only identify the contacts but immediately quarantine or isolate them. The results of this exercise will be seen soon,” union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said during a press briefingBhushan said additional manpower will be drawn from the municipal corporations, district magistrate’s offices, the disease surveillance programme as well as civil defence volunteers. “House-to-house surveillance is ideal to detect infections early, especially those depicting mild symptoms. It is crucial to get tested,” said Dr RR Gangakhedkar, former head, epidemiology and communicable diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research.He added, “The message that should go out loud and clear among masses is that if you suspect exposure, treat yourself as infected. Follow every single step of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, especially at home. That includes wearing a mask, eating meals alone, staying away from the elderly family members. etc. Super spreading events are rare, what is more common is a positive person infecting their family members. Be watchful for at least seven days and get tested if there are symptoms.”Since surveillance teams revisit households after five days or more to ensure symptomatic contacts are tested, a checklist on how to self-isolate and information about the nearest testing centres will be given in the initial meeting. The identification of new containment zones in the city will be a dynamic process using data on clustering and case mapping done by the teams headed by officials from the National Centre for Disease Control, district surveillance officers and district magistrates. NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul said around 16 contacts were being traced for each positive case in Delhi. This is an improvement over two contacts that were being traced in Delhi since the outbreak began. Also Read: North corp reserves beds for Covid patients at Hindu Rao hospitalThese contacts are being traced through phone calls in Delhi. “Ideally, contact tracing should be done face to face by the surveillance teams and not just on phone,” the minutes say, adding that as an abundant precaution, the surveillance teams should check those in home isolation in their area to ensure the rules are actually being followed and check their health parameters. According to data shared by a senior Delhi government official who requested anonymity, 50% of the people tested in a West Delhi dispensary using the less accurate rapid antigen test were found to be positive for the infection. The samples of 60% of those who tested negative were sent for a repeat RT PCR, making it a hot spot, the official said.At present, around 60% of the active cases or those with infection in Delhi are in home isolation, as per data provided by the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-to-get-9-500-teams-for-door-to-door-surveillance-outside-containment-zones-contact-tracing/story-5QEhITrucdcwz5lofPcqjN.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Covid-19 testing capacity to be doubled to 120K, focus on RT-PCR tests||The Centre announced on Tuesday that it will double the testing capacity to 100,000-120,000 with a focus on increasing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, deploy mobile testing labs and ramp up ICU beds from the current 3,500 to 6,000 in the next few days to arrest the sudden spike in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the national capital. According to official data, between November 1 and 16, Delhi has added over 100,000 new coronavirus infections while 1,200 people died due to the disease during this period. Delhi has registered a steep hike in the Covid-19 cases since October 28 when the daily infections breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11. “It has been decided that the number of tests will be doubled in Delhi between 1 lakh and 1.2 lakh. And, a strategy for the same has been devised. However, we need to ensure that the ratio between rapid antigen tests and the RT PCR is right; it should not become lopsided in the favour of rapid antigen tests,” said union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan at the weekly briefing. Ten mobile vans will be deployed and labs under Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and other scientific institutions will be roped in to increase testing, said NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul said at the briefing. Union home minister Amit Shah had chaired a meeting on Sunday, which was attended by the Delhi L-G, chief minister, top administration and health officials as well as representatives from the NITI Aayog, ICMR and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). On Monday, the Centre announced constitution of 10 multidisciplinary teams to inspect Delhi’s private hospitals to check whether the number of ward and ICU beds available in the hospitals is as per Delhi government orders so far. On average, the gold standard RT-PCR tests accounted for almost 36% of the total tests done in Delhi over the last seven days, an increase from around 28% the week before. It is necessary to ensure high numbers of RT-PCR tests as the alternate rapid antigen test is known to thrown up many false negatives for people who might have the infection. The ratio has been skewed in favour of rapid antigen tests in Delhi since its introduction in mid-June as it is cheap, easy to deploy in dispensaries, and gives results in 15 minutes. To increase testing in the city quickly, Dr Paul said that the entire capacity of laboratories in Delhi will be utilised. “Currently, the city does about 57,000 tests a day, of which nearly 20,000 are done using RT-PCR method. Delhi has a capacity of 27,000 tests. This existing capacity will be utilised,” he said. Also, laboratories under the ICMR and the health ministry will be used to add 10,000 tests. Another 1,000 will be added by scientific institutions in the city,” Paul said. The health ministry will also deploy 10 mobile laboratories for testing as well. “Five of these mobile laboratories will be operationalized in the next four to five days and the others will be added in a week,” he said. Also Read: Delhi to get 9,500 teams for door-to-door surveillance outside containment zones, contact tracingDuring the briefing, both Dr Paul and Bhushan emphasised that anyone who had symptoms of Covid-19 should get themselves tested. They said it was another “Covid Appropriate Behaviour” in addition to wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and not going to crowded places, and washing hands frequently. With increase in the number of hospitalisations and the intensive care unit beds almost running full, Dr Paul said that the current 3,500 ICU beds will be increased to 6,000 in the next few days with the help of Delhi government, army and central government. The army-run hospital in Dhaula Kuan will add 537 ICU beds, the central government hospitals will add 45 beds, and 2,680 beds will be added by the Delhi government, mostly through the order reserving 80% ICU beds in 33 big private hospitals. To staff the hospitals, 75 doctors and 250 paramedics from central forces are being flown in. “More than half of them have already arrived and the other will also arrive in the next couple of days. Manpower will also be drawn from central government and municipal corporation-run hospitals,” said Dr Paul. With the number of active cases on the rise in the city, the government has also decided to augment the support system needed for home care to facilitate home isolation of up to 35,000-40,000 people. “The support system needed for patients in home isolation – telemedicine support, pulse oximeter, etc – will be ramped up, as the number of active cases might go up in the future,” said Dr Paul. The number of active cases has touched a peak of almost 44,500 in the city so far, of whom nearly 80% people remain in home isolation as per data shared by the Delhi government. To increase isolation facilities for mild cases not eligible for home isolation, the union government has decided to operationalize 5,000 beds at the Radha Soami Satsang Beas centre in Chattarpur and 800 beds in railway coaches.

Probably 10-12 days later, we may see a decrease in numbers but not right now,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory and critical care medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital.“I feel it is worse in private hospitals as people are willing to pay, and there is also price cap in place, as a result there is acute shortage of beds, especially ICU beds at the moment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/testing-capacity-to-be-doubled-to-120k-focus-on-rt-pcr-tests/story-p46QwHFHKebP1qx5mzNqYK.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Wedding planners and traders anxious, but many say curbs needed||The Delhi government’s decision on Tuesday to cap the number of wedding guests at 50 and its move to get powers from the Union government to lock down select markets have drawn mixed reactions from traders and event planners.While several banquet owners bemoaned the lost chance to recoup losses incurred during the March 25 lockdown and said the decision could potentially obstruct the recovery of the Capital’s economy, others appreciated the government initiatives and said they were much-needed steps in the light of the surge in Covid-19 cases.Between November 1 and 16, over 101,000 Covid-19 infections were added to Delhi’s tally. In this period, the city recorded most infections (8,593 on November 11) and deaths (104 on November 12) for a single day. The proposal to cap the number of guests has been sent to lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, who chairs the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) for approval. With just a week left for the wedding season to start---the auspicious period for weddings this year is between November 24 to December 12—banquet and hotel owners were looking to stay afloat make up the losses sustained during the wedding season between April and June due to the lockdown.Also Read: Delhi to get 9,500 teams for door-to-door surveillance outside containment zones, contact tracingOn Tuesday, banquet and hotel owners’ associations started getting panic calls from clients and some of the associations even met with minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai, and urged him to intervene.Sandeep Madan, vice president of Community Welfare Banquet Association, said, “We had a meeting with Rai ji, as the Delhi government’s proposal to restrict the number of guests will ruin us. We have called back our workforce from villages as we were finally back in business. This decision will adversely impact the livelihood of 10 lakh families associated with the wedding industry.” There was no response from the ministry of home affairs to calls and messages seeking his comment.On October 31, the DDMA had allowed 200 guests at weddings and related functions. Since then, banquet halls and hotels have been accepting bookings accordingly, they said.“Our clients have distributed wedding invites. We have placed orders keeping the increased guest limit. How are we supposed to work?” said Madan.A delegation of Delhi tent owners’ federation went to meet the CM on Tuesday afternoon to request him to reconsider the decision but they couldn’t meet the CM.Pankaj Shokeen, general secretary, Delhi tent owners’ federation, said, “The CM didn’t meet us. We will request the L-G to reconsider the matter, as it will have serious financial repercussions for the industry. Some of us have taken loan or borrowed money at high interest rates to make arrangements. If the numbers are restricted to 50, we will be ruined.”Their anxieties were shared by traders, though the government has insisted that these fresh restrictions should not be viewed as a “lockdown”.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicBrijesh Goyal, president of chamber of trade and industry, said: “Traders are anxious after Tuesday’s announcement. We will do a video conference on Wednesday with more than 200 market associations in which we will be recording the views and opinions of traders, which will be sent to the chief minister’s office. We shall also discuss measures related to social distancing, Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and precautions that can be taken to avoid the temporary shutting down of any market.”Ajay Bajaj, advisor to the Karol Bagh traders’ federation, said: “We stand with the Delhi government on this. The Covid-19 situation in the city has gone out of hand and it poses a great risk for anyone. Such restrictions are inevitable at this point.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/wedding-planners-and-traders-anxious-but-many-say-curbs-needed/story-zlyAfjeiKcEEdfBR8kNpiN.html

Senior administration officials said teams of the health department will be deployed randomly at any of the five major road entry/exit points from Delhi or at the 11 Metro stations in Noida for testing commuters.“The teams will randomly select commuters coming in from Delhi and test them through rapid antigen method. The traffic between Delhi and Noida would continue to be normal and it is reiterated that only a few randomly selected commuters shall be tested and not all of those entering the city,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar.“The exercise will start Wednesday. Since, it will be the first day, we have not assessed how many of the commuters will be tested. This assessment will be done a day later. This is being done in order to curb the spread of infection and help in issuing advisories to employers and organisations, where a large number of people work and commute between Gautam Budh Nagar and adjacent areas,” Suhas said.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAccording to the state control room data, till November 17 the district has recorded 20,566 Covid-19 cases and 73 fatalities. Between November 1 and 17, the district has reported 2,727 fresh infections. The five major entry/exit points that Noida shares with Delhi are the DND flyway, Noida-Mayur Vihar border, New Ashok Nagar border, Kalindi Kunj and another one near Kondli. The city has Nine stations metro stations which are part of the Blue Line (Noida Electronic City to Dwarka Sector 21) of the Delhi Metro network and two stations which fall on the Magenta Line (Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden).Ashutosh Singh, traffic inspector, said Noida and Delhi are connected through DND Flyway, Kalindi Kunj and Mayur Vihar link road. “Before lockdown each of the three roads catered to over one lakh vehicles daily. After the lockdown, the number of vehicles has decreased on the roads since schools, colleges and offices are closed. As per out estimate, around 70,000 vehicles use DND Flyway and about 60,000 vehicles use Kalindi Kunj every day. Similar numbers of vehicles run on the Mayur Vihar link road as well,” he said.Also Read: Delhi to get 9,500 teams for door-to-door surveillance outside containment zones, contact tracingThese roads are presently toll free hence the police does not have exact figures, said officials.Ganesh Saha, DCP traffic, Gautam Budh Nagar, said he has not received the district magistrate’s order on random sampling of commuters visiting Noida from Delhi for Covid-19 test. “We will coordinate with the district administration as part of the programme,” Saha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-check-covid-19-cross-spread-noida-to-randomly-test-commuters-from-delhi/story-n530jrO3ZRyN314ALcP1lO.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Focus on local emissions to avoid return of bad air||Rain and improved wind speed after Diwali, which cleared off much of the pollution accumulated due to heavy stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana and the cracker bursting in the city, might have given Delhi the much-needed boost going into the winters when the air quality plunges every year. However, experts cautioned that the authorities must focus on local sources to ensure that city does not slip into an air emergency again. VK Soni, head of India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) environment monitoring research centre, said the western disturbance, which started impacting the western Himalayas on Sunday brought widespread and moderate rains to Delhi-NCR, helping Delhi breathe cleaner air. “The number of stubble fires being spotted over Punjab and Haryana are nearly negligible now. With this western disturbance, two major polluting episodes have been taken care of, which means that now local pollution sources and local weather factors will be the contributors for any kind of change in air quality,” Soni said. Also Read: Noise pollution up from last yearAnalysis of AQI data shows that on Tuesday for the first time since 2017, Delhi experienced a moderate air quality day between November 13 and 17. Delhi’s average air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday was recorded at 171, in the moderate zone, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. Also, the contribution of stubble fires in the city’s PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) was just 3%. It had peaked to over 40% in October.Experts said that while sharing a common air shed, pollution coming in from neighbouring states contributes to the air quality deterioration in Delhi, but local factors cannot be ignored. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment) said that while Delhi has been successful in bending the pollution curve year-after-year, a lot still needs to be done to control pollution, especially in the areas of vehicular emissions and waste management. “There is no denying that work has been done in areas such as controlling industrial emissions and fumes from heavy vehicles crossing the city, etc, but there are still two primary areas where efforts are required. One is reducing vehicular emissions, for which authorities will have to go back to basics and work towards the augmentation of public transport. The situation has become a little tricky now with the limitations due to Covid-19, but this should be a long-term goal for the government,” Roychowdhury said. Also Read: Rain and winds help Delhi breathe a little easyShe added, “Another area where the government needs to concentrate is waste management. In many unauthorised areas there isn’t a proper system to dispose household waste and this waste ultimately ends up being thrown in dhaloas and set ablaze.” Delhi’s environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday said the government is controlling local pollution sources and that Delhi’s air quality cannot be looked at in isolation. “We have said this time and again, we are not denying that Delhi’s local pollution sources are a problem, but these sources were the same till August. The deterioration starts when the harvest season starts in Punjab and Haryana and farmers start burning stubble in their fields because they do not have a viable option to get rid of it,” Rai said. Enlisting the measures being taken by the Delhi government to control the local sources of pollution, Rai said that they had from November 16 started the second phase of ‘red light on, gaadi off’ (red light on, ignition off) campaign, to control the vehicular emissions. He also said that regular meetings are being conducted with the municipalities to ensure that water sprinkling and mechanised sweeping is done to prevent road dust and open burning of waste is controlled. A 2019 analysis of Delhi’s pollution sources done by Council on Energy, Environment and Water showed that vehicular emissions contributes to as much as 39.2% of the city’s PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres). This is closely followed by dust from roadsides, whose contribution goes up to 37.8%. In PM 10 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres), the contribution of road dust goes up to 65.9%, while the contribution from construction activities reaches 21%. Also Read: Pollution levels soar on Diwali as cracker ban falls flat in DelhiRadha Goyal, deputy director, Indian Pollution Control Association (IPCA) also said that vehicular emissions, construction activities and waste burning are the main local sources of air pollution in Delhi during winters. “The approach to handling winter pollution should be more preventive than responsive. There should be strict monitoring on waste burning by municipalities in Delhi-NCR, and now that we have already practised working from home during the Covid-19 lockdown, this could become a practice during critical winter periods to avoid congestion on roads. Stricter guidelines and controlled construction activities will also help in reducing the impacts of local sources on Delhi’s AQI during critical winter periods,” Goyal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/focus-on-local-emissions-to-avoid-return-of-bad-air/story-ZuxQWnQ4X4EaYVRyZ0y3OI.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Colder days, cleaner air ahead, shows IMD forecast||In the coming weeks, Delhi will get colder and continue to breathe cleaner air, according to the forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). IMD scientists said that the minimum temperature in Delhi may fall to 9 degrees Celsius by November 22, and there may be no drastic changes in the air quality. Delhi’s AQI has fluctuated between poor to severe and moderate in a matter of five days between November 13 and 17. From an AQI of 435 on November 15, which is in the severe zone, the air improved to poor (221) on November 16 and moderate (171) on Tuesday. Sagnik Dey, associate professor at IIT Delhi, said the reduction in air pollution has been made possible partly because farm fires have reduced to almost zero and mostly because of the favourable meteorological factors such as good wind speed and light rain on Monday. VK Soni, of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said that the average wind speed on Tuesday was around 15kmph, which helped disperse the pollutants in the air. “Our forecast is that even tomorrow (Wednesday) the air quality will remain in the moderate range. Even though the wind direction changed to north-westerly on Tuesday, because the stubble burning activity is almost over, its impact on Delhi’s air quality was almost negligible on Monday and on Tuesday,” he said.Wind speeds are expected to remain high throughout the week, which will help keep the air quality in the range of moderate to poor, IMD scientists said.Also Read: Focus on local emissions to avoid return of bad airDelhi on Tuesday recorded a minimum temperature of 13 degrees Celsius at the Safdarjung observatory, which is the official data for the city. The maximum temperature was 26 degrees Celsius, two degrees below the season’s normal. On Monday, the minimum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory was 16 degrees Celsius. At the Palam observatory, the minimum temperature was recorded at 14.2 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature was 24.6 degrees C—nearly 3 degrees below normal. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that widespread snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, upper reaches of Uttarakhand will lead to a fall in the minimum temperature by around 2 to 4 degrees Celsius over northwest India in the coming days. “The winds have shifted to north-westerly from today (Tuesday) so cold winds will be blowing from the western Himalayas, where snowfall has just happened. We are expecting minimum temperature to drop to around 10 degrees Celsius in the next couple of days,” Srivastava said. Also Read| Winter is here: Delhi records season’s lowest maximum temperatureIMD data shows that till November 16, the average minimum temperatures recorded in the city have been around 2-3 degrees below what is considered normal for the season.. Data shows that last year the lowest minimum temperature recorded in the month of November was 11.4 degrees on November 20. On November 24, 2017, the lowest minimum temperature was recorded at 7.6 degrees. Srivastava explained that since September Delhi had not received any impact of western disturbance, which kept the skies clear. Under such weather conditions, the ground cools faster and the minimum temperatures stay low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/colder-days-cleaner-air-ahead-forecasts-imd/story-fpJIFMbpWXOSZE74P659fM.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: Hospitalisations peak at 9,000; 88% ICU beds full||The number of hospitalisations due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reached an all-time high on Tuesday, crossing the 9,000-mark for the first time, on a day Delhi recorded less than 7,000 cases for three days in a row, mainly because of fewer tests conducted during the festive season. . As on Tuesday, 9,215 patients were admitted with the infection at various city hospitals. 6,396 cases were reported with just over 49,000 tests being conducted on Tuesday -- 32,431 rapid antigen and 16,600 of the more accurate RT-PCR tests, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. On average, 54,000 tests were being conducted each day before Diwali. With 99 deaths on Tuesday, Delhi reported more than 90 deaths for six days in a row. With these deaths, the seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) – the proportion of people who die among those who test positive – touched 1.65%, the highest since the beginning of August. The total CFR, which had been on the decline, also inched upwards over the last four days and stood at 1.58% on Tuesday. Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayAt its peak, the number of hospitalisations had hit 6,264 during the first surge of infections in June-July and 7,051 during the second surge in September. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had on Monday said Delhi has already crossed the peak for the third wave of infections. With the increase in hospitalisations, more than 55% of the total beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 patients were occupied as on Tuesday evening, according to the Delhi corona app. However, the cause of concern is the number of ICU beds. Over 88% ICU beds were occupied across hospitals on Tuesday evening. “If the increase in the number of cases continues, there will be a crisis. This is because most of the ICU beds are already occupied. A positivity rate of 13 to 15% means widespread transmission is happening. And, we have everything open other than the schools; the markets have been crowded during the festive season,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, head of the department of community medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The current ICU capacity of just over 3,500 beds is likely to go up to 6,000 in the next few days. The army-run hospital in Dhaula Kuan will add 537 ICU beds, the central government hospitals 45, and 2,680 beds will be added by the Delhi government, mostly by reserving 80% ICU beds in 33 big private hospitals. “The kind of intensity of the pandemic can be dangerous to lives, livelihood and fabric of the society. We as citizens have to play our role. If you see Europe, their beds are getting over again,” said NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul in a press briefing on Tuesday.

Half of these deaths happened within the first 24-hours of admission. In Delhi, there has been a dramatic change since. We are still monitoring the mortality as it shows the efficiency of the system – mobilising patients from home, ambulance service, access to beds, and efficiency of the treatment,” said Dr Paul. Admitting that private hospitals had played an important role, he said that the 10 inspection committees constituted by the government were to “improve coordination”. “The teams will inspect, see if there are any gaps and address them, and wherever they need help it will be extended. They will also see whether the patients and family satisfied,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hospitalisations-peak-at-9-000-88-icu-beds-full/story-toZOF7JQkaMqvyZEmTNiLM.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||On promise of out-of-turn promotions, cops trace 1,440 missing kids since early August||After the Delhi Police announced incentives, including out-of-turn promotions, to motivate its force to trace more number of children who have gone missing, a total of 1,440 kids were traced since early August -- a period which also saw another 1,222 children being reported missing.In sharp contrast, only 3,336 missing children were traced by the Delhi Police through entire year of 2019. In the first seven months of this year, too, before the incentives were announced, only 1,189 children had been traced, shows data released by the Delhi Police.Eish Singhal, the Delhi Police spokesperson, said a slew of efforts in a planned manner helped the police carry out the large number of trace and rescues of missing children. On August 7, Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava had issued an order asking each police station to constitute a special team to trace missing children.“These children mostly belong to the lower strata of society. The detailed action plan included forming special teams in each police station and having the district deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) lead the exercise,” said Singhal.The exercise benefited after substantial incentives were announced for constables and head constables who helped search and rescue missing children.For example, constables and head constables who traced 50 or more missing children in a 12-month period could become eligible for an out-of-turn promotion. The children rescued by them should have been 14 years of age or less and they should have rescued at least 15 children below the age of eight years.Similarly, those who trace 15 children, at least five of them below the age of eight years, would be awarded the Asadharan Karta Puraskar, said Singhal.Since this plan was put into action in August, the police said they have traced 1,440 children to date, a period during which another 1,222 children went missing. In 2019, a total of 5,412 children had been reported missing and 61.64% of them were traced. This year, so far, the number of missing children is 3,507 while the recovery rate is 74.96%, Singhal said.While there were many stories of police walking the extra mile to reunite children with their parents, one stood out as it had transpired during the Covid-19 lockdown.It so happened that the police came across a six-year-old physically challenged child in a shelter home in north-east Delhi. The police went about tracing the child’s journey to that shelter home and eventually got to know that be had been reported missing from nearby Bhajanpura in November 2017 after being separated from his parents for over two years.“When we finally got to know of his parents, we found out that they had moved back to their village in Bihar. They were so impoverished that they didn’t have the money to even visit Delhi to be reunited with their child,” said Singhal.The police offered to pay their travel expenses to Delhi.But when the boy’s father reached Delhi, he got caught in the lockdown that came into effect on March 25.. “Until the lockdown was partially lifted by end-April, we paid for his stay here in Delhi. He was finally reunited with his son,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/on-promise-of-out-of-turn-promotions-cops-trace-1-440-missing-kids-since-early-august/story-NE36XSzi42zzGr7qTb3RKN.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||North corp reserves beds for Covid patients at Hindu Rao hospital||Keeping in mind the rising number of cases in the city, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Tuesday reserved 20 ICU beds at the 980-bedded Hindu Rao Hospital for critical Covid-19 patients and created another Covid isolation ward of 50 beds. The move comes after Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday suggested that infrastructure at civic hospitals can be used to treat and isolate Covid-19 patients.North corporation mayor Jai Prakash inspected the hospital and held a meeting with its authorities to review preparations to convert it into a dedicated Covid facility.“The union home minister had said municipal hospitals can be used for Covid treatment. So we have earmarked 20 ICU beds for critical Covid-19 patients and set up a 50-bed Covid-19 isolation ward. A flu clinic has been started in the hospital. The hospital has started functioning partially as Covid-19 facility. Further arrangements such as logistical support and facility for doctors and nurses, who will treat Covid patients, to stay in the hospital premises or hotels are being made,” he said.The 980-bedded Hindu Rao Hospital is the largest medical facility run by the north corporation and caters to a large population in north Delhi. The hospital was made a fully Covid-19 dedicated facility in June this yea after cases had started increasing in the city. Also Read| Covid-19 in Delhi: Hospitalisations peak at 9,000; 88% ICU beds fullLater in October 2020, the hospital was removed from the list of dedicated Covid facilities after its doctors had gone on strike demanding pending salaries.The mayor said the number of beds in the isolation ward will be increased to 200 and ICU beds will be augmented. He requested the Delhi government to provide logistical support to convert the hospital into a Covid-19 facility. “Utilisation of health infrastructure at municipal hospitals will certainly help in coping with the sudden surge in the demand for Covid-19 beds. We are ready to help but we need logistical support from the government. I have written to the Delhi government to provide logistics such as medicines, including injections, PPE kits and other machinery required. We had spent Rs 4 crore earlier in Covid-related expenses but did not get any support from the state government,” Prakash said.Hospital authorities said preparations are still on to convert the hospital into a Covid facility.

18-11-2020||Delhi||BJP says govt should allow Chhath celebrations, AAP says Centre restricted festival||New Delhi: BJP leaders on Tuesday protested outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence against the ban on Chhath puja in public places. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) shot back at the BJP, saying it was the BJP-led Central government that had banned the celebrations and now the saffron party was doing politics over it.The party demanded immediate withdrawal of the decision and asked the government to make adequate arrangements in parks, other public places to allow the Purvanchalis to celebrate the festival.Delhi BJP general secretary Dinesh Pratap Singh said, “The CM has allowed opening of weekly markets, malls, opening liquor shops, e-rickshaws, DTC buses with full capacity, etc. He even performed puja at Akshardham temple on Diwali. Why he is discriminating with lakhs of Purvanchalis by banning Chhath Mahaparva?”The BJP said that the government should immediately withdraw the orders and start preparations for the festival in various parks in Delhi. Naveen Kumar, Delhi BJP media head, said, “As an alternative to the Yamuna ghats, pits can be dug in the 2,500 parks in Delhi for people to observe Chhath Puja while maintaining social distancing.”Meanwhile, North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash on Tuesday inspected Chhath ghats in Keshavpuram Zone. During the inspection, the mayor directed the officials to ensure facilities at Chhath ghats before the special prayers. He said that a large number of Purvanchalis reside in Delhi and Chhath is a great festival of worship and faith for the people of Purvanchal and they celebrate it with great enthusiasm. All arrangements should be made at Chhath ghats. He appealed to the Delhi government to lift the ban on Chhath Puja and issue guidelines to control crowds during the festival.Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Durgesh Pathak on Tuesday said that it was the BJP-ruled central government that has issued guidelines to stop the celebration of Chhath puja but the same BJP is doing politics and “falsely accusing” the Kejriwal Government of not allowing the celebration.“The celebration of Chhath Puja is a very important festival for the people of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In Delhi, there are lakhs of people who originally reside from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Every year we celebrate the Chhath Puja in Delhi, but this year due to the Covid pandemic various restrictions were imposed. The guidelines issued by the central government’s home ministry under Amit Shah have imposed several restrictions on the celebration of Chhath Puja and this is why in Delhi and in many other states Chhath Puja will not take place in public. But it is unfortunate and shameful that BJP at one side is stopping the celebration of Chhath Puja and on the other side, they are politicising the issue,” Pathak said at a press conference.He added that the BJP at one hand has issued guidelines to stop the celebration in public but the same BJP on the other side is defaming the Delhi government by saying that the AAP government is not allowing Chhath celebration in Delhi. “This kind of politics is utterly shameful. The AAP demands that the BJP should immediately get the permission of celebrating Chhath Puja from home minister Amit Shah and the Delhi government will coordinate in the following process to ensure the celebration. The state governments right now are completely following the guidelines issued by the central government,” Pathak said.He said that the central government is under the BJP and this is why the AAP believes that the BJP leaders should immediately change the guidelines regarding performing the puja by Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning. “The AAP will meet the Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and ensure the celebration but the BJP should stop politicising the issue,” Pathak stressed.AAP MLA Sanjeev Jha said that earlier in Delhi there were only 72 places where the celebration of Chhath Puja used to take place but after the AAP government was formed, the number of ghats was increased to 1200.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bjp-says-govt-should-allow-chhath-celebrations/story-7PJuhtCR2keJvkEjeQ8mFI.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||Two Jaish militants arrested in Delhi: Police||The Delhi Police on Tuesday said they arrested two Kashmir-based “militants” of the Jaish-e-Mohammad from Sarai Kale Khan in central Delhi and recovered two pistols and cartridges from them. The police said that the two suspects, Abdul Latif Mir and Mohd Asraf Khatana, were planning to stay in south Delhi’s Nizamuddin for a few days before proceeding to Uttar Pradesh where they would allegedly receive some basic weapon training. Thereafter, the two suspects would cross over to Pakistan with the help of their Pakistani handlers, said Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, deputy commissioner of police (special cell). “In the past, these two men and their friends had made multiple attempts to cross the Indo-Pak border from places like Kupwara, Hyma and Keran in Kashmir, but their plans were foiled by the tight vigil of the security forces at the borders,” said Yadav. The officer said that the special cell received a tip-off on Monday about the presence of the two suspects in Delhi. “We laid a trap and caught them in the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday. We recovered two guns and 10 cartridges from them,” said Yadav. The officer said that a lot of “incriminating material” in the form of audio, video and literature have been recovered from their mobile phones. Mir, 22, belongs to Baramulla while the other 20-year-old suspect, Khatana, belongs to Kupwara. “Mir’s role model is JeM chief, Maulana Masood Azhar. Mir even has Azhar’s image as his Facebook display picture. He would listen to news on social media about brutality against Muslims across the world and that developed the ‘Jihadi mentality’ in him,” said Yadav. Four months ago, Yadav said, Mir came in contact with a Pakistani man through Facebook Messenger chat. “Mir requested the Pakistani man to allow him a chance to join Azhar. Through the same man, Mir later got in touch with the Pakistan-based JeM operatives who said they would help him cross the border,” said the DCP. Khatana had met Mir in Kashmir and they shared the same “ideology” because of which they became friends, said the DCP. “Khatana was brainwashed by local villagers about atrocities conducted by security forces on Kashmiri Muslims,” said Yadav. The police did not say whether the two arrested men had been involved in any terror attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-jem-militants-held-in-delhi-police/story-50cGhv5lNflMmF9EU2YjgM.html
18-11-2020||Education||Delhi govt moves Supreme Court, challenges HC order on free gadgets, internet||The Delhi government has filed an appeal in the Supreme Court, challenging a Delhi high court order directing private unaided schools in the national capital to provide free gadgets and internet connections to poor students for online classes and claim a reimbursement from the state government. The plea has contended that such a measure will “open up a Pandora’s Box of reimbursement and misuse of public money”.The high court order on September 18 came on a petition filed by the NGO ‘Justice For All’ through advocate Khagesh B Jha and secretary Shikha Bagga, seeking electronic devices such as laptops or smartphones with high-speed Internet packages, for students enrolled under the EWS (Economically Weaker Section) and DG (Disadvantaged Groups) categories in private schools. HT, on September 24, had reported that the government has decided to challenge the order in the apex court. A Delhi government spokesperson on Tuesday confirmed that a special leave petition (SLP) has been filed before the Supreme Court challenging the high court order and seeking an interim ex-parte stay on the implementation of the order. The matter is expected to come up for hearing this week. In its SLP filed on November 5, a copy of which is with HT, the Delhi government said the decision of conducting online classes was taken “voluntarily” by private schools. The government schools have been providing education in a “blended mode” (online and in-person) ever since in-person classes were suspended in March owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. “The order passed by the high court is erroneous and will open up a Pandora’s Box of reimbursement and misuse of public money…Imparting online education by private schools was purely voluntary in nature and never intended or directed by the petitioner (Delhi government).”“Such voluntary activity is outside the purview of the Right to Education (RTE) Act and therefore beyond the scope of application of Section 12 (1)(c). However, whatever the facilities extended by private schools to attract the fee-paying children cannot be denied to the 25% EWS students as the central idea of RTE Act..” it said.Section 12(1)(c) of the RTE Act mandates 25% reservation of seats in entry-level classes — nursery, kindergarten, and class 1 -- for students from EWS/DG categories in private unaided schools. These students are entitled to free textbooks, writing material, and uniforms up to class 8, for which the government reimburses the schools a fixed amount. The Centre and the states share the costs in a 60:40 ratio.The Delhi government said the court failed to consider that the primary objective of the RTE Act, 2009, was to universalize elementary education between the age group of six to 14 years and not to “modernise or glamourise” education. “However, the court has exceeded its jurisdiction and rewritten the entire vital part (soul) of the RTE without any deliberation by Parliament and made it school-centric which will affect the progression of the RTE Act across the country,” it said.The government said if private schools can afford to provide online education, then they are bound to give inclusive education to EWS students as well and the government was not obliged to reimburse the capital expenditure. Advocate Kamal Gupta, who is representing a few private schools in the case, said, “The Delhi government wants to take the credit of supply of equipment to EWS category children, but not pay for it. If the government was at all serious or had any interest of children’s meaningful education, it would have started online education and distributed gadgets to all students in government schools.”Petitioner Khagesh Jha said EWS students in private schools are suffering. “Many of them may drop out due to the unavailability of devices and internet facilities. The financial dispute can be settled later as well. Who will take the responsibility if students drop out in the meantime?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-in-supreme-court-challenges-hc-order-on-free-gadgets-internet/story-vRjtrRa5araLM7J9ob8trL.html
18-11-2020||Delhi||HC‘shocked’: Welfare board finds just 28 of 740 registered circus animals||The Delhi high court on Tuesday expressed shock over the huge gap in the number of circus animals found by the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) during a survey of circuses across the country as compared to the number of animals registered with it.During the hearing, a bench of justice Vipin Sanghi and justice Rajnish Bhatnagar was informed by one of the petitioner counsels that though the AWBI had around 740 circus animals registered with it, a recent survey by the Board could find only 28 of them.The court then sought to know from the AWBI and the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) what had happened to the remaining animals. It asked both parties to file an affidavit disclosing the status of the circus animals registered with the Board and listed the matter for further hearing to January 2021.The court was hearing pleas by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and Federation of Indian Animals Protection Organisation (FIAPO) for protecting circus animals stranded across the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“This is a serious issue. Of the 740 (animals) registered with you (AWBI), you have only 28 to answer for. What happened to the rest of them,” the high court asked AWBI.“One shocking thing that has been revealed is that of the 740 animals, information is available with regard to only 28, leaving a massive gap,” the court said, noting the submissions of the FIAPO counsel, senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, said.The court also asked the Board why it had only inspected 19 of the 28 circuses in the country. It also directed the Board to inform the court about how many circuses are operational and what had happened to animals in circuses that have shut down.An official from CZA told the bench that animals of closed circuses and those not registered with AWBI are the concern and responsibility of the respective state wildlife authority.It further told the court that the authorities were in the process of withdrawing recognition given to the Great Golden Circus in Gujarat, the only one in the country that is recognised under the Wildlife Protection Act.Action is being taken against Golden Circus for alleged violations with regard to maintenance and display of captive elephants, the CZA told the judges.PETA India, represented by advocates Aman Hingorani and Swati Sumbly, has claimed in its plea that due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdown, circuses are finding it difficult to feed the animals which are now slowly starving to death.The FIAPO, which is a group of 100 organisations working for animal rights, has challenged the constitutional validity of sections 21 to 27 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act so far as they permit exhibition and training of animals in relation to circus acts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-shocked-of-740-circus-animals-in-country-animal-welfare-board-could-account-for-only-28/story-FCkyYsIl1upBD6r4OmiTAO.html

Indu Prakash Singh, Noida authority’s officer on special duty, held a meeting with health department officials and all private agencies engaged in waste collection, transportation and remediation work in the city. The meeting held in Indira Gandhi Kala Kendra in Sector 6 saw the participation of engineers, project engineers and sanitation employees.“We have asked the health department officials and the private agencies to collect only segregated waste from households in residential sectors and villages. We have also asked the staff to start preparing for the Swachhta Survey-2020-21,” said Singh.The ministry of housing and urban affairs will visit Noida next year to check the level of cleanliness and take feedback from the residents. The process will start from the beginning of January next year and will be completed by the end of the month. Noida ranked the cleanest city of the Uttar Pradesh and also secured the 25th spot in the country under the Swachh Survekshan 2020 — an annual survey conducted by the ministry of housing and urban affairs on cleanliness under the Swachh Bharat Mission, announced on August 20, 2020.Now the authority is hoping o perform even better in next year’s survey. As such, it wants to take all the necessary steps to secure a better ranking on the Swachhta index, said officials.Noida, which has a total of 165 sectors and 65 villages, produces nearly 900 metric tonne of waste. Although the authority has started collecting door-to-door waste with the help of 250 vehicles and 21 compact machines, segregated waste is collected only from 22 housing complexes. Officials point out that most households do not segregate their waste.As such, the authority’s main focus is to segregate 100% waste to perform better in the survey.“If we are able to segregate waste at each household and then collect and treat it, then the city can improve its cleanliness score,” said Singh.The authority has been also appealing to individuals and citizen groups to come forward to help them in segregation and making the city cleaner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-asks-officials-to-collect-only-segregated-waste-to-improve-swachhta-ranking/story-vp8DEsCHY4AWq7Dc3XH4sL.html
18-11-2020||Gurugram||18 houses in Bhondsi illegal colony demolished amid protests||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Tuesday demolished 18 fully constructed houses at an unauthorised colony in Bhondsi, amid stiff resistance and protests by owners and local residents. DTCP officials said that it took them almost an hour to start the demolition drive after reaching the spot, as a large number of people had gathered at the site and refused to give way. It was only after the intervention by a posse of the Gurugram police that the demolition process commenced in the colony, they said. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, who led the team, said that 18 houses were demolished along with 50 plinths and a long boundary wall in the colony, which is being developed on around 12 acres. “A survey was conducted last week and the inspection revealed that 18 houses had been newly constructed but were not occupied by the owners. We demolished those houses as they were built against all norms, in an unauthorised colony,” said Bhath. Even as the demolition drive was being carried out, a large number of locals and area residents raised slogans against the DTCP officials, following which the police again had to intervene again and issue a warning to the protesters. DTCP officials said the protests escalated when a group of locals gathered on Sohna Road and threw a large pipe on the road to block the route, causing a short traffic jam. “When we came to know about the protest at Sohna Road, the police team, along with DTCP team, marched around one kilometre to the spot and made the protesters to leave the area. We have also conducted videography of the entire protest to identify the persons causing trouble,” said Bhath.DTCP officials said that they had carried out demolition drives in the same colony twice in the past, but the landowners and plot buyers refused to heed their warnings. “The department has come up with new policies to develop such land for residential purposes. The owners should get licences and then sell it or develop, but they can’t be allowed to simply flout the rules,” said Bhath. DTCP officials said that despite the protests, the demolition was carried out and similar drives would be carried out across the city in the next two weeks. “We appeal to plot buyers not to invest in unauthorised colonies and instead, buy property in affordable projects. We have also thanked the Gurugram police for its strong support today and during other such drives,” said Bhath. In a related development, the department has recommended that an FIR be registered against a developer for selling plots in illegal colonies in Badshahpur, Bhondsi and Sohna. “I called the company number and their representatives tried to sell me an illegal plot. We have decided to lodge an FIR against them,” Bhath said. Subash Boken, public relations officer, Gurugram police, said that adequate police force was deployed during the drive to prevent any untoward incident. “There were arguments only and nothing major happened,” he said. Harish Vashist, whose shop in Bhondsi was demolished on Tuesday by DTCP officials, said that the department had not given them any notice regarding the action. “We have built the shop on our land and this was not part of an unauthorised colony. We had spent around Rs 8 lakh of our hard earned money and the entire family is devastated,” said Vashisht.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/18-houses-in-bhondsi-illegal-colony-demolished-amid-protests/story-NYP740fG68Id5UzNKdfDaI.html

H-Rera officials said the response from developers, homebuyers and other stakeholders is encouraging as people want a quick resolution of their problems through mediation and discussion rather than taking the time-consuming legal route. The mediation panel comprises SC Goyal, retired district and sessions judge, who is the adjudicating officer (AO); Deepa Malik, chief grievance redressal and chief public relation officer, and Geeta Rathee Singh, senior legal officer. On Monday, the panel heard 36 cases against a real estate developer, which were pending for a long time before the authority. H-Rera officials said these complaints were referred for mediation by the developer and were heard during the first session on Monday. KK Khandelwal, chairman, H-Rera, said, “Such mediation forums are the need of the hour. The authority is overburdened by a long list of pending complaints. Many of these complaints can be resolved through a few sittings.Mediation can save the aggrieved allottees from the very exhausting and expensive battle of litigation.” Officials of H-Rera, Gurugram, stated that the developer, Emaar, offered to assist the allottees for an amicable resolution, with the help of an expert panel appointed by H-Rera. During the mediation process, compensation for delayed possession charges (DPC) was given to those who had booked their flats in various projects of the developer but could not get the possession. Both the promoter and allottees agreed to resolve the issues through discussion and deliberation. “Mediation is a new process for the allottees. I feel that they need to come with a positive attitude and make the best use of this process”, said Deepa Malik. Representative of Emaar did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mediation-forum-of-h-rera-gurugram-holds-its-first-session/story-ViChhBFFV8GRyvoHo9GAWP.html
