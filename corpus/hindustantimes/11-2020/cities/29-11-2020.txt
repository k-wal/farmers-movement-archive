29-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Marathas will get quota back if Devendra Fadnavis is made CM again, says BJP MP||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Udayanraje Bhosale on Sunday said if Devendra Fadnavis was made the chief minister again, Marathas will get their reservation back. The MP also alleged that the issue of the reservation is being deliberately delayed. The Congress has raised questions over the remarks and asked if the BJP was hinting that it can influence the courts. Bhosale, who was in Satara, said the Maratha community got the reservation when Fadnavis was at the helm in the state. “There is no point in discussing the reservation to the community. It is the responsibility of the ruling parties to ensure that the community gets its reservation back. The state government has failed to follow the case properly in the courts. It is time for the community to seek answers from those responsible,” he said. The Congress has termed the statement controversial. “The reservation is pending in the Supreme Court currently. The state government has been doing its best for the formation of the constitutional bench and vacation of the stay on the reservation. Despite this, elected representatives from the BJP are trying to create confusion among the community members over the issue. The statement by the BJP MP is highly controversial. Does Bhosale want to suggest that Fadnavis can influence the top court too? The ‘confidence’ which has been developed about the constitutional entities is dangerous for the democracy,” said party’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-marathas-will-get-quota-back-if-devendra-fadnavis-is-made-cm-again-says-bjp-mp/story-WOt5PzIyK6KVCtyoI5K2XK.html
29-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Private doctors await help from Maharashtra government||With no government insurance for private medical practitioners, despite 62 Covid-19 deaths and repeated pleas of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), HT speaks to family members of the victim doctors, for whom the struggle is endless. On May 23, Dr Zabir Hussain, 51, a general physician from Chembur, who also worked with government ambulance service (108) for Covid-19 patients at night, succumbed to Covid-19 infection. He is survived by his wife and three teenaged children. Till May, they managed the household with Hussain’s monthly salary of ₹27,000. With no money left after his death, the family moved back to their hometown in Uttar Pradesh. “My father worked day and night even during the pandemic for an income. I am the eldest son, but I am too young to work. My mother is illiterate, so she can’t earn money to feed us,” said Adil, his 18-year-old son. With no alternative, he may have to leave his studies and start working as a labourer to earn money for his family. “IMA had approached us and we gave them a letter seeking insurance cover but so far, we haven’t received any amount,” he said. When the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak between April and June, the state health department and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) sought help from private practitioners to screen suspected patients. As gatekeepers in screening Covid-19 patients, the state, under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, had directed private physicians to keep their clinics open. In the initial days of the pandemic, many private practitioners screened people, risking their lives as they were not even provided with safety equipment like personal protective equipment (PPE), said doctors. As per rules, insurance cover is extended only to government doctors. Private doctors have called this decision of the state government “biased and unreasonable”. Despite repeated calls, health minister Rajesh Tope was not available for a comment.“When a person develops symptoms like cold and fever, he/she doesn’t directly rush to a hospital. They first visit a nearby clinic for diagnosis. So, private practitioners provide the first line of treatment and screening to suspected Covid-19 patients. So, how aren’t they directly involved in Covid-19 duty,” asked Deepak Baid, president, Association of Medical Consultant, who has also written to the state chief minister’s office. Most families of physicians who died of Covid-19 infection that HT spoke to criticised the state for ignoring their plight. The kin of Dr Mithkesh Rampal Singh said they are not covered under Covid-19 insurance although the general physician contracted the infection on duty and died on June 8. “While treating an asymptomatic patient in a hospital, he got exposed to the virus. In this backdrop, he should get insurance,” said Dr Vimal Singh, brother of the deceased. “My brother was living with his wife in a rented flat. The insurance money could have secured his wife’s life to some extent.” The Maharashtra chapter of IMA has also held meetings with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray but they didn’t include private practitioners into the scheme. “In a pandemic, all doctors are involved in screening suspected Covid-19 patients. But instead of honouring the doctors, private physicians are threatened of losing their medical licence. They don’t get any benefits from the state government,” said Dr Avinash Bhondwe, president of IMA, Maharashtra chapter. In another instance, after the death of Dr Akshay Thakur, 29, who was resident of Thane, his 57-year-old father has been running around trying to seeking insurance money. “We didn’t want him at his clinic, but he insisted as it was his duty. But soon, he developed fever and we had to admit him to a private hospital. We have spent over ₹12 lakh for his treatment by borrowing money from people. How will I repay them? He was supposed to get married in a few months. But the state denied the money for my son who cared for his patients in the pandemic,” said Deepak, his father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-private-doctors-await-help-from-maharashtra-government/story-XErxZO5qYe7A0YQTksmn0L.html
29-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: CAT 2020 was tougher than last year, say aspirants||More than two lakh aspirants of the premier Indian Institutes of Management (IIM) and other top B-schools appeared for the common admission test (CAT) 2020 across the country on Sunday. This year, the exam was conducted by IIM Indore and most students found it to be difficult compared to last year. The paper is divided into three sections — Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR) and Quantitative Ability (QA). “In the first two slots, both VARC and DILR sections were more difficult compared to the QA section. Overall, the level of difficulty was a little higher than last year,” said Vijay Jha, president of a competitive exam prep institute. Keeping the ongoing pandemic in mind, the exam-conducting authority this year decided to reduce the otherwise three-hour paper to a two-hour paper and held the exam in three slots instead of two slots in a day. The total number of questions asked in the paper was also reduced, in comparison with time reduction this time round. Several students also found the overall difficulty level higher of the examination held in the second slot, between 12:30pm and 2:30pm, compared to the morning slot. “In slot two, VARC and DILR sections were very difficult whereas the QA section was moderately difficult. Scoring well in order to be able to bag seats in top IIMs this year will be a challenge,” said Anukriti Sharma, an aspirant who appeared in the second slot of the exam held on Sunday. “The third and final slot for CAT exam on Sunday was comparatively easier than the first two slots. While DILR section was difficult, the other two sections were moderately difficult, giving relief to many students,” said Kaushik Laskar, centre director of a coaching institute. “Some sections across the three slots were slightly more difficult compared to the same section in last year’s paper, primarily because of two reasons—higher level of difficulty of the questions teamed with reduced time for answering them,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-cat-2020-was-tougher-than-last-year-say-aspirants/story-zkkncSGCqZKvTZu1ikgG4M.html

29-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Dog-bite patients hit as govt hospitals run out of anti-rabies vaccines||NOIDA: As government hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar have been facing a shortage of anti-rabies vaccines (ARV) for the past several days, dog-bite patients are forced to visit private clinics for the injection. RD Garg, a 57-year-old resident of Sai Apartment in Sector 71, was bitten by a stray dog on Friday. He claimed that he was denied treatment at the district hospital in Sector 30 and was told that the ARV was out of stock. “The doctors there said that despite repeated reminders, the vaccines are not been supplied to them from the state headquarters in Lucknow. Finally, I purchased the vaccines from the market and started the treatment,” Garg said. Similarly, BN Mukherjee of Sector 25 said that he was denied the ARV dose by the district hospital, when he was bitten by a stray dog on Saturday. “The doctors said that they are not sure about the date of arrival of the vaccines in the hospital. I had no option other than to purchase them from a medical shop, and then visited a private clinic to get the injection,” he said. As many as six persons have suffered dog bites since Friday, health officials said, adding that nearly 250 dog-bite cases were reported in the district since March this year.At the government hospitals, anti-rabies vaccines are provided to patients for free. However, due to the shortage, a dog-bite victim in the district has no option other than to have a mandatory course of several vials of the vaccine costing Rs 300 per vial in a private hospital or clinic. When contacted, Dr Renu Agarwal, chief medical superintendent of the district hospital, admitted that the hospital is running out of ARV stock for the past 15 days. “We’ve intimated the matter to the higher authorities and they have assured us to supply the vaccines soon,” she said. GB Nagar district chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri also said he had asked the officials concerned to look into the matter. “It is a matter of concern for us as since March nearly 250 dog-bite cases were reported in the district. We have ordered for 1,000 vaccines last week. I hope that very soon the stock will be received at different hospitals and health centres,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-dog-bite-patients-hit-as-govt-hospitals-run-out-of-anti-rabies-vaccines/story-Fhc2kqIndoZBqKyT4VYFDO.html
29-11-2020||Noida||Noida: 200 factories withdraw their electricity connections after the Covid-19 outbreak||NOIDA: With shrinking workforce and orders, over 200 factories in Gautam Budh Nagar have withdrawn their power connections since the Covid-19 outbreak. Not only that, nearly 200 other industrial units in the district have opted for reduced power loads, said officials of the Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL), the power distribution company of the district. PVVNL (Noida division) chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said that since April this year, 207 industrial units have voluntarily pulled their plugs, after clearing their outstanding dues. “Apart from them, nearly 211 other units have asked us to reduce their stipulated power load. The industrial units, which have permanently disconnected their electric lines, have also given their undertaking that they will not start their production again,” he said. Singh further said that right from the formation of the discom, out of 11,010 factories falling under the domain of PVVNL, as many as 3,115 units have been voluntarily disconnected their electric supply permanently. “It’s a very serious matter that reflects the industrial growth of a city or district. While 390 big industrial units of 2,497 units have got their permanent disconnection, another 2,725 of 8,513 medium and small units have opted for permanent power disconnection. As on average, permanent disconnection is opted by nearly 370 industrial units every year,” he said. Rajesh Kumar, who was running a factory of electronic materials in Sector 63, said that he had no other option than to close his factory as the cost of raw material has gone much higher and the orders have become limited after the Covid-19 outbreak. “Despite being declared as ‘no power cut zone’ by the state government, Noida has no respite from regular tripping. Also, after the ban on diesel gensets in NCR, we have no option left other than pull our shutters down,” he said. Surendra Nahta, president of MSME Association (Noida chapter), said that frequent power cuts have become a routine affair in Noida. “We face regular power cut every day. And, if the industries can’t work on diesel gensets, it is impossible to run the factories. The industries in GB Nagar district are on a receiving end,” he said. However, discom officials said that whenever there is a power cut, our staff fix the problem at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-200-factories-withdraw-their-electricity-connections-after-the-covid-19-outbreak/story-XamBxsxBcONov6IpZdiqSK.html
29-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 testing in Mumbai increased by 50% in the past 10 days||With the anticipated peak in Covid-19 cases in December during the ongoing festival season, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has increased testing by around 50% in the past 10 days. November 25 saw the highest number of tests conducted in a single day in Mumbai till date, at 19,018, of which 10,500 were rapid antigen tests, and the remaining were reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. So far, Mumbai has conducted a total of 18,71,125 Covid-19 tests.The number of Covid-19 tests conducted in a single day in the month of October peaked at around 16,500. However, the number of tests declined to a maximum of 13,500 tests in the first two weeks of November and further dropped to as low as 4,000 tests per day during Diwali between November 14 and November 16. In the past 10 days, BMC has scaled testing by 40% to 50%. On November 27, 16,902 tests were conducted in Mumbai; followed by 17,973 tests next days and 19,018 tests on November 25. Of them, approximately 50% were rapid antigen tests. This figure is likely to further go up in the coming days.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of BMC’s public health department said, “We are trying to plug all gaps to check the spread of Covid-19 in the community, especially as public interaction at the community level has increased greatly due to the festival season, and unlocking of the state.”BMC is now conducting tests at airports and railway stations which are landing points for people coming into the city from other states. It is also targeting households that were found locked during the My Family My Responsibility surveys, considering the reverse migration. BMC is targeting crowded areas and workplaces. Also, BEST bus drivers and conductors are being tested.“Considering the economic background of vegetable vendors and hawkers in markets, they are likely to take BEST buses. The bus conductors come in contact with a large number of people daily, hence, we want to ensure we tap positive persons in time and isolate them from the community by quarantining them on time,” Kakani added.If any person tested at airports and railway stations returned home before their results are found positive, high-risk contacts in the families are tested as well.However, the positivity rate has remained between 6% and 8%, versus the average positivity rate of 15%. This has been attributed to a high number of rapid antigen tests conducted daily, which have a lower rate of accuracy. While positivity per cent of RT-PCR tests is between 10% and 12%, the positivity rate of antigen tests is only 3% or 4%.Kakani said, “If an antigen test result shows negative, but the person is showing symptoms or is a high risk, BMC is conducting RT-PCR tests on these persons again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-testing-in-mumbai-increased-by-50-in-the-past-10-days/story-Zzg2Q0AHhmyX1VNqcn8AxN.html
29-11-2020||Noida||‘Super spreader’ groups not a major threat in UP, reveals govt data||The focussed testing on possible “super spreader” groups during the festival days did not throw up alarming Covid-19 spread, said government officials quoting partial data. This has come as a relief to government agencies that feared that crowds could lead to a spike in infection. The focussed testing was taken up cross the state from October 29 to November 12 during which specific groups of people, including auto-drivers and cycle-rickshaw drivers, beauticians and staff of malls, sweets shops, and restaurants, among others, were tested. The highest positivity was recorded from religious places -- of the 114,976 tests, 2,438 turned positive cases (2.12%). The state health department said that they had tested 55,741 auto rickshaw drivers and found only 413 positives (0.74%), while 60,702 restaurant staff was tested and 416 (0.68%) returned positive. About 116,054 staff of malls were tested and 1025 (.88%) were found positive.A total of 19,170,240 samples tested so far till November 29 while the total cases in UP stand at 541,873. This gives an overall sample positivity rate of about 2.82%.Ever since the festival season in November, the state has witnessed marginal increase in number of active cases. On November 1, active cases stood at 23,323, was 23,367 on November 14 and was 24,575 on November 29.“The results indicate that we have been able to timely isolate such people who come in contact with large number of people and can spread infection. With the results and focussed testing, we have also been able to spread awareness among people so that they understand that infection has not gone and all precautions must be taken,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health), while adding that data for other groups was in process of compilation. A similar focussed testing exercise in Ghaziabad during the same period tested 15,314 samples and found only 79 persons positive ( a rate of about 0.38%). “The results indicate that there is no large-scale infection among the groups and those who tested positive were timely isolated. However, we are still keeping checks on such groups and not let them off completely. We also have post-festival focussed testing going on till November 30 and there too the positivity is less than 1%. With the figures, we have also focussed our attention to several localities like Vaishali, Indirapuram, Raj Nagar, Kavi Nagar etc which have high number of cases. There, testing and surveillance have been feed up,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. The state officials said that it is because of the focussed testing that the spread of infection could be regulated and they are taking up every measure to control it further. “Starting December 1 to December we have another drive coming up in which districts have been asked to plot on their maps areas having high number of cases in past 15 days. In such cluster areas they will be taking up focussed testing and targeted surveillance to check spread of infection,” Prasad, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/super-spreader-groups-not-a-major-threat-in-up-reveals-govt-data/story-NLhR5X6rnJCfdjHGWFzuaL.html

All other sub-divisions in Maharashtra (Vidarbha, Marathwada, and central Maharashtra) could witness below normal maximum and minimum temperatures (ranging between 0.01 and 0.15 degree Celsius below normal).“The upcoming winter season will be similar to previous years for Konkan’s coastal districts with a warmer winter, and the subdivision may not witness exceptionally low temperatures. However, below normal minimum temperatures are likely over most subdivisions of north, northwest, central and few subdivisions over east India,” said an IMD official, adding that global weather parameters had indicated below normal sea surface temperatures over central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean) and moderate La Niña conditions (over equatorial Pacific Ocean) till the end of winter was expected.On Sunday, the city witnessed warm conditions with the suburbs recording maximum temperature at 34.5 degrees Celsius, a degree Celsius above normal, while south Mumbai recorded 33.6 degrees Celsius, a degree Celsius above normal.

29-11-2020||Noida||Residents’ group demands relaxation in stamp and registration fee||A residents’ welfare group on Sunday protested in Greater Noida demanding rebate in house registration fee and stamp duty. Urging the state government to take cue from the state governments of Maharashtra and Karnataka, Noida extension flat owners welfare association (Nefowa) also sent a letter the chief minister’s office, real estate regulatory authority and to the Greater Noida development authority demanding that the duty be reduced from 5 percent of the property cost to 2 percent. The demonstrators stated that while the government has given relaxation to the builders, the buyers are also facing financial crunch in form of salary cuts or job and business losses in the wake of Covid-19. “While the central government had provided moratorium to the real estate, there should be some rebate for the flat or home buyers. A number of residents have suffered financially due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it doesn’t justify to charge such high registration and stamp duty from them at such point of time. We have thus demanded the state government to consider relaxation in registration fee,” said Abhishek Kumar, who held a demonstration on Sunday at Charmurti circle in Greater Noida. The registration of property and stamp duty is a major source of income for the state government. “The revenue collection is almost back on track for the district and October saw a collection of approximately ₹130 crore. There are several facets involved in the registration fee which depends on the value estimate of the house or flat. Current rate is 5 per cent of the values estimated of the residential property, a stamp duty of Rs 50,000 would be additional,” said Pradeep Asthana, senior registrar, GB Nagar, adding that the stamp and registration duty for a typical 1300 sq ft flat in Noida would cost around ₹3 lakh. Officials said that the department, on average, earns a revenue of ₹150 crore per month. “It’s cruel to charge such a high duty from a person who is already suffering financial crunch. Over the period of next one year several thousands of families will be getting possession, if the duty is relaxed then it will be a great help,” said Rahul Garg, member, Nefowa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/residents-group-demands-relaxation-in-stamp-and-registration-fee/story-tHzvvhRMr1lgPtLkzs1PCI.html
29-11-2020||City||Punjab CM taking advantage of farmers’ stir: Ambala MLA Goel||Amid the war of words between the chief ministers of Haryana and Punjab on the ongoing farmers’ stir, political slugfest kicked off in Ambala on Sunday as City MLA from the BJP Aseem Goel alleged that Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh was taking undue advantage of the agitation. HDF leader Chitra Sarwara also reacted on the issue and said the government was offering farm laws in “form of pits”. “Assembly elections in Punjab are due anytime soon and Captain Amarinder is trying to take advantage of the farmers’ protests. Farmers are understanding who is in their favour and who is just making political statements,” Goel said after inaugurating an electric crematorium at Ram Bagh in his constituency. His comments came a day after his counterpart from Cantonment seat and state home minister Anil Vij alleged that Captain had “engineered the ongoing agitation”. Chitra hit out at the government and said that what unfolded in the last few days has proved that they were digging “large pits” in form of farm laws. “We’ve seen some unfortunate situations wherein the government tried to do everything possible to stop the farmers going to Delhi. All this has shown that the government was trying to offer large pits in the form of farm laws. On the one hand, the government is inviting farmers for talks and on the other, they’re digging roads, putting barricades and using water cannons even on elderly,” she said. “They are also trying to change the narrative through several means. But I’m proud that the Haryana farmers started their march from Ambala,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cm-taking-advantage-of-farmers-stir-ambala-mla-goel/story-x5TJKQ7Ei4XDqd56yszrGP.html

29-11-2020||Noida||Noida sees poor air quality, likely to worsen||Air quality of Noida and neighbouring areas dropped on Sunday. Pollution monitoring agencies warned that the air is likely to worsen as weather was likely to remain unfavourable in the coming days. On Sunday, the wind speed dropped from the average 20kmph on Saturday to 8kmph on Sunday. Weather analysts said that while 8kmph is moderate wind speed and enough to disperse the local pollutants in ideal conditions, it is, however, not enough to disperse the excess pollutants that were blown in from Punjab and Haryana where there are a few farm fires still burning. “The wind speed has dropped from 20 kmph on Saturday to 8 kmph on Sunday. For next three days the wind speed will hover around 6 to 8 kmph only, which is enough to disperse smaller particles in ideal conditions like low humidity, normal temperatures. However, if the number of farm fire incidents increases, the air quality will worsen,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Sunday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 268 against 223 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 273 against 226 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 300 against 240 a day earlier. The AQI between 101 to 200 is considered ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. Meanwhile the fine particles or pollutants also recorded a rise in their overall volume over past 24 hours. PM2.5 for past 24-hours in Noida was recorded at 116.41 microgrammes per cubic metres against 104.70 microgrammes per cubic metres a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 120.09 units against 101.23 units a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Ghaziabad was 151.86 units against 112.24 units a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 units. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is likely to deteriorate further due to rise in the number of forest fire and slowing down of the speed. “The AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate to the Very Poor category for the next two days. Likely to further deteriorate and forecasted to be in the higher end of Very Poor category for on 2nd December.,” said the SAFAR statement on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-sees-poor-air-quality-likely-to-worsen/story-x1lTyjiy22NuIWA5HpVUyN.html
29-11-2020||Noida||Bharatiya Kisan Union to continue ‘Dilli Chalo’ stir from UP Gate, decides to prolong stay||Farmers led by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) on Sunday continued their stir from the UP-Gate border in Ghaziabad and said that they will camp below the flyover. Government authorities said that they have made arrangements for smooth flow of traffic basic facilities for the farmers.On Saturday afternoon, the number of farmers at the site grew as many from neighbouring districts joined them responding to protest calls (of ‘Dilli Chalo’) against the central government’s decision to implement new agriculture reforms, which the farmers say would go against their interest.The farmers called the UP Gate flyover the “kisan kranti chowk” as it was also the site of another earlier major stir on October 2, 2018 when they had protested for loan waiver and against high power and fuel prices. Farmers brought in their tractor-trolleys, ration, clothes, bedrolls to camp below the UP-Gate flyover. They also cooked food at the site and also prepared tea which they shared with the police. On Sunday afternoon, they once again grouped and broke the barricades put up at the UP-Gate border by the Delhi police. However, they did not proceed to Delhi. “We will stay here and will wait for the plan for meetings with the government. There is no plan given to us and we are waiting for government to talk to us. More farmers will come on Monday,” said Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of BKU said at UP-Gate protest site on Sunday.On Saturday, the BKU had rejected the government’s offer for talks. The farmers union said that the government had put conditions for the talks, which were unacceptable to them. It said that they would block five main entry points to Delhi, one of which was UP Gate.“It is not just the new farm laws. We have other issues regarding sugarcane price, electricity, among others. There are lot of issues if anyone wishes to listen to them. We will continue stay here (until the government agrees to our demands),” said Tikait. The farmers have come from Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Amroha, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and other nearby districts in UP. Considering the continuation of the protests at UP-Gate, the district officials have made traffic diversions. Commuters coming from Indirapuram, Noida and proceeding to Delhi have been asked to take NH-9 flyover at UP-Gate and not allowed to come below the flyover area which is barricaded. “The other commuters from Mohan Nagar will be diverted to Anand Vihar-Kaushambi border. Commuters must avoid coming to UP-Gate as there is no entry/exit we have allowed below the flyover area. The diversion will continue till farmers are at the site. Their protest has been peaceful and they have decided to prolong their stay,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2). The district administration officials said that they have also provided basic facilities to the farmers at the site. “We are in constant touch with them and there will be no disruption of traffic on Monday. We have regularly sanitized the protest site and also roped in water tankers, mobile toilets for farmers. They have assured that there will be no disruption of inconvenience to public,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. Sunday is the fourth day since farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh among other neighbouring states had set off on their “Dilli chalo” campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bharatiya-kisan-union-to-continue-dilli-chalo-stir-from-up-gate-decides-to-prolong-stay/story-Zd7hSpFURJlMqk9fs6yhUJ.html

29-11-2020||Chandigarh||MC mulls building bitumen roads in Sec-38 motor market||The Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) is considering constructing asphalt and bitumen roads instead of cement roads in the Sector-38 (West) motor market. The MC had sought the opinion of the National Institute of Technical Teachers and Research (NITTTR) on its proposal of constructing cement roads in the market due to failure of bitumen ones to last their normal life. MC chief engineer Shailender Singh said, “The NITTTR has suggested that we should go for the asphalt and bitumen road rather than cement or only bitumen ones in the motor market. It has also suggested proper drainage system in the matter, which would also include grease traps.” The grease traps will collect the oil and grease being discharged from the shops in the motor market. These oils and grease shorten the life of the bitumen road, he added. Notably, MC councillor and BJP state president Arun Sood in October’s general house meet had criticised the MC for not constructing a road in the market. He had said, “The civic body had committed that within 100 days of the second term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Sector-38 (West) motor market will have a cemented road. But, even as 2021 nears, they haven’t started the work.” After the issue was highlighted by Sood, MC decided to first take technical advice from the NITTTR on the issue. After the advice, the MC will prepare an estimate for the project and then float work tender after getting necessary approvals on the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mc-mulls-building-bitumen-roads-in-sec-38-motor-market/story-5pJ7NdrwRl3FZZj5JhgO5M.html
29-11-2020||Delhi||Only three effluent treatment plants along Yamuna meet standards: NGT-appointed panel||Only three out of the 13 Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) in Delhi, meant to treat industrial effluents before wastewater can be reused or discharged into the Yamuna, meet environmental standards, thus adding to the pollution load in the river, the NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee has found. Expressing concern over the issue, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) panel has asked the Delhi government agencies to take short-term measures to improve the functioning of the plants. Also, it asked them to “explore strategies” to deal with effluents being discharged from non-conforming industrial areas.On November 19, after chairing a meeting of the Delhi Jal Board, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that his government was working on a concrete plan to reduce 90% pollution in the Yamuna river by 2023. The plan includes the use of innovative technology and reuse of treated water.The National Green Tribunal (NGT)-appointed panel in a recent meeting with officials of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC) and the industries department raised concerns over untreated or partially treated effluents being discharged into the drains that ultimately cause pollution in the Yamuna.“The capacity utilisation of the 13 CETPs is extremely low. While the total capacity is 212 million litres per day (MLD), only 60-65 MLD is being treated. This is mainly because the plants are not getting enough wastewater with the flow being only around 48-50 MLD,” said a member of the committee, who did not wish to be named.Of the 33 notified industrial clusters in Delhi, which have around 31,000 industrial units within 17 clusters have water polluting units, which are connected to the 13 CETPs. Besides, there is so far no assessment of how many water-polluting industries are there in the unorganised sector such as those running from residential or unplanned industrial areas while most of these have not set up any effluent treatment plants and discharge wastewater directly into the drains. The DSIIDC has informed the committee that the pollution caused by different sets of industries must be assessed by segregating them by location and the government departments under whose jurisdiction it falls. As per a report submitted by NEERI (National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to the NGT-panel, which was roped in for surveying industrial clusters, many areas such as Wazirpur, the amount of industrial effluent found in the drains within a cluster was twice the amount of effluent reaching the CETP. “This clearly points to industries either not conveying all the effluent discharge to the CETPs or water polluting activities being undertaken by unauthorised units within the clusters. This is a matter of concern as effluents were allowed to pollute the water without any oversight,” the report stated.Based on NEERI findings, the committee in the meeting asked the DPCC and the DSIIDC to jointly prepare a report with suggestive strategies, which can help in the regulation and monitoring of such units. “An exhaustive report of all these challenges and the work done so far for the river’s revival will be submitted in a report to the NGT by next week for further directions,” the committee member said.The NEERI report also suggests short-term measures such as de-sludging of CETPs to improve their efficiency. “The industries department told us that it has issued notices to industrial associations managing CETPs to get the de-sludging done and in case they fail to do so, the department will undertake the task and recover the cost from industries,” the member said.Meanwhile, a senior DPCC official, who did not wish to be named said, “A report has been submitted to the committee and we are waiting for further comments.”The two-member committee comprises former Delhi chief secretary Shailaja Chandra and former NGT expert member BS Sajwan.Manoj Misra, convener, Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, however, said that fixing of CETPs is no more a solution to the problem. “The only solution to industrial pollution is zero discharge. All water-polluting industries must have a treatment plant at the site itself or in case of smaller industries, there could be a cluster than can set up one common plant where wastewater is discharged and reuse it after treatment. There must be no discharge into the drains at all,” said Misra.He said during the Covid-19 induced lockdown when all industries were shut, Yamuna was relatively cleaner, proving the impact of the pollution caused by effluents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/only-three-effluent-treatment-plants-along-yamuna-meet-standards-ngt-appointed-panel/story-VLnrg4RG3lhcN1JpWRJbYL.html
29-11-2020||Mumbai||India inches towards first marine ‘designated area’ off Maharashtra coast||The state government has sent its final proposal to the Centre to notify 2,011.43 sq km Angria Bank – located 105km (56.7 nautical miles) off the Konkan coast – as a ‘designated area’ under the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, thereby inching towards India’s first marine protected zone beyond territorial waters.“It is a very important step towards conservation and protection of marine biodiversity,” said Milind Mhaiskar, principal secretary (forests) who wrote to central bodies, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) with a copy to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on November 25. Supporting coral reefs, algal habitats, and high diversity of marine flora and fauna, Angria Bank was identified among 106 important coastal and marine biodiversity areas in India by the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun.“There is a high probability that surrounding waters are an important habitat for marine mammals. However, as it lies beyond the Indian territorial waters (12 nautical miles), it is not possible to declare the site as a protected area under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972,” read the letter, adding, “Therefore, being in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), the only way to provide legal protection is by notifying it as a ‘designated area’ for marine protection under the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, (covering territorial waters, continental shelf, exclusive economic zone, and other maritime zones) of the MEA.”Angria Bank, located off Malvan in Sindhudurg district, is a submerged plateau with coral reef formation at a depth of 20 to 400 metres, home to 29 genera and 39 species of both hard and soft corals (protected under Schedule I of the WPA) across 650 sq km. The proposed boundary for protection is approximately 61-km long and 50-km wide.MoEFCC said they were aware of the proposal. “Angria Bank is a very contentious issue. We need to read through submissions in detail to understand the significance of this declaration before taking any decision,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director-general of forests (wildlife), MoEFCC.After the Maharashtra mangrove cell (under the forest department) first proposed conserving the area on April 29, it was finally approved by the state government earlier this month.“This is a major step forward as it will open new avenues for the conservation of corals and help address increasing natural events like coral bleaching (turning white due to rising sea surface temperatures as an aftermath of climate change). With more conservation focus there will be more protective measures, promotion of research, a bit of controlled tourism, and control over suspected threats,” said Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF-Wildlife.This proposal is a first under the Maritime Zones Act, 1976. “There was no precedence to accord legal protection to such a marine area beyond territorial waters. Thus, every minor detail has been elaborated ensuring security concerns and focused approach to address every threat to this submerged plateau,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell). A proposal based on thorough underwater surveys The state’s final proposal was based on underwater and boat surveys in collaboration with Centre for Marine Living Resources (CMLRE) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences and Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)-India, Mangrove Foundation of Maharashtra and partner institutes. As many as 123 species of fish, 43 species of invertebrates, dolphins and whales among other marine animals protected under India’s wildlife laws were recorded. Threats including overfishing, oil, natural gas and mineral exploration, rising ocean temperatures, and rising marine traffic were identified.“Submission of the final proposal is one of the last steps in ensuring this notification for protecting this pristine coral reef, adjoining seascape, and biodiversity comes through. The decision will help India meet international obligations for more protection of our marine biodiversity,” said Prakriti Srivastava, country director, WCS-India. Marine biologist and scientist Deepak Apte said, “We must pursue this (an effort to protect this critically important reef) at the Central government-level for its early declaration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/india-inches-towards-first-marine-designated-area-off-maharashtra-coast/story-P8RPgVUfug8tqtLq9spl1I.html

The Delhi unit of the programme has set up astronomy clubs in these schools in the past three years.“Through this activity, students will learn, through practical exposure to celestial events like a lunar eclipse, the movement of planets, the arrival of comets meteor shower etc. that will help in building confidence among students and prepare them for future,” said Mohinder Pal, deputy director of education (Samagra Shiksha).Kavita Rana, assistant project director at Samagra Shiksha, said team members will also be visiting all the schools holding the event on Monday. “Mentors from ISRO and IIT,Kanpur will be participating for the activity,” she said.Schools have been asked to comply with Covid-19 norms regarding physical distancing and sanitisation. Parents of the students will also have to submit a no-objection certificate to the school. “Students will be able to gain hands-on experience and see what they learn in their books. This is bound to increase their interest in science. We are calling over 30 class 9 and 10 students to school to watch the full moon and Saturn rings,” said Vijay Kumar, librarian at RPVV Shalimar Bagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sky-watching-event-at-delhi-govt-schools/story-boS4Z5YRzUx3l4QoL9LGaN.html
29-11-2020||Delhi||Rise in pollution, dip in mercury likely from first week of December: IMD||The city’s air got slightly worse on Sunday as a consequence of a marginal increase in farm fires in neighbouring states and slower winds over the National Capital Region (NCR), government agencies said.As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the average air quality index (AQI) was 256 on Sunday, up from 231 the previous day, both categorised as ‘poor’. Meanwhile, weather scientists have forecast a further increase in pollution December 2 onwards, with temperatures expected to dip and winds likely to slow down.Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) have forecast below normal minimum temperatures in parts of north and northwest India including Delhi this winter.“The minimum temperature is likely to remain between 6-8 degrees Celsius over the coming week. Usually, such a drop in temperature is observed from December 20-22, but is likely in the first two weeks of the month itself this year. This may impact air quality, as winds are likely to get calm around December 4-5,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC).On Sunday, the Safdarjung Observatory — readings from which are taken as representative of Delhi’s weather — recorded a minimum temperature of 7°C, three notches below normal. The maximum was 26.4°C, one above normal, while winds blew at speeds of between 8 and 10kmph. “Wind speeds will remain around the same over the next couple of days, but will become slow from December 2 onwards,” he added. As per IMD’s seasonal outlook for December to February released on Friday, nights and early mornings are likely to be chilly with below normal minimum temperatures over most parts of north, northwest and central and some parts of east India, while day temperatures are likely to be above normal over the same regions.According to the System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the Union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing, the share of stubble burning to the city’s PM2.5 levels on Sunday rose to 6% from 4% the previous day. “The number of fire counts was 464. Ventilation conditions are likely to slow down from December 2 onwards and air quality is likely to deteriorate to “very poor” zone thereafter,” the Safar bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rise-in-pollution-dip-in-mercury-likely-from-first-week-of-december-imd/story-v01zynEWfrQM0HuYJGpXjI.html

The plant will be set up at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore,” said North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash. The mayor visited the landfill on Sunday after reports of a fire at the site the previous night. The civic body at present generates 4,500 metric tonnes of waste daily, of which 2,300 metric tonnes is processed at the Narela-Bawana waste to energy plant, while the remaining is dumped at the Bhalaswa landfill.“We have installed 15 trommel machines to dispose of legacy waste at the landfill site. By now we are able to reduce the height of the landfill by 30 feet. Four more trommel machines are in the process of installation that will further help reduce the waste at the site,” the mayor said.Rising over 50 metres (beyond the permissible height of 20 metres), the landfill exhausted its lifespan in 2006.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-corp-to-set-up-second-waste-to-energy-plant-in-rani-khera/story-5X8Tq2n1R3yzX58KVxLdKO.html
29-11-2020||Delhi||AAP, BJP, Congress spar over ongoing protests||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said the Central government should immediately talk to agitating farmer groups without any preconditions.He tweeted, “The central government should immediately talk to the farmers without any terms and conditions.”His comments came a day after Union home minister Amit Shah said that the government was ready to talk to farmer leaders before the scheduled date of December 3 (Wednesday) along with an appeal to move their demonstration to a designated open space in Burari – located in the northern peripheries of the city.The BJP hit back at the AAP accusing them of “misleading” farmers.Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “When the Union home minister has given a clear assurance to farmers, we fail to understand why the AAP leaders are misleading them. Large gatherings are unsafe in the light of the pandemic. The BJP can also incur all expenses for arrangements in Burari. The AAP should look at its own anti-farmer reforms. They charge road tax on tractors, higher power rate for irrigation and hardly procure anything at Minimum Support Price (MSP). Delhi farmers are in distress because of them.”AAP’s spokesperson Raghav Chadha accused the Congress of supporting the three laws which the farmers are protesting against.Chadha said, “Congress party’s 2019 election manifesto had the proposal of the abolition of agriculture produce market committees (APMC). Also, the Modi government had formed a committee to discuss these anti-farmer laws. In meetings of that Committee committee, Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh of the Congress gave his consent to all three anti-farmer laws.”The Congress denied the charges and hit back saying Chadha’s statements were “outright lie”.Mudit Agarwal, vice president of the Delhi unit of Congress said, “In the manifesto, the Congress had promised reforms in APMCs. And we are against the idea of doing away with APMCs. Also, minimum support process has to be given legal status under the new law to protect the interest of the farmers. As far as the committee is concerned, the Congress leadership in Punjab had never consented to the three Bills (now laws) which the farmers are protesting against.” (ends)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-bjp-congress-spar-over-ongoing-protests/story-roI9fQ3F7wZsJIJzI4K1mI.html
29-11-2020||Delhi||Sleeping in tractors, bathing by the roadside, women farmers say they’ve come prepared||Gurdev Kaur, a 70-year-old woman farmer from Patiala, gets a call every two hours from her family members, who are concerned for her well being. Kaur, one of the oldest women participants in the ongoing protests, has been camping at Delhi’s Singhu Border for the past three days with thousands of others from Punjab and Haryana who have marched up to the capital to voice dissent against the newly passed farm laws by the Central government.And Kaur is not the only one. Hundreds of women farmers have marched to Delhi with their male counterparts to voice their opposition against the new farm laws, which agitators say will change the manner in which agricultural produce is procured and traded .Septuagenarian Kaur says that when they were told they will all march up to Delhi to protest against the laws, she did not think twice. “In Punjab, we have been attending meeting on our action plan every day for the past two months. We are ready to support the agitation till our last breath,” she said.Kaur’s husband passed away a few year ago. She has two married sons back home who take care of the house and the family. “My daughters-in-law will take care of the house while we are here. They call me up frequently to ask if I am fine. They are worried because I am old. But I am not alone. There are hundreds of women here to support the cause and we take care of each other. We have our daily doses of medicines and other necessities with us. We can survive well enough,” she said, adding that she also speaks to her grandson daily, who is in Canada.Sixty five-year-old Amarjeet Kaur, another protester, added that for the last three days they were sleeping in tractor trolleys. “We have brought along mattresses and we sleep in tractor trolleys. We have designated places to take bath and relieve ourselves. We are not used to all this, but it is for a cause in which all of us are together. Most of the women here are the only representatives from their families,” she said.Donning a salwar kameez and covering their head with a shawl or dupatta, these women participate in the protest at the Singhu Border by the day and as it starts getting dark, retreat to their tractors to prepare the day’s meal. One of them, 50-year-old Charanjeet Kaur said their tractor is at least four kilometers away from the main protest site. “In the afternoon, we sit where our kisan leaders deliver speeches and raise slogans against the current farm laws. By evening, we return to our tractor trolleys, which is our home for now,” she said.For the past three days, a majority of these women farmers have mainly been occupied in preparing large quantities of food and distributing it among the protesters hrough Langars with the help of other younger farmers.“Most of our time is spent in cooking meals. We’ve been eating chapati with mixed vegetable curry for the past three days, which we cook ourselves. We’ve brought ration in abundance. We have food to last us for 5-6 months. When we decided to leave for Delhi, each of us contributed different items. While some brought oil, some contributed spices. Someone else donated their stove while others were told to chip on with mattresses and quilts. When our ration gets over, we will bring more. But will return only when our demands are met,” said 62-year-old Baldev Kaur, another woman farmer from Fatehgarh, close to Patiala.The farmers have been protesting at Singhu Border since Friday when thousands of them reached Delhi’s border, but were restricted from entering the Capital. Clashes later broke out with the police, with the farmers trying to cross through barricades to enter the city. The Delhi police later allotted Sant Nirankari ground, in Burari, to the farmers to continue their agitation. The farmers, however, turned down the offer, continuing to block the Singhu Border and demanding Ramlila Maidan as a protest site, which is close to Lutyens’ Delhi.Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharita Kisan Union, Ludhiana said that whoever was with them had volunteered.“Women have been the backbone of our movement since the beginning. Even in Punjab, they have been taking care of us when it came to food and other necessities and kept our movement going with active participation in all fields. At least 1000-1200 women joined us from Patiala , Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Amritsar and other places. We respect them and are deeply thankful to them for their contribution,” Lakhowal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sleeping-in-tractors-bathing-by-the-roadside-woman-farmers-say-they-ve-come-prepared/story-9r7WiktfmMOL5dAyWSaaPI.html

It is used in case a person is travelling without a ticket and has no cash with them. In such cases, the passenger can pay through debit/credit card and the ticket checking staff will process the payment through a PoS machine and issue a receipt to the passenger and keep a copy with them.The railways had provided 80 PoS machines to ticket checking staff at Ludhiana railway station in August 15, but they hardly use it due to the technical issues attached with these, such as poor network signal in moving trains.Requesting anonymity, a staffer said that one of the reasons for providing PoS machines to them was to minimise cash transactions due to the Covid-19 outbreak, but due to poor signal in moving trains, they were struggling to use the devices.The railway staff is also finding it difficult to keep a record of receipts as the ink on them fades out within a week, making it impossible to decipher the text. According to the staff, they have to store the receipts for six months. One solution is to keep photocopies of the receipts, but that will cause financial burden on the staff. They have sent a representation to senior officers over these issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/signal-issues-plague-use-of-point-of-sale-machines-say-ludhiana-railways-staff/story-6mI3msj5AQKhkgyiO3bJ3O.html

It is suspected that the furniture kept outside its premises picked this fire, which led to a blaze in the building.Leading fireman Rajan Singh said, “Three fire tenders were sent to the spot after we received an alert and the flames were put out in two hours. Workers rushed out of the building before the fire brigade reached the spot. Hence, injuries were avoided.”Fire at scrap godown in Gurmail NagarMeanwhile, in the second such incident in a week, a fire was reported at an open scrap warehouse at Gurmail Nagar near Giaspura on Saturday night.On November 22, another scrap godown had caught fire in Salem Tabri.Small explosions in the building and bright flames in the thick of night left residents of houses located in the adjacent narrow streets nervous.The fire was first noticed around 10.30pm, following which the owner and neighbours first tried to douse the flames and then called the fire department around midnight.As many as five fire tenders were rushed to the spot, but these could not reach the spot due to the narrow street, forcing firefighters to lay out a 600-foot-long hose to start the operation that lasted till 3am. As the premises were closed for the night, no one was hurt.Sub-fire officer Maninder Singh said, “No casualty was reported and the firefighters controlled the flames in around three hours.”Alarmed by the incident, residents demanded that the godown be shifted out of the area, as such mishaps posed grave danger to the population living around it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/furniture-workshop-ravaged-in-sunday-afternoon-blaze-at-ludhiana-s-haibowal-area/story-7qlNTlZo0wBDyVIfObfNvO.html
29-11-2020||Chandigarh||Liquor contractor alleges extortion by policemen in Chandigarh||A case was registered on Sunday against unidentified persons after a liquor contractor alleged that a few Chandigarh police personnel were extorting money from him and submitted CCTV footage of the ‘extortionists’ to the police.The liquor contractor (name withheld) in his complaint alleged that Chandigarh police personnel had been extorting money from him for the past few months. As it was not verified whether the men in the CCTV footage were police personnel, a case against unknown persons was registered.The liquor contractor has also sent the footage to senior police officials, sources have said.Commenting on the matter, a senior police officer privy to the matter said the liquor contractor ran six liquor shops in the city and had alleged that he was paying Rs 96,000 a month in extortion money.Sources, however, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the men seen in the footage were from a specialised investigation wing of the police department. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “We have received the complaint and the video clip. After identification of the accused we will take action against them.”The case was registered under Section 383 (extortion) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 13(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act at the Sector 39 police station. Police officials said they are trying to verify whether the accused were actually cops or impersonators.A few days before, Ranjit Singh, the person in charge of the operations cell in the union territory, was accused of trying to extort Rs 2.5 lakh from a liquor contractor. The name of the contractor from Sector 21 had come up after 300 bottles of liquor were seized while being transported to Himachal Pradesh in a consignment of fish. Ranjit Singh had allegedly sought a bribe for not registering a case against the contractor, who informed senior police officials about the matter. Singh was transferred to police lines on Thursday and also faces a departmental inquiry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/liquor-contractor-alleges-extortion-by-policemen-in-chandigarh/story-Pyu6RuKVLN8V5KWQFavGKI.html

In a complaint forwarded to the local bodies department and chief minister’s office on Sunday, they slammed the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) for its failure to repair the temporary boundary.Residents said that accidents take place at the site every year due to foggy conditions. They added that cars drive into the dug up portion due to improper boundary and non-functional street lights.RTI activist Arvind Sharma, said, “LIT has not repaired the boundary walls in the last decade. Accidents are reported at the site every year. The city centre project has not been completed till now as LIT is still in a legal battle with Today Homes. But, residents are bearing the brunt of this.” A resident, Jaspal Takkar, said, “The iron sheets installed at the boundary have broken at many points. LIT has also failed to repair the street lights, which increases the possibility of untoward incidents. Several complaints have been submitted with the local officials and higher authorities of local bodies department. But, no one is paying heed to the problem.” Sharma said that LIT’s failure to remove the garbage near Sunet railway crossing is also causing a nuisance in the area. “Garbage is strewn over a stretch of one kilometre along the road and authorities do not even bother to clear it. Foul smell spreads in Blocks D, E G and H of SBS nagar. The carcasses of two stray cattle which met with a train accident on Sunday are also lying there,” he said. LIT executive engineer, Buta Ram, said, “LIT cannot establish a wall around the City Centre site as we are still in a legal fight with Today homes in Delhi High Court. Minor repairs are done to avoid any untoward incidents and I will look into the recent complaint. Also, I will direct the staff to get the street lights repaired.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/broken-boundary-wall-of-ludhiana-city-centre-site-residents-slam-lit-complain-to-local-bodies-dept-cmo/story-TYCzpIacmCQJcTqxh5MA7N.html
29-11-2020||Chandigarh||Speed up takeover of resumed properties, Chandigarh adviser tells local agencies||The Chandigarh Housing Board, estate office and municipal corporation are set to start a drive, likely within a week, to take possession of hundreds of properties for which resumption orders have been issued for years.Taking serious note of the failure of the three agencies to take possession of properties even several years after resumption proceedings have been upheld, UT adviser Manoj Parida has instructed them to act promptly. They will also take over those properties for which cases are pending in appeal but there is no stay on resumption order.“I have given instructions to the MC, CHB and estate office to start a drive in a week’s time to take possession of properties where resumption proceedings have been completed,” said Parida. The three agencies have been instructed to compile an updated list of such properties, and the process for their digital tracking will also be initiated once the drive kicks off. The development comes after Parida called a meeting on the issue last week. Agency secretaries, heads and law officers were present. “It came to my knowledge that there are a large number of properties, as of now estimated to be around 700-800, in which possession is yet to be taken. It is not correct if the government doesn’t take possession even after winning the legal case for resumption,” said the adviser. He will take a review meeting of the drive after a week and also take account of the exact properties that have to be taken over. Reasons for delay aplentyThe MC, CHB and estate office are three agencies in the city that are custodians of properties – residential, commercial and institutional. Properties that stand resumed include shop-cum-flats, shop-cum-offices, booths and residential accommodations.There are some that are involved in legal tangles since as far back as 1976.In many of these cases, resumption notices have been issued on account of building violations, misuse of property or non-payment of lease amounts.The estate office issues orders for resuming 10-15 sites every year. In the MC’s case, in its rehabilitation colonies, more than 90% of sites have been transferred on general power of attorney in violation of rules. In many of these cases, resumption orders have been issued, but possession hasn’t been taken yet. “There are instances where people who have to be evicted from government properties continue to remain in occupation due to corruption at lower levels of the department. There are also cases of political pressure on officials,” said an MC official, requesting anonymity. In the meeting, too, the adviser enquired as to why the three agencies have failed to the take possession and allowed people to occupy government properties illegally. The work pressure on subdivisional magistrates (SDM) was cited as one of the reasons for non-implementation of resumption orders, said an official who attended the meeting. “With high work load on SDMs, we are now planning to delegate the power of taking possession to officials in the MC too,” said Parida. An officer of the rank of additional or joint commissioner is likely to be entrusted with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/speed-up-takeover-of-resumed-properties-chandigarh-adviser-tells-local-agencies/story-vKmIRzt1LsM0LlgLGzPLFI.html

The exam started at 10am. The school authorities said that a candidate, Kiran Rani, reported at 10.10 am, and she had the same roll number as another candidate with the same name. The invigilator checked the roll number and Aadhar cards of both students and took them to the school principal to resolve the matter. They contacted the Guru Nanak Dev University officials and were told to let both applicants appear for the test. District education officer, secondary, Swaranjit Kaur, was inspecting the centre at 10.30am. When she was told about the incident, she informed the state education department, who directed the officials to get a FIR lodged against the two women. A case has been registered at Division Number 8 police station under Sections 419 , 420 and 120 B of Indian Penal Code.Jarnail Singh, station house officer at Division Number 8 police station, said, “We have asked both candidates to join the investigation.”As many as 3,238 candidates appeared for the ETT recruitment examination at 11 centres in the city.

The flight then took off at 21:28 hours with the harvested organs, it said.“I look forward to leading Alliance Air and take it to greater glory and enhanced regional connectivity, through safe and efficient operations, passionate hard work, clear focus, meeting the goals of the business and corporate social responsibility through a true ‘alliance’ of hearts and divine energy with teamwork and faith in God,” said Mrs Harpreet A De Singh, CEO, Alliance Air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/alliance-air-delays-flight-to-allow-retrieved-organs-to-save-4-lives/story-D2hTkvC7b0LDzpokg7lqDK.html
29-11-2020||Gurugram||Daily cases below 500 after over three weeks||The district on Sunday reported 479 new Covid-19 cases, the lowest number of daily new infections in over three weeks. Gurugram had previously reported 460 new infections on November 3, following which the number of new daily infections has remained consistently above 500 cases per day. Gurugram’s total tally of Covid-19 cases now stands at 49,098.The health department tested a total of 56,007 samples for Covid-19 this past week, the highest seven-day aggregate since the beginning of the outbreak. The spurt in testing marks a 51% increase from the 37,000-odd samples tested last week, and resulted in a dip in the weekly test-positivity rate (TPR) — the ratio of positive samples to total samples tested — from 11.5% to 7% in the intervals ending on November 22 and 29. This is the lowest in at least six weeks.Health department officials were reluctant to comment on whether the district’s third wave of infections, which began with the onset of winter in mid-October, is waning. They, however, said that the numbers present a hopeful trend. “Sunday was the first day that we reported less than 500 cases. And despite a substantial increase in testing over the past week, we are reporting fewer cases than in mid-November. The growth rate is abating but the decline in new daily cases will reduce gradually,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer, Gurugram.The number of active cases, however, has gone up, currently at 6,160 patients, from 5,693 active cases a week ago. Of the currently active cases, 391 patients are hospitalised (down from 422 a week ago), while 5,757 patients are under home isolation (up from 2,264 a week ago). Another 12 patients (up from 10 a week ago) are under observation at district Covid care centres. Gurugram also reported five Covid-related deaths on Sunday, taking the total mortality count to 288.Of the 367 beds in intensive care units (ICU) currently reserved for Covid-19 treatment across 42 hospitals in the city, 201 are currently occupied. This also includes 253 ventilator beds, of which 81 are presently occupied. In addition, the district has another 2,633 general hospitals beds currently reserved for Covid-19, of which 625 are occupied. However, at least 425 Covid-19 patients currently hospitalised in the city for treatment of Covid-19 are not residents of Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/daily-cases-below-500-after-over-three-weeks/story-VD3vvjUj5gZAHuTI9kAhmK.html
29-11-2020||Gurugram||Teachers concerned over academic session disruptions||With schools set to remain shut till the first week of December, teachers have raised concerns over its adverse impact on the learning process, and said that assessing and evaluating students’ progress through online classes is becoming difficult.Haryana home minister Anil Vij on Saturday had said that schools in the state will remain shut for 10 more days in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Previously, the state education department had ordered the closure of all government and private schools in Haryana till November 30 as Covid-19 cases among school students started to spike, after physical sessions for classes 9 to 12 had resumed on November 2.Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that teachers had expressed concerns about the closure of schools at a time when the syllabus was nearing the end. “This period is very crucial for students in classes 10 and 12. This session will not be declared as a zero session and board exams will definitely take place. While we are conducting the lessons and preparations from our end, there is no way to understand how much students are grasping. We have also noticed that students are losing interest and not responding to calls as they did during the earlier months of the lockdown,” said Sharma.She said that teachers are worried about poor results due to the disruption in lessons. “Usually, written practice sessions are conducted during this time of the year, ahead of the exams. If students were visiting school, we would have motivated them to take the exams seriously and prepare accordingly. While the bright students are taking an interest, we fear that slow learners might not be able to perform well,” said Sharma.She said that the school had planned to conduct mock exams and that the closure has forced them to look for online alternatives.Manjubala Bhardwaj, who teaches English to class 11, said that some students were not actively involved due to technological problems. “Some students have been facing access issues due to the lack of smartphones at home. They are facing a loss,” said Bhardwaj.She said that physical classroom sessions would have helped in keeping students motivated. “Every year, we provide additional hand-holding support to students through multiple revisions and tests. Replicating the same online is not always possible. We are in a precarious situation since both, health and studies, are important,” said Bhardwaj.Shyam Raghav, the principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that his staff members remain in favour of opening schools, while taking precautionary measures. “Teachers are devoted to lessons and worried about the impact on results. The academic year is nearing the end and even students are getting fed up now. Students were motivated during physical classroom sessions due to a competitive spirit but with individual online learning, slow learners might fall behind,” said Raghav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/teachers-concerned-over-academic-session-disruptions/story-R5taEmEAMVXrEgsjwzv2cJ.html
29-11-2020||Gurugram||City shivers at 7.5 degrees Celsius; air quality drops further||The city recorded its lowest minimum temperature of this season at 7.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday — three degrees below the previous day’s minimum temperature of 10.5 degrees Celsius. Sunday’s minimum temperature was also three degrees below the normal for this time of the year. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 24.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday. IMD officials on Sunday said that below-normal minimum temperatures are likely over most subdivisions of north, northwest, central and few subdivisions over east India during the winter season — December to February — this time. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature will hover around 25 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature is expected to stay at 9 degrees on Monday. As per the weekly forecast, clear skies will prevail on Monday. The city’s air quality stayed in the “poor” category for the second consecutive day on Sunday, recording a reading of 242 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin — a fall from Saturday’s AQI reading of 204. Experts attributed the deterioration to slow wind speeds due to which pollutants couldn’t be dispersed. The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5) — the city’s primary pollutant — also increased and was recorded at 143.9 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) on Sunday, as per the data by CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. The concentration of PM2.5 pollutants on the previous day stood at 109 ug/m3. According to the early air quality warning system for the National Capital Region (NCR), the air quality is likely to remain in the very poor category on Monday and Tuesday owing to unfavourable meteorological conditions for the dispersal of pollutants. In the national Capital, air quality also deteriorated as a consequence of a marginal increase in farm fires in neighbouring states and slower winds over the region, government agencies said.As per the CPCB, the AQI for Delhi was recorded at 256 on Sunday, up from 231 the previous day, both categorised as “poor”. Sachin Panwar, a Gurugram-based independent air quality scientist, said that the air quality had deteriorated on account of slow winds due to which pollutants couldn’t be dispersed. He said that with falling temperature in the morning hours and thermal inversion, the air quality is expected to deteriorate further as the temperature falls. “As winter sets in, the morning temperature will fall day by day. Right now, since the presence of fog is not significant; the air quality is still better. Once the fog starts setting in, air quality will become poorer due to greater accumulation of pollutants,” said Panwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-shivers-at-7-5-degrees-celsius-air-quality-drops-further/story-ZlVCVzi1YTUulID7S8rxGO.html

The suspect has been identified as one Aftab Ahmad, alias Raja, a resident of Sector 9.The police said Raja, along with three of his friends, were having drinks in the Manesar area on Saturday evening, when an altercation broke out among them. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that four of them resolved the issue and left for their respective homes. “The incident took place on late Saturday evening, when one of his friends, Monu alias Sunil, a resident of Devi Lal Colony, was on his way home with another friend. Raja, along with a friend, came on a speeding motorbike from behind and shot at him. A bullet hit in his stomach and he fell from the motorbike,” he said Rao said the victim was rushed to Civil Hospital in Sector 10 and later was referred to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi after his condition was reported critical. The police said the victim’s friend informed the police and the probe was handed over to the crime investigation unit. The team led by inspector Amit Kumar based on technical and human intelligence arrested Raja.The police said an inebriated Raja shot at his friend and fled from the spot. He was arrested for attempt to murder and was produced before the judicial magistrate on Sunday and was remanded in police custody for two days. The victim and suspect lived in same colony and would often be seen together, said the police.

The company is yet to verify the total number of forged slips sold to commuters.The kingpin of the gang, Jitender, who was arrested on Saturday revealed that he had bought a printer for ₹6,500 and he, along with his friends, Tejinder and Jeetu, started printing and selling slips to drivers from March this year. Although, the drivers knew about this forgery and they used to charge full reimbursement from the companies they drove for.The police said they received a complaint from MEP Infrastructure Developers, the contractor for collecting municipal toll, alleging that a driver was trying to pass through with a fake slip.The police said MEP officials had also found similar fake slips when they had, randomly, stopped three cars to check their slips.

Now, the association has sent another survey on the parents’ willingness to send the kids to school in December.ISA president HS Mamik said, “We have asked the parents if they want to send their kids to school by December 1 or December 10.

As the MP for Ealing Southall and a councillor for 25 years before that I have often been ashamed the names of empire still pervade our streets”.Councillor Kamaljit Dhindsa, Ealing cabinet member for business and community services, said the council’s diversity is its strength, adding: “we have to make sure that the places we live reflect that diversity through our street names and buildings.”Julian Bell, leader of Ealing Council, said: “The renaming of one of Ealing’s roads reflects the importance of celebrating the borough’s diversity and is a timely celebration of the birth of Guru Nanak on 30 November.”The Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha moved to its current location on Havelock Road in 1997, when it was inaugurated by Prince Charles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/renaming-southall-road-after-guru-nanak-cleared/story-hZdi3xWo2ajayHmXwxizVP.html

Till October 31, 121 dengue cases have been reported. The pattern of the last six years shows that dengue cases are unevenly reported throughout the year, and the cases begin to rise after September and reach a peak in November, to fall thereafter.This year, as many as 19 cases were reported in September followed by 89 cases in October. Last year, too, a similar trend was reported with 30 cases being reported in September followed by 82 and 124 in the months of October and November, respectively.Authorities are, however, hopeful that the number of cases reported in the city this year will be around 250, less than what was reported last year.“Since we are in the last leg of the year and cases in the month of December see a dip, the number will remain below 250 against the 286 reported last year. The cases would have been lesser if the employees involved in the fogging process would have visited the homes and checked for possible sources like water-filled containers. Even though there was stiff resistance, fogging was carried out in all possible manner especially in the vulnerable areas,” a senior officer of the UT health department’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, wishing anonymity, said. Most of the cases were reported from Manimajra and Bapu Dham Colony, officials said.“The life-cycle of the mosquito which starts in the later part of August and September reaches the adult stage in November during which they bite the most. Additional reasons for the spike in cases in November are that conditions are most conducive inside the houses due to relatively high temperature,” the officer quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/november-accounted-for-52-of-dengue-cases-in-chandigarh-this-year/story-fwXbI4S2zbfRfoHARGxgQK.html

29-11-2020||Jaipur||Viral video: Gehlot calls Dotasra for discussion, BJP demands CM’s resignation||Cornered by the opposition after the ruling party MLA’s video went viral, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot will hold discussion with state party chief Govind Singh Dotasra on the issue on Monday, Congress leaders said. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded CM’s resignation. The alleged video of Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya, Congress MLA from Bagidora and a former minister, is doing the rounds on social media. The video purportedly shows Malviya saying, during a campaign for panchayat polls in Banswara, that each of the two BTP MLAs of Dungarpur received Rs 5 crore during the Rajya Sabha polls and Rs 5 crore each during the political crisis when former deputy CM Sachin Pilot rebelled against the Gehlot government. A senior Congress leader familiar with the development, said on condition of anonymity, that Gehlot has called Dotasra, who is currently on a visit to Sikar, for discussions. Apart from other organizational issues, the CM will be taking up the ongoing video issue with Dotasra. He added that the state in-charge and AICC general secretary Ajay Maken has already spoken with Gehlot on the issue. Also read: Farmers’ protest: Amarinder Singh questions Khattar’s Covid-19 concernsHitting at Gehlot, Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, in a series of tweets, demanded his resignation. Retweeting the video, he stated, “Gehlot government is playing with democratic values and mandate, and it is not hidden. Now, it is clear from the acceptance of the party’s senior MLA Mahendrajeet Singh Malviya in front of public that CM Ashok Gehlot has no right to continue on his post.” He said, “The trust vote obtained by the state government in the Legislative Assembly through the purchase and sale of MLAs was actually deceit with the public, similarly the victory of the Congress candidate in the Rajya Sabha election is also doubtful.” In another tweet, he said, Gehlot talked about herding, and simultaneously, on the other hand, created a chakravyuh (trap) of horse-trading, mislead the public and attacked the BJP to divert attention from his deceit. But now, all the secrets of this conspiracy are coming out themselves - the public is watching everything. Congress spokesperson Archana Sharma said the person who was involved in destabilising the state government has no moral authority to seek anyone’s resignation. The plot of toppling the government failed and now they are making baseless allegations, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/viral-video-gehlot-calls-dotasara-for-discussions-bjp-demands-cm-s-resignation/story-9vFu4s2xXAwgrhrRBGpc0M.html

They are facing trials in two or more cases of murder, attempt to murder, rape, drug peddling, robbery and snatching, among other crimes. Police also have another list of 2,800 proclaimed offenders (POs), who remain at large.According to police, at least 65% of undertrials and convicts return to crime after getting out of jail. As they pose threat to the law and order situation in the city, it was decided to start a daily attendance system to keep a track of their movement.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said the system was planned in July, but was delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak. But, it will be implemented shortly.As part of the process, the munshi concerned will also be clicking photographs of the history-sheeters. Those who fail to report to the police station daily will be arrested as a preventive measure.During his visit to the city on Thursday, Punjab director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta had also asked the police chief to put in special efforts to arrest fugitives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-police-devise-daily-attendance-system-to-tighten-grip-on-history-sheeters/story-V9glLypz7qs77aSNGuWHnJ.html

29-11-2020||Kolkata||Abhishek Banerjee takes on PM Modi and BJP on national security, personal remarks||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) used the Pulwama terror attack as an election issue to retain power in 2019 but has done nothing to free the territory China captured in Ladakh six months ago, Lok Sabha member and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee alleged at a huge public rally at his constituency, Diamond Harbour, on Sunday afternoon. This was his first public meeting in eight months. Taking an aggressive stance, he declared the launch of his election campaign for the coming assembly polls. “The government has not disclosed how much territory has been occupied by China. In fact, the Prime Minister says there is no such occupation while the Union defence minister claims otherwise. Who is fooling the people? We want China to be given a befitting reply but all Modi has done is ban some Chinese apps. How long do you plan to carry on with this politics with your false patriotism? Will you free this territory before the next election?” said Banerjee. He is also the president of the youth front of the Trinamool Congress (TMC). “We want India to give a befitting reply to any country that endangers her sovereignty, be it Pakistan, China, Nepal or Bangladesh. But why is the government silent for six months although China has occupied our territory in Ladakh? Do the lives of our soldiers who died in Galwan have no value?” Banerjee questioned. Also read: PM Modi to have drone killer as part of his security detailIn recent months, Banerjee has been singled out and targeted by state and central leaders of the BJP. In his speech, Banerjee dared PM Modi and other BJP leaders to take his name instead of referring to him as bhaipo (nephew in Bengal) or bhatija (nephew in Hindi) in their public speeches. “At his rally at Diamond Harbour before the last election, Modi said ‘bhatija’ will lose the limelight. I dare Modi and BJP leaders of all ranks to take my name. Neither the Prime Minister nor the others have that courage. Every time they did it, I dragged them to the high court and rubbed their noses on the ground. That’s why they are afraid of taking my name these days,” said Banerjee.“I am not afraid of taking names. I am boldly saying Amit Shah, Kailash Vijayvargiya, Amit Malviya, Sunil Deodhar and the others are outsiders. I am saying Dilip Ghosh (state BJP president) is a ruffian and a mafia. I am saying Vijayvargiya’s son Akash is a ruffian,” said Banerjee. Reacting to this, Vijayvargiya said, “Banerjee has been shaken by the raids the income tax department and the Central Bureau of Investigation is carrying out against a coal mafia don close to him. He has lost balance. I don’t want to react to this.”Dilip Ghosh, on the other hand, said, “If he says I am a ruffian so be it. I am a ruffian. Stop me if you can. It is my time now. The TMC has tortured people and deprived them these years.”At the rally, Banerjee attacked the BJP on the issue of development as well.“We can show with statistics that the TMC government in Bengal has performed much better than the BJP government at the Centre in several fields. I dare the BJP to send any Central minister or any number of leaders to sit for a debate with me on a live television show. I will not show my face if I cannot back our claim with data. Why is your politics based on religion and not development?” said Banerjee. Talking at length on the development projects of the state government, Banerjee said, “TMC is a party of the people. Mamata Banerjee has made a lot of sacrifices and so have you (the workers). She is the sun. You (the opposition) will burn if you try to touch her,” said Banerjee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/abhishek-banerjee-takes-on-pm-modi-and-bjp-on-national-security-personal-remarks/story-jMMHsiDgIrjneMr1pPzWvO.html
29-11-2020||Bhopal||Farmers in Madhya Pradesh dump guavas in garbage vehicle as prices crash||A video showing a group of farmers dumping freshly-harvested guavas into a civic garbage collection vehicle here has gone viral on social media, with the experts saying that a bumper crop of the fruit this year has resulted in its prices falling.The wholesale prices of this vitamin C-rich fruit at Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar Fruit and Vegetable Market in Indore currently ranges between Rs 4 and Rs 10 per kilo, sources in the market said on Sunday.Farm sector experts said the prices of guava have nosedived due to its abundant crop, which is ultimately causing losses to the cultivators.Due to the falling prices, disappointed farmers are leaving behind the fruits in the market after finding that they are not getting enough returns.The farmers know that transporting the fruits back was not beneficial due to the costs involved, they added.Talking to PTI, Rajesh Patel, who grows this fruit in Madhya Pradesh’s Ratlam district, said, “The bumper guava harvest in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and other states has sent its prices crashing.” The wholesale market of guava in Delhi, which supplies this fruit to the northern part of the country, has been hit hard due to the coronavirus situation there, he said.Country guavas perish in three-four day after being plucked, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/farmers-in-madhya-pradesh-dump-guavas-in-garbage-vehicle-as-prices-crash/story-137s7jmlV3exelLfStR9PN.html

After his visit, PM Modi tweeted, “Had a good interaction with the team at Serum Institute of India. They shared details about their progress so far on how they plan to further ramp up vaccine manufacturing. Also, took a look at their manufacturing facility.” Modi landed at SII’s Hadapsar campus at 4:45 pm via a special helicopter from Pune’s Lohegaon airport where he arrived from Hyderabad. At SII, Modi inspected various facilities and interacted with Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer, SII, along with his father Cyrus and other officials. Modi spent an hour at SII interacting with the officials inside a conference room. His Pune visit was a part of a three-city tour to review the status of vaccine development in India. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister arrived at Ahmedabad’s Zydus Biotech Park after which he visited Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad before arriving at Serum. “PM Narendra Modi is extremely knowledgeable on vaccines and vaccine production. We were amazed at what he already knew. There was very little to explain to him, except for going into detail on different variable vaccines and the challenges that we may face ahead in terms of regulators,” said Poonawalla. Pune-based Serum institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine maker, has signed an agreement to manufacture the vaccine developed by the Jenner Institute of Oxford University in collaboration with British-Swedish pharma company AstraZeneca.Both University of Oxford and AstraZeneca on Monday said that their coronavirus vaccine was up to 90% effective in late-stage clinical trials, raising hopes for arrival of shots in India by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/at-serum-modi-discusses-vaccine-production-ramping-up-capacity/story-yQLPRvAWaF3R884ZN0PpoM.html
29-11-2020||Pune||Shortage of ventilators in hosps; new cases add pressure on infra||Amid the rise in Covid-19 positive cases, the number of available ICU ( intensive care unit) allocated beds equipped with ventilators for the virus patients have also reduced to 432 in the city as of November 27, with zero vacancies in major hospitals. Patients who test positive for the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection take a longer time to recover if they end up on ventilators, observed doctors. So, with more cases coming up there has been a rise in critical cases too which is adding burden on the existing infrastructure which has also opened up for non-Covid19 patients. According to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) dashboard, major hospitals do not show any vacant ventilators, including Bharati hospital, Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, Ruby Hall Clinic, Noble hospital and Sahyadri Hospital. (see graphic) Pune city has overall 184 vacant ventilators of the 432 allocated ventilators for Covid-19 patients in 83 hospitals. As of Friday (November 27), PMC reported a total of 413 critical patients in the city of which 249 were on ventilators while 164 were on ICU beds without ventilators. Also, more than 1,000 Covid-19 patients were under oxygen therapy for treatment. Dr Bharat Purandare, expert, infectious department, Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital, said, “All our ICU ventilators are full as of now. Post-Diwali we did see a surge in cases which means there is a proportionate rise in the number of critical patients too. In fact, we also have a few patients who were admitted earlier who are still critical and so we have to find additional support for newer critical patients.” “It is difficult for critical patients suffering from Covid-19 to recover from the same as it takes longer for them to recover. Such patients who undergo treatment in ICU are treated there for at least 15 days, that is my observation at our hospitals and so the number of critical patients will rise in proportion to newer cases and so ventilators remain occupied for a longer time,” he said. Dr Ashish Bharati, PMC health chief, said, “We can’t say now that whether we will face any shortage in future. However, as of now, we have enough ventilators available. Also, we have seen that private hospitals do not update the dashboard. Ideally, they should update it at least once every day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/shortage-of-ventilators-in-hosps-new-cases-add-pressure-on-infra/story-ye6LfG3ACRC779BMLz529H.html

Bhalke is surveyed by his wife, son and three daughters, who are married. Balke was cremated at his native village Sarkoli in Solapur district with full state honours on Saturday. Bhalke had been a MLA for three terms and was a close associate of Sharad Pawar. He had defeated prominent leaders like Vijaysinh Mohite Patil and Sudhakar Paricharak in the previous elections. In his condolence message, Pawar tweeted: “Bhalke’s untimely passing away is painful. Pandharpur taluka has lost an efficient and people friendly leader.” Bhalke had tested positive for Covid-19 following which he was admitted to the Ruby Hall Clinic in Pune on October 30. However, as his condition improved, the former wrestler was discharged from the hospital. On November 9, Bhalke complained of recurrent fever and cough, as a result of which he was re-admitted to the hospital in Pune. As his condition worsened, Bhalke was put on ventilator. Ruby Hospital’s Dr PK Grant said, “Bhalke was admitted for post Covid-19 treatment at the hospital and was very critical. He was suffering from kidney illness and oxygen saturation level was also low.”He was a diabetic and suffered from kidney illness, he added.As Bhalke’s health deteriorated, NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Friday afternoon visited the hospital to take review of his health. After Pawar’s visit, Dr Grant briefed the media and cleared that his health is very critical. In 2009, he had defeated Vijaysinh Mohite Patil and emerged as a giant killer. In 2019, Bhalke defeated Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sudhakar Parichark, who was earlier with the NCP.NCP leader and deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar expressed grief on Bhalke’s demise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ncp-mla-bharat-bhalke-dies-due-to-post-covid-complications-cremated-in-solapur-dist/story-UreoylJvN0ys813xdWv1rN.html
29-11-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Schools must remain closed until a vaccine is available, say Pune readers||At our schools, we put the safety of our students and faculty members at the top. Looking at the gravity of the circumstances, and the uncertainty surrounding it, we feel that schools must remain closed and education must continue through the online medium. Education is very essential. However, life is precious, and we cannot jeopardise the health and safety of our teachers and students. Unless we have a vaccine that has been proven effective and made available for the masses, the threat of the pandemic still looms large. In such a situation, the reopening of schools is an unnecessary risk. Our school has re-worked the time-table and assessments in a way that children are actively engaged in education and extra-curricular activities. This holds good for students in the secondary section too. We have ensured that they are given assignments, and tests on a regular basis to ensure their learning outcomes are met. Much as we believe that class nine and 10th are crucial, we also need to prioritize the health and safety of our students. We have done everything to ensure the quality of education has not been compromised while ensuring the safety of our students and teachers. Besides, we are constantly in touch with the parents too, and they are very supportive of the decision to continue with online classes. Aparna Khairnar Reopening junior colleges ill-advised right now This is the most impractical step. A decision like this could have far-reaching consequences. In junior colleges with 120 students per classroom, we have three students seated on a bench, even if we restrict it to one student per bench sanitising all surfaces likely to be touched by students seems to be a very farfetched idea. I’m unable to understand how our limited housekeeping staff would be able to achieve this and how I would feel assured it is carried out satisfactorily since even they are at the risk of being exposed to the virus. Students normally enter the college premises about 15 minutes before the class and so recording the temperature of about 400 odd students and maintaining social distancing would be tough. Also, about 80 to 90 per cent of junior college students use public transport since they are all below 18. How can we put them at risk? Almost all parents have voiced their objection to this step and are not willing to send their children to college right now. Dr Gulshan Gidwani Time to reopen schools with caution and safety guidelines Following the directives of the government, the administration ordered that schools be opened only for students of Classes 9, 10, 11 and 12 as these students have to take board exams this year or the next and be eligible and prepared for national and international level competitive exams and admissions, without wasting an academic year. A total of 2.32 lakh students are dependent on public schooling in rural areas of Pune but unfortunately, almost 90,000 among them do not have a screen to access learning in their homes. Furthermore, 35 villages in the upper reaches of the Sahayari Hills do not have good internet facility to stream e-learning content. We made public appeals for the donation of mobile phones, tablet computers and laptops but there was a limited response. A total of 1.7 lakh students accessed online learning platforms such as “Deeksha” from rural areas of Pune, but we found that students were more attuned to lectures in classrooms rather than self-learning using a digital screen, though they are progressively becoming more comfortable now. We have provided self-learning workbooks, phone-based support from teachers and community classes but it’s difficult to systematically monitor these programs. The curriculum in senior classes requires students to do lab work and project work that requires school laboratories and libraries. Most of the students in rural areas do not have an effective academic guide at home and so there was a pressing need to open schools. A third of the villages in rural areas of Pune have never had a single Covid-19 case while today over 90 per cent of the villages do not have an active case. The daily deaths have also fortunately reduced to a fifth of what it was two months ago. Children are allowed to travel in flights and visit homes of relatives so definitely young adults in ages between 14-18 years, in areas with very few Covid-19 cases could attend schools to lay the foundation for their future. The administration has empowered school management committees, consisting of parents and teachers to ensure proper planning and implementation of those plans especially for sanitisation of toilets and touchpoints like door handles and railings, the practice of social distancing while travelling to schools, in-corridors and in-classrooms. Also, the use of masks at all times. All teachers are mandatorily undergoing RT-PCR tests and the positivity is less than 0.2 per cent while students are being screened every day. 546 Doctors around the district have been tasked to provide immediate medical attention in case of any symptoms but fortunately, not one new case has been reported in schools. We are monitoring by the hour through a special unit within the district’s IDSP Cell. Typically, the attendance is low in the first week after vacations and this has been a very long vacation. As parents see visible security, we are hoping for and are preparing for full attendance in classrooms. We are working to build confidence through visible action in schools and counselling by teachers and other parents. We fear that some girls may be forced to drop out of schools and we have directed the 21,000 women volunteers who helped prevent and support victims of domestic violence during the pandemic to ensure that girls continue their education and prevent any child-marriages. Opening schools also give a psychological message to young adults to take responsibility, face risks with caution and do their duty. If as a society we do not give this message, we would not find soldiers to protect our borders or nurses to serve in Covid wards. Schools, especially in India, serve multiple purposes beyond education, and even beyond nutrition. Ayush Prasad Schools are integral for growth, must re-open them Whether a child should go to school or not is a rhetoric which is in the mind of every parent. As per the World Health Organisation (WHO), data collected suggests that children under the age of 18 years represent 8.5 per cent of reported cases worldwide with a milder form of the disease and fewer symptoms. Children with chronic respiratory illness (Asthma), diabetes, obesity are at a higher risk. The role of children transmission is unknown. However, fewer outbreaks have been reported within educational settings. Does this information help the plight of any parent? To decode this conundrum here are some facts that might help. The return to school depends upon the protective measures taken to minimise the risk of infection not only within the school but also outside.Steps taken by parents include monitoring their child’s health, good hygiene practices which include teaching the child how to cough, sneeze into a tissue or elbow, washing hands regularly with soap water for at least 20 seconds, and the frequent use of sanitiser. On school re-opening, regular health check-ups are necessary. The schools should maintain a physical distance of desks of at least three to six feet apart, with fewer students in a classroom. Having lunch at desks should be encouraged. Schools should make use of outdoor spaces whenever possible and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. Teachers should guide the proper use of face masks and hand hygiene. For children under the age of five, masks should be optional, six-11 years masks should be worn as per a risk-based approach, the adolescent should wear masks mandatorily. These simple steps can help our children make this pandemic the new normal. School is an integral part in shaping the cognition and developmental skills in a child’s life. Institutionalised learning shapes the ethical, behavioural attitude facilitating the transition to adulthood.

The government received many complaints in this regard especially that of 1,000 such bogus registrations at the sub registrar office, Hadapsar on a single day.The government in a recently issued government resolution (GR) ordered the inspector general of registration and stamps (IGR) to constitute a squad to investigate the complaint made before the state. The IGR will submit the report to the state government by December 1, 2020. The squad comprises of deputy inspector general of registration Govind Karad, acting DIG (headquarters) Bharat Garud, joint district registrar of stamps Vijay Bhalerao and joint district registrar Udayraj Chavan.According to the information available, a number of complaints were related to the registrar office (Haveli No 3) in Magarpatta-Hadapsar where scores of documents were registered in complete violation of the RERA act. The complaint points out that all the norms related to the registration were violated in areas like Hadpsar, Baner and PMRDA regions and even gunthewari lands located in grampanchayat areas were registered.Maharashtra inspector general of registration and stamps Omprakash Deshmukh said, “A special investigation squad has been formed to investigate the complaints made to the government and a report will be submitted to the state government by me before December 1st. We will find out how many such types of registrations have been done and a detailed inquiry will be done on each of the registered documents. We are going to investigate it as per the rule number of 44 and if the registration is prohibited by law, action will be initiated. I will give my opinion and recommendations on the inquiry report before it is submitted to the government. The inquiry will reveal the exact nature of the violation of the RERA norms.”Real Estate Regulation and Development (RERA) Act, 2016 is regarded as one of the landmark legislation passed by the Government of India. The aim of this act is a reformation of the real estate sector in India, encouraging transparency, accountability, and financial discipline.Penalties for non-complianceThe Real Estate (Regulatory and Development) Act, 2016 is the first in the real estate sector that provides for rules and regulations. This Act specifies the detailed rules and regulation for the proper process of registration and maintaining transparency, the Act also prescribes the penalty for different kinds of offences. Under penalties for non-compliance with the Act, RERA 2016 recommends imprisonment for a term which can be extended up to three years or a fine which may extend up to 10 per cent of the cost estimated of the real estate project, or both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/state-govt-cracks-down-on-properties-in-violation-of-rera-in-pune/story-RLI7Uc6EFcAJXQPKdq4idN.html
29-11-2020||Pune||MVA govt completes a year: Hits and misses of Pune development projects||When Uddhav Thackeray was sworn in as chief minister of Maharashtra on November 28 last year, six others also took an oath with him though none of them was from Pune. A month later, three others – Ajit Pawar, Dilip Walse Patil and Dattatray Bharane – were sworn in during the first cabinet expansion of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. With three ministers including Ajit Pawar, who is deputy CM, Pune could have been top on government’s priority list of development projects even as not a single major project was announced for Pune in past 12 months as Covid-19 hit its finances. A year later, most big projects like the proposed airport at Purandar, extended routes for metro rail, High Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR) and ring road have also not seen any development, while a project like Hyperloop has been scrapped. Purandar airportThe proposed international airport at Purandar on the eastern part of Pune district was one of the most ambitious projects of previous Devendra Fadnavis government, which had identified land and was to begin its acquisition when there was a change in government in the state. After Shiv Sena-NCP-congress government came to power, not much happened till October when all of sudden, Pawar ordered the administration to explore three new sites for the project in the same tehsil due to opposition from local MLA Sanjay Jagtap. A month and a half later, the administration has not yet completed finalising new site, putting a question mark on the feasibility of the project itself. Outer ring road projectThe outer ring road, planned by Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) hasn’t seen any progress as the project is facing fund crunch as a result of which land acquisition could not be expedited. Conceptualised around 12 years ago, the 128-km route, once complete, will allow heavy vehicles to cross the city without entering into it. HCMTR or inner ring road and metroAnother crucial project for city - HCMTR or inner ring road – has also been put on the back burner by this government. The project which was to be developed jointly by PMC and state government is nowhere near start with Ajit Pawar raising some questions over it. The work on existing Metro rail project has also slowed due to pandemic with completion plan delayed by two years while no fresh route has been approved. Work in progressOn the other hand, MVA expedited work on Bhama-Askhed pipeline work, which is crucial for bringing water to parts of eastern Pune. Similarly, the state government agency PMRDA has razed University circle flyover to facilitate work on the proposed Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar metro route. At the same time, there has been some progress on Pune-Nashik rail project as Maharashtra Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (MRIDC) had floated tenders inviting civil contractors for constructions of tunnels and other ancillary work related to the Nashik-Pune rail project and other projects that are taken up by it. “Our government had expedited work on Bhama Askhed project while enough fund has been provided to the metro rail project. The SPPU flyover demolition plan, which was pending, was quickly executed during the lockdown. Covid has indeed delayed many things including metro work, the airport project has also been unnecessarily delayed,” said NCP spokesperson Ankush Kakade. Pune was the worst affected district due to Covid as the number of total positive cases along with fatalities was very high, prompting shortage of beds in the city between July and September. Tussle between MVA and BJPCivic activist Qaneez Sukhrani said nothing has been achieved in the city to improve the lives of people. “Situation is unstable as both MVA at the state level and BJP controlled Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) are concentrating on politically outdoing one another. So nothing is achieved in the interest of the general public.”The city has total of eight MLAs of which six are from BJP while two are NCPs. The Congress and Shiv Sena have no representation in Pune. “This government has taken Pune ten years back with no new announcement of any project or lack of progress on already announced ones. On Covid management in Pune, which was worst affected, the government was lethargic – be it bringing jumbo facilities, increasing beds or preventing deaths,” said BJP legislator from Shivajinagar Siddharth Shirole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mva-govt-completes-a-year-hits-and-misses-of-pune-development-projects/story-Ko9roTkvhj4r1j7IYzYZoI.html
29-11-2020||Lucknow||Private hospitals in Prayagraj delay submission of names for Covid-19 vaccination drive||A majority of private hospitals in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj were dragging their feet over submission of details of doctors and other medical staff members for a possible deployment by the state administration to carry out Covid-19 vaccination drive, officials said.“We have 129 government hospitals, as well as community and primary health centres and posts, besides 1,235 private hospitals in the district. The details of doctors, nurses, paramedical and other staff were sought by us on October 23. Till date, mere 268 out of the 1,235 private hospitals have complied,” said district nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rishi Sahai.Repeated reminders are being sent to those who have not yet complied with the directive. Meanwhile, uploading these details on the government specified portal for the vaccination is going on, he added.Despite the delay on this front, preparations have begun in Prayagraj for the safe storage and transportation of Covid-19 vaccines to various centres while maintaining appropriate temperature.The task of preparing a database of people to be vaccinated has been entrusted to the officials of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). UNDP district vaccine cold-chain manager Vinod Shukla said the names and other details of staff members of almost all government sector hospitals and institutions, amounting to 10,700, had arrived and were being uploaded.Also Read: Olympic-bound athletes will be given priority when COVID-19 vaccine is available: Kiren RijijuHe conceded that it was the private hospitals that were dragging their feet, in turn, delaying the data feeding work. So far, 5,072 names and associated details were provided by 268 private sector hospitals till November 27, he added.Shukla said the main storage facility for vaccines was being constructed at Tej Bahadur Sapru (Beli) Hospital in the district. Around 50 ice-lined refrigerators, (ILR) capable of highly safe vaccine storage, with proper power backup, would be installed at this site.“We hope to have the facility ready by December,” he added.Also Read: Cold chain in 53 districts gives UP advantage in Covid-19 vaccination: MinisterThe ice lined refrigerator units were equipped with effective polyurethane foam (PUF) insulation that ensures long hold-over time in case of a power failure, the officer added.“Likewise, for transport of the vaccines, we have a dedicated van that would have cold boxes with conditioning ice-packs to carry the vaccines, ensuring the right temperature,” said Shukla.District immunisation officer Dr Amit Srivastava said Rs 11.20 lakh had been sanctioned by the state government for getting the Covid-19 vaccine storage site ready. He said medical and health staff will be trained for administering the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/private-hospitals-in-prayagraj-delay-submission-of-names-for-covid-19-vaccination-drive/story-BPSHPDk4Va0ADTJrhH26dK.html

The mechanic was burnt alive... Prima facie it appears that he died due to short-circuit. The farmers sleeping near the site tried to douse the flames but couldn’t save the mechanic. We have sent his body for post-mortem at a hospital in Bahadurgarh. The matter is being investigated,” Duggal added.Tractor mechanics from various districts of Punjab have reached Delhi to repair farmers’ vehicles free of cost as part of their support to kisan unions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mechanic-on-way-to-delhi-to-help-farmers-dies-in-car-fire/story-Vf1v7eKSjEf30V3H3M986K.html
29-11-2020||Lucknow||Cold chain in 53 districts gives UP advantage in Covid-19 vaccination: Minister||Uttar Pradesh government is regularly reviewing the preparation of a robust cold chain infrastructure for storage of Covid-19 vaccine in the state’s 75 districts along with allocation of human resource and other logistical support required for vaccinating the state’s 23 crore plus population.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, on November 23, had directed officials to ensure that the state was not only ready with the cold chain infrastructure but also vaccinators in all districts by December 15. Health and family welfare minister Jai Pratap Singh is tasked with implementation of the task and is carrying out review in districts.Singh said Uttar Pradesh had the advantage of existing good cold chain network in a majority of districts. He pointed out that the health and family welfare department had been organising various vaccination programmes, including those for polio, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and routine immunisation round the year.Racing against time to meet the deadline, feedback on the state of the cold chain network, warehouses and transportation facilities, has been taken from district health departments. Singh added that funds had been allocated to all the districts to upgrade the existing system and ensure procurement of equipment and machines.The cold chain stores were fully functional for the storage of Covid-19 vaccine in 53 districts and construction or expansion work has been ordered in the remaining 22 districts including Agra, Ambedkar Nagar, Azamgarh, Balrampur, Banda, Etah, Firozabad, Gonda, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Kanpur, Lalitpur, Mainpuri, Mathura, Muzaffarnagar, Prayagraj, Rae Bareli, Saharanpur, Sant Kabir Nagar, Varanasi, Mirzapur and Bareilly. All the works would be completed before December 15, Singh said.To strengthen the cold chain system, the state government has demanded 1,244 deep freezers and 115,635 vaccine carriers from the central government, which was being dispatched to the districts accordingly, the minister said.Singh said training of 70,631 vaccinators, including laboratory technicians, pharmacists and ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwives) working in the state health department had started. If required, the health department would hire vaccinators on contract for the Covid vaccination programme, he said.Also Read: UP races against time to build 2,03,938L cold chain storage for Covid-19 vaccineAddressing chief ministers on November 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had stated that the central government was keeping track of vaccine development both inside and outside the country. The PM also said that the Centre will prepare a distribution strategy in coordination with the state governments.In the first phase, frontline health workers, including doctors and paramedical staff will be vaccinated. The state government has directed all the district magistrates and chief medical officers (CMOs) to enlist public and private health workers on priority basis for the vaccination drive. In the second phase, vulnerable people, including senior citizens, are likely to be immunized. The final road map of the vaccination programme will be prepared before the launch of the Covid vaccination drive, Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/cold-chain-in-53-districts-gives-up-advantage-in-covid-19-vaccination-minister/story-7siZcPfSRZrCvGcoU88DSO.html
29-11-2020||Lucknow||UP races against time to build 2,03,938L cold chain storage for Covid-19 vaccine||The Uttar Pradesh government is aiming to create a cold chain storage capacity of 2,03,938 litres where temperature is maintained between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius for the first phase of the Covid-19 vaccination. This 2.03 lakh litre capacity includes 87,801 litres of space ordinarily used for routine immunisation purposes.The first phase of Covid-19 vaccination is expected to immunise over four crore people in the state with the focus on frontline corona warriors, including health workers. Uttar Pradesh has a population of about 23 crore.So far, 80,733 litre of space has been created, according to official data. Now, work is going on in 75 districts for creating an additional cold chain storage of 1,23,205 litres.1,16,137 litre of storage space has to be created for the first phase of Covid-19 vaccine delivery in December alone.Construction work is going on in 22 districts for making exclusive vaccine depots, while repair work is under way in 27 other districts.The target Covid population in each district is calculated in proportion to the state Covid population, which is seven times the number of beneficiaries for routine immunization. This is roughly equal to 20% of the districts’ population, according to state government officials.There are 97,000 doctors registered in Uttar Pradesh and over 65,000 of them are active in practice, according to the state medical faculty data. Apart from the doctors, there are nurses, pharmacists, ward boys, lab technicians, cleaning staff and clerks working in hospitals. They are expected to be among the first to be vaccinated for Covid-19.“We have not been told how many vaccine vials will be coming, but the infrastructure will be ready in time,” said Dr AP Chaturvedi, state immunisation officer. “Vaccines will come in batches and we will ensure they are dispatched from the depots,” he added.“As soon as the vials arrive, they will be sent out from the depots for vaccination, making space for more batches to be stocked,” said another official.Also Read: India’s Covid-19 count now closer to 9.4 million, 22 states and UTs have fatality rate lower than national averageWalk-in-freezers, walk-in-coolers, cold chain boxes and deep freezers are to be provided by the union government.Who will be next after healthcare workers?After the healthcare workers, people above 60 years of age could be vaccinated.“The risk of complications from Covid-19 is up to 50% higher in the elderly and those with a comorbidity. As the majority of the elderly suffer from some type of comorbidity such as diabetes or high blood pressure, vaccinating them will be a wise decision,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general, association of international doctors and an expert in geriatric medicine.The elderly population in the state is over 6 crore including over 5 lakh elders in capital Lucknow. The vaccine storage equipment will have an electronic vaccine intelligence networking (EVIN) device that records temperatures in which vaccines are stored and if the range is broken, a message is sent via SMS to the authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-races-against-time-to-build-2-03-938l-cold-chain-storage-for-covid-19-vaccine/story-Frp6utbKkA94SmhHAqeceM.html
29-11-2020||Delhi||Farmers continue to camp at Delhi’s borders||Farmers’ groups continued to camp at the Delhi border for the third consecutive day on Sunday despite the Delhi Police having allowed them to enter the city and gather at the Sant Nirankari Ground in Burari. While the arterial roads at both Singhu and Tikri borders continued to remain closed, police said the farmer groups are peaceful and that no clashes were reported after Friday, when the groups first arrived at the borders and faced off with officials after being stopped from entering the Capital.Deputy commissioner of police (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma said the situation is normal at Singhu Border that connects Delhi with Haryana. “Our deployment is intact and the protesters are also peaceful,” he said.A police officer said the groups have even stopped sloganeering, unlike Friday and Saturday. “Some of them, especially the elderly men, even returned by Saturday night. But the rest, thousands of them, who have refused to take Burari ground as the protest site, remain at camps here,” the officer said.On Friday and Saturday, a small group of farmers that arrived at the Burari ground comprised either those who had gathered at the Tikri Border or the ones who had entered Delhi but were detained. They have camped at the ground since then as the police and paramilitary continue to keep the area fortified. Police also said that the farmer groups are still indecisive about whether they should accept the Burari ground as the protest site; their initial demand was Ramlila Maidan which is closer to the Lutyens Delhi. The farmers wished to march up to Jantar Mantar and Parliament house when they arrived on Friday. A little over 100 of them who had managed to sneak in were detained from Jantar Mantar and other areas of the city on the same day.It was then the police offered them the Burari ground as a protest site. The offer was made after a series of clashes at both the borders on Friday. On Friday, the police had also closed two other border roads -- the Dhansa border and the Jharoda Kalan border -- for traffic as a precautionary measure even through there were no protesters there.Farmers are protesting against the government’s moves to open up agricultural markets in the country and bring sweeping reforms to the farm sector, which supports nearly half the population. Farmers have demanded a repeal of three laws enacted by Parliament in September which, together, allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers cultivators assured prices from the government, largely for wheat and rice. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal held day-long negotiations on November 13 with leaders of several farmers’ groups in attempt to end over two months of a politically challenging agitation. The discussions were inconclusive, but both sides had agreed to continue negotiations in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-continue-to-camp-at-delhi-s-borders/story-fgJGPO5gpx1MLQvLEQo5OL.html
29-11-2020||Dehradun||Mahakumb approaching, Uttarakhand has 3-pronged strategy to contain Covid-19||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat directed the authorities to take strict action against those refusing to undergo a test despite showing symptoms of Covid-19 in the state. The directions came during a review of Covid-19 situation with all the 13 district magistrates (DM) and health officials on Saturday amid a surge in the number of Covid cases in the last few days.“We need to increase the testing rate in the state to curb the spread. In that process, if any symptomatic person refuses to undergo test, then strict action should be taken against him/her,” said Rawat.Directing the authorities to put in more efforts to bring down the death rate, he said, “There should be a proper analysis of every Covid-19 death (to see) if the patient was also suffering from another disease or (if) there was a delay in shifting (patient) to a hospital. There should be no delay in referring an infected person to a higher centre,” the CM said.He also asked the health officials and DMs to emphasize on conducting RT-PCR tests for Covid-19 detection.“If any person showing symptoms of the virus tested negative in Rapid Antigen test then he should compulsorily undergo RT-PCR test. Also, the test results should be given in 24 hours in urban areas and within 48 hours in rural areas,” said Rawat.The CM especially asked the DMs of Pithoragarh, Dehradun and Rudraprayag districts to focus more on bringing down the infection in their respective districts.He also asked the police to first fine those not wearing masks and then provide them with a mask. “Strict action will be taken if any police officer challans any person for not wearing a mask and doesn’t provide him one.”Rawat also asked for spreading awareness for compliance to required precautions. “It is important because the next few months are going to be challenging considering the winters, Mahakumbh and tourism activities,” he said.Also Read: Uttarakhand’s Vocal for Local push shows promise as growth centres make profitHealth secretary Amit Negi said that 80% of the total Covid-19 tests in the state are RT-PCR.“Also, 99.89% of the high risk contacts of Covid-19 people have been tested in the state. We are also taking test samples of people at popular tourist spots to curb the spread there,” said Negi.He also directed the DMs to ensure that the “non-Covid health centres are also operational.”The chief secretary, Om Prakash, directed all the DMs to ensure enough manpower for the vaccination process and hold regular meetings of the district and block level task forces created for the purpose.“Data of all the co-morbid patients, aged people, pregnant women and frontline covid-19 warriors should be maintained for the possible vaccination process,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/mahakumb-approaching-uttarakhand-has-3-pronged-strategy-to-contain-covid-19/story-X6iXJWkTFd0GqeAvbwAC9K.html
29-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi set to record coldest November in at least a decade: IMD||The national capital is all set to record coldest November in at least 10 years, with the mean minimum temperature for the month this year hovering around 10 degrees Celsius, according to India Meteorological Department data. In Delhi, the average minimum temperature for the month of November is 12.9 degrees Celsius. From November 1 to November 29, the city has recorded a mean minimum temperature of 10.3 degrees Celsius, which is the lowest in at least a decade, according to IMD data. The mean minimum temperature was 15 degrees Celsius last year, 13.4 degrees Celsius in 2018 and 12.8 degrees Celsius in 2017 and 2016. On Sunday, Delhi recorded a minimum of 7 degrees Celsius. This is the seventh day this month that the minimum temperature remained below 10 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature is likely to settle around 7 degrees Celsius on Monday as well, according to IMD. On November 23, Delhi recorded a minimum of 6.3 degrees Celsius -- its lowest minimum temperature in the month since November 2003, when the city recorded a minimum of 6.1 degrees Celsius, according to Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre. The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degrees Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital. The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-set-to-record-coldest-november-in-at-least-a-decade-imd-data/story-zq33C93J0Cd9ia2aCb2vDO.html
29-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air continues to remain in poor category||Delhi’ s air quality deteriorated marginally on Sunday morning, though it remained in the poor category. The air quality index (AQI) was 248 at 8 am. On Saturday, the average AQI was 231. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) have forecast air quality to remain in the “poor” zone till November 30, after which it is expected to deteriorate. “The air quality has been in check over the past few days because of good winds. However the wind speed is likely to deteriorate gradually from Sunday,” said a senior IMD scientist. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Besides, the scientist added that the temperature in Delhi and the National Capital Region is also likely to drop in the coming days because of the continuing snowfall in the regions of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh and parts of Uttrakhand. On Saturday, the minimum temperature was 10.1 degrees C while the maximum settled at 26.4 degrees Celsius, a notch above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-continues-to-remain-in-poor-category/story-vAPfloUPD3Pr6avsEmfBfJ.html
29-11-2020||Lucknow||Governor okays UP’s ‘love jihad’ law||Uttar Pradesh governor Anandiben Patel approved an ordinance promulgated by the state against forced and dishonest conversions, though there are fears that the law may also be used to target inter-faith marriages where one of the partners voluntarily converts. The Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 came into effect on Sunday itself. It has provisions to check religious conversions carried out by “allurement, coercion, force, fraud, or marriage.” The state cabinet cleared the law earlier this week, targeting what many right-wing outfits term “love jihad”, where Muslim men marry Hindu women with the aim of changing the latter’s religion after marriage. According to the ordinance, marriages where the intention is to change the woman’s religion will be declared invalid. “Yes, the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance- 2020 has been promulgated,” confirmed additional chief secretary, Home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi.Under the provisions of the new law, the violations have been made a cognizable and non-bailable offence. The new law authorises the aggrieved persons’ parents, siblings or close relatives to file a first information report (FIR) for violation of the provisions of the ordinance.The ordinance provides for jail term of up to 10 years in some cases for violators and treats forced and forced conversions as a non-bailable offence. A government spokesperson said those violating the provisions may be punished with imprisonment of one to five years with a fine of not less than Rs 15,000. In case of girls, who are minors or belong to the scheduled castes or the scheduled tribes, the imprisonment will be for two to 10 years with a minimum fine of Rs 25,000. In case of mass conversion, the law has the provision for imprisonment of three to 10 years and a minimum fine of Rs 50,000. It provides for courts to award appropriate compensation with a maximum of Rs 5 lakh payable by the accused to the victim. Any person who counsels or convinces the other person to commit the offence will also invite punishment. And the burden of proof will lie with the accused.UP’s move is likely to encourage other states that have spoken of a similar law -- Haryana and Madhya Pradesh are at the head of the queue -- to push through their own ordinances. Starting now, in UP, anyone wishing to convert to another religion will have to give a declaration at least 60 days in advance to the respective district magistrate/ additional district magistrate and a violation will invite punishment of six months to three years with a fine of Rs 10,000. Any religious converter, who performs conversion ceremony, will have to give a month’s notice and violation will invite a punishment of one year to five years with a fine of Rs 25,000.Under the provisions of the ordinance, an inquiry will thereafter be conducted about the intention/ purpose of conversion and the violation of this provision will have the effect of rendering such conversion null and void. The converted person will have to make another declaration on the prescribed format within six months after conversion. The new law also provides for cancellation of registration of the institution/organisation violating the provisions and the person in charge will invite punishment as per the provisions of the new law. No government grant will be given to such institutions or organisations violating the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/governor-okays-up-s-love-jihad-law/story-09NdPOiw8vItiLxH0dvovO.html

SP (traffic) Gurjot Singh Kaler met the two young siblings, Tanya and Badal, and gifted them warm clothes and blankets. The children lost their mother when a speeding vehicle hit her from behind and she succumbed to the injuries. “We can’t lessen their pain and sorrow but we can certainly help them,” said Kaler, urging people to drive safe. Congress protest or was it a photo op? Protesting against the BJP’s performance, rather non-performance, in Chandigarh, Congress councillors rushed to the well of the House with placards during the meeting on November 27. A few minutes on, a BJP councillor asked his Congress counterparts to return to their seats, saying: “You’ve got your pictures clicked so stop this drama now.” The members were in splits when a Congress councillor replied, “Achha yahan media bhi hai? Humein toh pata hi nahi tha, hum toh ye sab janta ke liye kar rahe hain (Oh, is the media here? We were doing all this for the people).” Incidentally, a Congress councillor had tipped the journalists off earlier, requesting them not to leave as they had planned a protest in the well of the House. After high drama, journalists back in the media gallerySince the end the Covid-19 lockdown, covering the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation meetings from the confines of the committee room on the sixth floor of the MC building in Sector 17 has been a virtual struggle for journalists. On November 27 too, the mediapersons gathered in the committee room to watch the live video feed of the House meet. As usual, they struggled to make sense of the proceedings because of the poor quality of the video feed. Repeated requests to officials for better arrangements went unheeded till they missed the feed for nearly an hour. The 10-odd journalists had had enough when an official locked one of the committee room’s exits so they met mayor Rajbala Malik in her office during the break. Malik directed MC officials to make arrangements for the journalists in the media gallery of the House. Within 10 minutes, the arrangements were made. When councillors lost, and found, their voice Both Congress and BJP councillors created a ruckus during the House meeting when one of the BJP members was a given a cordless microphone to make a statement. Congress councillors alleged that while their voices were not audible to journalists in the committee room, BJP members were being given special microphones. The BJP member, who got the cordless mic, said journalists could hear him through the instrument installed at his seat, too. This led to a verbal duel between members of both parties till MC commissioner KK Yadav intervened. He directed the MC chief engineer to go to the committee room and check whether the voices of all councillors could be heard over the video feed. The House proceedings resumed once the chief engineer confirmed that everyone was clearly audible. Duplicate bricks hurting business If you thought duplicates were limited to electronic gadgets and clothing brands, you’d be surprised to learn that even bricks used for construction aren’t spared. A representative of a brick manufacturing company, KKK, held a press conference on November 23 to complain that dubious kilns had copied the brand name and were selling substandard bricks, hurting the sale of the original. The company holds the contract of supplying bricks to a number of construction projects underway in and around the tricity. With duplicate bricks flooding the market, the original are piling up at the kiln. The company’s owners have warned dubious kilns of legal action and reporting them to the administration. Social media to rescue of traffic cones at Sukhna The cones installed by the Chandigarh Traffic Police earlier this month to demarcate the cycle track in front of Sukhna Lake were found displaced on Friday by a resident, who took to Twitter to complain. The problem was promptly resolved by the traffic police, who now plan to install such cones on other busy roads of the city for the safety of cyclists. Professor mimics PU V-C during teachers’ protest From reciting poems to singing songs, members of the Panjab University Teachers’ Association (PUTA) have been coming up with innovative ways to register their protest against the pending promotion of teachers under the career advancement scheme (CAS).

29-11-2020||City||Sealed buildings, containment zones in slums in Mumbai drop since Sept||Since September, when Mumbai recorded a peak in Covid-19 cases, the number of sealed buildings has reduced by 55% as fewer active cases have been reported. There were 10,871 sealed buildings on September 25 and the number has come down to 4,790 in November. The number of containment zones in slums has also reduced from 686 on September 25 to 407 in November. The overall positivity rate of the city is at 15%. In September, Mumbai saw a spike in Covid-19 cases, with the daily caseload going over 2,000 and the total number of active cases crossing 34,000. Since the last week of October, daily caseload has come down sharply and the total number of active cases is around 14,000 at present. Civic officials said fewer positive cases are being reported from high-rises. “It is likely that there are fewer cases in buildings, but we are regularly setting up testing camps in areas where the caseload is higher,” says Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health).Assessing the cases in the past few weeks, Kakani added that even though the number of tests conducted daily had been scaled up to above 20,000, daily positive cases remained at around 1,000. In November, the positivity rate is 6% while the city’s overall positivity rate is 15%.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) focus is now on those returning to the city, particularly migrant workers who had left for their hometowns and villages in other states after the lockdown began in March. As part of the survey under the state government’s ‘My Family, My Responsibility’ campaign, the municipal corporation had compiled a list of 12,000 homes in slum pockets that were reported as locked. These homes will now be revisited by civic officials and if anyone is found living in those homes, they will be made to undergo a health check-up and also a Covid-19 test, if necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sealed-buildings-containment-zones-in-slums-in-mumbai-drop-since-sept/story-ZLYAUpQe5W1XMwjGveK6bK.html

Citing environmentalist Zoru Bhathena’s complaint, in which he has claimed violation of coastal regulation zone (CRZ) laws for the constructions of the access road, the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) on Friday issued directions to the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation Ltd (MSRDC) and the suburban district collector to verify, take appropriate action and send a factual, detailed action taken report at the earliest on the allegations. “Treat this as an important complaint,” read the letter. “We have asked them to check for any violations of CRZ norms 1991 and 2011, and the Bombay high court orders from 2005, 2010 and 2018 (for protection of mangroves and intertidal areas) as the site is CRZ-1 where no construction activity is allowed,” said a senior MCZMA official. According to Bhathena’s complaint, the permanent access road across Juhu koliwada was being constructed to give access to the construction zones falling within the intertidal areas. “However, this road is being built by excavating the beach sand and filling up this excavated area with stones and also through the intertidal zone (area between high tide and low tide) or CRZ-1 areas. This is a prohibited activity,” the complaint read, adding that the CRZ clearance issued by the Union environment ministry on January 9, 2013, expressly clarified, “There shall be no dredging and reclamation for the project.” The complaint filed before the environment department, MCZMA and various state bodies called for an immediate action to stop the work, failing which the environmentalist said the matter would be taken to court. “There is absolutely no need to reclaim the beach to build a bridge on stilts. I am glad that MCZMA has taken cognisance of my complaint, and hope MSRDC will stop this illegal construction and restore Juhu Beach and its intertidal areas to its natural condition,” said Bhathena. MSRDC officials refused to comment. “We will comply with directives, if any, but no such instructions have been received by us yet,” said an MSRDC official. About the projectIn May 2019, the Supreme Court (SC) had dismissed MSRDC’s petition to set up a casting yard for the VBSL project at Juhu beach on the grounds that it would have a negative impact on the beach. MCZMA in February 2019 had approved the construction of the casting yard, but Bhathena had challenged the decision before the HC, which revoked MCZMA’s permission citing violations of CRZ laws. MSRDC had then moved the SC. The VBSL project is a 9.6km-long bridge (four-plus-four land) proposed to be constructed off 900 metres away from the coast. The sea link will have three connectors – one at Otter’s Club, Bandra; second at Juhu Koliwada and the third at Nana Nani Park at Versova —which would take the total length of the sea link to 17.17km. According to MSRDC, the total project cost is Rs11,332.82 crore, while the cost of construction is Rs6,993.99 crore. It aims to be a part of the coastal road project that will link Nariman Point and the northern suburbs. The proposed sea link will begin from the Bandra-end of the 5.6km Bandra-Worli Sea Link.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/verify-allegations-of-crz-violations-at-juhu-for-versova-bandra-sea-link-submit-report-maharashtra-coastal-authority-to-msrdc-mumbai-suburban-collector/story-BlFnHGBBs3RwPtyQiCwFDK.html

29-11-2020||Delhi||Marginal drop in capital’s air quality, fall in mercury likely next week: IMD||Delhi’s air quality deteriorated marginally on Saturday and settled in the poor category from moderate on Friday. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed Delhi’s overall AQI on Saturday at 231. On Friday, the air quality had improved to reach 137. IMD scientists said that the wind speed had slowed down slightly on Saturday compared to Friday, but it was still enough to have facilitated pollution dispersion. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said, “The average wind speed recorded on Thursday night was also around 8kmph, which is rare because winds tend to slow down at night. During the day too, the winds have been favourable for the dispersion of pollutants. Today (Saturday), the wind speed was high but not as high as it was on Friday, so the AQI increased.”Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), data shows that on Friday 499 fires were spotted over Punjab and Haryana, contributing to 4% of the Capital’s PM2.5 levels.Soni also said air quality is expected to remain between moderate and poor range till November 30, after which there is a forecast for deterioration. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, also said that gradually wind speed will deteriorate from Sunday. He added that the temperature in Delhi and NCR is also expected to fall in the coming days because of the continuing snowfall in the regions of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh and parts of Uttarakhand.On Friday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official recording for the city, was 10.1 degree Celsius. The maximum temperature was 26.4 degree Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/marginal-drop-in-capital-s-air-quality-fall-in-mercury-likely-next-week-imd/story-6AXSLgf9XrKBVp9tgLmtQI.html
29-11-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nivar helps improve Mumbai’s air||After witnessing poor air quality for three days, the city on Saturday saw an improvement in air quality with an increase in wind speed and rise in minimum temperature owing to partly cloudy conditions. The air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 123 (moderate) on Saturday from Friday’s 218 (poor). On Wednesday, AQI was 201 (poor) while on Thursday, the city recorded the worst air quality in eight months with an AQI of 252 (poor). The System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the air quality improvement was an after effect of the remnants of Cyclone Nivar, which made landfall over the east coast as a very severe cyclonic storm north of Puducherry late on Wednesday. The cyclone subsequently weakened and dissipated as it moved over peninsular India.Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR, and scientist of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, said, “Under the influence of the remnants of Cyclone Nivar, winds over coastal and interior Maharashtra suddenly became fast between late Friday night and early Saturday morning, which helped disperse pollutants that accumulated closer to the surface. A marginal rise in morning temperatures also helped reduce the carrying capacity of pollutants in air.” Beig added that depending on the intensity of winds, AQI was expected to fluctuate within the moderate category in the next three days. It is expected to be 120 (moderate) on Sunday. On Saturday, Mazagaon (242) and Chembur (208) were the most polluted locations in the city, recording poor air quality, while Navi Mumbai (71) and Worli (88) had the cleanest air with the AQI in the satisfactory category.Meanwhile, the minimum temperature in south Mumbai increased to 24 degrees Celsius, 2 degree Celsius above normal, while the suburbs recorded 23.2 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature in south Mumbai fell below the normal mark on Friday and was at 31.7 degrees Celsius. The day temperature in the suburbs dropped from 34.4 degrees Celsius to 33.3 degrees Celsius, which was close to the normal mark. “Mostly due to the post-cyclone effect, almost the entire state was under cloud cover on Saturday, as the remnants of the system pushed a lot of moisture, contributing to high clouds, which can lower the visibility, lead to some drizzle and lower the temperatures, too,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, IMD.He said light drizzling was reported from Solapur, and other areas in interior Maharashtra could also witness light showers.IMD has predicted a partly cloudy sky for Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nivar-helps-improve-mumbai-air/story-f6Uv006mT6raDGuO1InnAL.html

According to a survey of 720 respondents across India, 54% love working from home and 56% believe their productivity has increased by working from home.Around 34% respondents, who said they like working from home, are also willing to take a 10% pay cut if companies allow them to work from home permanently, revealed Mavericks India’s report — Covid-19 and Beyond: An Evolving Perspective. However, most of the respondents who agree for a pay cut are also senior executives.The report, which was released earlier this week, also states that 81% of the people who used to spend more than 90 minutes of one-way commute to the office would love to work from home permanently. According to a report by MoveInSync, on an average, Indians spend two hours a day commuting, which is the highest in the world. Among the respondent from different cities, 52% from Mumbai said they like working from home, compared to 78% in Pune, 66% in Bengaluru and 51% in Delhi. The report also stated that women prefer the work-from-home setup more than men.Chetan Mahajan, CEO of Mavericks, said, “By working from home, people can save costs associated with commute, grooming and maintaining a formal wardrobe, apart from saving time. Of course, there are teething problems of maintaining a work-life balance, but it will evolve and people will learn to adapt to the new phenomena.” 56% of the respondents said they were struggling to find a work-life balance as the lines have blurred in the past few months.Mavericks conducted the survey in September-October to understand the behavioural changes among people caused by the pandemic. The report also states that 51% respondents have started focusing on maintaining better hygiene since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-effect-most-prefer-working-from-home-say-productivity-up-reveals-all-india-survey/story-fsbIjhXT9HtBncmlNEdHUK.html
29-11-2020||Chandigarh||Coaching centres in Chandigarh unlikely to reopen from December 1||Even as the UT administration has permitted coaching institutes to resume regular operations from December 1, subject to observance of strict protocols both in classes and hostels, many coaching institutes are unlikely to reopen.Business head of Sri Chaitanya Institute in Sector 34, Hitesh Panwar, said, “Right now, we haven’t decided whether we will reopen from December 1 or not. We will convene a meeting on Saturday and also speak to the parents of students who take online classes from us to get an idea of how many students will actually come if we resume regular classes.”He added that online classes were going on smoothly, and even the UT administration has directed coaching institutes to concentrate on online teaching rather than regular classes.Some coaching institutes are still unclear about what the protocols would be in the classes before they decide to open. Senior manager of Allen institutes in tricity, Jitain Gupta, said, “We will receive directions from our head office in Kota, Rajasthan, about reopening. Till now, there are no clear instructions from the administration’s side on key aspects such as the number of students allowed per classroom. We hope that the administration can hold a meeting with coaching institutes of the city and discuss these issues with us.”He said they were facing no issues with online classes and would continue with them as of now. Other institutes such as Abhimanu IAS Study Group in Sector 25 are also holding meetings to discuss the reopening strategies. Students, meanwhile, are also indecisive about whether they will attend classes in these institutes once they reopen. Special sessions a better optionKunal Singh, who runs a coaching centre in Sector 34, said, “If we are asked to teach classes in small batches with social distancing, it will not be feasible for the faculty to take so many classes. Some institutes in the city have batches of 300-400 students. How many classes will they take then? Rather, the coaching institutes can start doubt-clearing sessions for students. This way, appointments can be given to students and they will be easier to manage.”He added that many coaching institutes are unlikely to reopen because even if permission has been granted, it can be taken away too if the number of cases rise. “In case the classes are not allowed after a week, the students will want a refund and the faculty will want salaries, so it will be a riskier proposition. Online coaching is likely to continue.”Meanwhile, officials from the administration said that detailed instructions for coaching institutes were being prepared and likely to be released before December 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/coaching-centres-in-chandigarh-unlikely-to-reopen-from-december-1/story-zDbwfyZVAmz6H1KUPLgYJJ.html

29-11-2020||Chandigarh||HC hauls up judicial officer for contempt proceedings against former Chandigarh SSP||Penal provisions of contempt have to be invoked with due circumspection, judicial restraint and sparingly, the Punjab and Haryana high court has said while giving relief to former Chandigarh senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Vijay Jagadale.Jagadale had challenged civil contempt proceedings order passed by a judicial magistrate first class, Chandigarh, on March 18 this year, for “violating court orders” passed on five occasions in 2017 and 2018. The police officer, who took over as the first woman SSP of the city in 2017, joined back services in Punjab after her tenure got over in August this year.“Their (contempt provisions) undue and indiscriminate use, particularly against public officers in connection with their official work, tends to unnecessarily embarrass, humiliate and demoralise them, thereby adversely affecting the discharge of their public functions without enhancing the dignity, respect and image of the courts,” the bench of justice Arun Monga said, while allowing Jagadale’s plea.  The caseThe case in which contempt proceedings were initiated is of cheating, filed by one Daya Nand Saini in 2008. It was being investigated by the economic offences wing (EOW) of Chandigarh Police. In March 2009, an incomplete challan was filed, but police assured court of submitting a supplementary challan, but failed to do so. In 2017, Saini filed an application for further probe, and the trial court ordered police to act on it. In June, July and August of 2017 and in January and April of 2018, besides the officers concerned, the SSP too was asked by the judicial officer to personally look into the matter. However, the SSP failed to respond, and in October 2018, Saini moved contempt plea against her and three other cops. A reply was filed, but the trial court was dissatisfied and initiated contempt proceedings in March 2020, said lawyer Gautam Dutt.What HC saidThe high court bench found that in November 2018, Saini had moved a plea before it, seeking a CBI probe. While disposing of the plea in September 2019, court was satisfied over the reasons given for delay in probe. It had come to light that the probe was stuck as record to be submitted for forensic examination was lying with the Chandigarh court. So, HC ordered that it be sent to forensic examination through a special messenger. Despite this, the judicial officer still proceeded with initiating contempt proceedings in March 2020 even as the SSP was not responsible for the delay. There was also no specific direction to the SSP to probe the FIR, the HC noted, adding that even if the delay was due to the police department, it would not be more than superintendence lapse on her part. The court also noted that when contempt application was moved in October 2018, court could not have taken its cognisance in 2020, as beyond one year, it is not permissible in law.“To say the least, judicial discipline and propriety required the magistrate to give due weightage and respect to the view taken by this court. Instead, the magistrate ignored the view of this court, by observing, contrary to the record, that there was no evidence on the file to show that any difficulty was expressed by the petitioner to comply with his (magistrate’s) orders,” the high court said. “His observations that rather it was for the first time that such a stand had been mentioned in the reply to the contempt petition; or the response was by an officer who was not facing contempt; or an incompetent officer had filed reply et alia (other contributors), fly in the face of the record,” the court further said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-hauls-up-judicial-officer-for-contempt-proceedings-against-former-chandigarh-ssp/story-uaZ16JLf3vGRDXpL4mUWyK.html
29-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 test positivity rate drops below 8% in Delhi||Delhi on Saturday added fewer than 5,000 new cases of Covid-19 for the first weekday in over a month, despite a record number of gold-standard RT-PCR tests conducted in a single day, with the Capital’s test positivity rate falling below 8% for the first time since the third week of October. The Capital logged 4,998 new infections as per Saturday’s daily health bulletin, which records data primarily from a day earlier, on the back of a record 69,051 new tests, up significantly from 64,455 the previous day. Most of these additional tests were conducted using the more accurate reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method as per Saturday’s bulletin, which shot up from 28,100 the previous day to 33,147 — 48% of all tests conducted in Delhi on the day. The Delhi government aims to ramp up Covid-19 testing to between 100,000 and 120,000 a day, with an eye on performing half of these using the RT-PCR and other molecular methods such as TrueNAT and CBNAAT. As the numbers were released on Saturday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “Since 7 Nov, cases and positivity in Delhi are going down. Today, less than 5000 cases, 89 deaths and 7.24 positivity. Hope this trend continues. Delhiites and Delhi govt together will win over this third wave also. Pl continue to observe all precautions.” As a result of the drop in daily new cases and added tests, the positivity rate also dipped to 7.24%, the lowest since October 23. This number had shot up to 15.33% on November 15. Daily deaths dropped below 90 for the first time on Saturday in 16 days. With 89 deaths reported on Saturday, Delhi’s toll inched closer to 9,000. Till Saturday, 8,998 people had died of the infection in the city. “Although the number of cases is going down, I do not think it will go down to levels in August before the second and third surge in cases. With temperatures going down and pollution, there will likely be more cases in coming months,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-test-positivity-rate-drops-below-8/story-CCcLKiKDrqVlWgINrZNNrM.html

It has been diagnosed with an advanced stage of metabolic bone disease. The reptile was found abandoned in a building complex at Ghatkopar by a resident. He informed the forest department about it and they rescued the reptile, said Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW). It was later handed over to the Thane Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (TSPCA), where X-ray reports revealed that the tortoise was pregnant with three eggs. The vet, Dr Archana Bapat, then learnt that the tortoise had developed the bone disease. It is now under intensive care. “While this may not be a rare disease, the reptile has poor chances of survival presently. Its shell has turned rubber-soft due to the bone disease as its body starts absorbing calcium required for normal metabolic and hormonal functions from its shell, thereby causing excessive softening of the shell,” said Pawan Sharma, president, RAWW, adding, “Most of the star tortoises kept in illegal captivity are prone to this disease, which leads to a slow and extremely painful death.” Listed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, star tortoises are one of the most trafficked wildlife globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pregnant-star-tortoise-rescued-in-mumbai-diagnosed-with-bone-disease/story-RvUWDQUqCk0A84oDt4cQLN.html
29-11-2020||Chandigarh||Housewives a high-risk group, account for 78.5% of cancer cases among Chandigarh women||A staggering 78.5% of the women in Chandigarh who developed cancer were housewives, the population-based cancer registry (PBCR) for the years 2015 and 2016 has revealed.The registry further reveals that one in every 8th woman and one in every 9th man in Chandigarh is at risk of developing cancer.“In the years 2015 and 2016, PBCR registered 1,800 cancer cases, of which 907 were males and 893 were females. The age-adjusted incidence rate for males is 96.6 per 1,00,000 population and for females, it is 100.9 per 1,00,000 population. The cumulative risk for the age group 0-74 years in males is 11.6% (1 in 9 men is at risk of developing cancer) and in females, it is 12.2% (1 in 8 females is at risk of developing cancer),” the report states.Of the 893 female cancer patients, 706 were housewives while 111 (12.4%) were government employees, the registry data shows. Among the men, government employees formed 42.3% of the total 907 cases.Population with a sedentary lifestyle at riskProfessor JS Thakur, principal investigator of the registry, said that most cases were found among the population with a sedentary lifestyle.“The part of the population which has a lifestyle involving little or no physical activity and a great amount of stress is at greater risk of having cancer, and the data gathered here in the registry reveals the same,” said Dr Thakur.Dr Pankaj Malhotra, professor of internal medicine and investigator of the registry, said that food habits and lack of regular exercise are the main factors of cancer among housewives.“Among women, breast cancer is the leading site, which is due to bad food habits, restricted activity, and high-stress levels. Most of the cases we receive at PGIMER are in the advanced stages because women do not screen themselves regularly. Regular exercise and low stress levels can decrease the incidence of cancer. The type of cancers in Chandigarh are mostly found in affluent societies which are linked to bad lifestyle,” said Dr Pankaj Malhotra. The third report of Population-Based Cancer Registry was released on Saturday by Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, in collaboration with Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, and Chandigarh health department. Report recommends programmes for early detectionThe report recommended early detection programmes, including etiological and survival analysis, with focus on breast, cervix uteri, oesophagus, prostate, lung and oral cancer. It also recommends that cancer should be made a notifiable disease in Chandigarh. There should be a robust mechanism for interstate sharing of data with neighboring states of Rajasthan and Haryana, it further stated. States may consider introducing an electronic medical record system under the National Digital Health Mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/housewives-a-high-risk-group-for-cancer-account-for-78-5-of-cancer-cases-among-chandigarh-women/story-ZZBLzHPVUX3cet86hoETsO.html

DRI arrested three people, including two Nigerian nationals, in a well-coordinated seven-day operation called ‘Operation Kruger’.A senior DRI official said they intercepted a parcel that had arrived from South Africa to the hub of an international courier company in Mumbai on the basis of a specific input, and examined the same. The parcel contained women’s gowns and the drugs were hidden in buttons attached to gowns.Officials noticed the abnormally large number of buttons sewn to the gowns. Upon further examination, they found around 396 grams of heroin hidden inside the buttons.DRI officials then seized the contraband material under relevant provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.In a bid to nab narcotics racket members linked to the seized heroin, DRI officials obtained authorisation for a controlled delivery from the director general of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on November 26.A team of DRI officials then went with the courier company’s vehicle and managed to nab the Indian national who came to accept the delivery. He revealed the details of the Nigerian national who was set to receive drugs from him. Following the information, the foreigner was nabbed. During questioning, the Nigerian national revealed details of one of his associates who is also a Nigerian national. DRI officials have also arrested the associate on Friday from Taloja.All the three arrested accused have been booked under relevant sections of the NDPS Act and have been sent to judicial custody by a city court.DRI officials said Operation Kruger was the fourth major drug bust of DRI Mumbai in the span of 10 days and is expected to cause major disruptions in the city’s drug supply chain which has deep transcontinental links extending to Africa and America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/drug-racket-bust-dri-arrests-three-with-heroin-worth-2-crore-in-mumbai/story-bgYBPkrOmHRM33grFkKyoI.html

He escaped with injuries on his legs.According to Mumbra police, the driver Brijlal Jaiswal, 40, was going from Bhiwandi to Nhava Sheva. The container was filled with tar. He was not speeding. However, due to the narrow bypass road, he lost control of the vehicle near Uday Nagar on Mumbra bypass road, and fell 250 feet deep in the valley beside the road.Regional Disaster Management officer, Santosh Kadam, said, “As the container fell down 250 feet, the driver’s cabin was crushed. The driver tried to escape but his legs got stuck. After reaching the spot with the fire brigade team, we realised that we have to break and cut the cabin partially. Accordingly, our team started the rescue operations, cut the cabin and rescued the driver after two hours. Luckily the container didn’t fall on the houses that were just near the accident spot. The container is still on the spot and not yet removed.”The driver has been admitted to Chhatrapati Shivaji Hospital in Kalwa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/driver-rescued-after-2-hours-of-container-toppling-at-mumbra-bypass/story-sBtRQVKfwF74AOVD71pciP.html

A video of the incident, captured in the CCTV camera of the elevator, went viral. The police have registered an accidental death report (ADR) and are probing the case further.The victim, Mohammed Huzaifa Sarfaraz Shaikh, lived with his family on the fourth floor of Kozi Center building at Dharavi’s Cross Road. On Saturday, the child was playing with his two sisters in the building. When lift stopped on their floor, the three children entered inside and pressed buttons of upper floors, the police said. “The children didn’t close the door of the lift. The two girls then stepped out of the lift, but the boy got stuck between the grille and wooden safety doors of the lift. As the children had pressed the buttons of the upper floors, the lift went up and the boy fell down from the fourth floor to the bottom of the elevator’s shaft. He sustained head injuries and died,” said inspector Vilas Gangawane of Shahu Nagar police station.The boy’s mother learnt about the incident 45 minutes later, after she noticed blood stains on the elevator’s door while searching for her son, the police said. “The CCTV footage indicates that it was an accident. So we have filed an ADR and are probing if there was negligence on anyone’s part,” said Gangawane. “We appeal to citizens to keep a close eye on their children while they play outside, especially in buildings that have elevators. Residential societies must also depute liftman to avoid such mishaps,” Gangawane added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/five-year-old-dies-after-getting-stuck-in-lift-door-falling-4-floors-in-mumbai-s-dharavi/story-RjUpLIcI0sNOK3GSAGs2vJ.html

The civic body did not have a rehabilitation plan in place. Thus, the rehabilitation was delayed.Vijay Suryavanshi, KDMC chief, said, “We will conduct meetings with those affected in road projects and formulate a rehabilitation plan on priority. Our officials have been asked to work on it, make a list of those affected and suggest rehabilitation options for them.”Those affected in the widening of the Siddharth Nagar U-type road in Kalyan (E) two decades ago are still fighting for rehabilitation.“I lost my one room kitchen in 2000. Even today, there is no alternate accommodation provided by the civic body. Initially, we went to the court, who asked to provide rehabilitation to 12-13 residents. The civic body had discussed this matter in the general body several times but still nothing has been done,” said Balu Anand Ubale, 61, who lives in Jimmibaugh with his family.Residents also formed a group, ‘Citizens Rehabilitation Committee’, to fight for the rehabilitation of the affected people. Since 2000, the KDMC has been trying to widen the U-type road extending from Katemanivali Naka to Tisgaon Naka by 24m to ease congestion on the road. However, residents and shop owners kept protesting, demanding the KDMC to first rehabilitate the people already affected by a demolition drive conducted in 2000.The committee said 18 families were affected in the demolition drive conducted in 2000 in Siddharth Nagar.“The rehabilitation committee of the civic body has approved the sanctioning of alternative space for those affected in the Siddharth Nagar project in 2014. However, all we got were false assurances. We want the civic body to first make a proper data on the properties available to them that they can hand over to the affected people. If a person who lives near the station is affected and is given a flat in the outskirts, what is the point of such rehabilitation?” said Uday Rasal, president of Citizens Rehabilitation Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kalyan-dombivli-civic-chief-assures-to-implement-rehab-plan-for-project-affected-people/story-Mptb0N2qgLcFyHGtM9Ml4K.html
29-11-2020||Delhi||ICMR approves dry-swab RT-PCR method to ramp up Covid testing||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved the “dry swab-direct” RT-PCR method for Covid-19 testing, after finding it to be 96.9% in concordance with the current sample collection method. The process developed by researchers from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology-Hyderabad (CCMB-H) skips a few steps done before performing the gold standard RT-PCR test, meaning it can help in scaling up Covid-19 testing two to three times at no additional cost. Under the new method, nasal swab samples can be directly put in a dry test tube for transportation instead of using a viral transport media (VTM), which is a solution that can keep the live virus stable for 72 hours without refrigeration. Using a dry tube instead of VTM also prevents spillage and contamination of samples that can result in the test throwing up false positives. The method also skips over the step of RNA extraction, with the samples being directly set up for RT-PCR following a simple processing. “Handling of the dry swab becomes extremely easy because there is no risk of spillage and the vials do not need to be sealed. In addition, we also skip the step of RNA extraction, which even with automation takes 4 hours for roughly 500 samples. This cuts down the time and the cost of an RT-PCR test by half. For example, for each test the VTM costs about ₹100, the RNA extraction kit about ₹200 to 250, and the additional steps also consumes a lot of plastic ware that will be eliminated,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, director, CCMB. The organisation had been collecting and testing patient samples since April 2020 and had been able to identify the bottlenecks. The process was submitted for approval to the ICMR in June but the delay in approval had prompted the director of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, which runs CCMB, had said, “What we needed in the country is to get science rid of the bureaucracy. In fact one thing that hinders science in India is our bureaucracy. We had announced dry swab in June and yet on today’s date, we don’t have regulatory approval for one reason or the other. It’s a shame.” He was speaking at a lecture in Pune International Centre (PIC) in September. Following this, ICMR had tweeted, “Scientific evaluation proved that despite initial promises, swabs collected from clinic attendees & transported in a dry test tube environment w/o VTM for RT-PCR & skipping RNA extraction in the laboratory, is not effective for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.” This prompted the researchers to add an enzyme to the process, making it more robust, and in concordance to the results given by the existing method even for samples with low viral load. “At our end, the results were similar to the traditional RT PCR method. However, in some settings and depending on people running and reading the tests, the samples where the CT value was high – meaning low viral load – the results could be interpreted as this way or that. As we do not do RNA extraction, we need to get an efficient amount of virus even from such samples. For that, we have added a cheap enzyme Proteinase K to the sample before putting it in RT PCR. This helps in getting more viral particles and proteins for the test to detect,” said Dr Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/icmr-approves-dry-swab-rt-pcr-method-to-ramp-up-covid-testing/story-qq2dTqnO0WZjBqc76xPZ6M.html
29-11-2020||Kolkata||As Suvendu Adhikari quits cabinet, CM to hold rallies in his strongholds||The Trinamool Congress in West Bengal decided on Saturday to step up public meetings in the poll-bound state in the wake of senior leader Suvendu Adhikari’s resignation from the cabinet, a development the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is looking to tap to up the ante against the Mamata Banerjee government.Banerjee is expected to hold rallies in some of the districts where Adhikari has a strong support base starting with West Midnapore on December 7; the chief minister will also hold a virtual meeting with all district-level leaders on December 4. On Saturday, Abhishek Banerjee, TMC MP and the chief minister’s nephew, and poll strategist Prashant Kishor held a meeting with party leaders of Malda district. TMC leaders from East Midnapore have been directed to attend the December 7 rally. “The leadership not only wants to take stock but also wants to boost the morale of the party workers ahead of the polls,” said a TMC leader. The ruling party received a double blow on Friday with not just Adhikari quitting the cabinet, but another party veteran Mihir Goswami joining the BJP. “Suvendu is still a party member. So talks can still be held. His mother is unwell, so it may take some time. But I am hopeful,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP. Party insiders said some leaders from Malda were absent at the meeting called by Abhishek Banerjee and Kishor in Kolkata on Monday. The BJP sharpened its attack on the TMC. State president Dilip Ghosh said, “Didi has failed in disaster management of the state and now is busy with the disaster management of the party.” The TMC said Ghosh was daydreaming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/as-suvendu-adhikari-quits-cabinet-cm-to-hold-rallies-in-his-strongholds/story-28KScz903ut7cRIfTCb7eI.html

The positivity rate was 8.51 per cent. In Delhi, the positivity rate was over 15 per cent on November 7, which has come down. This is a relief,” he said.Jain said that as many as 50 per cent of the beds are vacant in the national capital and added that 1,200 ICU beds are also available. “Yesterday, there was some problem with oxygen. But the issue with oxygen supply has now been resolved,” he added.Speaking about the farmers’ protest, Jain said that the demonstrations are being conducted in a peaceful manner and should be permitted to continue.On Friday, the Delhi government had rejected a request made by the Delhi Police seeking permission to convert nine stadiums in the national capital into temporary prisons, in view of the Delhi Chalo farmers’ protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/can-vaccinate-all-of-delhi-in-a-month-satyendar-jain/story-u0qph243n0njccAFiEm2KJ.html
29-11-2020||Delhi||As part of new containment strategy, RT-PCR tests for all ‘high-risk’ residents of Delhi’s hot spots||As part of a revised policy for containment zones in the city likely to be enforced next week, districts in Delhi may continue with the micro-containment policy in terms of size of sealed areas, even as testing and surveillance are scaled up in these places to better arrest the spread of Covid-19.Under the current containment strategy in the Capital, district administrations are entrusted with conducting RT-PCR tests on all symptomatic people and contacts of positive cases.Under the revised policy, district administrations expected to, inside containment zones, be required to conduct RT-PCR tests, the most reliable diagnosis for the coronavirus disease, on all residents aged above 60, pregnant women, and individuals with comorbidities, irrespective of symptoms or direct contact with active cases, said senior government officials aware of the new policy.They further said, districts will have to ensure follow-up health checks on such “high-risk” individuals periodically even after the containment zones are de-notified.Currently, over 220,000 people live in Delhi’s 5,200-odd containment zones spread across the city’s 11 revenue districts.The revised policy – drafted by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) – is likely to be implemented from Monday, senior officials said, adding that district magistrates had been briefed about the strategy by chief secretary Vijay Dev earlier this week.In his meeting with Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on November 15, Union home minister Amit Shah had recommended a revised containment policy for Delhi in the light of the severe spike in cases and increased number of deaths. Baijal is the chairperson of the DDMA and Kejriwal the vice-chairperson.“The policy of micro containment zones will continue. Micro containment zones have enabled the government to spread out and cover a larger share of active cases and contacts. Tests and surveillance in the containment zones will be further scaled up,” Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot, who is also a member of the DDMA, said.A similar testing policy covering all elderly people and “high-risk” individuals living inside containment zones was implemented once in June, when Delhi had witnessed the first instance of severe spike in Covid-19 cases. However, those tests were conducted the rapid antigen method, which though faster, is known to be far less accurate than the RT-PCR method.“As cases went down, the testing policy was revised. Even though rapid antigen tests show results quickly, it was a massive exercise because containment zones were much larger back then,” said a senior revenue department official who did not wish to be identified.The current policy of RT-PCR tests on all symptomatic people and contacts of Covid-19 cases living inside containment zones was implemented in mid-September when Delhi witnessed the second instance of surge of Covid-19 infections.In November the city witnessed the third – and the most severe so far – spike in cases, which necessitated the revised strategy.Dr Jacob John, former head of clinical virology, Christian Medical College in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, said: “These are all welcome moves from a health management perspective. Micro containment zones are easier to manage. RT-PCR tests on more people would help in isolating more Covid-19 cases and ensuring that these containment zones do not turn into hotspots at any point. As far as recordkeeping of the elderly and vulnerable are concerned, it should be done across Delhi now. Follow-up checks are very important in Covid-19 and it is not a labour-intensive job as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-part-of-new-containment-strategy-rt-pcr-tests-for-all-high-risk-residents-of-delhi-s-hot-spots/story-roQlHF26rfe8HziUtiSTsM.html
29-11-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Waiting for the dawn of a Covid free era||The year that saw the world in the group of a pandemic, the one ray of hope is the Covid-19 vaccine. As reported in various newspapers, a number of Covid-19 vaccines are in the final stages of trials and are likely to hit the market soon for phased use. If priority approvals are given by licensing authorities in India and elsewhere, the vaccines could be available at the dawn of 2021. It has been reported in the media that the Oxford Vaccine developed by Oxford University and British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is 70.4% effective in its trials in India and abroad. People are now relieved knowing that, at last, there is some shield available against the deadly virus that has affected over 60.18 million people around the world and has taken at least 1.41 million lives globally. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will be produced in India by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). As reported, 40 million doses have already been manufactured and will be released as soon as permissions are obtained from the regulatory authorities for its use for the public. As stated by Dr Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of SII, to the media, another 60 million doses can be produced in the next 45 to 60 daysThat’s not all. There are around 164 candidate Covid-19 vaccines in pre-clinical evaluation, 48 vaccines in the stage of clinical evaluation, of which about 11 are in the final stages of phase three testing, the final trial and testing stage. So now it’s a matter of time before a variety of Covid-19 vaccines flood the market, but the advantage will lie with companies that hit the market first. Since the vaccine will be available in the market in another two months or so, maybe less, the most important question is the pricing factor. US based Pfizer and BioNTech, also at an advanced stage of developing their vaccine, have announced an estimated price at $19, while Moderna, also US-based, says its price will be an estimated $25 to $37. These vaccines, however, will then be uneconomical for countries like India. However, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla has stated that Covishield will be priced at around $3 a dose (approximately Rs 225) for the government and around $7 to $8 a dose (approximately Rs 600) for the general public in India. Since the vaccine will be launched soon and the immunisation process is going to take a long time, the Indian government’s role will be vital in the areas of its procurement and distribution. Infrastructure has to be in place for its storage and transportation across the country, which is going to be a big challenge. As demand will be huge in the first stage, the government should take command of its resources and act as an intermediary to procure the vaccine in bulk for rationing the same among the public. At whatever price it may procure the Oxford-AstroZeneca vaccine, the government has to provide it at a highly subsidised rate, which will not only bring immense relief to the public but also generate a lot of goodwill among the masses. It has already been made clear that the vaccine will be reserved at the first stage for priority groups such as frontline health workers and emergency cases, including the elderly and a data bank of such persons has already been created. The launch of the vaccine will not only save lives, but also give enough confidence to people to get out and about without fear of getting infected. It will also set the agenda for the economic, social and psychological reconstruction of the country. India is in and advantageous position during the pandemic as companies like SII, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Bharat Biotech make it one of the world’s biggest vaccine makers. Bharat Biotech has the capacity to produce 500 million doses and the SII 800 million doses annually. Vaccines developed anywhere in the world, therefore, would need Indian manufacturers’ support for its production and distribution. Everyone is now waiting eagerly for announcements of the Covid-19 launch, the new dawn in an era free of the pandemic.jrk7860@gmail.comThe writer is a retired civil servant.

Of those tested, nine have been found Covid-19 positive in the RT-PCR tests. On the first day, 130 flight passengers did not have a negative RT-PCR report with them and so, they were tested, of which six tested Covid-19 positive. On the second day, of the 63 tested for Covid-19, only two tested positive and on the third day, of the 78 passengers who were tested, only one had been Covid-19 positive. All these were RT-PCR tests as per the guidelines issued by the state government and most of the passengers were asymptomatic. Passengers coming in flights from Mumbai or Pune from Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujrat and Goa will be subjected to mandatory testing. An RT-PCR negative test report (with the sample collection done within 72 hours of scheduled arrival) is a must before boarding which needs to be shown to authorities before arrival. Shravan Mutha, Covid-19 manager at the airport kiosk of Krsnaa Diagnostics, said, “Most of the patients arriving from these three cities are subjected to testing if they do not have a negative RT-PCR report. All the tests are conducted only through RT-PCR as per the state government guidelines. Once the reports come, and they test positive, we inform the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for further action like contact tracing and isolation.” Kuldeep Singh, airport director, said, “All the necessary precautions are in place for testing. The sample collection centre has been completely sanitised and social distancing is maintained. The precautions have been put in place and all the passengers are handed blank forms which seek address and contact details.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/271-passengers-tested-in-three-days-at-pune-airport-only-nine-covid-19-positive/story-isTe9M6adG0yttSM6Ynl4M.html
