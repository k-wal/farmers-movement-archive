24-11-2020||Chandigarh||Bar Council has no power to suspend licence of an advocate: HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that a Bar council does not have power to take punitive action against a lawyer without the complaint being referred to a disciplinary committee. The high court bench of justice Alka Sarin gave this ruling while quashing the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana (BCPH)’s August 14 order, wherein the licence of Bharat Bhushan Verma, former president of Ludhiana District Bar Association, was suspended for his alleged Facebook posts against the council’s executive members. “The provisions of the 1961 Act (Advocates Act, 1961) and the BCI (Bar Council of India) Rules do not bestow power on the State Bar Council to suspend the licence to practise of an advocate while referring the complaint against him to its disciplinary committee,” the bench held. On August 4, a note complaining about Verma’s Facebook posts was put up by a member. The BCPH chairman, acting on it, issued a show-cause notice to Verma via WhatsApp and speed post. It was claimed as he did not respond to the notice, on August 14, his licence was suspended and the matter referred to the disciplinary committee. The committee initiated proceedings against him on August 21. Verma had argued that the decision was without jurisdiction and in gross violation of all principles of natural justice. It was argued that matter should have been referred to the disciplinary committee and the Bar Council had no power to pass an interim order. Before the court, it came to light that the show-cause notice was sent through WhatsApp but another condition of also delivering it by email was not complied with. In the speed post, the address was incomplete. Hence, Verma could not present his side. “An order suspending the licence to practice of an advocate operates to his prejudice not only in praesenti (at the present time) but also puts a taint which attaches far beyond and may well spell the death knell of his professional career which can be described as a civil death,” the bench observed. The bench further said there is no specific or implied power conferred on a State Bar Council under the 1961 Act to take punitive action against an advocate while simultaneously referring a complaint against him to the disciplinary committee. It has to justify exercise of its powers within the four corners of the statute which has created it, the bench added while quashing all proceedings against the lawyer with a liberty to BCPH to initiate them afresh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bar-council-has-no-power-to-suspend-licence-of-an-advocate-hc/story-dbdOCNPsJgfsqwRbPZlQHN.html

While maximum temperature went down marginally from 22.8°C on Monday to 22.2°C on Tuesday, minimum temperature rose to 12.3°C from 9.6°C owing to cloudy weather.In the coming three days, the day temperature is expected to remain between 19 and 24 degrees while the night temperature will remain between 9 to 12 degrees.With western disturbances active in the region and cloudy weather to continue, open areas have been experiencing mist formation since Monday, especially in the morning. At Sukhna Lake, mist was present even in the evening. Fog and mist differ by how far you can see through them. Fog is when you can see less than 1,000 metre away, and if you can see further, it is called mist.

24-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab governor’s principal secretary tests positive for Covid-19 again||JM Balamurugan, principal secretary to Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore, on Tuesday tested positive for Covid-19 again, within less than four months. However, whether it is a case of reinfection has not been immediately established.An official spokesperson said that out of 338 people tested during an exercise at Punjab Raj Bhawan, six people including Balamurugan were found positive. They have been immediately isolated.Badnore and his family members have, however, tested negative. The spokesperson said that entry and meetings have been restricted at the Raj Bhavan for the time being, and all protocols regarding the pandemic are being followed as per the Government of India’s guidelines.Balamurugan, a 1994-batch Indian Administrative Services officer, had earlier tested positive on August 9, the official spokesperson said. Dr Mini P Singh, professor of virology and nodal officer of the Covid-19 laboratory services at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education of Research, Chandigarh, said that further investigation is required to establish if it is a possible case of reinfection.“To possibly say that it was a case of reinfection, we need to examine whether the patient was symptomatic earlier and what symptoms the patient has exhibited this time. It will require more investigation as well,” said Dr Singh.Dr Jagdish Chander, head of microbiology department and Covid-19 laboratory at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, said the patient may have tested positive again due to a fragment of the dead virus.“It can also be a case of reinfection. We need to understand that the testing system (RT-PCR method) is actually a research tool more than a diagnostic test,” he said.Earlier, a 25-year-old man from Sector 45 had tested positive for Covid-19 within a gap of two months. The person had also donated plasma after recovery.Experts pointed out that to determine whether it is reinfection or not, a blood sample can be taken to see the formation of antibodies and to see whether the patient is still shedding the virus, or if it is a new infection, the two strains of the virus have to be sequenced.Meanwhile, Chandigarh reported a total of 79 fresh cases om Tuesday, which took the tally to 16,848.

The department on Tuesday wrote to the Municipal Corporation Gurugram(MCG) to initiate action against the hospital for violating norms. DTCP officials said that the action was taken after a formal complaint was lodged on social media regarding this issue. RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement, said that an inspection of the premises was conducted and the hospital management was asked to produce both the fire NOC as well as the revised building plan of the building. “Neither the fire NOC was presented to the department nor the revised OC was submitted. As such, we have decided to write to the MCG to initiate action in this regard as operating a hospital without required permissions could pose threat to the safety of patients,” said Bhath. As the site for which the change of land use (CLU) was granted by the department falls in the jurisdiction of MCG, the department has written to the corporation to initiate necessary action. An official of the World Laparoscopy Hospital, on condition of anonymity, said that they have obtained the OC for the building. “We have also applied for an NOC from the fire department and the matter is under process,” he said.

24-11-2020||City||Six robbers held last week had ‘trained’ in UP, wanted to start their own school to train criminals||Gurugram: The six members of a gang arrested last week allegedly “trained” to be robbers in Uttar Pradesh last year, before carrying out heists in the National Capital Region (NCR), and were planning to start their own school to train future criminals, said the police on Tuesday.The suspects were arrested on Friday and Saturday from different locations over their alleged involvement in an armed robbery at a jewellery shop in Sadar Bazar’s Roshanpura area on September 19. Officers said they have been allegedly involved in dozens of armed robberies at jewellery shops in the NCR.According to Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), the suspects allegedly revealed during questioning that they took a month-long training from criminals in Kasganj in Uttar Pradesh. They were trained in making route maps, placement of gang members during the robbery, which route to select after identifying the shop, how to avoid CCTVs and how to target victims,” he said. The suspects were identified as Varun alias Sonu (32) of Kaithal, Mintu (24) of Nathupur in Gurugram, Harsh (19) of Badshahpur, Tony (24) of Sector 65, Sunil Kumar (27) of Madhya Pradesh and Sourya of Kasganj in UP.Police said Sourya had allegedly introduced the other suspects to his friends in Kasganj who were involved in more than 80 criminal cases, including murder. “Sourya was earlier part of a UP gang and was involved in 20 snatching cases. He fled to Gurugram along with two of his friends and joined Varun’s gang. He took them to his hometown and lodged them at his house. They all robbed more than 11 people in a month and snatchings from 17 people. Sourya was planning to start his own “training school” for robberies and snatchings before he was caught,” said Sangwan. Officers said that the gang was allegedly planning to start a business and for that they had planned to rob at least five jewellers in Gurugram, but their planning failed and they were identified via CCTV footage.Varun had allegedly joined hands with Sourya and they had finalised a place in the outskirts of Kasganj where they would have started their training school by the end of December, said the police.Sangwan said the suspects were allegedly planning to train young snatchers and robbers and were planning to keep a cut from their earnings. “They were planning to come up with “packages” for the training school and had started connecting with criminals in UP and Haryana lodged in jails to get them on board,” he said. Narender Chauhan, in-charge, crime investigation agency, Sector 18, said that all six gang members were allegedly well trained but could not conduct reconnaissance of inner lanes connected to Sadar market, in which they were captured. “They had to change their route last minute while fleeing with the ornaments and cash due to traffic congestion, which was not in their original plan. They had stopped at three locations and had come out of the car, where they were identified,” he said. Chauhan said his team will be sent to Kasganj for further investigation on Thursday and that they are coordinating with the local police there. The suspects were produced before the court on Tuesday and were sent to 14 days’ judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/six-robbers-held-last-week-had-trained-in-up-wanted-to-start-their-own-school-to-train-criminals/story-PAth1rD995ZKO5ob0SvBqJ.html
24-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram least polluted in NCR although city air remains toxic||Air quality in the city remained “poor” on Tuesday, recording 296 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin, up from 285 the previous day in the same category. Gurugram was the least polluted city in the National Capital Region (NCR) with the AQI in Delhi and Noida staying in the “very poor” category. Ghaziabad stayed in the “severe” category. Experts attributed the poor AQI to slow wind speeds due to which pollutants couldn’t be dispersed.The level of ultrafine particulate matter 2.5 (PM 2.5), which has a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 243.38 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Tuesday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to deteriorate further and remain in the “very poor” category on Wednesday. The air quality is expected to improve but remain in the “very poor“category on Thursday. Gurugram’s minimum temperature settled at 9.6 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Palam Observatory in Delhi, which, according to the MeT department officials, gives a fairly accurate reading of the city’s weather. The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) did not record the city’s minimum temperature on Tuesday. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 23.8 degrees Celsius, as per the Palam observatory. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that temperature will continue to be in a similar range on account of a western disturbance over the next 2-3 days. “After the western disturbance passes, cold winds will again start blowing from the region and the mercury is again set to dip from November 27,” said Srivastava. As per IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature will hover around 23 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature is expected to stay at eight degrees. As per the weekly forecast, fog and mist will prevail in the morning hours on Wednesday followed by partly cloudy skies later during the day. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality took a turn for the worse on Tuesday, sparking fears that meteorological conditions and local pollution sources could choke the city for days yet again. Government agencies have forecast that the air quality could enter the ‘severe’ zone on Wednesday. The city’s air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday settled at 379, in the upper end of the “very poor” zone, according to CPCB’s recordings at 4pm. Ghaziabad emerged as the most polluted city in the country for the third consecutive day. Experts pointed out that since stubble burning count from other states had reduced considerably, local pollutants now have a major impact over the air quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-least-polluted-in-ncr-although-city-air-remains-toxic/story-hz8eR1oO377td2d75TgC5N.html
24-11-2020||Gurugram||Residents defiant over lack of mask hygiene||Shoppers at city’s busy markets and visitors at other prominent locations, such as parks and malls, continue to flout safety norms of social distancing and mask hygiene — the two most important ways to curb the spread of Covid-19 — even as cases continue to peak this month, following the festive season and onset of winter.HT tagged along with police patrol teams last week to four prominent locations, including markets and parks, where rampant violation of the rules pertaining to Covid-appropriate behaviour was noticed. Despite awareness campaigns and penal provisions, visitors to public places seem dismissive of the safety norms in place, with many telling the enforcement teams that the virus would not affect them.A lack of awareness about Covid-19 continues to be the main problem among the people, with many citing superstitious beliefs and their healthy lifestyle as excuses for not wearing masks.Experts say that wearing masks is crucial in containing the infection as symptoms only appear after four to five days of getting infected. It is likely that during this period, patients might not develop usual symptoms of cough, fever or difficulty in breathing, but can still spread the infection to others. A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June found that Covid-19 can also be spread by those who have very mild disease and do not show any symptom. Studies show that mask can reduce the growth rate of coronavirus infection by 40%.Even fines do not seem to deter violators or promote safe practices among those reluctant to wear masks. Between July 9 and November 20, the police has levied 89,582 penalties for violation of Covid-19 guidelines and collected over Rs 4.47 crore. The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), which also delegates teams to check for violations, has collected a fine of over Rs 13 lakh till October, as per the data available with the state government.The police said that more than 1,200 people, on an average, are fined every day for not wearing masks. There are 86 police teams, comprising 900 personnel in all, deployed across the city to keep a check on violators.Officials of the health department, concerned over the situation at markets, had asked the civic agencies to ensure white paint markings, with a distance of three feet, to ensure social distancing. However, visitors at most markets continue to ignore the markings and huddle together at shops.Sadar BazarAround 11am on a weekday, groups of visitors from nearby villages throng the shops, with hardly any distance between one another. Many of them can be seen not wearing masks even as they continue to visit different stores to do their purchasing.The police teams, both in plainclothes and uniforms, keep a vigil and penalise people found violating rules. However, they say that the biggest challenge is to ensure that violators understand the importance of safety measures and do no repeat the offence.The police had organised a Covid-19 awareness camp in the market last week and distributed sanitisers and face masks to promote mask hygiene.Hardeep Hooda, station house officer, City police station, said that at least 26 hawkers and shop owners have tested positive for the virus, so far, in November. “It is the biggest market in the city and people from nearby villages visit here for purchasing groceries, clothes and other stuff. It has been observed that many do not follow safety measures and at least 200 people are penalised Rs 500, each, every day. Many of them tell us that their immune system is so strong that they cannot get affected by this virus,” he said.Bhupinder Singh, a resident of Badli village, who was visiting the market with his family to do the shopping for his daughter’s wedding, said, “The virus does not attack Jats.” Further, he said that his immunity is strong as he drinks fresh milk, consumes desi ghee and fresh vegetables grown in his fields. “I have never fallen sick in the last 45 years; nor does my family have any history of illness. We eat healthily and remain fit. Covid cannot affect us even if we do not wear a face mask,” he said.Singh and his four family members were fined for Rs 2,500 in total and given free masks.A group of 16 persons of a family from Bas village was found carrying masks in their bags. Roshni Lather (28), one of the family members, was asked to rub sanitiser before entering the market to which she refused and said she didn’t want to use chemicals on her skin. “We don’t use sanitisers as it causes cancer, instead we use ‘rakh’ to clean our hands when we return home after travelling outside the village. We do not wear a mask in our village as many people had fallen sick because of prolonged mask use,” she said.Many people in the market were seen removing their masks to cough, while many just wore the masks incorrectly, without totally covering their mouths and nostrils. Outside the juice shops, people could be seen sharing containers and spitting in the open, paying no heed to the guidelines.In several instances, shopkeepers were also seen hanging their masks around their necks instead of covering their face. When pulled up by the police, they claimed that they had to cough and couldn’t do so while keeping their masks on.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that they have penalised 434 shop owners in the last two months. “In many shops, there were no sanitisers placed despite repeated warnings. With the number rising, we are taking the help of the market associations to spread awareness. Assistant commissioners of police are visiting markets in their area every day to ask grocery shop owners and others to wear masks,” he said.Kamla Nehru ParkAt Kamla Nehru Park in Sadar’s Roshan Pura, people were penalised for walking in groups.A group of athletes, sharing water bottles during a practice session, said that they consumed more than 300ml of desi ghee daily and they are strong enough to fight the virus. They were also penalised.Rao said more than 5,000 people caught without masks in the last few weeks claimed to have recovered from the virus and thus, did not need to wear masks any longer. “People are getting careless about coronavirus and some of those who have recovered are moving around as if they are allowed to violate rules,” he said.Dharmender Kadiyan, a resident of village Chimni near Jhajjar, said he had been penalised eight times this month, but he still does not carry a mask. “I find it difficult to breathe with the mask on. Walking and running is not possible with a cloth on your mouth and nose. Three of my friends had collapsed due to breathlessness as they were wearing face masks. My family has asked me not to carry one,” he said, adding that avoiding the virus spread is inevitable and that it only harms senior citizens. “I am just 22,” he said.Subhash ChowkVisitors to malls along the Sohna Road were seen entering the premises without wearing masks and many instances of disagreements were observed when they were asked to use sanitisers and purchase a mask. The police said the habit of wearing masks is on the wane.A team of police officials deployed at Subhash Chowk also continue to penalise autorickshaw drivers for crowding. Many were seen ferrying up to 14 people, despite the vehicles having a seating capacity of six.People at public places are behaving as if there is no coronavirus, said Dinesh Kumar, the station house officer of Sadar police station. “With the rising number of coronavirus cases, we have removed hawkers from Subhash Chowk. More than 15 of them tested positive this month,” he said.Ram Tanwar, an autorickshaw driver who was fined twice in two days, said that passengers did not listen to him and removed masks. “They cough and sneeze but refuse to use handkerchief saying that they have recently recovered and they are safe for next three months. I wear a mask, but, at times, passengers say they can’t hear me clearly, due to which I remove my mask to talk. I had removed my mask only for a few minutes but I was caught,” he said.Two hawkers who sell paranthas and fruits at the crossing said they did not get their tests done due to a fear of losing out on business. “I had a mild fever last month for a few days but had no money to survive without work. I took all precautions and used a face mask, but did not take a break from work. Due to the lockdown, I have used up all my savings and if I don’t work, I will have no money to support my family. We will die in hunger,” said Ram Kishore, of Etawah in Uttar Pradesh.Vyapar KendraThe Vyapar Kendra in Sushant Lok-1 is one of the most tightly packed markets in the city, with 200 shops, 140 offices and many makeshift kiosks selling food, clothes and other sundry items vying for space on a six-foot-wide corridor, which snake up and down the building’s five floors, including the basement.With a daily footfall of over 3,000 people, at least 100 customers are fined every day, said police.Shopkeepers at the market said they are concerned over a lack of discipline among visitors, as they openly flout the regulations in place. However, they are fearful of losing out on customers if they object to a lack of mask hygiene.Shyam Sunder, a shopkeeper, said, “When I request people to use sanitisers, they say they have just used in the last shop and deny to rub it again. They remove their mask and talk. Asking them to pull it up gives an impression of arrogance. Last week, when I objected a man for not wearing a mask, he caught hold of me and abused me.”Most of the customers and buyers at the market were not wearing face masks. Those who did have the masks were wearing them improperly and pulled them up only on sighting police teams.Sarika Devi, a resident of Sushant Lok-1 Block A, was fined for leaving her mask hanging. She told the police team that she was coughing and with the mask on, she was unable to breathe. When the police tried to impose on her the importance of masks, she alleged that it is a way to harass the public and earn money. “I had a mask and I was about to wear it, but cops caught me and issued a fine,” she said.Tej Singh, the president of the market association, said that they regularly make announcements through speaker systems for visitors to wear face masks. “But people are still very careless and do not pay any heed. Surprisingly, being educated, they are not concerned about their own lives or others’ safety,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-defiant-over-lack-of-mask-hygiene/story-H05XiOTohH9a39or7P6mzM.html
24-11-2020||Gurugram||Doctors from AIIMS, Delhi, review Covid-19 situation in Gurugram||The director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, visited the city to review the Covid-19 situation in view of the continuous spike in cases for almost a month. Daily cases continued to hover near the 1,000 mark with the district on Tuesday reporting 822 new infections, taking the Covid-19 tally to 45,894 and active cases to over 6,000 for the second time this month.Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS, Delhi, asked the district health department to conduct targeted and saturation testing, where everyone gets tested, in worst-affected clusters. According to the district health department, Guleria, who was assisted by two other doctors, also advised that the workforce for contact tracing and monitoring home isolation be increased to flatten the curve.The active cases in Gurugram stand at 6,085. Cases are showing an uptick with a weekly test positivity rate of 16%, with daily infections fluctuating between 500-970. Considering the high positivity rate, doctors from AIIMS, who held a meeting with health officials at the chief medical officer’s (CMO) premises at old Civil Hospital, called for saturation testing in Covid-19 clusters.The Central government has already issued an advisory to states to conduct saturation testing in high-risk areas. Testing can be repeated periodically until the positivity rates of the high-risk areas decline. “In the worst-affected Covid-19 areas, the target is to increase the intensity of saturation testing, where everyone gets tested,” said Dr Virender Yadav, CMO, adding they have been doing periodical testing in some areas to lower the positivity rate.The health department has been conducting almost 6,000 tests for the last six days. On Tuesday, 6,264 tests were administered, including 4,688 Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) ones and 1,576 rapid antigen tests.Yadav said that the district health department has also been doing targeted testing. “Gurugram is currently doing maximum tests in Haryana. Over three lakh tests per million population have been conducted till now. At least 1,650 testing camps have been conducted. We are also trying aggressively to screen and test asymptomatic people identified through contact tracing exercise to limit the chain of transmission,” he said.HT reported earlier this week that contact tracing has become a challenging task due to the surge in cases. For every positive case, the teams are able to identify over four contacts, which is fewer than the recommendation of 10 contacts, as the health department is facing a shortage of personnel.“The issue has been put across to the state health department, to depute additional workforce for ideal contact tracing. Also, as nearly 93% of active cases are home isolated, their timely surveillance every alternate day is equally crucial. Therefore, we have also asked for more people who can join the home isolation teams,” said Yadav, adding that they have also been told to ensure strict quarantine of close contacts of positive persons.According to Yadav, the AIIMS team emphasized strict enforcement in containment zones and mask discipline in crowded places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/doctors-from-aiims-delhi-review-covid-19-situation-in-gurugram/story-P0RSLVUlzgon7ir0lg59IM.html
24-11-2020||Gurugram||Hostel facilities reduced by 75% for first-year students in city colleges||Of the two government colleges in the city that offer hostel facilities, one will not be offering the facility to first-year students this year while the other has reduced its strength by half, due to concerns over social distancing. As per the standard operating procedure for colleges and universities, physical distancing needs to be maintained at all times in hostels. Besides maintaining an adequate distance among the beds in a room, colleges have also been instructed to erect temporary partitions to separate the residents. At the Government Girls College in sector 14, the available seats have been reduced by half. Ramesh Garg, the principal of the college, said that the college will be starting the hostel facility from next month while adopting physical distancing norms. “The government has allowed the operation of hostels with physical distancing protocols. Earlier, 800 students used to stay in the hostel. This year, to abide by the distancing concerns, we have decided that a room will be shared by only two students. With this parameter, around 450 students will be able to occupy the hostel facilities,” said Garg. He said that forms for admissions have been shared with hostel applicants and the final list will be declared soon. “Admission to the hostel will be strictly done on merit basis. Students have already shared necessary information and we are aiming to make the hostels functional by December 1. The premises have been sanitized and sanitizers have been placed at various points,” said Garg. Outstation students said that the chances of securing a hostel seat would be less due to the reduction. Moreover, the move would be a setback for girls, especially students from rural areas, who are already struggling with internet access for online classes. “Due to Covid-19, all students will not be given a seat this year. Since the admission is merit based, we need to have a percentage (as per the cut-off) to get a seat,” said Komal, a first-year BSc student at Government Girls’ College, who has applied for a hostel seat. She said that students coming from distant places might face difficulty in relocating to Gurugram if they are unable to secure a seat. “Parents are often reluctant to send girls to other cities for studies. With limited chances of securing a hostel seat, obstacles will arise when physical classroom sessions go back to the normal routine. Online classes are not working seamlessly for all,” said Komal, who goes by her first name.Garg, however, said that since many students are in favour of online classes, the number of students seeking hostel admissions has also declined. “More than 50% of the students prefer online classes due to which the number of hostel applicants has reduced,” said Garg.Pooja Khullar, principal of Dronacharya Government College, said that the college will not be inviting new admissions to the hostel. “Our hostel is not in a working condition and needs to be demolished. We are not admitting first-year students to the hostel for now and will be adjusting the second and third-year students once arrangements are made,” said Khullar. She said that the college will take further steps based on the feedback it receives from the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hostel-facilities-reduced-by-75-for-first-year-students-in-city-colleges/story-vWwh5dx9ppIKDbN8NVVdHO.html
24-11-2020||City||Will declare results by November 30: DU tells Delhi high court||New Delhi: Delhi University on Tuesday informed the Delhi High Court that it would declare the pending results for various postgraduate and undergraduate courses by November 30, with the court remarking that the varsity’s “neck is on board” if it does not meet the deadline.A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad was informed by DU’s counsel Mohinder Rupal that it would declare the results after a plea alleged that varsity had not declared the results by October 31 in violation of an earlier order dated October 12.On October 12, the high court had directed the varsity to upload the mark sheets on its website and that no student should be asked to physically come to collect them.The court, while noting the submissions, said the remaining results of postgraduate and undergraduate courses should be declared by November 30. It posted the matter for further hearing on December 2.“Your neck is on the board if you don’t do it,” the bench said during the hearing, while questioning the filing of an application in a petition that had been disposed of.The high court had earlier disposed of two pleas by law student Prateek Sharma and National Federation of Blind, seeking to set up effective mechanisms for visually impaired and specially abled students so that educational instructions can be transmitted to them properly and teaching material provided through the online mode of teaching during the Covis-19 pandemic.The court questioned the maintainability of the application and asked petitioner Sharma why he had filed it in an already decided matter.“Why did you file an application in a decided matter? Answer us on the maintainability first and not on merits... We have reservations in entertaining the application in a disposed of petition,” the bench said.The petitioner, represented through advocate H S Hora, said in the application that DU had violated the October 12 order, where under the varsity itself had undertaken to adhere to the October 31 timeline for the declaration of results of PG and UG courses.The high court had earlier asked Delhi University and its examiners to expedite the evaluation process of the online open-book examination (OBE).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-declare-results-by-november-30-du-tells-delhi-high-court/story-NudfRaOUFZiB1rr8m8jtMN.html
24-11-2020||Gurugram||Cops question private lab staffers in connection with fake Covid report scam||After a private lab in the city was busted last week for making fraudulent Covid-19 reports, the police on Tuesday said more labs were under the scanner for forging such reports and that they were in the process of verifying the details before conducting raids. The police have recovered mobile numbers of more than 300 people who had allegedly paid the private lab to get positive reports for ₹1,400 and convert positive reports into negative ones for ₹3,000. On Tuesday, a police team of four members questioned the staff of a diagnostics lab in Delhi’s Kirti Nagar, whose letterhead was used to forge Covid-19 reports by the lab in question. Many people have travelled to foreign countries with these forged reports in the last two months, said the police. According to the police, the people involved in this racket included Anirban Roy of Kolkata and Parimal Roy of Murshidabad in Uttar Pradesh. They revealed that they had been involved in this illegal practice for the last two months. The teams have seized a bundle of letterheads from the lab and a laptop which stored all the data, said the police. Anirban had allegedly tied up with a diagnostic and path lab located in Delhi’s Kirti Nagar. Both were working hand in glove and used to prepare fake reports on lab’s letterhead, the police said. Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s flying squad, said that the duo didn’t seek permission from the district health department to conduct Covid-19 tests and to set up a lab in Gurugram. “The Sector 40 police is investigating the case and have questioned a few staff members of the Delhi lab. They have served them notice to join investigation as they were not cooperating in the investigation. The duo must have prepared more than 1,000 reports but we are yet to figure out the exact number of reports,” he said. The suspects were residing in a rented accommodation in the Saini Khera village in Sector 30 near the lab and used to contact people through messages and calls. They had allegedly bought data from Delhi where they used to send bulk messages that they are conducting tests, said the police. Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, Crime Investigation Department, said that the suspects were operating under the banner of Medikartz Pathology Lab and Medical Tourism, and used to also collect samples of blood for other investigations. “There are more such labs under scanner and we are conducting investigation and are in touch with the officials concerned. Once all the leads are verified, we will conduct raids at more locations,” he said. On Saturday, the Chief Minister’s Flying Squad had busted the fake pathology lab and arrested both the suspects from Sainikhera village. They had received a complaint that the fake coronavirus test reports are being generated in Gurugram and people are using it for travelling abroad. The police said a few people have even travelled to the US after taking fake negative certificates from them. Some people got positive reports to get leaves from their offices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-question-private-lab-staffers-in-connection-with-fake-covid-report-scam/story-9B86v7ljCPHod0s8QTw6tL.html
24-11-2020||Gurugram||No more than 50 allowed for indoor events, 100 for outdoor ones||The state government has capped the number of persons allowed for indoor events, such as weddings, political and religious functions, to 50, and the number of people for outdoor events to 100, in the six districts that fall in the National Capital Region. The decision was taken in view of the rising number of daily Covid-19 infections, said chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar during a press briefing on Tuesday in Chandigarh.The order will be effective from November 26, according to an official statement issued by the state administration. The decision comes a week after the Delhi government limited the number of people at gatherings to 50. Khattar on Tuesday took part in a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with chief ministers of seven other states — Delhi, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Kerala and Gujarat — through video conference. During the meeting with the PM on Tuesday noon, Khattar was interrupted by Modi while he was sharing Haryana’s Covid-19 figures. The PM said that the figures had already been presented and asked Khattar to share how he planned to control the spread of the coronavirus. Currently, Haryana is among the 10 states in the country that are reporting the maximum number of Covid-19 cases, which, in turn, has also led to increased mortality. The overall tally of the state has reached 222, 292 on Tuesday, of which 20,765 are active cases. The Covid-19 toll stands at 2,249, with 33 deaths recorded on Tuesday. The fatality rate of the state is 1.01%, while the recovery rate is 89.65%. The direction is applicable for Gurugram, Rewari, Faridabad, Rohtak, Sonepat and Hisar. In the remaining districts of the state, gatherings have been limited to 100 persons for indoor functions and 200 persons for outdoor ones, following the Central government’s guidelines.As per the official statement, Khattar said that the situation of Covid-19 in Haryana remained satisfactory in the first and second phase. “In the third wave of Covid-19, spurt in the number of cases has been registered in the past few days, especially in the districts adjoining the NCR, in view of the thick movement of people in the NCR,” said Khattar. He also said that police and urban local bodies have been directed to strictly enforce mask hygiene and penalise offenders. A fine of Rs 500 can be imposed on those who are found without masks. Also, 10 million masks would soon be distributed across the state. Khattar, however, said that there are no plans to impose night curfew. With regards to vaccine distribution, Khattar said that health care workers will get the first dose of vaccine.Also, in view of the ‘Dilli Chalo’ call given by various farmers’ organisations on November 26, to protest farm laws that were recently passed, the state administration has issued a comprehensive travel advisory for commuters. It stated that blockades can be faced at entry points from Punjab into Haryana and Haryana into Delhi, between November 25 and 27.Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, home department, said, “Haryana border connecting Punjab will be sealed completely, while traffic and security arrangements will be made at Delhi-Gurugram border.” Officials are expecting protesters are to enter Haryana from Punjab, through various border entry points, to reach Delhi. They will be taking four major national highways — Ambala to Delhi, Hisar to Delhi, Rewari to Delhi and Palwal to Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/no-more-than-50-allowed-for-indoor-events-100-for-outdoor-ones/story-h1tSZcjaDvv6lSMGTq22qJ.html

Police identified the two men as Rupender Nanhas and Amit Sutar -- both residents of Sonipat, Haryana. Police said there was a shootout in which at least 28 bullets were fired by the police and the two men. Police have recovered three pistols and 8 live cartridges. Police said the two men are members of Sonipat’s Sandeep Badwasni gang. Badwasni, who was allegedly into illegal liquor business, was shot dead by rival gang members in February 2017. Police said the two men arrested in the present case had for long wanted to take revenge on Badswani’s killers. In September, they had shot at a Haryana police inspector, who was related to one of the killers. Deputy commissioner of police(special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said the Haryana police had announced a reward and sought help from Delhi police in nabbing Nanhas, who had shot at the Haryana police inspector. DCP Yadav said that police received information about Nanhas visiting Rohini area after which they waited. The officer said that at around 4 am, they spotted a white Honda City car near Rohini Khera village bridge and asked them to stop but the two men in the car accelerated and tried to flee. “To prevent their escape, they were blocked by police vehicle due to which their vehicle hit the road divider. They came out of the car quickly and tried to escape. They fired at police, which hit the bulletproof vest of two cops from Delhi and Haryana police. The police team fired back. Two bullets hit the legs of the two men. A total of 11 rounds bullet were fired by the criminals and the police fired total 17 rounds bullets. The accused were shifted to a hospital in Rohini through PCR van,” said Yadav.

The move comes days after the college staff association wrote to the principal, requesting the formation of a committee to look into the needs of marginalised students in the wake of the recent death by suicide of a student of Lady Shri Ram College (LSR) due to financial distress and the pressure of online education.“Covid-19 has hit us all hard! Between 50-100 Stephanians currently enrolled in different courses are struggling to finance their tuition fees due to changes in family circumstances because of Covid. We are appealing to all Stephanians to partially or fully support the tuition fees of those affected students. Your contribution will be recognised on the college website and the beneficiaries will be made known to you,” the college said.“These are extraordinary times, let’s do the extraordinary. Please write to bursar@ststephens.edu to make a donation to this fund,” the college notification said.The college has invited applications from second and third-year students requiring financial assistance. The college says students should have a minimum of first division as aggregate in university examinations to apply. “The annual income of the family should not exceed ₹5 lakh; they need to attach a valid income certificate. Applicants should not be receiving any other scholarship or financial aid that exceeds ₹20,000 from the college or any other agency. Any other achievement that would justify the application,” the college said in its notification.Earlier, a group of students from the college had independently initiated a fund-raising event to help students struggling to pay their fees and buy devices to attend digital classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/st-stephen-s-college-sets-up-covid-19-resilience-fund-to-support-needy-students/story-zptFvLHukuinWx4rKRmOgJ.html
24-11-2020||Delhi||South civic body ties up with NTPC to set up solar panels, e-charging stations||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday approved a proposal for installing rooftop solar panels at all its buildings as well as setting up e-charging stations at sites provided by the civic agency. The proposal was approved in a standing committee meeting on Tuesday.The SDMC will tie up with National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) for the execution of the project. Rajdutt Gehlot, chairman, SDMC standing committee, said the idea behind the proposal is to minimise the expenditure incurred on electricity at office buildings and to also generate revenue through e-charging stations. “After approval from the standing committee, now a memorandum of understanding (MOU) will be signed between the civic body and the NTPC for the project. This project will complete the requirement of electricity in SDMC as the civic body will purchase solar power from the NTPC for its consumption which will be cheaper,” he said.According to municipal officials, solar panels are already installed at 208 buildings and nearly 9.33 megawatt (MW) electricity is being generated through these panels. Similar work of installation of solar panels at 177 SDMC buildings is underway which will produce 0.8MW of electricity.“Under the project, the NTPC will install rooftop solar panels at 250 more buildings under the SDMC which will produce nearly 10MW electricity. The NTPC will also set up ground solar panels at a south corporation’s land in Ghummanhera for the generation of 20MW solar power. The civic body’s electricity demand is around 35MW which will be met by solar power after completion of the project,” a senior SDMC official said, on the condition of anonymity. The official also added that the work on the project is likely to be started in January next year.Besides, the NTPC will also set up e-vehicles charging stations at different locations in the SDMC jurisdiction. “We don’t have to spend any money on this. We will just provide the land and locations and entire infrastructure for solar panels and e-charging stations will be developed by the NTPC,” the official said.The official added that terms and conditions for revenue sharing are yet to be worked out. However, the responsibility of operations and maintenance of solar panels and e-charging stations will be on NTPC. The SDMC currently has at least 106 e-charging stations for its own electric vehicles and has also inaugurated one public e-charging station in Greater Kailash in November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/south-civic-body-ties-up-with-ntpc-to-set-up-solar-panels-e-charging-stations/story-nJcdwLkLxLlhGMsEGzK0aI.html

24-11-2020||Chandigarh||Passengers relieved as train services resume in Ludhiana||With goods and passenger trains resuming operations in the state after two months on Tuesday, it has come as a relief for passengers at the Ludhiana railway station, which is one of the biggest in the Ferozepur railway division. Before the Covid outbreak, around 150 trains used to ply on the tracks of the Ludhiana railway station. But, this was reduced to around 20 amid spread of the infection. On Tuesday, eight passenger trains arrived from other states, while 11 left from or through Ludhiana. Also, around a dozen goods trains crossed the Ludhiana station, which comes as a relief to industrialists, who were struggling to transport goods.Residents who visited the railway station to board trains or book tickets said travelling by trains was cheaper and time-efficient compared to buses.Gurdeep Singh, a visitor at the station, said, “I have a transport business in Ludhiana and Jharkhand. I had to visit Jharkhand, but could not, as train services were suspended in the last week of September. Travelling by bus would take almost three days and cost seven to eight times more. I have now booked a train ticket for November 27.”Another visitor, Damanjit Singh, said, “I have booked a ticket for Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. However, no tickets are available for sleeper class. Travelling by bus is arduous as it will require changing a number of buses to reach the destination.”Meanwhile, residents said more trains should resume their services soon. A passenger, Nitish, said, “I wanted to book a ticket for Gorakhpur, but was told that no tickets were available for that destination. Authorities should press more trains into service to bring back normalcy in railway transport.”Ludhiana railway station director, Tarun Kumar, said, “The number of trains will increase gradually. Unreserved booking counters have been closed as per Covid guidelines issued by the government and residents can travel only by reserving their tickets in advance.”Apart from reserving the seats through the ticker reservation counters at the railway station, residents can also reserve the seats through the IRCTC Rail Connect mobile app. Also, tickets can be booked through private licenced agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/passengers-relieved-as-train-services-resume-in-ludhiana/story-LcENhx0f0NWP832wDzyEpO.html

24-11-2020||India||3,000 weddings slated to take place in Jaipur in Nov; officials fear Covid surge||Notwithstanding the recent spurt in Covid-19 cases in Rajasthan, more than 3,000 weddings are scheduled to take place in the capital city Jaipur over the next few days, posing a grave threat to people’s lives amid the pandemic outbreak.Officials fear that the infection may spread rapidly in the city due to such events.“We have received applications for permission to more than 3,000 weddings in the month of November. The permission is being given offline and online,” Additional District Collector-Jaipur, Shankar Lal Saini told PTI.A majority of the weddings this month will take place on November 25, on the occasion of ‘Dev Uthani Ekadashi’, and up to 100 people are allowed to attend a marriage function.Saini said the situation is alarming because the infection is spreading at a fast pace.“It is certainly a challenging situation in view of the increase in Covid positive cases. The district administration and police officials are constantly making people aware about the need to follow guidelines like maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks,” he said.Taking into account the sudden spike in the cases in the last few days, the state government has imposed night curfew in eight district headquarters, including Jaipur, from 8 pm to 6 am. However, those attending marriage functions are exempted from it. The official said the state government has also increased the penalty amount from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000 if more than 100 people gather in marriages and other events.“The district administration and police officials will be in the field to check any violation, and action as per the guidelines and government orders will be taken,” he said.Ravi Jindal, president of tent dealers association, said the number of wedding events may go up to 4,000 in Jaipur alone in the coming days.“The coronavirus pandemic has badly hit the business of the wedding industry, which directly and indirectly gives employment to over 10 lakh people in the state like tent dealers, florists, caterers, event planners, among others, and all of them are facing crisis,” he said.Jindal said due to the restriction on the number of people attending a wedding event, two to three marriage events are taking place at the same venue.Astrologer Ayush Bhardwaj said Dev Uthani Ekadashi is considered the most auspicious occasion for marriage, therefore, the maximum number of weddings will take place on this day.Other auspicious days for marriage in the month of November are November 27 and November 30, he said.Rajasthan recorded 19 more fatalities due to coronavirus on Tuesday, taking the Covid-19 death toll in the state to 2,200, according to a health department bulletin.The state also reported 3,314 fresh Covid-19 cases which mounted the infection tally to 2,50,482, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/3-000-weddings-slated-to-take-place-in-jaipur-in-nov-officials-fear-covid-surge/story-vC2tv96MiDdTKZCVuPgnmM.html
24-11-2020||Chandigarh||SDM chairs meeting to review condition of Ambala cemetery||The district administration on Tuesday swung into action to review the condition of the historic Ambala Christian Cemetery on Jagadhari Road, which is virtually in ruins due to neglect and feud between two parties for its control.Earlier on Monday, an archaeology department official visited the site to carry out observational tasks. The move followed reports by the Hindustan Times on the dilapidated state of the cemetery, and a letter shot off by Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan KJ Alphons to the Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar and principal secretary to the state government (archaeology and museums department) Ashok Khemka with a plea to save the burial ground. In Tuesday’s meeting, Ambala city sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Sachin Gupta spoke to officials concerned about repair and maintenance of the boundary wall, water drainage system and cleaning up of the heritage site.Gupta said the matter had come up before home minister Anil Vij and a report sought by higher authorities on the state protected site. “I’ve directed the executive officer of Ambala Sadar municipal council, Vinod Nehra, to prepare estimates for cleaning up of the ground. The SDO public works department Ritesh Goyal has been asked to check the water drainage system and prepare estimates necessary for the repairs of the cemetery,” Gupta said. On being asked about a letter written by the archaeology department in September on estimates for maintenance of the site, Gupta said, “Yes, the task has to be carried out by both the departments, which have been given a week. But usually the type of clearance the archaeology department carries out requires some specific contractors that are difficult to find.”Archaeology department official visits siteShubham Malik, technical assistant with the archaeology department and in-charge of the cemetery on Monday checked the illegal encroachments along the boundary wall, war graves and sewage water issues. Cemetery Committee officials said this was Malik’s second visit, the first one being in September after they requested the archaeology department for help . Banani Bhattacharyya, deputy director of the department had told HT last week that the department had already written a letter to the Ambala deputy commissioner to carry out scientific clearance at the site. “We took the initiative because the site is an urgent need of cleaning and this is the best season to carry out clearance. For this, we needed an estimate of the area and we’ve written to DC in this regard,” she had said. Under scientific clearance, cleaning or restoration process is carried out without causing damage to monuments (graves in this instance). Use of heavy machinery is avoided and most of the work is done manually. A few days earlier Father Patras Mundu, secretary and treasurer of the Ambala Cemetery Committee, had said the site was common property belonging to the Christian community. He had alleged that one Shaukatt Masih Bhatti had claimed the property.Bhatti had denied the charges and said he was the president of the cemetery .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sdm-chairs-meeting-to-review-condition-of-ambala-cemetery/story-pAUUF4n6FLVh3ZIlKUAEgN.html

While three bidders each came forward for the parking lots at Feroze Gandhi market, Bhadaur House and multi-storey parking near MC’s Zone A office; two bids were received for the BRS Nagar market parking and none for that at the Model Town extension market, primarily due to its low footfall.The parking lot at Sarabha Nagar Block-I market was auctioned for Rs 4.3 lakh on November 17.

24-11-2020||Mumbai||MLA Pratap Sarnaik’s properties raided: Sena, Cong, NCP term it vendetta; BJP says not ED action not politically motivated||Terming the searches carried out by Enforcement Directorate (ED) on the properties of Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik and detention of his son, Vihang, “political vendetta”, the party said Maharashtra legislators will not surrender to such pressure. The Sena’s allies – the Nationalist Congress Party and Congress –said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was now using Central agencies to disrupt the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. However, leader of the opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis dismissed any politically motivated action. Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the move was politically motivated. He dared the BJP to come out in the open to fight the Shiv Sena and “not hide behind Central agencies”. Also read: ED raids Shiv Sena lawmaker Pratap Sarnaik’s premises“If anybody thinks this government will come under pressure with the use of central agencies, they are living in a fool’s paradise. No matter what they use, be it the ED or CBI, our leaders and legislators will not surrender. Not just the next four years, but this government will last for the next 25 years. No matter how many notices you send, how many raids you conduct or false papers and evidence you create, the truth will prevail,” Raut said. He added, “The BJP should come out in the open and fight us and not use Central powers and agencies like ED and CBI as tools. The ED or any other agency should not work as a branch of a political party.” NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who got served a notice by ED in October 2019, called the use of agencies against political opponents inappropriate. He said the MVA government has the backing of the people and the BJP was using the ED to dislodge the government. “The MVA government has completed one year in power. The BJP has realised now that they cannot dislodge the government and hence they have been using the power they have as the ruling party at the national level. Instead of answering the questions raised by people, Central agencies are being used against political opponents, which is not appropriate,” he said. Maharashtra Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat echoed his allies’ thoughts. “No such action has been taken against any leader in BJP-led states. Leaders who have been taking a stand against the BJP are facing such actions. The ED action against Sarnaik is unfortunate and objectionable and taken to suppress the voice against the BJP,” he said. Also read: Raided by ED, TOPSGRUP denies link with Shiv Sena MLA Sarnaik, partyFadnavis, who was in Solapur, said, “The ED does not initiate any action unless it has solid evidence.

However, I can say that nobody should be scared of any such action if nothing wrong has been done.” Sarnaik later emerged at Sena mouthpiece Saamana office in Parel for the first time since the ED action began on Tuesday morning. He held an hour-long meeting with Raut at the office. Sarnaik refused to comment on the ED raid or the exact case in which his son Vihang was detained. Sarnaik is also said to have held a meeting with his lawyers on the case. “Let me find out what has happened. So far, we do not have any details,” he said. When the media persons outside Saamana asked his whereabouts since morning, he said, “I will speak later on all issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mla-pratap-sarnaik-s-properties-raided-sena-cong-ncp-term-it-vendetta-bjp-says-not-ed-action-not-politically-motivated/story-zfJemlF2BMuq6y3Kl922BL.html

DRI officials said they have observed a change in modus operandi adopted by the drug mules, from body concealment to meticulous baggage concealment, which throws newer challenges to law enforcement agencies. DRI officials said this was the second cocaine seizure within a week. Earlier, the agency had seized 502gm of cocaine which was shipped to India in a parcel and had arrested four persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/woman-carrying-rs6-crore-cocaine-arrested-at-mumbai-airport/story-D7HyZ8SJHqEKPmwsaxhmOL.html

On November 9, a girl had suffered serious head injury after her two-wheeler fell due to a pothole. Following this, residents took to the social media to slam the civic body for its apathy. A complaint regarding this was also filed with the chief minister’s office. As senior officials came to know about this, a show-cause notice was issued to the AE. Besides, the road was repaired twice, as the first job was not executed properly on Monday.“This is the fourth road repair for the pothole since November 9. In the first two instances, the pothole was filled with rubble and interlocking tiles. As that failed to solve the purpose, the road was repaired with hot-mix on Monday and again on Tuesday. Had the MC acted sooner, several accidents could have been averted,” said Jaskirat Singh, an area resident. MC commissioner Pradeep Sabharwal said, “Superintending engineers have been directed to repair potholes in their respective areas. The AE has been given three days to submit a reply to the show-cause notice.” Another AE gets noticeA show-cause notice has also been issued to assistant engineer Rakesh Singla for his failure to keep a check on the inferior road construction work being done by a contractor in Giaspura.

24-11-2020||Chandigarh||Navjot Singh Sidhu gets a lunch invite. It is from his ex-boss||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has invited former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu for lunch on Wednesday. “He & @sherryontopp are expected to discuss state & national politics over the luncheon meeting,” Amarinder’s media adviser Raveen Thukral tweeted. Amarinder Singh and Navjot Singh Sidhu are not on the best of terms ever since the latter exited the state council of ministers after being divested of the local government department last year, but there have been efforts lately from both leaders to break the ice. Earlier, Amarinder asked Sidhu to second the resolution in the state assembly against the Centre’s farm laws and then the latter also participated in a protest led by the chief minister in Delhi. All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and state in-charge Harish Rawat has been openly trying for a rapprochement between Amarinder and Sidhu and also been pushing for an important role for the cricketer-turned-politician. Though there is discontent in a section of the party over the importance being given by him to Sidhu, Rawat recently advised the state leaders to be more “flexible and accommodating” towards the former minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capt-amarinder-singh-invites-navjot-singh-sidhu-for-lunch-on-wednesday/story-ZkGihOfsjKiucSrrY7gX3O.html

The central probe agency raided 10 premises in Mumbai and Thane linked to Sarnaiks and the premises of the TOPSGRUP. The ED, according to officials, suspects that companies linked to Pratap Sarnaik and his sons have pumped money into TOPSGRUP’s Rahul Nanda’s businesses and wants to investigate possible money laundering. “If ED has carried out searches, the agency must have done it based on some complaints or material they possess. I do not know much about the case since I am touring the state. For those who have not made any mistake, they do not need to be scared,” said Fadnavis while speaking to reporters in Solapur where he was campaigning for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Sangram Deshmukh, ahead of the graduate constituency polls. Reacting to Sena MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut’s remarks that the action by ED is part of BJP’s vendetta politics and similar action can be taken against over 100 leaders from the BJP, Fadnavis said, “I challenge Sanjay Raut to please release list of 100 people. If there’s any substance, I will ask probe agency to initiate an investigation.” The former CM said that wherever there is action, Sena often cries foul. Following the ED action, Raut, without naming the BJP, said that the party should forget the dream of coming to power in Maharashtra for the next 25 years, “no matter how much pressure it exerts or spreads terror through agencies. If you have begun today, we know how to end it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ed-searches-at-sarnaik-s-home-fadnavis-says-agency-must-have-evidence/story-V7HqaJ7fJEoW1rfy7bkh4L.html

The car was found burnt on Humbran Road, 4km from his house, the police said, adding a search was on for the absconding accused. The victims were identified as the accused’s wife Sunita Sunda, 58, son Ashish Sunda, 35, daughter-in-law Garima Sunda, 32, and grandson Suchet, 12. Rajiv and his son Ashish were in the business of building construction and share trading. SUICIDE NOTE RECOVERED A suicide note was recovered from the house in which Rajiv Sunda claimed that he had taken the extreme step as his daughter-in-law used to threaten to implicate him in a fake dowry case. He said that the family members of his daughter-in-law had not returned money they had borrowed and were trying to extort more money by threatening him.ALSO READ: FAMILY KEPT TO THEMSELVES, QUARRELS WERE ROUTINE, SAY NEIGHBOURSPolice commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said a family dispute could have led to the murders but things would be clear once the accused is arrested. Garima’s brother Ashok Kumar found the bodies when he reached the house at 6.30am. He told the police that Suchet called him up around 6am, saying that his grandfather and grandmother were beating him and his father. When he reached the house, he found Rajiv Sunda driving his car out of the house. “I asked Rajiv about the matter but he in turn told me to wait and let him take the car out of the house. Instead of explaining anything, Rajiv sped away. I sensed something fishy and alerted neighbours before entering the house,” Ashok Kumar said. “On entering the house, we were shocked to find the bodies of Sunita, Ashish, Garima and Suchet. We immediately informed the police,” he said.

Minutes later, the police found the burnt car of Rajiv Sunda on the side of Humbran Road. It is suspected that he fled after torching the car. While escaping, he hit a scooterist also. The police are investigating if the family members were awake, why didn’t they resist or shout for help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-man-hacks-four-members-of-his-family-to-death-goes-missing/story-VymOhwSMcnUWbsLUunWtMM.html
24-11-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Four teams deployed to search for missing tigress in Rajaji Tiger Reserve||After not being able to sight a 20-year-old tigress for almost two months, Uttarakhand forest department has now deployed four teams on elephants to search for her. The tigress went missing from the western part of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve and has not been sighted or camera trapped in almost two months. The search operation started on Monday. Rajaji Tiger Reserve has only two tigresses in the western part and five tigers from Corbett are to be translocated to increase the population soon. Harak Singh Rawat, state forest minister, said, “I have been in talks with the chief wildlife warden and officials of the forest department to trace the tigress at the earliest. Teams have been deployed to find the tigress.” Also Read: To preserve alpine meadows in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh, no more overnight stays, bonfiresOfficials said that a tigress was recently sighted in Barkot range of Dehradun forest division, but they are not sure if this is the same one. DK Singh, director of Rajaji Tiger Reserve, said that the tigress has not been camera trapped since March“We have deployed teams on elephants in Motichur, Kansaro, Ramgarh and Barkot forest ranges to search for the tigress. It is a matter of concern that the tigress has not been camera trapped since almost March,. Her pug marks and other signs were visible to staff while patrolling, but for almost two months, those signs have also not been sighted,” said Singh. He added that a few days ago, pug marks similar to that of the big cat were seen in the Barkot range in Dehradun forest division so the officials are coordinating with them in the search operation. During the last tiger estimation, it was found that the reserve had 34 resident tigers, including 32 in its eastern part, which is spread across 150 sq km area and two in the western part, which covers 570 sq km. The eastern and the western part of the reserve are divided by a busy traffic corridor making it difficult for the tigers to migrate between the two parts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-four-teams-deployed-to-search-for-tigress-missing-from-rajaji-tiger-reserve/story-5M4dJ8b2MbV7dz3QDJjttJ.html
24-11-2020||Pune||BJP leaders protest in Pune, state against inflated power bills||The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) on Monday held an agitation in front of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Limited (MSEDCL) office in Rasta peth, Pune to protest against the inflated electricity bills. The agitation was part of state-wide protests held by the BJP against MSEDCL and the state government on Monday demanding a roll back of the bills. BJP city unit president Jagdish Mulik led the agitations in the city. According to Mulik, MSEDCL sent excess bills to citizens and due to the pandemic, they did not physically visit for recording a reading of the electricity meter. “Later, they sent excessive bills. Instead of waving off the electricity bills, the MSEDCL has charged excessive bills. The state government should waive off the bills or BJP will do more aggressive agitations,” Mulik said. Former Maharashtra energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule and other BJP leaders burnt electricity bills at Mahadula in Koradi area of Nagpur for not giving relief to consumers who complained of inflated power bills during the pandemic.BJP leaders staged protests in Mumbai, Nagpur, Pune, Satara, Ahmednagar and others parts of the state and said the party will not keep quiet until the inflated electricity bills are “corrected”.Earlier this month, state Energy Minister Nitin Raut hinted at a major relief to the consumers facing the issue of inflated power bills, saying a Diwali gift was in the offing.However, a few days back, the minister said the government will not be able to provide any relaxation in the inflated electricity bills and consumers will have to make full payment of the bills.“BJP workers are burning electricity bills at 2,000 spots across the state. If the government does not wake up from its sleep and pursues disconnection of power lines of consumers, the party workers will not allow it to happen,” Bawankule said.Later, BJP’s Nagpur unit workers raised slogans against the government and burnt electricity bills at various squares in the city.Bawankule last week demanded that those who consume up to 300 units of electricity daily should get a waiver from bill payment for the March to June period.He also said that people have lost jobs (due to lockdown) and several electricity consumers have received inflated bills. The government should correct these bills, they had demanded.Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, who led the protest at Karad in Satara district, said the party will not allow authorities to disconnect power supply of people in case bills are not paid.“We are burning inflated electricity bills as protest...the government should wake up soon or else, the anger will intensify,” Patil told reporters in Karad.He charged the state government with not waiving of consumption of power bills up to 100 units or not giving relief to people hit by Covid-19 despite talking about it.The BJP leader also claimed that a file pertaining to electricity bills correction was not sanctioned by deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar.The state energy department is with Congress leader Nitin Raut, while Pawar belongs to the NCP.Suggesting there are differences between the NCP and Congress, Patil asked, “Why should the common people suffer just because the department is with the Congress?” “We will not keep quiet until the inflated bills are corrected...we will not let the linemen cut power supply of the people.”Patil in a tweet claimed ministries that are with the Shiv Sena get funds, but the portfolios that are with the Congress are not given funds, and it shows the Congress does not have any worth in the state government.“The BJP will continue to fight until the state government provides necessary relief to consumers,” he added.In Mumbai, BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar led the party’s protest and he was detained along with other party men by police when they staged a protest in suburban Kandivali.Besides, former Maharashtra minister and BJP leader Ashish Shelar in a tweet accused the state government of looting people by issuing “exorbitant” bills.Shelar said the government is not giving any relief to the affected people, but is instead recovering bill dues “as money lenders”.“Are you running a government or are into money lending?” he asked with hashtag ‘MahaAghadiElectricityScam’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bjp-leaders-protest-in-pune-state-against-inflated-power-bills/story-n9uLLGZjGahtNb0IEyi2AJ.html
24-11-2020||Pune||PMC plans to increase entry fees for public gardens||In a bid to curb down the unwanted crowding at gardens and parks in the city, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has now decided to increase the entry fee for public gardens across the city. The proposal was given by the PMC’s garden department earlier this year in the month of January, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic it was put on hold. While unlock has begun in the state, gardens and parks will be the points where crowding will happen. “There are 191 parks in Pune city which are under the PMC’s garden department and of them 21 parks require an entry fee. In some of the parks the entry fee is very nominal as 50 paise or Rs 1 and in other parks it is between Rs 5 to 10. So to increase the revenue of PMC we had given the proposal to hike these entry fees in the month of January. Later due to Covid-19, it was put on hold and now it will be taken up in the standing committee meeting. Once it gets the approval from the standing committee, the hike will be done,” said Ashok Ghorpade, PMC’s garden department superintendent. In Pune there are a large number of citizens who go for a morning walk and also during the evening time for a walk to the gardens. There are senior citizens and laughter groups in these gardens which gather together daily. To avoid such type of gatherings in this crisis situation, increasing the entry fees will somewhat keep a tap on crowding at the gardens. While there are mix reactions from citizens on this entry fee hike, Ramesh Damale, a regular morning walker said, “Due to Covid-19 pandemic, going to the park for a daily morning walk has stopped now, but earlier I used to go daily at 6am to walk in the garden nearby. I have seen many unwanted people creating nuisance and damaging the public property inside these gardens. So increasing the daily entry fee to the gardens is a good step, to reduce the number of people.” Shantanu Shetty, a resident said, “It is not right to increase the entry fees in the garden, we are already paying tax to the PMC from which these gardens are being maintained. Now again hiking the entry fees in the Covid situation is not right, people come to the garden for walking, exercise and for mental peace. By making them pay a high entry fee daily will reduce the number of people coming to garden.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-plans-to-increase-entry-fees-for-public-gardens/story-3z7sq2iP7gKVC36mtJ50HI.html

Rai said that high pollution levels from stubble burning have also contributed to a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in the capital over the last 15 days. “The city’s pollution situation has been critical over the past several days. We need to find a permanent solution to this problem. We urge the CAQM to spray the bio-decomposer solution in the states of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan considering its success in Delhi,” the minister said. He added that the solution is cost-effective and has been provided to farmers free of cost. “The central government gives a subsidy to the farmers through which they can buy machines, but the farmers are also supposed to pay a major amount to buy them. This is why the farmers avoid buying these machines and start stubble burning. If all the states follow the Delhi government’s model, then the stubble can be taken care of in half the price which the central government spends for this initiative,” said Rai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/air-quality-management-commission-should-consider-using-bio-decomposer-for-stubble-delhi-environment-minister/story-dYF3QVTVShifZDgDmpVD8J.html

But farmers still have to spend a lot of money from their pocket which is why they resort to burning the crop residue.“In half the amount being spent on machines, government can get the biodecomposer sprayed in the neighbouring states without farmers having to spend anything,” he said.According to scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, the solution can turn crop residue into manure in 15-20 days and can prevent stubble burning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/air-quality-management-commission-should-consider-use-of-bio-decomposer-for-stubble-rai/story-V5OKukj6XFFqpiK80NBELP.html

Why only spas? What is so special about spas? You have opened everything else. Look at markets, restaurants, metros, buses, all are open and running full time.” It directed the Delhi government to indicate, in its affidavit, what was special about spas that they were not being allowed to open, when everything else was being permitted.During the hearing, the central government told the court that while it “has cleared the decks” for reopening spas, the final decision with regard to the same has been left to the Delhi government.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe court, thereafter, listed the matter for hearing on December 4.It was hearing a plea moved by several persons who run spas which have been shut since the first lockdown was enforced in Delhi.In their plea, filed through advocates Rajeshwar Dagar and Himanshu Dagar, the spa owners have contended that they have been trained as professional therapists under the National Skills Development Mission launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.They have further contended that when a maximum number of businesses, like salons, gyms, restaurants and bars, have been granted permission to reopen and even Delhi Metro has been restarted, then why not the spas.The petitioners have claimed that the spas in other states are running with full safety measures, but are not permitted in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/why-only-spas-not-allowed-to-resume-services-delhi-high-court-asks-aap-government/story-7xH5rFEpitPdNUHuk87RWL.html

They also questioned me about our trust in Mauritius, which again, we have answered and told them that this was created legally by lawyers and that there is ZERO money that is in the Mauritius trust. This was all the mischief played by Ramesh (Iyer), Amar (both top executives of his companies) and the coterie, who complained to the ED and have sent them on a wild goose chase. We have written and told them (authorities) that all fund transfers done in 2009 was done 100% legally with all requisite legal and RBI permissions.Also Read: Kalyan medics to strike work tomorrow after Shiv Sena corporator allegedly abuses doctorThe ED hasn’t yet clarified about the basis of their enforcement case information report (ECIR) which requires a predicate offense be first registered by any other law enforcement agency.

24-11-2020||Lifestyle||World Heritage Week: How heritage walkers took a detour||Intricate architecture of tombs, breakfast in the alleys of Old Delhi and endless stories about the Capital was something every Delhiwallah loved. But, Covid-19 and the guidelines made it difficult to organise heritage walks as before, forcing organisers to either take the virtual route or limit the number of participants. This World Heritage Week, that concludes on November 25, we decode how heritage walks have changed their path.  “Since the time pandemic started, everything is getting virtual, so are the walks and lectures on heritage.People are so keen that the number of lectures has increased. Earlier, we couldn’t invite people those were sitting far away, unless one arranged a flight ticket, but now with virtual means, they are also participating,’”says, heritage activist, Vikramjit Singh Rooprai, who feels conducting virtual sessions has helped bring people closer. Sahapedia, a non-profit organisation that organises heritage walks and festivals across India, has also gone digital. “We used to organise 20-30 heritage walks every month, but it wasn’t possible since the lockdown happened, so we started conducting digital walks. We organise online talks with our audiences, put up blogs and articles on heritage. For Cultural Heritage Week, we have put up trails on heritage that can be downloaded and watched,” says Ela Gupta from the organisation.However, DelhiByFoot Adventures is continuing with physical walks, albeit with smaller groups of people. . Ramit Mitra, co-founder, DelhiByFoot Adventures says, “We started conducting heritage walks from the second week of October. The way we organise it has changed and only 12 people are allowed to participate. All our batches are full and we are talking all the precautions and following guidelines, keeping safety as our priority.” And heritage lovers are keeping a close eye on the physical as well as virtual walks. Kanika Mittal who is pursuing Masters in History, says, “Virtual discussion on heritages and history is a blessing. I have participated in so many of them and they are absolutely amazing. And the participation of experts from various corners of the world makes it all the more worthy, and you don’t need to pay anything.”Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/world-heritage-week-how-heritage-walkers-took-a-detour-in-pandemic/story-jbOfl4JX0nSVDE1SN7SHuN.html

24-11-2020||Chandigarh||First passenger train reaches Amritsar after diversion as defiant farmers refuse to lift blockade||With a farmer faction refusing to lift the rail blockade in Amritsar district, the Golden Temple Mail, the first passenger train after resumption of services, had to be diverted via Tarn Taran station early on Tuesday. The train, which was scheduled to reach at 5.45am, arrived at 8.45am. The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) remained defiant and did not lift the protest from Jandiala Guru railway station, forcing the authorities to divert the train coming from Mumbai Central. It was diverted from Beas and reached Amritsar junction via Tarn Taran. The KMSC holds sway in the Majha region and has distanced itself from the decision of 30 farmer unions that met Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday and agreed to allow the movement of both passenger and goods trains in the state for 15 days. The KMSC is adamant that it will allow only goods trains to ply until the Centre revokes the three farm laws introduced to liberalise the farm sector. District administration and police officials met KMSC leaders in Amritsar on Monday night, urging them to allow passenger trains but in vain. The police did not use force to disperse the protesters. Around 4am, Amritsar deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira and Amritsar (rural) SSP Dhruv Dahyia reached the protest site and tried to persuade the activists to clear the track, but failed again. Of the 2,500 passengers who boarded the train, 427 were to disembark at Amritsar. First, the district administration planned to arrange buses to ferry the passengers from Beas railway station to Amritsar. Later, the officers along with the railways staff decided to divert its route via Goindwal Sahib and Tarn Taran. The train reached Amritsar at 8.45am on Tuesday. Activists of the KMSC, which is spearheading the rail roko protest at Jandiala Guru on the key Amritsar-Delhi rail route, were sitting outside the station but announced that they would again sit on the tracks to stop any passenger train.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/first-passenger-train-reaches-amritsar-after-diversion-as-defiant-farmers-refuse-to-lift-blockade/story-TjVx7FKI4XHF0WCp6ypozO.html

We know your grievances. The people who are coming via trains are also the people of Punjab, you must think of them and should stop the blockade,” Khaira told farmers, according to ANI.Farmers were adamant that they shall not allow passenger trains to operate until the farm bills were not withdrawn. They have blocked railway tracks in the state since September protesting the central government’s farm bill passage. They are protesting against the newly-passed laws under the banner of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee.Farmers’ organisations, the Punjab government and the ministry of railways have had several discussions on this issue.

At least 10 members had come to attend the meeting.Later, the members met the V-C at his office and expressed resentment over the treatment meted out to them. Heated arguments were reportedly exchanged. Syndics also urged the V-C to call the meeting of the body to clear pending issues.The development comes days after a protest rally was organised on the campus demanding immediate conducting of senate polls. On Monday, the syndicate members left the V-C office without any assurances on their demands. Although the V-C had called an emergency meeting of the syndicate twice in September, the members refused to attend the same and instead demanded that a physical meeting be held.As the term of the PU senate ended on October 31, syndicate remains the highest body of the university. Ever since the senate elections of PU were postponed on August 15, the syndicate members have been pressing the V-C to call a meeting and report the matter to the body.Syndicate member Rabindra Nath Sharma said, “These things have never happened in the history of this university. The V-C does not bother about the sanctity and authority of the executive body of PU.”“It is shameful that the elected representatives are regularly requesting the vice-chancellor to call a meeting, and he simply gives excuses,” said syndicate member HS Dua.While speaking to the syndicate members, the V-C said, “The meeting may be called when the situation improves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-v-c-gives-cold-shoulder-to-agitating-syndics-meeting-halls-closed-members-leave-without-assurance/story-RqKxU33CEMtUsiz5nuypRP.html

24-11-2020||Kolkata||Food for Shah’s lunch with tribal family was prepared by Brahmin cook: Mamata Banerjee||Terming Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s recent visit to a tribal family in West Bengal’s Bankura, a “show-off”, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday alleged that the lunch he had there was prepared somewhere else by a “Brahmin cook”.Also alleging that the home minister didn’t even know how tribal freedom fighter Birsa Munda looked like as he garlanded a wrong statue of him there, the chief minister announced that the state government would declare holiday on Munda’s birth anniversary on November 15.Addressing a state government event in Khatra area of tribal-dominated Bankura district, Banerjee hit out at Shah, saying a few days ago he visited Bengal for show-off. “Dikhane ke liye kuch din pahle mannaniya grih mantri Amit Shah aaye the. Unhone ek Dalit familly ke yahan khana khaya tha (Shan came here and had lunch at a Dalit home for show-off),” she said in Hindi, alleging “the food was brought from outside and cooked by a Brahmin.” Also Watch | How RSS adjusted to Vajpayee-Kaul partnership | On The Record“There were visuals that the Dalit family was cutting cabbage and coriander, but none of these was seen (on his plate). He had eaten Basmati rice, posta bora (poppy seed fritters),” she said, adding after having lunch he went away. “There was a child suffering from Thalassemia or some disease whom he didn’t meet”.During a two-day visit to West Bengal earlier this month, Shah met the family in Chaturthi village of Bankura and had food with them on November 5.Banerjee added that Shah even garlanded a statue of a hunter, thinking it to be that of tribal freedom fight fighter Munda.“Shah had garlanded a statue thinking it to be of Birsa Munda... Later, it was known that it was of a hunter. But my Ma, Mati, Manus (TMC slogan) workers will ensure that Birsa Munda’s statute is installed here. In fact, the state government will announce holiday on Birsa Munda’s anniversary from next year. It will be updated in the state’s holiday list,” she said.Also accusing the BJP of defaming her Trinamool Congress (TMC) for one per cent wrong people, she said 99 per cent of them are good. “They defame us for just one per cent wrong men in TMC that too those who came from the CPI(M).”She also took on the Centre for the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, from which potatoes and onions have been excluded. Referring to the Centre as “aaloo ki sarkar (Government of potatoes), Banerjee alleged that it is ensuring that “you can’t even eat a meal of rice and potatoes”. But, she said, the state government would extend the free foodgrain scheme beyond June 2021, earlier announced, as she was confident of “forming the government after next Assembly polls”.She also asked the people not to vote for the BJP as the central government was giving the financial benefits to the poor from their money only.

24-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The Nehru Park connection||Pathways go up and down the many slopes. Distractions include flowers and fountains, lovers and joggers, chai wallas and chips sellers. Nehru Park runs along a tiny patch of the Aravali range of hills, so ancient that they are even older than the Himalayas. No surprises than the landscape is punctuated with rocks, some of which must be thousands and thousands of years old.So forty years is absolutely nothing in time for this park. Yet that short period does count for something in the case of Bhag Bahri Malhotra. In her late 80s, the lady has been enjoying morning walks in this central Delhi garden for those many years. She would come with her husband, and continued to do after he passed away in 2016. “In Nehru Park, my heart feels lighter,” she says, talking on WhatsApp video from the isolation of her residence in Safdarjung Enclave. Because the coronavirus infection can be fatal to the elderly, her son and daughter-in-law are extremely cautious about her outing, and Ms Malhota hasn’t been visiting her beloved hangout since the pandemic hit our part of the world. She’s always happy to dwell upon her extensive private history with the park, though.“Bahri Saab (her husband) and I would walk every morning in the park from 7 to 8,” she recalls. Ms Malhotra affectionately peppers each sentence with “bacche”, or child. Over those garden strolls, she says, she and her husband had gradually befriended other park lovers who would be there around the same time. “We had a whole group... after our walks, we would all sit down on the grass to have chai and gupshup (small talk), and we would also celebrate our anniversaries and birthdays.” Sometimes, they all would have an impromptu breakfast of kachori, halwa and aloo subzi ordered from Chandni Chowk.The ritual lasted for years until “we grew old.... some of us left for Ishwar (God)...”Ms Malhorta would still go, accompanied by her longtime attendant, Ravi, who would walk by her side with a bottle of water. “All the gardeners know me. They give me izzat (respect).”Here she pauses, before admitting that “ I no longer see purane log (old timers) in the park... but sometimes I see children of old friends who have now grown up.”A day after this chat, Ms Malhotra texted, saying she finally went for a walk in Nehru Park — the first one since the lockdown started, in March. She also Whatsapped an earlier picture of her in the garden, posing with a smile and flowers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-nehru-park-connection/story-DVqNTJeArgO5YoR3kI6SxH.html
24-11-2020||City||Punjab Police file revision plea seeking open-ended arrest warrant against gangster in 2014 weapon smuggling case||The Punjab Police’s organised crime control unit (OCCU) has filed a revision petition seeking open-ended non-bailable arrest warrant against gangster Ranjit Singh Dupla, the main accused in the 2014 inter-state illegal foreign-made weapons smuggling case. An open-ended non-bailable warrant, which does not have a time limit for execution, would help the OCCU get red-corner notice (RCN) issued by Interpol against Dupla who is believed to be in the United States. On October 29, the court of judicial magistrate Suresh Kumar had dismissed the OCCU’s plea demanding open-ended non-bailable arrest warrants against Dupla. Now, the OCCU has filed a review petition in the court of additional sessions judge Harbans Singh Lekhi who has summoned the lower court records on the next hearing on December 1. Dupla had fled the country soon after he got bail in the case. He was facing more than 18 criminal cases, including kidnapping, attempt to murder, robbery, snatching, and contract killing. He was a declared proclaimed offender by a Faridkot court in December 2017. The red corner notices are issued by the Interpol on the request of a member country to prohibit the movement and subsequent hand over an accused from across the globe. In October 2014, a case was registered against Dupla and others for illegal trafficking of foreign-made weapons and indulging in supply of weapons to gangsters and civilians by forging sale bills. Three accused were arrested on October 21, 2014, which led to the recovery of weapons from different individuals, including some gun house owners. In 2015, the police filed two chargesheets in the court against eight accused, including Dupla, and charges were framed against them in that year only. In August this year, the OCCU arrested Satish Kumar, gun house owner and Moga-based car dealer Pankaj Bansal for buying illegal weapons and forging sales bills. The unit had also named Ferozepur’s Bhupinder Singh, New Delhi-based Amit Goyal and Rohit Chhabra of Kotkapura as accused in the FIR. It added Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the FIR later. On October 20, the OCCU filed a chargesheet against Bansal and Satish. In 2015, the police had given a clean chit to six persons, including Satish and Bansal, claiming that Dupla and others passed the weapons as genuine in connivance with the arms dealers and the buyers did not know the genuineness of the weapons. Now, the OCCU claims they purchased the illegal weapons using forged documents knowingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-police-file-revision-plea-seeking-open-ended-arrest-warrant-against-gangster-in-2014-weapon-smuggling-case/story-LL49fLpF6Zq5uy6BW5XPdJ.html

The department will issue within a week show-cause notices to these colleges as why their affiliation should not be cancelled. Besides, a three-member committee was formed on Monday to look into their response. The institutions are Vinayaka College of Pharmacy, Lehragaga; Arya Bhatta Institute of Pharmacy, Sangrur; Modern College of Pharmacy, Vidya Sagar Paramedica Institute, Leharagaga; Maharaja Aggarsain Institute of Pharmacy, Lehargaga; Lord Krishna College of Pharmacy, Lehragaga; and Krishna College of Pharmacy Lehragaga.Technical education minister Charanjit Singh Channi said anybody found indulged in a cheating scam will not be spared and strict action will be taken against the institutes concerned. “Orders have also been issued to charge-sheet Government Polytechnic College Bareta, principal Navneet Walia, who was flying squad in-charge, and section officer Anil Kumar,” a press statement stated. The matter came to light after a video of copying in the examination centres went viral on social media. Principal secretary (technical education) Anurag Verma said a detailed report was sought from secretary (technical education and industrial training board) and the principal of Government Polytechnic College (Girls), Patiala, where papers of the seven colleges were sent for evaluation.“During investigation, it was found that the answer sheets of nearly all the students who appeared in the offline examination matched verbatim. Also, sheets of some students who appeared in the online examination also matched to some extent,” Verma added. The technical education board officials have been directed to issue show-cause notices to the seven colleges in a week to cancel their affiliation. The reply will be examined by the director (technical education and industrial training department), the secretary (technical education board) and the Punjab state technical education board (convener) registrar, he said.“The examination held at these colleges will also be cancelled. Directions have been issued to hold reexamination of the students. During the reexamination, the invigilating staff will be deputed from government ITIs and examination centres will also be set up at government polytechnic colleges/ITIs. CCTV cameras will be installed in examination centres,” Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/7-sangrur-pharmacy-colleges-indulged-in-mass-copying-says-probe-report/story-hCIaDv1dkX5bSve17tEDOL.html
24-11-2020||Chandigarh||Shipping of grains out of Punjab godowns starts today||With the railways resuming freight and passenger services in Punjab after nearly a two-month hiatus, the authorities concerned will start shipping foodgrains in goods trains from the godowns to other states. At least 35 rakes (freight trains) are likely to reach various storage points to transport at least 1 lakh tonne wheat and paddy on the first day, it is learnt. The railway had board imposed restrictions on the movement of goods trains in the state on October 7, after the farmers protesting against the Central agriculture laws blocked the passenger trains. The railways, however, insisted on running both passengers and freight trains simultaneously. In a meeting with Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday, the majority of farmer unions agreed to allow goods trains as well. “We hope to get 31 rakes of rice and 4 of wheat tomorrow, requirement of which was placed today. These rakes will be loaded and dispatched on Tuesday. We hope that things will fall in place as the pile-up of grains will be reduced. The state department is in touch with the Container Corporation of India, a subsidiary of the railways, for the movement of the grains,” said director (food and civil supplies) Anindita Mitra. 35 lakh tonnes held up due to restrictions Due to the restrictions on freight trains, the state could not ship at least 35 lakh tonne grains — 19 lakh tonne rice and 16 lakh tonne wheat — to other states. Punjab could have recouped about Rs 10,000 crore against the cash credit limit (CCL) received in the past for the procurement of grains if the stock had been delivered. The state government was forced to pay a monthly interest of Rs 75 crore for holding the stock. Over 190 lakh tonne rice and wheat is stored in the state’s godowns. This includes 110 lakh tonne wheat of four state agencies and 25 lakh tonne of the Food Corporation of India (FCI). Another 55 lakh tonne rice of FCI is also in the godowns. 3 goods trains to bring gunny bags Nearly 90,000 bales of gunny bags are expected to reach the state by Tuesday. Each bale comprises 500 gunny bags. One rake each will reach the dry ports at Dappar, Ahmedgarh and Phillaur for unloading, Mitra said. The state agriculture department has asked for at least 100 rakes of urea from manufacturing companies such as Chambal Fertilizers, IPL, Kribhco and NFL. “We are falling short of 5 lakh tonne of urea as we have a stock of 3 lakh tonne available. The agriculture department has asked the urea manufacturing companies to increase the supply,” said chief inspector fertiliser Gurjeet Singh Brar. “Over 60% wheat crop has already been sown. Once the fertiliser stocks arrive, our role is to ensure an early distribution to the agricultural societies and farmer groups,” he added. 1 coal rake arrives at Talwandi Sabo Plant A rake of coal reached the Vedanta-owned thermal power plant in Talwandi Sabo on Monday. “We would get one 640 megawatt unit in the thermal plant synchronised by Tuesday,” said a director-level functionary of the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). Coal supply for other thermal plants is expected to arrive by Tuesday, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/shipping-of-grains-out-of-punjab-godowns-starts-today/story-d8mUKYtRGltOsW2Z6AtrmM.html

The minister, who was in Ambala, said there have been some vested interests behind it (protests). “Farmers would benefit from these agricultural laws which will bring new revolution in the sector,” he said while addressing reporters at the residence of Ambala City MLA Aseem Goel. On the ongoing speculations over ‘anti-conversion’ law, he said that the government has to do something when so many such cases come up. “I object to the statement by Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot that marriages are personal affairs and there is no need for such laws. I understand this, but why there should be a need that a bride is bound to change her maiden name and religion after marriage. Society and governments have to come forward if such cases keep on surging,” he added. Earlier, he inaugurated a newly erected statue of Prithvi Raj Chauhan near Ambala Central Jail.

A number of premis or followers have gathered at Salabatpura, where the body has been kept in the middle of the road, and dera leaders are raising the issue of targeted killings of sect members and delayed police probes,” said an official source.Sources said Gupta directed the local police to enhance the use of forensic and cyber investigation to identify the culprits.Though Gupta refrained from briefing the media, sources said Bathinda police gave a detailed presentation on various leads in the case.Police officials admit that there had been pressure after a gangster, Sukhpreet Singh alias Sukha Gill Lamme, claimed responsibility for the attack through a Facebook post on Saturday.“The Facebook post, in Punjabi, claimed that the crime was committed by Rajinder and Aman to avenge the sacrilege incidents of 2015. A couple of other posts from the gangster’s social media page resulted in a social media frenzy following which the page was pulled down on Sunday evening,” said sources.Meanwhile, the dera followers said they would cremate the body only after the accused are caught.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk said police investigation is on and the culprits will be held soon.“We will hold another round of talks with the dera followers on Tuesday to convince them to end the traffic blockade,” said Virk.Meanwhile, the DGP also took stock of the law and order situation from the police authorities in south Malwa region, ahead of the Punjab farmer unions’ movement towards Delhi for the agitation on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dera-follower-s-murder-punjab-dgp-rushes-to-bathinda-to-review-probe/story-zBhBzRsO3VxoVWbYam5ZKI.html
24-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chautalas can’t use Sirsa farmhouse for marriage, rules HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday allowed the enforcement directorate’s (ED’s) plea against de-sealing the Dabwali farmhouse of former Haryana chief minister and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Om Prakash Chautala for the wedding of his grandsons in November end. This is the second round of litigation between ED and Chautalas on this issue. The appellate tribunal, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Delhi, had on November 18 allowed Chautalas to use the farmhouse. Tribunal had acted after November 17 order of high court in which it was asked to pass a fresh order on the plea of Chautalas. “The high court has allowed ED’s appeal against tribunal order. Detailed order is awaited,” ED’s counsel Arvind Moudgil said. On November 18, the tribunal had allowed Chautalas to use the farmhouse from November 23 to December 7, reiterating its November 6 order overturned by high court on November 17. The tribunal order had come on the plea of Om Prakash Chautala, who had sought permission to use the farmhouse at Tejakhera village for the wedding of his two grandsons on November 27 and 30. The farmhouse has been sealed by the ED in ongoing probe against Om Prakash Chautala on allegations of money laundering. The ED had told the high court that there is no provision in the PMLA to de-seal an attached property connected with the proceeds of crime, even temporarily. In case it is allowed, it would set a wrong precedent that would be exploited by the accused to enjoy the proceeds of crime till the decision is rendered by the appellate tribunal, the ED argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chautalas-can-t-use-sirsa-farmhouse-for-marriage-rules-hc/story-RoEz7QksjKwRejMmrlh9cJ.html

24-11-2020||Chandigarh||J&K DDC polls: BJP banking on campaigning by national leaders||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is relying on the campaigning of its national leaders to boost the image of local candidates in Jammu and Kashmir’s district development council (DDC) polls, especially in Kashmir, while other parties have kept their campaigns a low-key affair.So far, six national leaders have visited different parts of the Valley to seek votes for BJP candidates. The BJP is the only party that is vigorously campaigning for the DDC polls, while other political parties, especially the newly formed Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), have left the campaigning to the second-rung leadership.At present, BJP national spokesperson Syed Shahnawaz Hussain is visiting Kashmir. He went to south Kashmir’s Anantnag to campaign for the DDC polls. Last week, Mukthair Abas Naqvi addressed a rally in Kupwara, in which he lambasted the PAGD leadership for giving ‘false hopes’ to the people of the UT.Union MoS for social justice and empowerment, Krishan Pal Gurjar visited Shopian, Pahalgam and Budgam areas and sought votes for the BJP. Tarun Chug BJP central in-charge for J&K and Ashish Sood BJP leader from Delhi also visited Kashmir.Syed Zaffar Islam, Rajya Sabha MP and BJP leader also arrived in Kashmir for the poll campaign. BJP state spokesperson Altaf Thakur said that BJP had brought national leaders for campaigning as they were going to emerge victorious . “It was due to strength of the BJP that all other parties joined hands, including Congress.” Thakur, who is himself contesting DDC polls from Tra, said in the coming days more national leaders will be coming to Kashmir and Jammu regions.The DDC polls for 280 seats will be held in eight phases starting from November 28 and will come to end on December 19.Congress, another national party, is completely relying on its local leadership. J&K Pradesh Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said the party had full faith on the local leadership. “Our local leaders are campaigning for the candidates and our position is strong in both provinces of J&K. We are not part of any alliance but have tactical understanding with candidates at the local-level.”The DDC polls are the first political test for Apni Party, which is being led by former minister, Altaf Bukhari. The party has many former ministers and former legislator as its members and the new party, which was formed in March is completely relying on the former legislators to make its impact felt. Many opposition parties blame the Apni Party for working on the behest of BJP.PAGD, which comprises six regional, parties have kept their campaigning a very low key affair, however, they are relying on the vast network of party cadres spread across J&K. “All the parties that are part of PAGD have a strong cadre-base, which is a threat to BJP and its allies. If elections are free and fair PAGD candidates will win maximum seats in J&K,” said a top PAGD leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-ddc-polls-bjp-banking-on-campaigning-by-national-leaders/story-b79o1WDb2b5CxVq0p6VYIM.html

They said Yuvkaran Singh Dhillon committed the crime as he was allegedly being blackmailed by the girl and her family. Charanjit Singh Khokhar, 56, his wife Jaswinder Kaur, 49, and Simran Kaur, 20 were found shot dead at their house at Bathinda’s Kamla Nehru Colony in the morning. A milk vendor informed police after finding Khokhar, secretary at state cooperative department, wife and daughter lying in a pool of blood. The bodies were lying in the lobby on the ground floor. Superintendent of Police Jaspal Singh said the three victims suffered bullet injuries in head. There was no attempt to rob the house, the SP said. During spot inspection, the police found Simran’s mobile phone and noticed frequent calls and from one particular phone number. “Prompt forensic investigation found that the phone number in question belonged to Dhillon of Mansa Khurd village in the district. As the mobile location of Dhillon was also found at the crime location, our team rushed to locate Dhillon. It was found that the suspect ended his life late last night by shooting at his home. But the family performed last rites this morning without informing the police,” senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk said. He said during scanning of Dhillon’s mobile phone, a video clip was spotted where he shared details of the circumstances that led him to kill the three. Police said Dhillon shot the video in his car while driving back to the village after the triple murder.A preliminary investigation said Khokhar and his family were killed at around 9 pm on Sunday, said the SSP. “In the video message, Dhillon talked about his long relation with Simran and the subsequent breakup. The video message claimed that the girl had in possession photographs of their intimate moments. In the video clip, the accused further alleged that Simran and her parents were forcing him for the last several months to marry her or threatened to lodge a rape case against him on the basis of their old photos,” said the SSP. Dhillon also said he used his cousin’s licensed arm to commit the crime. Virk said no other criminal angle is suspected and the probe is being completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bathinda-man-shoots-ex-girlfriend-her-parents-dead-before-killing-self/story-NED7vu81GQju4VPtwRMDZK.html

I will not raise any flag other than that flag of J&K.”The petitioner said through this statement she intended to show that Jammu and Kashmir is not a part of Indian territory and stands as a separate entity of its own.“Besides, through this statement, she has disrespected and insulted the Indian flag and has shown indignity to the Indian National flag before the national media,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/plea-in-delhi-hc-seeks-fir-against-mehbooba-mufti-over-flag-remark/story-J6JwNXPtAZQwsevWUoNAaJ.html

24-11-2020||Chandigarh||Roshni land scam: J&K admn set to post list of beneficiaries on govt website||Pursuant to the high court’s directions regarding the ₹25,000 crore Roshni land scam, the Jammu and Kashmir administration is all set to post the names of beneficiaries, which include influential people including politicians, on the government website, as per an official privy to the development.HT has a list of around 20 influential people, who allegedly benefitted from the Roshni Act. They include former ministers and their family members, who are and were associated with PDP, Congress and NC, prominent hotelier from Kashmir, a former bureaucrat and his wife, a former banker from J&K Bank, a former Congress minister from Doda and a former NC minister from Kishtwar. The administration is already working on cancelling all mutations of land transferred under the ‘unconstitutional’ Roshni Act across the UT. A top administrative official said, “Over the last 30 to 40 years, many people have usurped government and forest land through different means in Jammu and Kashmir. This has been done by enacting laws to regularise lands encroached upon by rich, wealthy and influential people or illegally through brazen encroachment of public land.”In 2001, the Jammu and Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001, was passed to provide ownership of state lands to the people who were occupying such lands. “Under its garb, hundreds of acres of valuable forest and state land across Jammu and Kashmir has been illegally occupied, usurped and encroached upon by politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats and judicial functionaries,” he said. Roshni Act was introduced in the budget speech of 2000 by then finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather of the National Conference. In the 2005, the PDP government-led by Mufti Mohammed Syed relaxed the cut off year to 2004. The Congress government led by Ghulam Nabi Azad, further relaxed the cut off year to 2007. “The working of the Roshni Act was effected arbitrarily, dishonestly and illegally. There exist glaring instances of state lands being usurped,” said the official. “A major highlight of the scam was that in 2007, rules were framed under the said Act whereby agricultural land was given away almost free of cost and urban land was given away at discounted prices in the name of rewards, rebates and incentives. Further, the rules allowed usage of agricultural and forest lands for commercial activities, which is against statutory provisions,” he added. A 2014 report by the comptroller and auditor general found that only ₹76 crore had been realised from the transfer of encroached land between 2007 and 2013, against the targeted ₹25,000 crore. On November 28, 2018, the then governor Satya Pal Malik had repealed the flawed Act: “Persons in position, power and those with financial resources including bureaucrats, government officials, ministers, legislators, police personnel, business persons etc., have influenced the completely illegal vesting of state lands,” he had said. “Following the high court order, revenue department officials have been cancelling mutation orders under the Roshni Act. Consequently, a list of 15,000 beneficiaries is being uploaded on the official and the National Informatics Centre (NIC) website after due step-by-step vetting ,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roshni-land-scam-j-k-admn-set-to-post-list-of-beneficiaries-on-govt-website/story-d4JjNxMZ9rkGHY6SWsQp0I.html
24-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: 55-year-old woman dies as public toilet’s wall collapses in Kurla||A 55-year-old woman died as the wall of a public toilet in Kurla collapsed on Monday around 7am, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s disaster management cell said. The woman’s leg got stuck under the wall, and she was taken to Rajawadi Hospital around 9.30am. However, she was declared dead around 10.30am. BMC officials said the civic body will investigate who can be held responsible for the collapse.According to BMC officials, they were undertaking work of toilet augmentation at the toilet block where the incident took place. Of the total 12 toilet seats, six were demolished last week, and the remaining six were to be demolished this week. However, residents of the surrounding area continued to use it despite the ongoing demolition work.Manish Valanju, assistant municipal commissioner of L ward, which covers Kurla, said, “We are going to investigate why the wall collapsed and if there was negligence. However, primary information is that residents had opposed the demolition of six of the 12 toilets and continued to use it. We are investigating the issue.”Under BMC’s 2018 project, public toilets across 24 administrative wards are being reconstructed to accommodate additional toilet seats. Also, initial reports of structural audit of nearly 1,000 public toilets across the city in 2018 had revealed that more than 50% of them are in dilapidated condition and need reconstruction, major and minor repairs.Chirag Nimkar, a resident, said, “It is very easy for BMC to ask us to not use the toilet. But in reality, it is very difficult for us to go to a different area at times considering the distance. It is very easy to say that we should use toilets from nearby areas, but BMC should arrange mobile toilets to ensure these types of incidents are not repeated.”Meanwhile, local BJP corporator Harish Bhandirge has demanded monetary compensation from BMC for the victim’s family. Bhandirge said, “BMC had displayed a board outside the toilet to not use it considering demolition work was scheduled for the same. However, residents continued using it. I am demanding that BMC give monetary compensation to the family of the lady whose two children are to be looked after.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-55-year-old-woman-dies-as-public-toilet-s-wall-collapses-in-kurla/story-7ev0NcQi3VCR9NjF2GdEqM.html

The committee modified the plan and drawings prepared by a consultant to ensure that the new market did not have the same bottlenecks as the old grain and vegetable market in Sector 26. Funds will be allocated for the market once all plans are finalised. The administration has suggested some changes to the urban planning department in the plan submitted by the consultant, an official said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Apart from this, the department has also been made aware of the requirement of the committee for the new market. In the first plan, there were some deficiencies in traffic management, which had been rectified, he added. In August 2015, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed the UT administration to start the mandi work. Though the administration in its affidavit to the court had said that the market would open in Sector 39 by March 31, 2016, things could not be finalised on time. Only one shed and five toilet blocks have been built in the market so far. In its plan, the administration had decided to get the market committee office, Kisan Seva Kendra, cold storage, office block built for commission agents here.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ut-urban-planning-dept-to-take-final-call-soon-on-sector-39-mandi/story-NwexKUp2a7PpEbaqkPZIdM.html

Of the 2,874 selected, 71.6% were from the general category; 1.6% were from the ST category; 7.5% were from the SC category; and 19.2% were from the OBC category. Of the total applications received in the five years, only 1.8% were from candidates from ST category; 10.7% from SC category and 21.8% from OBC category. This information was disclosed in response to an RTI application filed by an IIT-B student in association with the Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle (APPSC), a student organisation at the institute. HT has a copy of the RTI response. The government of India’s (GoI) norms require 10% of all seats to be reserved for students from economically weaker sections; 27% for OBC students; 15% for SC students; 7.5% for ST students; and 5% for students with physically disabilities. Data from IIT-B shows only one department admitted more than 10 ST students between 2015 and 2019. Eleven departments admitted more than 10 SC students in five years and 14 departments admitted more than 10 OBC students. Dean of academic programmes Amitava De said the institute followed all the reservation norms in letter and spirit; and only candidates who clear the cut-offs set by each department are admitted to PhD programmes. “Over and above the eligibility criteria, candidates are required to qualify through a test and/ or interview …The cut-offs for each birth category is fixed as per the GoI norms. To be eligible for the final admission offer, a candidate must score marks above the set cut-off mark,” said De, adding that the admission committee of each academic unit checks and monitors the admission process to check for biases.In a statement, APPSC said, “The institute has not yet clarified what are the guidelines devised by the GoI in the case of cut-off marks for admission. The reservation policy has itself been introduced in IITs only much later than it was in other institutions. The cut-off marks function in addition to the basic eligibility criteria, which is almost a deterrent for ST, SC, and OBC students from joining the institute at all. A systemic practice of exclusion is happening across all IITs… We strongly demand the removal of this additional cut-off and the following of the reservation policy in its true spirit.”At IIT-B, PhD admissions are held twice a year for all 12 positions including teaching assistantship and research assistantship. De said that an advertisement for admissions is placed on the institute’s website and candidates have to apply online. “Candidates are selected based on prior academic records, test and/or interview,” said De. Of the total number of candidates who applied to the PhD programmes in the five-year period, only 3.5% were successful in securing admission. De said the number of applications from SC, ST and OBC categories were lower than from the general category. Of the 54,021 general category candidates who applied, 3.8% were admitted while 2.4% of SC applicants were admitted. For ST and OBC candidates, the conversion rate is 3.1%.For instance, the mathematics department of IIT-B received 43 applications from ST candidates between 2015 and 2019, but none were selected. Of the 220 applications the department received from SC candidates, only seven were selected in the same period. Of the 607 OBC applicants, 19 made it through.Former chairperson of University Grants Commission and author of Blocked By Caste: Economic Discrimination and Social Exclusion in Modern India, said, “Initially, the number of applicants from reserved categories in higher education institutes were few. However, the situation has improved now with more applications coming in. While the lack of representation has to be understood in the context of the number of applications, the lack of representation at IIT-B is concerning, irrespective of the reasons.”APPSC alleged IIT-B has not followed the ministry of education norms for vacant seats. “Rules mandate that if the institute fails to implement the stipulated reservation for a year, it has to re-advertise the seats, call for admissions again, and carry forward those seats into the subsequent year. IIT-B should explain why they haven’t been following any of these mechanisms, despite seats being left vacant,” said APPSC.On the subject of biases, De said students can approach the SC/ST cell with complaints, but students said it was not easy to report biases. APPSC said in its statement that the SC/ST cell has been ineffective. “The caste bias at IIT-B is both systemic and subtle. The data clearly shows that very few from reserved categories are admitted. Casual remarks are passed by professors and colleagues that our admissions are not based on merit. There is an insinuation that we should drop out midway,” said a research scholar at IIT-B who is from the SC community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-phd-scholar-from-st-category-in-11-of-26-departments-at-iit-bombay-between-2015-and-2019-rti-data/story-Fg2qRn6uyQtNDBdKoZp43K.html
24-11-2020||Chandigarh||With the groom in a wheelchair, this is a story of true love||It was a moving moment for everyone gathered at a wedding here when the groom, Rahul Singh Diwakar, started taking the pheras around the holy fire in his wheelchair, with his bride Anamika Bhartiya, resplendent in red, following him.The wedding of Diwakar, a quadriplegic, and Anamika, who has no disabilities, in the city on Monday, was one chapter in a journey of love triumphing over trauma.Both 29, they had known each other since 2000 from the age of nine, when they were neighbours in Fatehgarh, Uttar Pradesh. When disaster struckIn 2008 they realised they had feelings for each other and things were going well when, some years later, disaster struck. “I used to meet Anamika every day, but on that day, March 13, 2016, I was in a hurry as I was going for a competitive examination and didn’t get to see her. I was riding pillion on a friend’s motorcycle when it slipped and I fell, injuring my back,” said Diwakar.When friends took him to hospital, he realised he has lost the use of his limbs.With tears in his eyes, he said, “Anamika did not once let me feel I was disabled when my lower half was completely paralysed.”She took care of him during the day when his father, an Army officer, and mother and sister, both teachers, were at work.Even when Diwakar and his family moved to Lucknow in 2018, “distance could not part us, and I used to talk to Rahul for seven to eight hours on the phone daily as he was very depressed and I tried to keep his spirits high,” recalled Bhartiya. Soon she realised she had to make a big decision. “I went to Lucknow without telling relatives at home and tried to convince Rahul’s family to let me marry him, but they didn’t agree. I went again last year but for his father it was a firm no”, said Bhartiya. Later, with much convincing, however, his family agreed.About Diwakar’s disability, her response is: “What if he had suffered the injury after our marriage? Would I have left him then?”A bigger familyToday, Bhartiya, after marrying Diwakar, is part of a bigger family as she lost her mother six years ago to bone cancer and her father some years later to brain haemorrhage.Interestingly, it was the Chandigarh Spinal Rehab Centre that hosted the wedding and took care of all expenses.“Rahul came to Chandigarh in September for treatment when he got to know about the centre through the internet,” said Nicky P Kaur, founder and CEO of the centre.A BTech who has been hired by an MNC, Diwakar is undergoing training there. “I wanted to make sure their wedding is as grand as the one I organised for my own children and we have allocated a furnished room for them, where they can stay for as long as they want to,” Kaur added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-the-groom-in-a-wheelchair-this-is-a-story-of-true-love/story-3tOBFPTVwIQ7B1FWzHZe8H.html
24-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid-detection through AI: Phase-1 of study in Mumbai’s NESCO facility ends; voice samples of 2,000 patients collected||The NESCO jumbo Covid-19 centre at Goregaon has completed the first phase of screening suspected Covid-19 patients through their voice samples by using artificial intelligence (AI). The centre has collected 4,000 voice samples from 2,000 suspected Covid-19 patients for the pan-India study and a preliminary report on the research is expected to be released next month. The study commenced in August with an Israel-based company. The report is likely to establish the effectiveness of the first-of-its kind diagnostic tool to detect Covid-19. “We have collected 4,000 samples from 2,000 patients. Each patient has given two voice samples. The first sample was given when the patients were suspected of having Covid-19 during their admission to the centre, while the second sample was given after their recovery,” said Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of Nair Dental Hospital, who is in-charge of the NESCO facility. The samples have been sent to a firm Vocalis Health for analysis. “Along with the voice samples, we have also conducted Covid-19 tests on suspected patients. This will help experts to identify if the voice analysis technique can actually detect infected patients,” said Dr Andrade. According to the experts, the study is based on the hypothesis that the novel coronavirus infection may affect the voice of individuals, given the interdependence between the respiratory and speech systems in the body. When symptoms of Covid-19 manifest, an individual starts developing breathing problems that affect the amount of air exhaled. This exhaled air interacts with inflamed muscles on its journey to produce voice or speech. These interactions impact voice modulations — measurable qualities that form the basis of their biomarkers. Depending on its variations, an individual can be detected with Covid-19. An individual will be diagnosed based on vocal biomarkers (VB). For instance, if a person’s VB is below the standard point — 0.5, they will be considered negative for the virus. But if anyone records VB above the standard point, the patient will be suspected to be infected with Covid-19 and an RT-PCR test will be conducted for confirmation. “With lockdown restrictions being lifted, this diagnosis can prove to be helpful as it provides reports in just 30seconds. The preliminary report will be available next month. The final reports, which will come in January, will help in deciding the effectiveness of the technique,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. In the pan-India study, 10,000 samples will be collected all across the country. “If it shows promising results, we have plans to use the programme in hospitals as well. It is non-invasive and can deliver results quicker than other tests,” said Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-detection-through-ai-phase-1-of-study-in-mumbai-s-nesco-facility-ends-voice-samples-of-2-000-patients-collected/story-1MwSFxsTM8I0m1egG94OBI.html

24-11-2020||Pune||Health minister Rajesh Tope hints return of curbs, says CM to hold meeting in two days||A day after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray warned of another lockdown with reports of residents flouting Covid prevention norms, health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday hinted that certain Covid-19 restrictions may return. During his visit to Pune on Sunday, deputy CM Ajit Pawar had said, “The government is monitoring the rise in Covid cases and a decision can be taken about lockdown after reviewing the situation in 8-10 days.” Tope, who was speaking to reporters in his hometown Jalna, on Monday, said the chief minister will be holding a meeting in the next two days to discuss the possible restrictions. Hours after Tope’s remarks, the state government made reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test compulsory for travellers coming to the state from Delhi, Rajasthan, Goa and Gujarat by air or train. The passengers, according to the state notification issued by chief secretary Sanjay Kumar, will have to carry “negative” results of the RT-PCR test on landing in Maharashtra. Besides restrictions on passengers, Tope hinted that the number of those attending wedding needs to be brought down from existing 200. “Given the rise in the number of cases, we may have to take firm steps if needed. If may be complete lockdown, but certain restrictions can be brought back such as bringing down the number of those attending weddings and other public events. The decision is expected in a meeting convened by the CM in the next two days,” he said. The minister also hinted about increasing the amount of fine from those not wearing masks on the lines of Delhi, which recently hiked mask violation fine from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000. His remarks came against the backdrop of Maharashtra’s Covid tally steadily surpassing the 5,000-mark post Diwali. The rising cases also prompted Thackeray to warn citizens to follow discipline and safety measures. In his address on Sunday, Thackeray said that indiscipline could not just lead to the possible second wave but “tsunami” of infection spread. Within Maharashtra, Pune, along with Mumbai, has been reporting high number of cases as a large number of people came out on streets during the festive season. Pune city’s positivity rate has gone up from below 10 per cent before Diwali to close to 13 per cent in the week after Diwali, an indication of the spread of the virus. Although the civic body has been increasing its testing numbers, in the week after Diwali the city saw a drastic rise in the number of cases in comparison to tests conducted by the civic body. Echoing similar views that of Tope, minister for rehabilitation Vijay Wadettiwar said that certain restrictions are needed in the state considering the spread of the virus in the past few days. “We will have to observe the situation in the next eight days and then take a call,” said Wadettiwar while speaking in Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-minister-rajesh-tope-hints-return-of-curbs-says-cm-to-hold-meeting-in-two-days/story-zDMKbOL3DoaeJFaduWsQ2I.html
24-11-2020||Mumbai||Next Maharashtra government swearing-in will be in broad daylight, says Devendra Fadnavis||Former chief minister and leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that the next swearing-in ceremony of the state government will be done at an appropriate time. Fadnavis said that the next swearing-in of the state government will be done at an appropriate time. “We will form a government after the existing Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government falls. The swearing-in will be at the appropriate time,” he said. Fadnavis was reacting to a question by the media on Monday, on the occasion of the first anniversary of his early morning swearing-in as chief minister last year. In the absence of a majority after falling out with the Shiv Sena post-elections, he had to resign on the third day. His remarks have, however, led to political speculations in the state.Another Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union minister Raosaheb Danve said that the party will form a government in Maharashtra in the next two to three months. He said that the BJP has made preparations for it.On Sunday, while reacting to Shiv Sena leader Nitin Nandgaonkar’s demand for changing the Karachi Sweets brand name, Fadnavis said that the BJP believes in inclusive politics. “We believe in Akhand Bharat and one day, Karachi will be part of India,” he said, while speaking to reporters in Nagpur.Nandgaonkar had last week asked the owner of the shop in Mahim to omit the word Karachi from his store’s name.Reacting to the statement, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that the Central government should first focus on bringing back portions of Kashmir that are occupied by Pakistan before thinking about Karachi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/next-maharashtra-government-swearing-in-will-be-in-broad-daylight-says-devendra-fadnavis/story-pdVfYlmqXn1bKQVnlPZKYI.html
24-11-2020||Delhi||Farm fires to blame for higher Covid-19 deaths, says Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain||State health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday attributed the rising Covid-19 fatalities in the city to pollution from stubble burning in neighbouring states, as the city reported 121 deaths of the infection, taking Delhi’s toll past 8,500. The Capital has seen more than 100 deaths of the disease for four straight days now.Delhi, as per Monday’s health bulletin, reported 4,458 new cases of the disease — a drop that came on the back of fewer tests conducted on Sunday. Just over 37,000 tests had been conducted, as per the bulletin, compared to an average of 56,000 tests during the rest of the week. However, over 48% of these were conducted using the RT-PCR method, which is considered the most accurate to diagnose Covid-19.So far, 8,512 people in the city have died of the infection. Monday’s toll, the same as the day before, is the second highest recorded in a single day. The most – 131 – were reported on November 18. Also Read | Start of second Covid-19 wave? States impose fresh set of curbs, curfews are backThe number of deaths has shot up over the fortnight, with 114 people dying on average each day during this week, as compared to 93 the week before and 65 the week before that. The seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) – number of deaths among those who test positive — is inching closer to 2%. It stood at 1.84% as per data shared in Monday’s health bulletin. Jain, meanwhile, said that people who contracted Covid-19 when pollution levels were in the ‘severe’ zone earlier this month, faced more serious symptoms.“The pollution in Delhi caused by stubble burning created a lot of problems. Pollution leads to aggravation of respiratory symptoms and the effect of it would be felt for two to three weeks. The people who got Covid-19 when the pollution levels were high, got more serious disease. Now, that pollution levels have gone down, the cases and deaths will go down in two to three weeks,” said Jain during a press briefing on Monday. “Death usually follows the curve of the number of cases and should start coming down in two weeks,” said Jain. Last week, the minister had said that most of the Covid-19 deaths in the city happened ten days after admissions, an improvement from nearly 50% of the deaths happening within 72 hours during the surge in cases in June-July. Studies from across the world have shown that there could be an increase in the number of deaths due to Covid-19 with the increase in the levels of pollution. A study from Italy shows that higher mortality was reported from regions where the air pollution levels were high. The mortality in Northern Italy – where pollution levels are higher – had 12% mortality rate as compared to 4.5% in other parts of the country. Another research from Europe, showed that 78% of all the Covid-19 deaths were reported from five regions in Italy, France, Spain, and Germany where the levels of nitrogen dioxide was high. A study from Harvard University showed that with every 1 μg increase in long-term exposure to PM 2.5, the Covid-19 mortality went up by 8%. Jain, however, assured that there was a downward trend in the number of cases and case positivity rate — number of samples that test positive among total tested — suggesting that the situation is likely to improve in the city. Experts argue that the transmission of the disease is in control when the positivity rate remains at 5% or below for at least two weeks. Delhi’s seven-day average positivity rate stands at 12.1%, as per Delhi government data. “Pollution cannot be the only factor leading to the increase in the number of Covid-19 deaths. The temperatures dipped simultaneously, the festivities led to more infections, and the higher number of cases meant people were reporting late to hospitals,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, head of the department of pulmonology at Fortis hospital, Shalimar Bagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farm-fires-to-blame-for-higher-deaths-jain-says/story-5ORZzDGTPPxGOsS6DlEmqM.html
24-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Few vacancies despite ICU beds going up by 1,000 since Nov 1||Despite a marked increase in the number of intensive care unit beds for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), only 26% were available for patients on Monday evening, as per data on the government’s Delhi Corona app.The number of ICU beds for Covid-19 treatment– with and without ventilators – have gone up by over 1,000 since the beginning of November, while the total beds for Covid-19 in government, private, and makeshift hospitals have increased by over 2,000 during the same time. “Even though some people have said that the number of cases are going down over the last few days, it has not reflected in the cases coming to the hospitals. We are still getting very sick patients and our ICUs are running full. Every time a new bed opens, there are patients in queue for it,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, head of the department of pulmonology at Fortis hospital, Shalimar Bagh. As on Monday evening, there were no beds available in 57 of the 101 hospitals that had ventilator beds for Covid-19 treatment and 38 others had less than five beds available. As for ICU beds without ventilators, of the 109 total hospitals, 55 had no beds and 28 had fewer than five beds available, as per data on the Delhi Corona app. Dr SP Byotra, chairman of the department of internal medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, concurred. “We have increased some beds, but they are also full. Our staff is stretched thin. We cannot keep expanding the facilities, more because it is drawing from services for the non-Covid patients. We have to therefore ask the people to help out, stay at home, wear masks so that there are fewer new cases.” However, most of the available beds are in smaller centres that may not be equipped to handle complicated cases. “There are patients who come to our hospitals with very low oxygen saturation and in severe condition, many of whom are referred from other private hospitals. We see about 60 admissions a day, of which 15 to 20 patients are those who have been referred from other centres,” said a senior doctor from Delhi government’s Lok Nayak hospital, on condition of anonymity. Another reason for concern is that several people over the age of 60 are getting infected. “Currently, 90% of my ICU is full of elderly patients. Many younger people are stepping out getting the infection and passing it on to the elderly in the family. And, these are the patients who get the most severe disease and need ICU care. Other than that, patients are coming in late to the hospital – when their oxygen saturation has already sipped below 90% -- these patients also need immediate ICU care,” said Dr Maurya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/few-vacancies-despite-icu-beds-going-up-by-1-000-since-nov-1/story-j7pheiv18TtNwGucs3SKwN.html
24-11-2020||Delhi||CPWD constructs new office spaces to shift offices from Central Vista||As part of the Central Vista redevelopment project, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) is constructing two large office spaces at Africa Avenue and Kasturba Gandhi Marg to accommodate offices operating from hutments at South and North blocks.The North and South Blocks will house the National Museum. The plots south of South Block and north of North Block will be used to construct the residences of the Prime Minister and Vice-President of India, respectively, according to the Central Vista redevelopment plan.The CPWD is constructing seven multi-storeyed buildings ---three nine-storeyed (G+8) buildings at KG Marg and four eight-storeyed (G+7) blocks at Africa Avenue—using state-of-the-art pre-engineered building (PEB) technology. The buildings are expected to be ready by March next year.The total built-up space at the two locations is 93,000 sqm---44,000 sqm at KG Marg and 49,000 sqm at Africa Avenue. “The large office complexes here can accommodate over 14,000 officials. The hutments at the South and North blocks have defence establishments. These will be relocated to these buildings.”Explaining the PEB technology, Vinit Kumar Jayaswal, CPWD director general, said, “The pre-engineered components consist of structural steel columns and beams. Only nuts and bolts are being used for the erection of steel structural frames, and no welding is required at site. Expeditious construction is feasible with dry wall construction technology, which uses light gauge steel frames (LGSF) for the external and internal walls. These frames are covered with cement fibre boards on the outer side of the external walls.”At a time when pollution levels are high in the city, CPWD officials said all measures are being taken at both sites. “We have placed a 10 metre high barricading all-round the perimeter, water is regularly being sprinkled on the open areas apart from the use of anti-smog guns, controlled deconstruction measures, and covering of all debris, sand, excavated soil with suitable fabric sheets, etc,” the official said. The CPWD, the nodal agency for the redevelopment project, is working on creating alternative spaces to shift offices and other establishments located at the Central Vista.For instance, renovation and refurbishment of Janpath Hotel is moving at a fast pace. The hotel complex will accommodate the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) located on Man Singh Road.The hotel will be IGNCA’s new address for at least two years till a new space is constructed for the academic and cultural institution, which was set up in 1985.Sachidanand Joshi, member secretary, IGNCA, said, “The CPWD is refurbishing the hotel complex as per our requirements. It will have space for classrooms, exhibition halls, auditorium, etc. The space will be around 30,000 sq feet, which is more or less what we have right now, excluding the lawns. “It will take us two months from the date the building is handed over to us to shift everything.”A senior CPWD official said, “We target to complete the renovation work at the hotel by December end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpwd-constructs-new-office-spaces-to-shift-offices-from-central-vista/story-vbKbM9X2aHS19gvgaQ44pK.html
24-11-2020||Delhi||Lowest minimum November temperature in Delhi since 2003 — for second straight day||The minimum temperature in the national capital on Monday dropped to 6.3 degrees Celsius, the lowest in November since 2003, as cold wave conditions gripped parts of the city, further bolstering predictions by the met office that winter in Delhi would settle early this year.The lowest minimum temperature fell to 6.9°C on Sunday, which was then the lowest minimum November temperature since 2003.On Monday, the Safdarjung Observatory, considered representative of Delhi’s weather, recorded a minimum of 6.3°C, five notches below normal. The maximum here settled at 26.2°C, normal for this time of the year. “Such a low minimum temperature in November was earlier recorded on November 29, 2003, when it dropped to 6.1°C,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.A cold wave is declared when minimum temperature is under 10°C and the departure from normal is 4.5° C for more than a day.The lowest ever minimum temperature recorded in the month was on November 28, 1938, when the mercury fell to 3.9°C, IMD data shows.Meanwhile, on Monday, at Lodhi Road, the minimum temperature settled at 6.4°C, four notches below normal, while at Aya Nagar this was 7.4°C, four below normal. At Palam weather station, the minimum was 9.3°C, three below the season’s average.IMD officials have forecast a colder than normal winter for Delhi this year, with both minimum and maximum temperatures likely to remain at least two degrees below normal throughout the season. This is mainly because of global factors such as La Nina, a global weather pattern linked to low minimum temperatures in northwest India.“The cold winds blowing from snow-clad western Himalayas have led to a dip in the mercury. However, a fresh Western Disturbance affecting the Western Himalayan region from Monday will have its impact on Delhi as well and the minimum temperature will rise by 2-3 degrees over the next couple of days. It is like to remain around 8-9°C over the next three days. After the WD passes, cold winds will again start blowing from the region and the mercury is again set to dip from November 27,” said Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lowest-minimum-november-temperature-in-delhi-since-2003-for-second-straight-day/story-f1zhN7H6asS30Jv9fbMXQO.html
24-11-2020||Delhi||Colleges weighed down by dearth of trained student counsellors||The death by suicide of a 19-year-old undergraduate student at Delhi University’s Lady Shri Ram College (LSR) has exposed the fault lines in online education and points to how psychological counselling initiatives in colleges are not reaching students effectively, stakeholders and experts said.According to the 19-year-old girl’s parents, she was under immense academic and financial stress -- her parents were out of work and they could not afford to buy her a laptop. She had to follow her online classes on her phone. The college had also asked all second-year undergraduate students to vacate the hotel, which had added to her stress, her parents said.While most top colleges, during the online orientation this year, took pains to stress that they have counsellors on call, several students said they weren’t told in detail about them or the facility. Also Read | LSR teachers raise Rs 2.5 lakh to help dead student’s familyFor instance, Prateek Chandera, a first-year student at Deshbandhu College, said, “During our college orientation, we were told about the yoga and meditation facilities on the campus. I can’t recall anything being said on counsellors but they did tell us that students having queries could approach certain teachers.” Manoj Sinha, general secretary of DU Principals Association (DUPA) and principal of Aryabhatta College, said, “As administrators, we know the importance of mental health issues and consistent efforts are made in this regard. There are mentors who can be approached when students need help, at least one-third of all DU colleges have trained psychologists as counsellors.”Through several advisories during the Covid-19 pandemic, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had asked higher educational institutes to take measures to address mental health and well-being of students including setting up helplines, regular monitoring by counsellors,mentoring by teachers, and formation of student help-groups. The ministry of education has also set up a toll-free helpline (8445440632) to provide tele counselling to students with mental health or stress issues.Neelima VP, 18, a first-year student pursuing BA Programme in Miranda House, said, “Student and teacher counsellors shared their contacts during the online orientation, asking us to reach out if we needed help. I think a more effective thing to do would be to organise more group counselling initiatives. In our school, we had such sessions every one or two months and it helped us.”Parents, teachers and students have emphasised on the need for counsellors, therapists and administrators of universities and colleges to step forward and reach out to more students instead of waiting for troubled students to reach out to them. Sanjeev Sahni, principal director of Jindal Institute of Behavioural Sciences, said, “There need to be group therapies sessions and trust building sessions on the subject to spread awareness.” He also recommended a third-party arrangement to ensure that therapists are not on the college’s payrolls. “Trust building exercises are a crucial component since students might often be scared of approaching trained counsellors if they were employed by the college or university.”Jahnvi Kshitij, a final-year UG student of applied psychology at Gargi College, agreed. “Students are often apprehensive to approach a college counsellor with issues related to the college. In our college, our department organises multiple mental health awareness programmes. But we don’t know who the counsellor is. In order to reach out to somebody, you have to know that the person exists,” she said.Dr Satendra Singh, a disability rights activist and a teacher at DU’s University College of Medical Sciences, said, “Despite guidelines and directives, not enough is being done to help students with their mental health problems. Following the 2009 Aman Kachroo death-by-ragging case, the Supreme Court had made it mandatory for colleges to have counsellors. Even the 2017 Mental Healthcare Act cites that suicide reduction programmes must be planned by the government and more people should be employed for mental health services.”Dr Rajesh Sagar, professor of psychiatry at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said, “Work has to be done on the social integration of all students and to de-stigmatise of mental health initiatives so that any barriers to seeking help are eliminated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/colleges-weighed-down-by-dearth-of-trained-student-counsellors/story-XvStn7gHoheo7tlEKBkxCN.html
24-11-2020||Delhi||Court defers taking cognizance of riots conspiracy charge sheet against Khalid, Imam||A Delhi court on Monday deferred the hearing on the issue of taking cognisance of the supplementary charge sheet in the conspiracy to trigger communal riots in north east Delhi which names Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and Faizan Khan. The charge sheet was filed on Sunday. The Delhi High Court had stayed the trial in the case on November 11 while hearing Delhi Police’s appeal, challenging a trial court order of supplying hard copies of the charge sheet to all suspects. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat reserved the order for Tuesday, saying the court’s order has to be correct in terms of the high court’s directions. In the supplementary charge sheet filed on Sunday, Imam and Khalid were booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and other sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act and Prevention of Damage to Public Properties Act.In its November 11 order, the HC had said that the trial court is at liberty to decide any application in the case and put up the matter for further hearing on December 15.During the hearing, counsel for some of the accused said that the grievance of the prosecutor was with the supply of physical copies of the bulky main charge sheet and so soft copies of the supplementary charge sheet can be supplied now.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, said the prosecution was willing to provide soft copies of the supplementary charge sheet to the accused but the orders have to come from the court. He, however, said if the court passes any such directions for supply of the charge sheet, then the police can challenge it before the high court.The police had challenged the October 21 order of the trial court where it had refused to grant time to the police to obtain funds’ sanction to provide to the accused hard copies of the voluminous charge sheet and directed to provide the same.While both Khalid and Imam are in custody, the Supreme Court confirmed bail for Faizan Khan in another riots related case on Monday. Khan was released on bail by the high court on October 23, after it found no ground to directly link him with the commission of offence. Khan was charged under the UAPA in March this year and was accused of arranging SIM card for a co-accused Asif Iqbal Tanha. According to the police, this number was used to communicate messages by students of the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), who too were charged for instigating the February riots in protest to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed by Parliament in December last year.Meanwhile, Khalid, on Monday alleged before chief metropolitan magistrate Dinesh Kumar that his custody in connection to a case related to riots at Khajuri Khas was extended “illegally” and “mechanically”.Khalid was arrested in this case on October 1. Appearing for Khalid, his counsel Sanya Kumar told the court that since the beginning of his arrest in the case, his lawyers were not given copies of the remand applications and denied information about when and before which judge he would be produced.“Time and time again the remand was mechanically granted. Case diaries were not signed, we were not supplied a copy of the remand application,” she claimed.The application by advocates Trideep Pais and Kumar, sought directions to the investigating agency as well as the jail authorities to provide a copy of the application seeking remand/extension of remand to Khalid’s counsels in advance to the proceedings.He was sent to police custody for three days and on October 4, he was sent to judicial custody for 14 days which was extended on October 18 and further on October 31.Khalid’s counsel further alleged that despite repeated requests to inform them about where those remand proceedings would happen and before which judge, the police only informed them that it would happen at Tis Hazari district courts complex and around 11 am and did not give any further information.Kumar then got the details from the court.The plea had sought directions to the police to intimate the counsels about the time, place and manner of all future remand proceedings for Khalid one day in advance.The court has put up the matter for further hearing on November 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/court-defers-taking-cognizance-of-riots-conspiracy-charge-sheet-against-khalid-imam/story-HphgT49sJMH6AaatiWESjO.html
24-11-2020||Delhi||Air quality slips in Delhi, another round of bad air in coming week likely||The air quality in 21 of Delhi’s 35 monitoring stations on Monday dipped to the ‘very poor’ zone while one station entered the ‘severe’ category as the city’s overall pollution level continued to slide further to the far end of the ‘poor’ category. According to weather scientists and experts, Delhi may be in for another spell of bad air in the coming week with local pollutants and unfavourable meteorological conditions largely behind the spike in pollution levels.On Monday, the overall average air quality index (AQI) was 295 in the poor zone, a few notches from ‘very poor’ (301). The air quality has started to plunge again after a week of remaining in the lower to middle end of the poor zone and experiencing a day of ‘moderate’ air quality. After Diwali, rainfall and good winds had helped clear pollutants and improved the air from ‘severe’ to ‘poor’.An analysis of AQI data shows that within 10 days, Delhi is on the verge of ‘very poor’ air again. Previously, this month, Delhi saw ‘very poor’ air on November 13, with an average AQI reading of 339. Delhi’s AQI fluctuated between ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ and ‘moderate’ in a matter of five days between November 13 and 17. From an AQI of 435 on November 15, which is in the severe zone, the air quality improved to poor (221) on November 16 and moderate (171) last Tuesday. Delhi saw its longest spell of ‘severe’ air quality this season with the average AQI remaining in the upper reaches of the category for six consecutive days during November 5-10. Before this, in 2016, the capital breathed severe air quality for six straight days. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that on Monday, the air in the Jahangirpuri monitoring station was in the ‘severe’ zone (404). Alipur, Anand Vihar, Bawana, Ashok Vihar, Narela, Dwarka sector-8, Mathura Road, Chandni Chowk, DTU, Karni Singh Shooting Range, ITO, Mundka, Nehru Nagar, Okhla, Patparganj, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, R K Puram, Rohini, Sonia Vihar, and Punjabi Bagh showed AQI readings in the upper end of the ‘very poor’zone. These include the 13 pollution hots pots across the city.Government agencies have forecast deterioration in air quality from November 24. V K Soni of the environment monitoring research centre at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said with wind speed reducing and a dip in temperature, air quality is likely to deteriorate. “While stubble fires have almost reduced to negligible, change in weather conditions and local emissions are affecting air quality . With a western disturbance affecting the Western Himalayan region, winds will become calmer and may result in a plunge in air quality,” said Soni. The average wind speed on Monday reduced to 5-6kmph from 15-16 kmph over the past few days. “Air quality may improve slightly only around November 27-28 when wind speed is likely to pick up again after the passing of the western disturbance,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, IMD’s head of regional weather forecasting centre.Vivek Chattopadhyay, senior programme manager, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said Delhi is likely to have another spell of bad air in the coming week. “Our daily analysis has shown particulate matter concentrations are again rising gradually, as good weather conditions have almost retreated. Action on hot spots is still lacking as unpaved roads and local waste burning has been observed in many areas. Vehicular emissions are the same as public transport is still not running to full capacity. Te government needs to tackle all sources of pollution equally, as these come into play when the peak stubble burning season is over,” he said. According to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) officials, measures are in effect, including sprinkling water at key stretches, mechanised sweeping of roads and patrolling of hot spots. “We are monitoring the air quality on a regular basis. Teams are on ground to check local pollution sources such as waste burning and industrial fumes,” said a senior DPCC official, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-quality-slips-in-delhi-another-round-of-bad-air-in-coming-week-likely/story-D1Cxp8uIgRLQBkHaql3IfK.html
24-11-2020||Delhi||No word yet on admission to entry-level classes, parents worried||With no information on admissions to entry-level classes to the capital’s 1,700 private schools for the 2021-22 academic session, parents planning to get their children enrolled this year are now left concerned. The process for admissions to entry-level classes – nursery, kindergarten, and class 1 – normally begins between November and December every year.Simran Kaur, a resident of northwest Delhi’s Rani Bagh area, said the family was trying to get their three-year-old daughter enrolled into a school this year. “For nursery, the upper age limit is four. We are worried that if our child is not admitted this year, she will lose a year. Though we don’t want her to physically go to school till the vaccine for Covid-19 is available, we do want her to join online classes at least,” said the 26-year-old homemaker.Sumit Vohra, who runs a portal on nursery admissions, said they have been receiving queries from parents on a daily basis. “The parents are concerned and have been asking if there are any tentative dates for admissions since other NCR cities such as Ghaziabad, Noida and Gurgaon have initiated the process for conducting nursery admissions. The Delhi government could release a notice to assuage the concerns of these parents,” he said.Echoing Kaur’s concerns, Vohra said not conducting admissions this year was not feasible since there is an upper age limit for entry-level classes. Last year, the minimum ages for nursery, kindergarten and class 1 was three, four, and five years while the maximum limit for the categories was four years, five years, and six years, respectively.“Not all schools provide online forms and in some cases parents have to visit the schools for the forms. Schools ask parents to submit hard copies of documents. Doing this would be challenging during the pandemic. A mechanism should be put in place to address this,” Vohra said.A senior official from the Directorate of Education said it was too early to comment on the matter due to the Covid-19 situation. The Capital recorded 6,746 new cases of Covid-19 and 121 deaths on Sunday taking the total number of fatalities to 8,391. On Monday, 4,454 new cases and 121 deaths were recorded.“Generally, the process for nursery admissions to the capital’s private schools starts around November-end and so far there has been no discussion on this because we are dealing with an unprecedented situation. More clarity on this will emerge in the coming few weeks,” the official said, adding students who took admission in entry-level classes in the 2020-21 academic session are yet to attend offline classes.“We are waiting for clarity on when schools can reopen and the decision for admission will be taken on the basis of that. There has been no discussion over how and when admissions will be conducted,” the official said.Riyaz Ahmed, an HR professional and a resident of New Friends Colony, is trying to get her daughter enrolled this year. He said the education department should consult parents before deciding the schedule and work on alternative options as well.“We are worried about sending our children to school but there has been no conversation with parents on this so far. We are not left with any option but to apply as competition for getting a nursery seat in Delhi is very stiff. Due to the pandemic, we are worried about how institutions will adapt to the new normal and figure out logistics of how they will teach. We are also wondering how the children will travel to school once if they reopen,” he said.Admissions under the economically weaker section/disadvantaged groups category for 2020-21 are yet to be completed. The education department has announced it will call fresh online applications from EWS/DG aspirants for 838 vacant seats. The last date of submission for these applications is November 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-word-yet-on-admission-to-entry-level-classes-parents-worried/story-hwSkqlQYcfpKoJ6h8Fj1xM.html
24-11-2020||Delhi||Man, son killed in north-east Delhi, personal enmity suspected||A 50-year-old scrap dealer who also ran an NGO, and his 22-year-old son, were murdered near their home in north-east Delhi’s Nand Nagri on Monday morning, police said. The father, Zulfiqar Qureshi, was shot in his head, and his son Janbaaz Qureshi was stabbed with a sharp weapon by two-three men when they were walking back home after offering namaaz at a local mosque, Ved Prakash Surya, deputy commissioner of police (north-east) said.While the police were yet to arrest the attackers, the DCP said Janbaaz was able to identify the suspects before his death. “It was a murder over personal enmity. We hope to nab the suspects soon,” the DCP said. The DCP said Zulfiqar had multiple criminal cases against him though there were none in recent years. “His son, Janbaz, too had a few criminal cases against him and was arrested for motorcycle theft two months ago,” said the DCP. The officer, however, couldn’t immediately comment on the nature of those alleged criminal cases. The families of the dead men said Zulfiqar was an RTI activist and an active member of the Bharatiya Janata Party.“He would file RTIs against scrap dealers involved in vehicle thefts as well as those involved in illegal construction and other activities. He was an active member of the BJP and ran an NGO that worked for the environment,” said Zulfiqar’s niece, Parveen, adding FIRs against the father-son duo were bogus and motivated. The police said they did not have any information about his RTI activism or his political affiliation. The police as well as the victims’ relatives said he was assigned a personal security officer (PSO) by Delhi Police due to perceived threats to his life.“There were attempts on his life in the past because of his RTI activism. So, he was given security. But the security officer’s duty was between 8am and 8pm,” said Zulfiqar’s brother, Sarfaraaz. The double murder happened over an hour before the security officer reached and began his duty. “Zulfiqar and his three sons had visited the mosque near our home and had just finished their namaaz around 6.45am when three men attacked the father. They shot him in his waist, chased him in the street and then threw a tyre around him before shooting him in his head,” said Parveen. The DCP, however, said Zulfiqar was shot just once -- in his head -- and he died before he could be taken to a hospital. Zulfiqar’s eldest son, Janbaaz, who is preparing to get into a law college, tried to save him but he too was attacked. “They shot Janbaz in his waist before stabbing him. They smashed his head with pistol butt,” Parveen said. The DCP said it could not immediately be confirmed if Janbaaz too received bullet injuries. The suspects fled and the father-son duo was taken to a local hospital where Zulfiqar was declared brought dead. His son was referred to Safdarjung Hospital where he succumbed during treatment. “But before he died, Janbaaz told us the names of the suspects,” the DCP said. The victims’ relatives alleged the double murder was because of Zulfiqar’s RTI activism. Naveen Kumar, Delhi BJP’s media head, said, “He was an active member of the BJP, but he was not an office bearer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-son-killed-in-north-east-delhi-personal-enmity-suspected/story-dcdiekz1MX7rEHKdYf7bMP.html
24-11-2020||City||Customs bust gold smuggling racket on trains||Delhi Customs have found that gold is being smuggled into Delhi on trains which helps them avoid strict surveillance at airports, officials said. The racket was exposed after the Customs busted a cartel, members of which have told officials that at least 65kg gold from Dubai and Hong Kong has been brought into the country through Myanmar and Bangladesh border.Officers say rail routes are becoming popular among smugglers as they not only provide them with a safe, surveillance free passage but also allowed them to switch the handlers, carriers and routes, to avoid being tracked.Deputy commissioner customs (preventive) Hemant Rohilla said this is one of the biggest gold smuggling cartels unearthed by Customs in Delhi that was operating via trains. The syndicate was busted last week on Thursday when following a tip-off about smuggling of 6kg gold, Customs sleuths arrested a 37-year-old man at New Delhi Railway Station.“Based on intelligence inputs, we intercepted the man who had reached Delhi on Rajdhani Express. His baggage check led to the recovery of 6.3 kg gold worth Rs3.26 crore. The gold was foreign marked and the stamp mark had been scrubbed off. The gold was in form of bars. Two days of follow up searches and intelligence further led us to a 45-year-old man who was arrested from his hideout in old Delhi on Saturday night where he was waiting to receive the consignment,” Rohilla said.The deputy commissioner said, “They revealed that there is a larger cartel behind the supplies. The carrier told us that within past two-three months he has made 15 trips from Howrah and other nearby areas in West Bengal to Delhi, carrying different quantities of smuggled gold. The duo has confessed to have smuggled at least 65 kg gold worth over Rs30 crore till date,” he said.He further said, “The men disclosed that the gold consignments originate usually in Dubai and Hong Kong and have foreign markings on them which are scrubbed off before the gold is pushed into India at Bangladesh and Myanmar borders. They said they received the gold in Howrah and boarded trains to cities like Kanpur, Moradabad or Bareilly. They then changed train to reach Delhi. Many a times, the handlers and carriers were also switched on the way to avoid tracking by authorities,” Rohilla said, adding that the names of the two arrested men cannot be disclosed as the investigations are in progress.Customs officials also found that the carrier even used Covid special trains to smuggle the gold as indicated by the tickets recovered from the arrested duo.Another Customs officer, who wished not to be named, said the smugglers said they preferred trains over flights as it was considered a safer option.“They said the railway stations do not mandate x-ray scanning of luggage as at airports almost zeroing their chance to be caught before boarding. They also said that they often changed stations and trains in between to avoid suspicion or tracking by any law enforcing agency. This also helped them frequently change their travel history and avoid any suspicion,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/customs-bust-gold-smuggling-racket-on-trains/story-DR4rkQMGkaxKH1w90XKH3I.html

He was found to be inebriated.Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said prima facie, it looks like the man lost control of his car as he was drunk. “No one was injured in the accident. The driver was taken to RML hospital but he also didn’t sustain any serious injury. A case has been registered for negligent driving and under sections of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and under Motor Vehicle Act.

24-11-2020||Pune||Schools reopen in rural Pune||Schools and colleges for classes 9 to 12 reopened in the rural areas of Pune district on Monday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started in March. Educational institutions in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic areas continue to be shut till December 13 and November 30 respectively.Ganpat More, primary education officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “With the district administration’s permission, some schools reopened on Monday. Attendance for students is not compulsory and as parents are still worried about Covid-19 infection, the attendance report was not overwhelming. Till now, 6,565 teachers and non-teaching staff have undergone Covid-19 tests and 29 tested positive. The tests of the remaining teachers will be completed soon and then, they will be joining school. We will be taking daily review of Covid tests and till December 1, we will try to start 100 per cent schools in Pune district. We hope that the number of students will increase gradually.” Anuja Mujumle, a class 9 student, was elated to attend classes at school after almost eight months. “I had been preparing to attend school since Sunday. I arranged my school uniform, packed my bag with subject books and notebooks and most importantly carried my facemask and hand sanitiser with me. My parents had given strict instructions regarding Covid-19 safety as to how to attend the classes. Our teachers too are taking all precautions. So, I feel safe to attend physical classes rather than online ones,” said Anuja, a student of Shivbhumi High School and Junior College located in Khed Shivapur. Just like Anuja, hundreds of other students from rural parts of the Pune district enthusiastically attended physical classes at their respective schools on Monday. HT visited some of the schools in the rural parts of Pune on Monday and reviewed the safety arrangements in place by the school administration. While some schools had good attendance, other schools reported low presence of students. “We have been preparing for physical classes to start since the past one week. We have a staff of 60 teachers and non-teaching members, who underwent the Covid-19 test. Only those with a negative Covid-19 report have been allowed to come to school. Also, for every student it is compulsory to bring their parent’s permission letter to attend the classes. Today before starting classes, we sanitised all the classrooms and in each class only half the number of students, 30, were called in. So, each student will be called every alternate day to attend school classes and we are conducting classes only for English, Science and Mathematics subjects,” said VR Kondhare, principal of Shivbhumi High School and Junior College. Ganesh Garad, a student of class 10, said, “I used to attend online lectures started by schools since June, but I would hardly understand anything. Also, there were mobile network issues in our village, so I am happy that physical classes have begun. I don’t want to fail in SSC this year and want to secure good marks. For that, classroom teaching is necessary.” Shivbhumi School conducted classes for students of class 11 and 12 between 8am and 10.30am on Monday following all Covid-19 safety protocols. Students of class 9 and 10 attended classes between 12pm and 2.30pm. On arrival, all students were thermally screened, their oxygen levels were checked, and classrooms were deep sanitised. Social distancing was also maintained in the seating arrangements. Wearing a face mask was compulsory. Parents of some of the students came to the school to check the safety arrangements in place and speak to the teachers regarding their concerns. Sharing of water bottles and food has also been prohibited on the school premises.Prof SA Kadam, principal of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule High School and Junior College at Shindewadi, Velu village, said, “As it was the first day of schools reopening, the number of students coming to the classes was less. There is still a fear amongst parents to send their child to school and we cannot force anyone. Today, only safety instructions were taught to students. We will begin our subject classes from Tuesday.” Savita Chavan, a parent who had come to drop her daughter to school, said, “We are happy that schools are restarting, but at the same time there is a constant fear of infection. I have instructed my daughter to follow all the safety instructions in the school and just concentrate on studies.” On record- Total number of schools in Pune district – 1,246 - Schools which restarted classes on Monday – 215 - Number of teachers – 11,033 - Non-teaching staff – 4,821 - Total number of students - 2,38,041 - Students who attended classes on Monday – 9,433||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/schools-reopen-in-rural-pune/story-bepz6FczMdHUzqlUCKfVyM.html

24-11-2020||Environment||Maharashtra: Panje tidal water blockade lifted, strengthens demand for bird sanctuary||The City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (Cidco) said it removed almost all its outlets of the sluice gates at Panje area in Uran as per orders of the Bombay high court (HC)-appointed state wetland and mangrove redressal committee.The area had been going dry over the past few months as the free flow of tidal water had been restricted by the sluice gates on one side and artificial bunds on the other. The HC-appointed panel on November 2, headed by the Konkan divisional commissioner Annasaheb Misal, directed the Raigad collector to ensure the flow of tidal water to the 289-hectare patch, a destination for hundreds of migratory birds, was not blocked.“We ensured the removal of 72 of 76 outlets of this sluice gate over the weekend. As per original orders, we were supposed to do this by September. However, owing to Covid-19-related issues, there was a delay. Directions have been issued to local residents and security officers set up by private companies that in no circumstances, tidal water should be blocked,” said Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco.Also Read: Biomedical waste incineration plant to shift out of Mumbai by Feb 2022The barrier was built in 1994-95 with help from Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay as a flood control mechanism. The gates can also be manually operated, allowing more water to be released if needed. It shuts automatically during high tide and opens up during low tide, remaining closed throughout the months of monsoon.Patil added that though areas in Panje had been handed over to private companies for the Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ), a proposed integrated industrial township, construction cannot commence until necessary permissions are taken by private companies. “This includes coastal regulation zone (CRZ) permissions and a nod for the Bombay HC if mangrove areas are involved,” he said.Nandkumar Pawar from environment group Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishthan (SEAP), which is campaigning against protection of mangroves areas and fishing zones in Uran, said, “Not all flap gates have been opened yet, and we need strictly monitor the area to ensure Cidco does not close the gates again. NMSEZ has also started an illegal landfill here and a dumper truck driver was caught red-handed dumping trash recently.”Environmentalists also expressed happiness as they had mounted a campaign to declare Panje as a bird sanctuary. They also want a compound wall around Panje to be demolished and free the bird sanctuary from all restrictions. “Panje has been under attack and birds have stopped coming here,” said BN Kumar, director, not-for-profit NatConnect Foundation.Environment groups alleged that both the sluice gates and the wall were illegal as those planning projects at Panje do not have permissions from the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA), which is a prerequisite as the mangrove-filled area falls under CRZ-1. “The state government must be reminded that Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) had in 2015 obtained assurance from then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis that Panje would be protected as a bird sanctuary. However, Cidco has ignored this and drawn up a development plan for Dronagiri node covering Panje and other wetlands and mangrove zones,” said Tukaram Koli, a member of Uran fishing community forum Paaramparik Machhimar Bachao Kruti Samiti.In a fresh appeal before the state, Kumar said since the sluice gates had been lifted, the government should declare Panje a bird sanctuary.Member of the HC-panel Stalin D said they would be pursuing the matter to ensure all impediments in the way of tidal flushing are removed. “After relentlessly following up, finally Cidco has acted. There are more blockages made by local vested interests which are yet to be opened. If needed the committee members will personally visit the site to ensure that the tide water is not blocked,” he said.In 2015, Cidco had claimed that mangroves that had grown within their holding ponds (for high-tide water connected to sluice gates mainly at Panje, Karanje and Koparkhairane) were not protected under the coastal regulation zone (CRZ) notification since they were ‘inland mangroves’. A notification from the union environment ministry earlier this year stated that such mangroves also needed to be protected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/environment/maharashtra-panje-tidal-water-blockade-lifted-strengthens-demand-for-bird-sanctuary/story-vBYOID0XnBaPsNxRukRVmO.html
