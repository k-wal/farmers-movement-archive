Parents are in a fix and are hesitant to admit their children to the school, as they have assumed that it will close down,” Ryait said.“This has dented the reputation of the school. We used to get more than 200 to 300 applications for admission in LKG and Nursery classes in October and November. But, due to the controversy, we have not received a single application. We have a strength of 3,000 students, but only 40% have paid fees till now,” he added.Ryait refuted the allegations of not paying salaries to teachers. He added that each and every staff of the school is receiving salaries in time. On being asked about collecting fees from students, Ryait said that there were no clear orders either from the government or from the court to not collect fees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cancellation-of-nocs-did-not-receive-notice-pvt-school-in-ludhiana-says/story-aLJtulj1eKVeVsUUYsCoxN.html

Locals said they had to file multiple complaints with the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) for it to pay heed.According to residents, choked sewer lines and overflowing sewage into houses was a common problem in sectors Beta 1, Delta 1, Zu 1, Ecotech 2 and Knowledge Park-III of the city.“The authority does not clean the sewers regularly, as a result of which choked sewage overflows into the residential areas. We had to file multiple complaints, after which the authority paid attention to the issue. We hope that this will not recur,” said Harendra Bhati, a resident of Sector Beta 1 and founder member of Active Citizen Team, a social group.The authority, meanwhile, said that it has started the cleaning of sewers with the help of sucker machines and stopped manual cleaning which involves manual labour. Officials said they have assured the residents that the authority will resolve issues of choked sewers in sectors Gamma 1, 2, Alpha 1, 2, Omicron 1, 2, 3, Xu 1, 2, 3 and sigma by March 2021. “We have been cleaning the city’s sewer network with the help of machines so that sewage overflow issues are addressed properly. Now, the regular cleaning of the sewers with robot machines, that work on artificial intelligence, will make sure that sewer lines are not choked in any residential area of the city,” said Deep Chandra, additional chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority. The authority said that it has set up an integrated control room with helpline numbers – 8595810523 and 8595814470 – where residents can call and get their issues resolved related with choked sewer lines.“In Greater Noida’s residential areas, choked manholes, overflow of sewer lines and sludge content in the sewer network have been very common problems in the city. To address these issues professionally, we have set up the integrated control room, where residents can call and get their issues redressed,” said Chandra. Officials said the authority has laid out a system that if a complaint is not addressed at any level then it will be escalated to a senior official, who can take appreciate decisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/choked-sewer-overflow-irks-residents-in-greater-noida/story-GgK3nlYgCwrHaALy0qn6yI.html
04-11-2020||Noida||With 339 cases, GB Nagar registers highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases||Alarmed with reports of 339 Covid-19 positive cases on Wednesday, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration called upon an urgent meeting in the evening to decide on the measures to check the further spread of the infection in the district. However, the health department attributed the sudden spike to a delay in uploading data on the central server.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that the health officials have been asked to increase surveillance at public places and strengthen contact tracing of positive patients. “Rising number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi also has a direct impact on the neighbouring districts of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. In April too, 42% of the cases in GB Nagar had come from contacts in Delhi. But, now that almost all restrictions have been eased and commercial activities have started, we have any no other option other than proper surveillance and following all precautionary measures,” he said.With 339 cases, the total number of patients suffering from Covid-19 has now reached 18,679 in Gautam Budh Nagar. There are 1,443 active Covid-19 cases in the district with no new deaths being recorded in the last 24 hours. The previous biggest single-day spike in the district was 251, which was reported on September 10. Attributing the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases to the district’s floating population and the movement of over one lakh across the Delhi-Noida border daily, the DM said that only mass awareness about social distancing and sanitisation can check the spread of the virus. “In the meeting with the health officials today, I’ve asked them to increase daily testing from 4.000 to 7,000 and enhance contact tracing. They have also been asked to keep strict surveillance in the crowded areas. I’ll myself keep a tab on daily testing and contact tracing,” he said. Suhas further said that in the present situation, early and timely tracking and providing adequate treatment are the main goals before the administration. “Despite having adequate beds for Covid-19 patients, all private and government hospitals have been asked to increase the number of beds in their intensive care units (ICU) and high dependency units (HDU),” he said. The DM also said that further spread of viral infection cannot be ruled out. “Our focus is on reducing the number of deaths and curing the maximum number of infected patients possible. For that, we have adopted the ‘tracking, testing and treating’ methodology in which we are ensuring the maximum number of contact tracing, testing nearly 4,000 people every day, and treating infected patients as per symptoms. While the recovery rate in GB Nagar is still over 90%, the case fatality rate is only 0.36%, which is much better than the state’s overall rate of 1.45%,” Suhas LY said. Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer (CMO) of the district, however, said that sudden surge in positive cases on Wednesday, was mainly due to bulk uploading of as many as 169 cases by the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) after October 28. “Actually, it is not a sudden surge as the spike could have been of just 30 cases, if case details were uploaded on a daily basis. Nevertheless, to avert any major surge, we need to further increase the contact-tracing and testing,” he said. When contacted, the GIMS director Dr Rakesh Gupta, also admitted that there was a delay in uploading cases. “While some of our laboratory staff members tested positive, the weekend offs also caused a delay in uploading the daily positive cases on the portal. We’ll now make all efforts to put the figures on state Covid-19 portal on time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/with-339-cases-gb-nagar-registers-highest-single-day-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-eGdCrdm14Fti8sEqFAPo4J.html

04-11-2020||Noida||Wildlife Institute of India to submit plan to protect fauna around Jewar airport||The Wildlife Institute of India has decided to draw up and submit a conservation plan that will aim at protecting wildlife species and their natural habitat that will be affected due to the upcoming Noida International Greenfield Airport at Jewar. The conservation plan will have proposals on individual species — mainly on Sarus crane, blackbucks and Nilgai, due to their abundance — that exist in and around the proposed 5,000 acres site for the airport. These species rely on a number of wetlands around the proposed site for food and water for their survival and the plan will aim at mitigating the impact, scientists said. “There is a small population of blackbucks, Nilgai and Sarus cranes in the area. The conservation plan that we will be submitting in the next ten days has been made to protect the wildlife species that will be affected due to the airport project. The plan will minimise the impact on the species and will be shared with all the concerned departments,” said Bilal Habib, scientist of WII who is also the head of the conservation plan team. He points out that a number of species live on agriculture fields and not in the protected area or the notified forest land. The report will also consider aspects like flight safety, given the risk of birds coming inside the operational area of the airport and damaging aircrafts. “We have worked on all aspects keeping individual species in mind. The idea is not just to reduce the impact on the wildlife, but also on human lives. The plan thus will include all options be it relocation or rehabilitation or conservation of a particular species within that area,’ said Habib. The Noida International Greenfield airport project is spread across 5,000 hectares that falls in 39 villages near Jewar along Yamuna Expressway— that connects Greater Noida with Agra. Earlier the project’s nodal agency, Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL), has signed a memorandum of understating with WII on August 30, 2019, for the preparation of a conservation plan that is crucial for obtaining environment clearance. The clearance for the project has already been granted, but the WII has been tasked to chalk out a mitigation plan to reduce impact on wildlife and the ecology , especially in a 10-km radius or the area of influence of the project site. An inception report by WII last year observed several herds of blackbucks, Nilgai and flocks of Sarus crane around the proposed site. During the inception report, several herds of blackbucks —with the largest having 29 members — along with other mammals, including jackal and jungle cats, several flocks of Sarus cranes, and over 60 other bird species including endangered Egyptian vulture and Indian peafowls were observed. The blackbuck, an antelope species, is listed under Schedule-1 of Wildlife Protection Act-1972, while the Nilgai, also an antelope, is protected under schedule-3 of WPA-1972. The sarus crane (schedule-4 of WPA) is categorised as a vulnerable species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classification. It is the state bird of UP and parts of western UP, especially areas around Etawah and Mainpuri, are among the bird’s largest habitat in the world. Surajpur and Dhanauri are two rich wetlands close to Jewar and both are unprotected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/wildlife-institute-of-india-to-submit-plan-to-protect-fauna-around-jewar-airport/story-6uGIXjDiJuTAgEaqGLwvBM.html

Arvind Mallappa Bangari, managing director(MD), PVVNL, said that during the disconnection drive, the discom has pulled the plugs of 71,611 defaulters in the districts of Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, Shamli, Bijnour, Moradabad, Sambhal, JP Nagar and Rampur. “Our raiding teams have also collected ₹60.44 crore from the power consumers across these 14 districts for failing to clear their outstanding dues,” he said. Bangari further said that as many as 40,848 meter exception cases have also been attended to during this drive, in which the meters were found to be out of order. “Also, FIRs against over 500 meter readers have been lodged in different districts. Alarmed at the poor revenue collection in some areas of these districts, we started checking the actual meter readings. We found that the meter readers often connive with the owners of the meters and downplay the number of units consumed by them. The actual units consumed continue to get recorded as store-reading and the consumers have no other option than to pay for them,” he said. The PVVNL MD also said that while Noida division has 2,120 recorded cases of faulty meters, Ghaziabad division had 4,701 erring meters. “We have disconnected 11,746 electricity connections in Ghaziabad, whereas 4,095 lines were disconnected in Noida. The total revenue collected from Noida zone from the defaulters is over ₹4.05 crore, while over ₹18.23 crore was collected from the Ghaziabad — the highest in the entire Meerut division,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/discom-files-fir-against-500-meter-readers-collects-over-60-crore-from-defaulters/story-SM97bSWSHDvngsehJKqELJ.html

04-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: After brief gap of three days, active Covid cases cross 1,000 mark yet again||Ghaziabad: After a brief period of three days, during which the number of active coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in Ghaziabad fell below 1,000, the number of active cases has again crossed the 1,000 mark. Ghaziabad is now among the four districts in Uttar Pradesh to have 1,000 or above active cases. Officials acknowledged that they have witnessed the trend and have directed for gearing up for any spike which may come around the festivals.The last time the Ghaziabad district had less than 1,000 active cases was on August 13, when the number stood at 984. Thereafter, there was a rise in cases and on October 29 the number of active cases came down to below the 1,000 mark after a gap of nearly 77 days. However, the trend could continue only till October 31, and active coronavirus cases have gone up since November 1 when they stood at 1,041 and have remained above the 1,000 mark ever since. According to the state control room records of November 4, active cases were at 1,146 in the district. Apart from Ghaziabad, the three other districts in UP – Meerut, Gautam Budh Nagar and Lucknow – have active cases more than 1,000, at 1498, 1443 and 3906, respectively, on November 4 as per the state control room figures. “We are witnessing the trend of increase in cases and daily cases in Delhi are also rising. Since we have a major population chunk which travels to and from Delhi, there is a high probability that our cases are also likely to increase. Many of our localities like Vaishali, Kaushambi, Surya Nagar and Loni, etc. are very close to Delhi borders,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “We have chalked out a ‘November action plan’ under which we have directed for resumption of L1 category hospitals, once there is a spike in the number of cases. Apart from these, it is also directed that ventilators and other equipment should be kept in ready condition. Apart from this, we already have about 900 beds in private hospitals. So, we have geared up but it is a must that people wear masks and adhere to social distancing during the festival season,” he added. An increase in active cases means that there is a spike in fresh cases, outnumbering the number of patients discharged over a period of time. The Ghaziabad district had reached an all-time high figure of 2,126 active Covid-19 cases on September 14.“There is much need for precautions to be taken by residents in times of festivals, as lapses could lead to spread of Covid-19 when too many people mingle with each other in markets. So, it is vital that they wear masks and adhere to social distancing norms,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. Although the case tally has shown an increase, Ghaziabad has a better discharge rate – of about 93.56% – with 1,7890 patients discharged, out of a total 19,120 cases reported since March to November 4. The total also includes 84 deaths which have so far taken place in the district due to the coronavirus disease. On November 4, the total cases in the district crossed the mark of 19,000. Out of these, the last 1,000 cases were reported in a span of nine days, with the 18,000 mark having been crossed on October 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-after-brief-gap-of-three-days-active-covid-cases-cross-1-000-mark-yet-again/story-zZhPc5sRw7vA5v4IJKGfAP.html
04-11-2020||Noida||Visibility over Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida low; haze to prevail for a few days, says met dept||Ghaziabad: Visibility in the three cities of Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida on Wednesday was low due to cover of trapped pollutants, as a result of low wind speed in the region. Officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that unfavourable meteorological conditions have resulted in the scenario, which is likely to continue for two-three days.The haze was witnessed on Wednesday morning and in many areas, hardly any sunlight came through. Officials of the IMD said that the visibility reduced to about 800 metres due to presence of pollutants, which stayed between the ground level and up to one kilometre from the ground.“The cover of pollutants had come down below one kilometre, and also stayed at the ground level. The wind speed also remained low with an average of about eight-10 kilometres per hour (kmph). Further, there was also a decline in temperature. So, all these factors contributed to lesser dispersal of pollutants, which resulted in hazy conditions due to presence of pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi. “The conditions are likely to remain prevalent for next two-three days. There may be marginal improvement in wind speed but it will have no major effect on dispersal of pollutants. The temperature during the day time is likely to remain about 28-29 degrees Celsius while the temperature during the night time will hover around 10-11 degrees Celsius,” he added. The residents said that weather conditions remained hazy throughout. They added that they had difficulty in breathing in the open air.“There was hardly any sunshine on Wednesday and as I breathed, I could feel the quality of air was bad, when I went out to the market. The visibility was poor and hazy conditions prevailed throughout the day, continuing till evening. The air quality might deteriorate further and the authorities should increase the frequency of water sprinkling activities on roads,” said Sanjeev Sethi, a resident of Sector 107, Noida, adding that he had to keep the windows of his home shut throughout the day.The Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) for Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida stood at 389, 368 and 345, respectively, all under the “very poor” category, on Wednesday. The AQI of 389 for Ghaziabad is among the highest this season since October 1. The same AQI was recorded on October 29 as well.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Although Ghaziabad’s AQI stood under the “very poor” category on Wednesday, the AQI levels at Loni, Sanjay Nagar and monitoring stations spiked to “severe” categories, with AQI values of 436 and 415, respectively, at 4pm on Wednesday, as per the CPCB’s bulletin. Meanwhile, Greater Noida’s Knowledge Park 5 monitoring station also reached the “severe category”, with an AQI reading of 405. Instances of fire, however, continued unabated.An HT team spotted instances of stubble burning at Kallu Garhi near Dasna, while another major fire took place at a garbage dump in Raj Nagar Extension Wednesday evening. Chief fire officer Sunil Kumar Singh said that a fire tender was rushed to Raj Nagar Extension to douse the blaze. “We immediately informed the authorities and one fire tender arrived. The fire tender had to refill water several times from a nearby highrise in order to douse the flames. It took over one hour to control and completely douse the fire. The blaze resulted in thick smoke in the air which engulfed the nearby highrises. There was low visibility and difficulty in breathing due to pollution prevailing throughout the day; it was probably the worst day of this season in the city,” said Vikrant Sharma, a resident of Raj Nagar Extension. Utsav Sharma, the regional officer of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) in Ghaziabad, said that action will be initiated in both the incidents. “We will ask the agricultural department to initiate action in the instance of stubble burning at Kallu Garhi, and recommend a penalty of Rs 25 lakh against the plot owner at Raj Nagar Extension. The pollution conditions prevailed due to low wind speed and drop in temperature,” he said. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that he will direct agencies to intensify pollution abatement measures.“In case the conditions continue this way, we will also consider a stoppage of infrastructure-related works in certain areas in coming days,” he added. The forecast by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), a private weather forecasting agency, said that overall Delhi’s AQI is likely to stay in the lower end of “very poor” category and deterioration is forecasted for November 5 and 6 towards the higher end of “very poor” category. It said that Safar synergised stubble fire counts over Punjab, Haryana, UP, Uttarakhand, and neighbouring areas are marginally decreased, but still significant and stood at 1,949 yesterday (Tuesday), and stubble-burning share in PM2.5 in Delhi’s air was estimated at 5% for Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/visibility-over-noida-ghaziabad-and-greater-noida-low-haze-to-prevail-for-a-few-days-says-met-dept/story-IVYxXrgmPEZn1BsMhbFxfL.html

Around 10pm when he was passing by Atam Hosiery in Daresi, three men on a motorcycle intercepted him. Brandishing a gun, they demanded his cash and money.When he resisted, the accused opened fire in the air to threaten him and snatched his Rs 13,000 in cash and mobile phone before fleeing.Left shaken by the attack, he returned home and narrated the incident to his family, but could not muster the courage to approach the police.ASI Shavinder Singh, who is investigating the case, said the robbery was captured in a CCTV camera installed near the spot. Kumar managed to get the CCTV footage and one of his neighbours identified one accused as Lovedeep Singh, who lived in their locality earlier. After identifying him, the victim lodged a complaint with the police on Tuesday. Police have booked Lovedeep Singh of Bhamiya, Deepak Kumar and Gagandeep of Shimlapuri under Sections 392 (robbery), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 25, 54 and 59 of the Arms Act.

04-11-2020||Chandigarh||Protest by Akalis a political gimmick: Congress leaders||The protest by Shiromani Akali Dal leaders outside the residence of Punjab cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Wednesday has invited sharp criticism from the local Congress leadership who called it a frivolous attempt to save lost ground. Lashing out at the Akalis, MLAs Surinder Dawar, Sanjay Talwar and Kuldeep Singh Vaid said that they have no locus standi to question leaders like Ashu. “People have seen their true colours, which is why they are issuing frivolous statements to save their long lost political ground,” quipped the MLAs. Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu and Ludhiana Improvement Trust chairman Raman Balasubramaniam said the Akalis had first signed in approval of the three farm ordinances passed by the Union government. “It is a known and documented fact that former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal as well as former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal had given official statements in media appreciating the farm ordinances. But, when people started objecting, they were forced to backtrack and shed crocodile tears in support of the farmers. This clearly shows the opportunistic nature of Akalis and Punjabis will never forget their misdeeds against farmers,” they said. Ashwani Sharma and Karanijt Singh Soni Galib, urban and rural presidents of District Congress Committee, Ludhiana, said that before questioning Ashu’s credibility, the Akalis should first come clean on the alleged misappropriation of public funds to the tune of Rs 31,000 crore during the 10 years of their rule. “The Akalis have no moral right to question an honest leader like Bharat Bhushan Ashu. If they are so concerned about Punjab, they should first question their own leadership as to why Rs 31,000 crore were misappropriated during their tenure,” they said. Mamta Ashu, MC councillor and wife of Bharat Bhushan Ashu, said that the Akali protest near their house was a political gimmick because unsuccessful and failed leaders like Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal now want to contest Assembly elections to show their prominence. “Everyone knows about the honesty and credibility of Bharat Bhushan Ashu, who has not lost a single election since 1997. This clearly shows that he has been accepted year after year by the people of Ludhiana. From the actions of the Narendra Modi led Union government, one can easily make out that they are hell bent to destroy the agriculture, industry as well as entire economy of Punjab”, the councillor said. She added that the Punjabi industry, which is world famous for its hosiery, textile, cycle parks and automotive components, will not be able to sell their products because the central government is operating in an autocratic manner and Narendra Modi like a dictator. She further said that Punjabis have always given their sweat and blood for safeguarding the rights of fellow citizens and would not bow down in front of the dictatorial government. “People should question Bikram Singh Majithia as to why he did not go to Delhi to organise a protest against Union government. Maybe he is scared of the Enforcement Directorate,” she quipped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/protest-by-akalis-a-political-gimmick-congress/story-WHAXDEVkNsyiWAoSQjrwIM.html
04-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana assembly session: Abhay Chautala to move private member’s Bills seeking amendment in farm laws||Former leader of opposition in Haryana assembly and INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala has submitted three private member’s Bills to speaker Gian Chand Gupta, seeking guarantee that farmers’ produce will not be sold or bought below the minimum support price (MSP). The Bills will be tabled during the two-day monsoon assembly session starting Thursday and the issue is expected to dominate the proceedings. Chautala, an INLD MLA from Ellenabad, said he has submitted the Bills seeking amendments in the recently enacted agriculture trade laws by the central government. The assembly secretariat has referred the Bills to agriculture and food and supplies department to explain the government’s viewpoint. The three private member’s Bills—The farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assurance and farm services (special provisions and Haryana amendment) Bill, 2020, the farmers’ produce trade and commerce (promotion and facilitation) (special provisions and Haryana amendment) Bill, 2020 and the essential commodities (special provisions and Haryana amendment) Bill, 2020—are on the lines of Bills passed by the Punjab assembly recently. As per the provisions of the farmers (empowerment and protection) agreement on price assurance and farm services (special provisions and Haryana amendment) Bill, no sale or purchase of wheat, paddy, bajra, maize, sunflower seed, mustard, pulses and cotton will be valid unless the price paid for such agricultural produce under a farming agreement is equal to, or greater than, the MSP announced by the Centre. The Bill also provides for a three-year imprisonment and fine for a person, company or corporate house which compels farmers to enter into a contract or sell his agricultural produce at a price below the MSP. Chautala said he will push for the enactment of the laws proposed by him as they were in the interest of farmers. “Since the Congress which is the principal opposition group in the assembly has nothing to offer on this issue, I am fulfilling the role of the opposition in the House. The Congress leaders are busy in their internal bickering,” he said. The INLD leader said central laws would nullify the MSP mechanism guaranteed through the existing structure of agriculture produce market committees that has stood the test of time. “The government has introduced a trading mechanism through these Central acts that is vulnerable to encroachment and manipulation by vested corporate interests leaving the farmer open to vagaries of market forces for getting an optimum price for agriculture produce, fruits and vegetables,” he said. Chautala said a large number of farmers in Haryana own less than five acres and a majority of them own less than two acres. “They have limited or no access to multiple markets with an inherent handicap of bargaining power to negotiate fair price contracts. They need proper protection by the state government to ensure a level playing field, prevent exploitation and an optimum guarantee of fair market price for the agriculture produce. This is the primary and principal responsibility of the state government which has been overlooked by the central laws,” he added. Meanwhile, Congress MLA from Dabwali Amit Sihag has signed a memorandum to protest the enactment of three agricultural marketing laws by the Centre. The memorandum is addressed to President Ram Nath Kovind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-assembly-session-abhay-chautala-to-move-private-member-s-bills-seeking-amendment-in-farm-laws/story-p8v67Lwxz4OdtxXeg344FJ.html

The UT administration on Wednesday gave the go-ahead to Punjab University to hold the test at the earliest. The UT personnel department wrote to the University Institute of Applied Management Sciences, PU, to hold the typing test/examination for recruitment of clerks and stenos following due Covid protocols. The test is being conducted to fill over 400 posts of clerks and steno-typists in the UT administration for group ‘C’ posts under the Recruitment Rules, 2015, on a regular basis. The administration had entrusted PU to conduct the typing test last year. The written examination was held last year on December 22 and, the result for the same was announced in February this year. The typing test was to be conducted in March but, the process was halted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The candidates, who had cleared the written exam, have been demanding conduct of the typing test since the lockdown restrictions were removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/typing-test-for-chandigarh-admin-s-clerk-steno-typist-posts-to-be-held-soon/story-kktq6pPdXFUwzSBozd8zUK.html
04-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana assembly session: Dushyant to table private sector job quota Bill in House||A Bill providing 75% reservation in private sector jobs in Haryana will be tabled in the two-day assembly session starting on Thursday. JJP leader and deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala, who piloted the private quota move, is expected to move the Bill in the House in his capacity as labour and employment minister. The cabinet had in October withdrawn an ordinance approved by it earlier for providing 75% private sector quota. The ordinance though was not promulgated by the governor, who had reserved it for consideration of the President. The Bill replacing the ordinance is expected to be a replica and will also require the assent of the President, officials said. Article 201 of the Constitution says that the President can either declare that he assents to the proposed law or that he withholds assent. The President can also direct the governor to return it to the House for reconsideration. The move to introduce reservation for local youth in private-sector jobs is on the lines of a law enacted by YS Jaganmohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh which has been challenged on the question of constitutional validity in the high court. The proposed law The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Bill, 2020, the proposed law, aims to provide 75 % employment to local candidates for jobs having salary of less than Rs 50,000 per month in private companies, societies, trusts, limited liability partnership firms, partnership firms etc situated in Haryana. However, employers will also have the option to recruit local candidates from one district to the extent of only 10%. The proposed law also contains an exemption clause if suitable local candidates are not available for a particular category of industry. Presidential assent required due to overriding clause The ordinance was reserved for the President’s consideration as its Section 23 gave it an overriding effect over other laws and has the potential to be repugnant to an Act of the Parliament. The clause providing for preference in jobs to the local candidates domiciled in Haryana also was seemingly in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution pertaining to equality before the law and Article 19 (1)(g), which provides for protection of certain rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. The Constitution does not provide a time limit for the President to give assent to a Bill or withhold it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-assembly-session-dushyant-to-table-private-sector-job-quota-bill-in-house/story-VgQz9FBbaPLWdBVcm0m5XK.html
04-11-2020||City||Haryana farmers intensify protest against agriculture laws, call for statewide chakka jam on November 5||Farmer leaders in Haryana have decided to intensify their agitation against the three agriculture laws by blocking national and state highways on Thursday. Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni said several farmer unions have extended their support to the statewide chakka jam call from 12pm to 4pm. He said they have decided to block NH 44 (Chandigarh-Delhi) highway near Raipur Roran village of Nilokheri in Karnal district. In a video message, Charuni urged farmers to support the protest by blocking the national and state highways in their respective districts. Harpal Singh, BKU state secretary, said they have decided to block some selected highways in Karnal, Kaithal, Rohtak, Sonepat and Hisar districts. As per reports, the farmer leaders have been contacting commission agents and other people associated with the mandi system, traders and labourers to join the protest. He said the farmers will not block link roads. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav said preparations have been made to deal with the situation. “Efforts will be made to ensure the roads are not blocked and if required, the traffic from NH-44 will be diverted,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-farmers-intensify-protest-against-agriculture-laws-call-for-statewide-chakka-jam-on-november-5/story-zRXyB0vwslMY6FR7lllzJK.html
04-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram exceeds target coverage of polio vaccine by nearly 15 percent||As part of a three-day intensified pulse polio immunisation (IPPI) drive, conducted earlier this week, an estimated 2,400 healthcare workers in the district immunised over 180,000 children under the age of five, by administering them drops of the oral polio vaccine (OPV). With this drive, the health department exceeded its target, pegged at covering 160,000 infants, by nearly 15 percent. On an average, 72 children were immunised per healthcare worker involved in the campaign.Health department officials said that while it is not uncommon for such immunisation drives to exceed their coverage targets, doing so amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic proved to be especially challenging, with a majority of the district’s healthcare workers currently being involved in the pandemic response. Dr Naresh Garg, district immunisation officer, Gurugram, explained that an IPPI, which is conducted three to four times a year, usually enlists as many as 8,000 to 10,000 healthcare workers for door-to-door vaccination campaigns. The IPPI drive conducted in September and November this year, however, relied on not more than 2,500 healthcare to meet the same targets.“A large portion of our staff is still engaged in the response to Covid-19. As such, this year, only about 2,240 healthcare workers, along with 176 supervising officers, were enlisted to carry out the IPPI drive earlier in September and now this month. In both cases, the field staff have had to work doubly hard to cover the same numbers. Our annual coverage target is 3.5 lakh children — the same as 2019. Like last year, it has been adequately met,” said Garg, adding that the department has also relied on assistance from volunteer NGOs working in the field of public health, as well as several ASHA (accredited social health activist) workers at the primary healthcare centre (PHC) level. Health department data shows that a total of 184,849 children under the age five have been covered in the recently concluded IPPI. This was done as part of a sub-national immunisation campaign, which covered high-risk areas in 13 districts of Haryana. An earlier sub-national IPPI, held from September 22 to 24, had successfully immunised 128,529 children against polio (against a target coverage of 110,000 children) while at least another 0.1 million children were immunised early this year, as part of a National Immunisation Day campaign.To make full use of their limited manpower this year, Garg said, health department staff, volunteers and contractual National Health Mission (NHM) staff carried out door-to-door awareness campaigns in high-risk areas, such as Tigra, Badshahpur, Wazirabad, Laxman Vihar and others, early last week, to let people know of the upcoming immunisation drive. “On Sunday, which was the first day of the IPPI, the outreach exercises successfully brought 87,701 children to about 400 pulse polio booths set up across PHCs and their sub-centres, allowing us to meet half our target in just one day,” said Garg.Another 97,148 children were subsequently immunised on Monday and Tuesday in door-to-door vaccine drives conducted across the district by nearly 1,000 mobile teams, comprising two-members each, which in previous years were carried out by four-member teams. The entire exercise was overviewed by Dr Bindu Yadav, the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) surveillance medical officer in Gurugram, who said, “Polio drives are extremely manpower intensive, since we have to cover an extremely large number of children over several districts. It is a feat in itself that officials have been able to meet their targets with fewer resources this year. Each individual involved in the polio response has had to work to their fullest ability.”However, she also added that a slight rejigging in immunisation criteria has also facilitated meeting of these targets. “Usually IPPIs cover a larger area, geographically speaking. This time, the drives were intensified in areas deemed especially high-risk. Therefore, we covered more people in smaller areas,” she said. Yadav pointed out that these areas are also those which are at the highest risk of Covid-19, due to poor sanitary conditions and densely packed homes.Health department data shows that, out of the 18 primary healthcare centre blocks in Gurugram, only two blocks have not met their targeted coverage of the oral polio vaccine. These are Farukhnagar (where 96% of the target was met), and Bhora Kalan (which met only 85% of the target ). Officials said this was not alarming. “It is not uncommon for a couple of areas to have less coverage. These are typically poorer pockets with migrant populations that move around frequently. Overall though, we have been able to meet last year’s coverage target,” said Garg.The last case of polio detected in Haryana dates back to 2011. The state was declared polio-free in 2014. However, immunisation drives against the infectious viral disease are important as they continue to resist the possibility of transboundary entry of the virus into the community. In addition, the health department also audits all registered cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in the district to check for the re-emergence of the virus. While officials were not able to provide data on AFP cases detected this year, they admitted it has been less than the previous years. “This is due to weakened disease surveillance in the face of pandemic, not because there are actually fewer number of cases of AFP. Therefore, meeting immunisation targets becomes all the more important, since surveillance is already affected,” Yadav added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-exceeds-target-coverage-of-polio-vaccine-by-nearly-15-percent/story-yURd8zX3h6ZxhZaGKOZz2J.html
04-11-2020||Gurugram||HSPCB study to assess sources of pollution in four cities unlikely to begin this winter||A study to comprehensively assess the sources of air and noise pollution in Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonipat and Panipat is unlikely to commence this winter, despite being floated by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) a year ago, in November 2019. The HSPCB’s proposal for the study, which is known as a source apportionment study, received only a solitary bid from a Delhi-based research organisation, which officials said was not enough to proceed with the study.Jai Bhagwan Sharma, senior scientist, HSPCB, Panchkula, who is overseeing the study, said that while an expression of interest (EOI) for the study was floated in November last year, the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown resulted in a delay. “When we took stock of the bids received, we found that only a single Delhi-based research institute had approached us to conduct the study in all four cities. A committee was then formed to comb through the finer details of the proposal. The committee met on September 28 and it was decided to issue a new EOI, so that we can receive more bids and pick the most viable option,” Sharma said.Sharma added that the study, which is expected to last at least 18 months from the date of commencement, is unlikely to commence this winter cycle as originally intended. The study is being commissioned by the HSPCB under the aegis of the Centre’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). While such studies have been earlier commissioned by the Delhi government, they have not yet been carried out in the satellite towns of Delhi-NCR. “In Delhi, there are two official studies, which were conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri). We are aiming to engage an institution of similar repute for our subject cities,” said S Narayanan, member secretary, HSPCB.Officials added that the study is being undertaken pursuant to the ‘Comprehensive Action Plan for Clean Air for Cities of Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Panipat in Haryana’, which was drafted earlier last year, and is a part of the NCAP. Gurugram and Faridabad were added to the list of initial 102 non-attainment cities covered under the NCAP in July 2019. A non-attainment city is one where the prescribed National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are not followed.“Since the implementation of same interventions in two cities, having different meteorology, topography and different typology of air polluting sources, is unlikely to give same results, the choice of interventions to control urban air pollution has to be city specific, drawn on the basis of scientific study (sic),” states the EOI issued last November by the HSPCB. The EOI further states, “The aim of the study is to promote and demonstrate a more rational & proactive approach to air quality management in urban areas (sic).” The study, officials explained, will be based largely based on 90 days of ambient air quality monitoring conducted over the summer, monsoon and winter, to demonstrate and quantify the seasonal variations in air pollution. The daily sampling times will further be divided into three eight-hour sessions (06.00 hours to 14.00 hours, 14.00 hours to 22.00 hours, and 22.00 hours to 06.00 hours), which will capture the diurnal variations in sources and meteorology of air pollution. This study will also involve a systematic survey of vehicle population with an emphasis on vehicles older than 20 years. The aim is to find cost-effective solutions to curb their emissions as these represent a major portion of the city’s total vehicular population.“On completion of data collection, validation and interpretation of the assimilated information, a detailed road map will be drawn considering all possible measures for air quality improvement. These measures will be classified into short and long terms with due priority to low-cost measures that can give maximum benefit,” the HSPCB’s EOI goes on to state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hspcb-study-to-assess-sources-of-pollution-in-four-cities-unlikely-to-begin-this-winter/story-8fkDNkuouAipkqg1khbCuK.html
04-11-2020||Gurugram||Mercury rises, favourable wind direction keeps air quality ‘poor’||The minimum temperature of the city increased to 14.1 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, from 12 degrees Celsius recorded on Tuesday, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Palam observatory in Delhi. The city had recorded the lowest minimum temperature on Sunday at 10.2 degrees Celsius. IMD officials said that the minimum temperature is expected to increase further on Thursday. “The minimum temperature has increased today and we expect it to rise further on Thursday. It can stay around 11 in Delhi-NCR. We do not expect a cold wave in the next two days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional weather forecasting centre. A maximum temperature of 26.6 degrees Celsius was recorded, which was four degrees Celsius below the normal. The IMD has forecast a maximum temperature of 29 degrees Celsius for the week. Srivastava said that poor visibility is, however, expected on Thursday on account of poor air quality. “The pollution level has increased due to which visibility will remain low. Shallow to moderate fog is expected to prevail tomorrow,” said Srivastava. Air quality in the city remained in the ‘poor’ category, with a reading of 296 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This was up from Tuesday’s reading of 270, which experts attributed to slower winds, leading to an accumulation of airborne pollutants. However, the northwesterly direction of prevailing winds remains favourable for Gurugram, which was the only major NCR city to record ‘poor’ quality air on Wednesday. Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Noida all recorded ‘very poor’ air quality on the day.With northwesterly winds, with speeds of 5 to 15kmph, expected to prevail on Thursday as well, Gurugram may see yet another day of ‘poor’ air before the situation deteriorates further. The forecasted AQI for the city on Thursday, as per the CPCB’s central control room for air quality management, is 297. As per the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “Air quality is likely to remain in lower end of Very Poor category on 04.11.2020 and higher end of very poor category on 05.11.2020.” However, experts said that Gurugram may see better air quality than other parts of the region until wind patterns change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mercury-rises-favourable-wind-direction-keeps-air-quality-poor/story-CsNpTKkLI4TRxL6nwRM7OM.html
04-11-2020||Gurugram||Golf Course Ext Road, one of the most dangerous since lockdown||The Golf Course Extension Road has become one of the most dangerous spots for commuters during nights. In the last month, many commuters have fallen victim to robbers, who operate on this stretch on motorbikes up to the Kherki Daula toll plaza via southern peripheral road (SPR), the police said.The police have attributed the recent surge in increased criminal activities to outlaws who were forced to remain indoors during the lockdown. The police also said that most of the streetlights are also defunct, which makes it further unsafe.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they have arrested more than 50 criminals from this stretch, many of whom were drug addicts and had robbed commuters of their vehicles and belongings. “The suspects arrested were majorly from Nuh and Rajasthan. They sell the vehicles for half the price to dealers in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Some of them carry out thefts to fund their drug addictions,” he said.The police said that 13 carjacking cases have been reported on this 14-kilometre stretch since the lockdown.Sangwan said that crime on the stretch has seen a sharp increase after lockdown. “We are conducting nakabandis, gathering intelligence and also conducting raids based on the information we have received regarding the suspects,” he said.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said the crucial part of the process is keeping a tab on those recently released from Bhondsi jail. “The process involves gathering intelligence from informants about the suspects’ latest activities and whether they were involved in similar activities on the same stretch,” he said.Rao said the biggest challenge is to identify the suspected vehicles due to darkness on the stretch.Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), which is responsible for the streetlights on the stretch, assured action soon.Arun Dhankhar, the superintendent engineer of HSVP, said that they regularly check streetlights on this stretch but some miscreants damage them intentionally. “We have directed the electrical team to repair the damaged light at the earliest. We are taking a stock of the situation on the entire stretch and a team will be sent every night to check if any lights are non-functional” he said.Residents of Golf Course Extension Road said they are scared to step on to the roads at night. “It has been more than 15 days since we complained about the absence of streetlights, but no one from the agency responsible has come to solve the problem. It is scary to drive on Golf Course Extension Road at night,” said Vaibhav Jaiswal, a resident of Unitech Escape on Golf Course Extension Road.Rao said they are increasing police patrolling in the areas where lighting is poor. Special care is taken in sectors that have offices and markets. “We have also deployed three PCR vans on the stretch to attend to any emergency,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/golf-course-ext-road-one-of-the-most-dangerous-since-lockdown/story-0L4VtZxOKJTNbKkHCiqNsJ.html

She is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Sector 38 and her condition is stated to be critical.According to the police, the woman and her soon-to-be fiance were returning home in a car after having dinner, when assailants fired at them after a failed attempt to rob them of their car.The woman, Pooja Sharma, of Chhattisgarh, lives in a rented accommodation in Sector 40. Sharma and her companion, Sagar Manchanda (30), of Roorkee in Uttarakhand, work for a multinational IT company in Gurugram. The police said that they were about to get engaged.The incident took place after 11pm, when they were out for a drive and Sharma was at the wheel.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said that Sharma started driving the vehicle after crossing Kherki Daula toll plaza towards Southern Peripheral Road (SPR). Both of them went to see Manchanda’s under-construction apartment in Sector 65, near Golf Course Extension Road.“While they were returning to Sector 40, after crossing the road near an international school, they spotted three men on a motorbike approaching them on the wrong side on the road. When the trio intercepted them, Sharma applied brakes. Two men got down and pointed pistols at their glass window panes,” he said.Manchanda said they had immediately locked the car as they were scared. “One man came to my side and asked to roll down the window. Another went towards Pooja’s side. One of them shot at me as I did not follow his instruction but I escaped. Seeing this, Pooja tried to press the accelerator and the suspect standing close to her glass window shot her in the head,” he said.Manchanda said the three suspects, upon seeing Sharma fall on the steering wheel, fled the spot on their motorbike. “I had no time to shift Pooja from the seat. I sat on her legs and drove towards a private hospital in Sector 38 and informed the police and her family members,” he said. He shifted her with help of a person after crossing the stretch, where he saw movement of people.A team from the Sector 65 police station that was patrolling in the stretch reached the spot and later the hospital. They recorded Manchanda’s statement, based on which a case under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 34 (common intention of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections of Arms Act, 1959, was registered at Sector 65 police station against unidentified masked men. A probe is in progress, said police.Sangwan said that Manchanda, in his statement, told police that they had dinner at a restaurant in Sector 31 and left for a drive towards the Delhi-Jaipur Expressway around 8pm. After crossing Kherki Daula toll plaza, they took left on the SPR and visited a society in Sector 65, as he wanted to show her his apartment. “They had crossed the Sector 65 road around 11.15pm when they spotted three masked men on a motorbike, but ignored them. The trio then followed them from the wrong side after they crossed the road,” he said.The police are scanning CCTV camera footage from different locations to identify the suspects. Sangwan said they are probing all the details and also looking at an angle of possible rivalry. “We have recovered more than nine CCTV footage where the car and motorbike are seen, but due to it being dark, we could not identify the bike’s registration number. The exact reason will be ascertained after the suspects are arrested,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-shot-at-in-robbery-attempt-near-golf-course-extension-road/story-83uEC6mTysgSitg56QDX8N.html
04-11-2020||Gurugram||Speed calming measures introduced at Sikanderpur underpass||In a bid to check speeding and high-speed collisions, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and DLF have installed rumble strips, a speed calming measure, on the 3.5-kilometre accident-prone stretch between Shankar Chowk and Bristol Chowk over the last week.The 3.5-kilometre route facilitates movement through the Golf Course Road-Cyber City stretches, via the Sikanderpur underpass. The GMDA has installed four sets of rumble strips, two on each carriageway inside the Sikanderpur underpass, on opposite ends.Each set of rumble strips has three parts, a series of six continuous strips, followed by 10, and another six, all located within a short distance of each other.“We have installed rumble strips inside the Sikanderpur underpass as an experiment to see if it can be an effective and safe speed calming measure. If not properly designed and placed carefully, rumble strips can be dangerous, especially inside underpasses, as it can lead drivers to lose control of their vehicles. However, this experiment has been successful and has prompted us to consider using them at other points across the city,” said VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA.Kundu further said that the rationale behind introducing rumble strips was to check speeds on the accident-prone stretch and reduce the chances of collisions.Although Kundu said that the next locations for installing rumble strips are still under consideration, GMDA officials privy to the matter said that the DLF Phases 1/4 underpass and Genpact underpass on the Golf Course Road are likely to be the next locations.In January, GMDA had floated a Rs 8 lakh-tender for installing rumble strips inside the Sikanderpur underpass. However, due to the coronavirus outbreak, the project had to be indefinitely postponed.DLF, the caretaker of the Golf Course Road and Cyber City stretches, has also installed a set of rumble strips on both the carriageways of Cyber City Road opposite Infinity Towers, just ahead of the foot overbridge.DLF officials said that they are also planning on installing rumble strips at the road bends opposite building number 9 and Belvedere Park, in the future.“After deliberating upon various speed calming measures, DLF finalised rumble strips as the preferred option. Unlike speed breakers, these reduce the speed of vehicles in such a manner that there is no traffic build-up resulting in snarls. By placing rumble strips at short intervals, vehicles can no longer travel at high speeds, and thus the chances of accidents also reduce significantly. DLF is planning on installing rumble strips on more such stretches,” said David Amalraj, director, DLF Estate Developers Ltd.Besides the rumble strips, signage depicting a speed limit of 50 kmph has also been placed at various points along the 3.5-kilometre stretch by DLF officials.Since the redesign of the Golf Course Road-Cyber City roads in 2017, several high-speed accidents leading to fatalities have been reported. Three months ago, a 49-year-old man died after being hit by a speeding sedan opposite Belvedere Park. In May 2018, two people died and a woman co-pilot with a commercial airliner was severely injured after their cab collided with an SUV that was travelling on the wrong side of the Sikanderpur underpass.Sewa Ram, an urban transport systems design expert and a faculty member at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said that as per the Indian Road Congress (IRC) guidelines, speed breakers cannot be placed on main roads such as Golf Course Road or Cyber City roads, as it would lead to traffic congestion.“In the absence of speed breakers, installing rumble strips makes sense in regards to checking the speed of vehicles, especially due to the fact that there are several curves and sharp bends on the Bristol Chowk-Shankar Chowk stretch. It is also important for authorities to install stud reflectors on top of the rumble strips to ensure these are visible at night, along with installing signage cautioning commuters about approaching rumble strips,” said Sewa Ram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/speed-calming-measures-introduced-at-sikanderpur-underpass/story-qu4VAen5zmVLEwklT53hGJ.html
04-11-2020||Gurugram||Haryana government drafts policy for affordable rental housing projects||The Haryana government has come up with a policy for the development of rental housing projects meant only for local and migrant workers, who are not in a position to buy property due to financial reasons. This rental housing policy — the draft of which was made public on Monday — aims to facilitate the development of apartments in the affordable segment exclusively for corporate executives, and industrial and migrant workers. As per the officials of the department of town and country planning(DTCP), all housing projects developed under the affordable rental policy can only be offered on rent for a minimum period of one year and maximum period of 99 years. These units, however, cannot be sold under the Haryana Apartment Ownership Act or under any other existing laws. This is meant to ensure that the ownership of project remains undivided, said officials. To encourage the participation of corporates and industries, the policy allows the developer to enter into tie-ups with one or more industrial units or corporates to cater to the housing requirements for their workers on both short-term and long-term basis. DTCP officials said that projects across the state will be granted permission and minimum area required for setting up a project would be 0.5 acres while the maximum area would be 2 acres. The proposed site should have an access road of minimum 12 metres, the draft policy states. The minimum and maximum number of persons allowed per acre would be 1,000 and 1,600 respectively. The policy proposes to fix the floor area ratio at 250, the ground coverage at 50% and keeps 4% area for the development of commercial establishments like shops. The size of the apartments would be between 20 square metres and 50 square metres. The developer will also have to provide parking for two-wheelers depending on the area. A facility for a community hall and anganwari-cum-creche would also have to be a part of these affordable rental housing projects, the draft policy states.Makrand Pandurang, director, DTCP, said that this policy has been drafted to ensure that affordable housing is made available to those people who want it on rent. “The chief minister had announced this plan in his budget speech and this policy aims to provide rental housing to industrial and migrant workers, who are in the need of affordable housing. Further, such projects will be easier to set up as only CLU (change of land use) permission will required,” Pandurang said, adding that small plots in villages, labour clusters and leftover plots can be developed for these projects. A senior DTCP official said that the decision on rent would be based on area, facilities and location but will be kept within affordable limits. “The decision on rent will be taken at the time of finalising this policy and it will be reasonable so that working-class people can afford it. A monitoring committee headed by deputy commissioner and senior DTCP officials will keep a close watch on every aspect, including rentals,” he said. City-based developers, meanwhile, said that affordable rental policy was positive move with huge potential in the near future. “This policy will create newer avenues for housing for the common people. However, there should not be a cap on the project area and the sale of individual units should be allowed because individual investors will not be able put their money in these projects as they do it in commercial real estate projects,” said Pradeep Agarwal, managing director, Signature Developer, an affordable housing company.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-government-drafts-policy-for-affordable-rental-housing-projects/story-4r1YxMbOiztuv7AoFTOPSJ.html
04-11-2020||Gurugram||Colleges set to resume on Nov 16||The state higher education department on Tuesday issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) for the initiation of physical classroom sessions in colleges, in a staggered manner, from November 16. In the directive shared with universities and colleges in the state, the department said that research scholars and postgraduate students in science and technology would be allowed to visit colleges for the purpose of research and laboratory work, with generic preventive measures in place. Officials said that the same rules would be applied to undergraduate courses across the state. As per the guidelines, online/distance learning will continue to be the preferred mode of teaching and shall be encouraged. Students who wish to continue with online classes will be permitted to do so and attendance will not be enforced. Online classes in the state started from November 2. Pooja Khullar, principal of Dronacharya Government College, said that the college had prepared a timetable for different departments that would be updated in line with new directions before November 16. “We have received oral instructions regarding the staggered manner in which classes will take place for different courses. Students from different courses will be asked to appear for classes on different days. We are still awaiting details regarding the student strength that would be permitted,” said Khullar. She said that while online classes had started for most courses, the response of students has not been good. “From November 16, we are expecting more students to turn up since many face issues due to lack of devices or other connectivity issues. At the same time, there are concerns with people talking about the third wave of Covid-19 cases. For now, we will work towards putting in place adequate measures ahead of the reopening,” said Khullar. Ramesh Garg, principal of Government Girls College, Sector 14, said that while online classes had not been fully initiated in the college, normal classroom sessions are expected from November 16. “We will put in place a timetable for students and start physical classes as per government guidelines. Online classes have not been taking place due to exams right now, but from November 16, we expect classes to become regular,” said Garg. Srishti Yadav, a second-year BSc student of Government Girls College in Sector 14, said that while students were participating in online classes, connectivity continued to be an issue due to which students would prefer physical classroom sessions. “All students do not have access to mobile phones. Even when they have devices, there are network connectivity issues which prevent a seamless delivery of classes,” said Yadav. She said students had concerns due to the rising number of cases but would not be opposed to the idea of physical classroom sessions for clearing doubts. “Sometimes, due to connectivity and other issues, classes get delayed or disrupted. If given a chance to visit college, I would try and get my doubts cleared since there are some gaps in the online mechanism,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/colleges-set-to-resume-on-nov-16/story-iAty0MAeG9W94ZvHPcbLOJ.html
04-11-2020||Gurugram||Highest single-day spike in Covid cases sends alarm bells ringing||The district on Wednesday reported its highest single-day spike in coronavirus (Covid-19) infections, with 611 new cases recorded. The number of active cases also surpassed 4,000 infections, a week after the count hit the 3,000 mark.The daily new cases have increased by nearly 50% in less than two weeks, taking the tally of Covid-19 cases to 31,996. Experts said that the pandemic fatigue, indoor transmission of the virus during winter months and the reopening of business and outdoor activities will lead to further increase in the transmission if preventive steps are not taken.It is the fifth time since October 16 that a new single-day record spike was recorded. Virus resurgence to high levels started with 294 new infections recorded on October 16, which climbed to 304 on October 21 and further to 398 on October 24. An uptick of 498 new cases was reported on October 31, followed by 529 on November 1.The alarming increase in Covid-19 infections has also raised concerns over the increasing positivity rate — the ratio of positive cases to the total number of tests conducted — over the last two weeks.Data shows that weekly average positivity rate is now almost 15%, up from 12% reported in the last week of October. Epidemiologically, a higher positivity rate suggests higher transmission with more number of people who haven’t been tested yet. On whether the testing levels are keeping up with the disease transmission, experts said that the positivity rate is moderately high and there is a scope of increasing the testing instead of simply focusing on high-risk population.As per the district health department data, an average 3,000 tests are conducted daily, of which nearly 90% are administered through Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), the most reliable test for Covid-19. The rapid antigen tests have declined in the last one week as the health department has been running short of kits provided by the state government.“High positivity rate is due to testing of only high-risk people. It is, therefore, important to increase the testing to reduce the transmission, otherwise, it would lead to a further surge in infection,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious disease at the Indian Council of Medical Research.Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine department and school of public health, PGIMER-Chandigarh, said that positivity rate of Gurugram is moderately high. “Data shows that new Covid-19 cases have doubled in less than two weeks. Considering the incubation period of the infection, which is five to seven days, the new 611 confirmed cases contracted the virus five to six days back. In absence of precautionary norms or testing, the infection can double to 1,200 in next one week,” said Kumar.Taking results of the second serological survey of Gurugram into account, Kumar said that nearly 70% of the population is susceptible to infection. “Results shows that nearly 26% population in urban areas of Gurugram has developed antibodies against infection, which means nearly 74% are vulnerable to the infection. With its dense population and increased mobility, Gurugram is seeing the outbreak of the pandemic within this susceptible population, which is huge,” said Kumar, suggesting that infection rate must be suppressed until a vaccine is available.According to Kumar, epidemiologically, without taking any precautionary measures, the coronavirus can impact near 60% of the susceptible population, which makes it crucial to suppress the infection. “It can be done in the current situation, but precautionary norms are to be taken seriously by citizens.”Kant said that if serious measures are not taken to curtail the infection then the existing health care infrastructure will be overburdened. “People who require timely treatment may be devoid of it if cases of Covid-19 continue to spread at the current pace. It is a bad situation across Delhi-NCR, as high transmission is taking place. Government has to take serious measures, which can be unpopular, to curtail the interaction and mixing of people to bring down the infection,” he said.In Gurugram, the district administration and health department, too, are issuing advisories as cases continue to mount. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Contact tracing will be increased to spread the transmission. It is high time for the citizens to take the deadly infection seriously, as rising numbers would now cast its impact on mortality in the next few months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/highest-single-day-spike-in-covid-cases-sends-alarm-bells-ringing/story-eMQ4wmZUxDokF7frvND0SP.html
04-11-2020||Chandigarh||Lawyer’s remarks against court: HC imposes Rs 50,000 fine on petitioner||The Punjab and Haryana high court has imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on a Kaithal resident, whose counsel when faced with dismissal of petition told the court that he “had been instrumental in making many a judge.”The court also imposed ₹50,000 on the man fine for ‘concealment of facts’.The order was passed by high court bench of justice Arun Monga, who was hearing a plea from Shiv Kumar Chauhan, seeking direction to deputy commissioner and superintendent of police to initiate action for committing a fraud by trust members of a private school in the district. As per the plea, the petitioner was removed ‘fraudulently’ by the trust members as secretary in 2016 but police did not act on his complaints.On November 3, when the court was about to pass dismissal order and impose a cost of ₹ 50,000 on the petitioner, his lawyer Sushil Gautam, the court says “very rowdily exuberates that paying costs is not an issue and he is even ready to pay ₹1 lakh towards the same”.“He also boisterously claims that he has been instrumental in making many a judges and how can his arguments/contentions, therefore, be rejected by this court to dismiss the instant petition,” says the order.The judge observed that the bench could have passed more strict order but it is taking a lenient view and preferring self-restraint from taking any further action and enhanced the fine on petitioner to ₹1 lakh in view of the lawyer’s behaviour.As per order, during the hearing it had come to light that two civil suits are pending on the controversy before a court but the petitioner could not satisfactorily state as to why this fact was not disclosed in the plea.It also said prima facie the dispute seems to be civil in nature and institution of the criminal proceedings is being sought for “collateral pressure and for settling private scores/gains”.The petitioner should have first approached the trial court for redressal of his grievance before coming to the high court, it added.The court recorded that the petitioner indulged in “subtle concealment” of facts and does not inspire any confidence for its intervention and therefore the fine was imposed to be deposited in Covid-19 fund of UT administration.Gautam said, “I am yet to get a copy of the order. If advised so by my client, I would file an appeal against it and make a complaint against relevant people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lawyer-s-remarks-against-court-hc-imposes-rs-50-000-fine-on-petitioner/story-jr2NzuI0WFZ9CbkpOaCFTO.html

04-11-2020||City||Day 1 of TATA Steel PGTI Players Championship 2020: With eight-under, Chandigarh’s Akshay shines bright||Chandigarh golfer Akshay Sharma, who played his last professional tour in February before the pandemic halted the competitive sporting activities in March, was on fire on Day 1 of the resumption of the country’s professional golf circuit during the TATA Steel PGTI Players Championship 2020 at Panchkula Golf Club on Wednesday.Akshay flawlessly finished first in the first round of the four-day event, with a card of eight-under-64. He was followed by Asian Tour regular Chikkarangappa of Bengaluru at six-under-66.The tournament, which is being played across two venues at Panchkula Golf Club and Chandigarh Golf Club, has a unique format: One half of the field will play their first round at Panchkula while the other half will play their first round at Chandigarh. In round two, both the halves of the field will switch venues. The third and fourth rounds will only be played at Panchkula.“This was my first competition after almost eight months, but I was fully prepared for the competitive circuit as I was regularly playing pro-pool rounds with fellow professionals these past few months. I am very happy that I played as per my expectations,” said 30-year-old Akshay.“From the beginning, I was quite accurate as I found all fairways and made 17 greens in regulation. Throughout the round I was enjoying my game and by the time I finished the first-nine, I knew I was going to wrap up today’s round with a great score.“Playing at Panchkula was the bigger challenge for me as Chandigarh is my home course. I didn’t expect to go so low here, so this score is like a bonus for me as I’m confident of doing well in Chandigarh tomorrow,” Akshay added.Day’s best score recorded at Chandigarh Golf ClubThe two leading scores of the day came from the Panchkula Golf Club, while Kolkata’s Sunit Chowrasia recorded the day’s best score at Chandigarh Golf Club of five-under-67, to occupy the third place. Another Chandigarh golfer Karandeep Kochhar shot a 68 at the Chandigarh club to be tied fourth along with Gurugram’s Manu Gandas.Former winner on the PGTI in 2018, Akshay was delighted to get off the blocks with an error-free round. His good placement on the fairways and greens at Panchkula set up five birdie putts within a range of three to four feet for him, which he went on to convert. He also sank three long birdie putts of 12 to 15 feet.Chikkarangappa, a 13-time winner on the PGTI, also got off to a splendid start on Wednesday, but had a contrasting round as compared to Akshay’s. Chikka sank nine birdies in exchange for three bogeys in a round where he made some tremendous recoveries after finding the hazard or the trees on at least four occasions. He also performed well with the putter draining four birdies from a range of 12 to 15 feet.Chandigarh’s Aadil Bedi and Patna’s Aman Raj were tied sixth with scores of 69; Delhi-based Rashid Khan, 70, was tied 13th; Udayan Mane, 71, of Pune, the PGTI Order of Merit leader was tied 20th; Chandigarh’s Ajeetesh Sandhu, 72, was tied 29th; and Khalin Joshi, 74, and Viraj Madappa, 74, were both tied 47th.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/day-1-of-tata-steel-pgti-players-championship-2020-with-eight-under-chandigarh-s-akshay-shines-bright/story-r74FcEO1PV9Ie0M752QbhO.html

The varsity’s distance education wing, Institute of Distance and Open Learning (IDOL), revealed on Wednesday that three of their students appeared for their third-year Bachelor in Arts (BA) exams from the United States of America, France and Germany this year.State university exams were held online for the first time this year due to the increasing Covid-19 cases and the resultant lockdown. “Exams for IDOL’s third-year BA students started on October 26 and concluded on November 4. Three students managed to appear for their papers successfully from abroad and we’re happy that they didn’t to travel for the examinations,” said the spokesperson for IDOL. While one of the student had to travel to Germany for work before appearing for his exams, the other two were studying and working in the USA and France and could sit for their exams from their respective residences. “Two of the students were from third-year BA (Economics) while the third was from the third-year BA (English) batch of IDOL. They all gave successful feedback to the exam process,” added the spokesperson.IDOL exams had to be rescheduled this year after the first session in the first week of October was marred by technical glitches that left around 9,000 third-year Bachelor of Commerce (BCom) and BA students unable to appear for the tests online.While the rescheduled backlog exams were held on Google forms on October 19, 20 and 21, the exams for fresh candidates were conducted by a new service provider hired by the university in the last week of October.The contract with the original exam service provider, LittleMORE Innovation Labs, was cancelled after the incident. The university approved a new service provider, Pune-based Splashgain Technology Solutions, last week to conduct the online exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/three-students-of-university-of-mumbai-s-idol-appear-for-ba-online-exam-from-abroad/story-14yoEBMoZvg5AbJvBbndeK.html
04-11-2020||Delhi||DJB requests Union Home ministry’s intervention for pending bills by Delhi police||Delhi Jal Board vice chairperson Raghav Chadha on Wednesday asked for union home ministry’s intervention regarding Delhi Police’s pending bill of R607 crore to the water board. Chadha on Wednesday met union minister of state for home affairs, G Kishan Reddy requesting him to direct the Delhi police to release the funds they owe to the DJB. “The VC requested the minister’s intervention in recovering the dues running into Rs 607 crore, so that the financial challenges facing the board can be overcome,” the DJB said in a statement. Chadha told the minister that the water utility had sent multiple show cause notices to Delhi Police, but did not get any response. “This has hindered the smooth expedition of the functions and duties of the board, which is doing the groundwork for expanding its operations, and bringing about revolutionary changes in the current structure of water supply as well as water management,” the statement read. “All of this requires regular flow of finances. Releasing the dues owed to the DJB would go a long way in meeting necessary and immediate expenses,” it said. Chadha said that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic condition of the state government is in a bad shape and the Delhi government wants to complete all such pending transactions. In September, Chadha had said that around seven government agencies had not cleared the bills of the DJB. “Railways owes Rs 3,283 crore to the DJB for the services provided by it, while the CPWD (Central Public Works Department) has to clear dues amounting to Rs 190 crore,” Chadha had said. The DDA owes Rs 128 crore, East Delhi Municipal Corporation Rs 49 crore, North Delhi Municipal Corporation Rs 2,466 crore and South Delhi Municipal Corporation Rs 81 crore, the DJB vice-chairman had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/djb-requests-union-home-ministry-s-intervention-for-pending-bills-by-delhi-police/story-QFcq4xDplDEJVKvHmP3dhI.html
04-11-2020||City||Chandigarh-Kharar flyover project: Ludhiana link to open on December 15||Having missed several deadlines, the Mohali administration has finally set December 15 as the date for opening the Ludhiana link of the Chandigarh-Kharar flyover project, while the Rupnagar link is expected to get completed by January 15 next year.Kharar sub-divisional magistrate Himanshu Jain, who met National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and Larsen & Toubro officials on Wednesday, said that after reviewing the work, December 15 has been set as the deadline for opening the Ludhiana side of the flyover for vehicular traffic.“The work is being done on a war footing and 88% has been completed. The Rupnagar side of the flyover will also be opened by January 15,” he said.A senior NHAI official, who did not wish to be named, said the work on stretches near Desumajra and Sunny Enclave in Kharar will be completed as soon as the work on the Khanpur bridge is over. “We are now in a hurry to complete the project as it is already delayed,” he said.The national highway where the flyover is coming up connects Chandigarh to parts of Punjab besides Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. This leaves Kharar as a major bottleneck. About 50,000 vehicles cross the stretch on an average daily. The project, which entails widening of the road between Balongi and Kharar T-point and includes construction of two flyovers and three minor bridges, has been hanging fire for the past five years. The total length of the flyovers (divided into three parts) is around 10km. The ₹368-crore project being executed by Larsen & Toubro was initiated in November 2015 and has missed six deadlines, after initially poised to be completed in three years by December 2018. From delay in land acquisition to other administrative hurdles and mostly recently workforce issues amid the pandemic were the main reasons for the delay. The NHAI had recently opened 1-km stretch of the flyover starting from Balongi (called the Balongi flyover) for vehicular traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-kharar-flyover-project-ludhiana-link-to-open-on-december-15/story-qyE8VuIOmu3mmbjf9QF3AI.html

04-11-2020||City||St Stephen’s students raise concerns over fee, matter to be raised in governing body||New Delhi: Second and third-year class representatives at St Stephen’s College have written to the governing body over students being charged for electricity, water, IT, and library fee among other things despite non-usage of these facilities this semester.According to the students, the college on November 2 released the semester term bill, which said third-year hostellers would have to pay Rs 24,292 for this semester, including rent fine, for failing to vacate their rooms. The fee would come down to Rs 18,592 if the rent fine was exempted, students said. A third-year student, who is a day scholar, would have to pay Rs 18,580 this semester.Requesting anonymity, a signatory to the letter, said, “The hike in fee isn’t much but we had to raise our voices for being asked to pay for services not being used by us during the pandemic. Further, our college fee is much higher than other DU colleges and the administration needs to be transparent about where the money is being used.”In the letter sent to the governing body, students wrote, “Students have been charged for the following facilities despite non-usage this semester: Rs 2,400 for electricity and water fee, Rs 2,000 for internet resource centre and information technology (hiked from Rs 1,200 in the previous semester), and Rs 900 for library fee.”  “Newly admitted students have been charged on many services which they will not be able to avail anytime soon. We request if a roll-back of fee on these heads be made possible or an assured refund at a later stage for students.”Nandita Narain, elected teacher representative on the governing body, said, “The teacher representatives in GB have been raising the issue of high fees. A meeting of the college governing body is scheduled for Thursday and I will raise this issue in the meeting. The students are perturbed about the term bill and I have written to the governing body on it.”Despite repeated requests, principal John Varghese and governing body chairperson Bishop Warris Masih did not comment on the matter.In the letter, students alleged the college has not provided any institutional support for online teaching-learning. “To date, we have not observed institutional support for online classes, apart from providing ad-hoc professors with institutional IDs to access GSuite, (freely accessible for educational institutions). Our professors have been using personal Zoom subscriptions or free versions of softwares. Professors and students have been incurring high costs for internet connections and devices. Hence, we are of the understanding that online education cannot be cited as a justification for an enhanced IRC fee, as it does not appear that any hardware, software or training support has been provided so far,” students wrote in the letter.The students have asked for an extension of the deadline for payment of fee and concessions on a case-to-case basis due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic impact on families. They raised questions on the Establishment Fee component which charges students Rs 9,600 per semester “without any transparency around its use.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/st-stephen-s-students-raise-concerns-over-fee-matter-to-be-raised-in-governing-body/story-Sn7icJcUsGEhnbDMC72Z6J.html
04-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s air quality gets poor||Chandigarh’s air quality turned poor for the first time this year on Wednesday.In the recent weeks, the Air Quality Index (AQI) stayed between 110 and 130 (moderate level), before starting to rise amid falling temperatures in the past two days, and crossed 200 at 2pm at the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station in Sector 25. In 2019, it was on the same date (November 4) that the year’s peak AQI of 335 was recorded in the city.The development comes at a time the Chandigarh administration is planning to ban the sale of firecrackers, fearing rise in Covid infections due to air pollution.Last Diwali, AQI at the monitoring station in Sector 25, which gives live data, had gone up from 237 the previous day to 272. The highest AQI was recorded at the observatory in Sector 22, where it had shot up to 372 (very poor).“The hourly readings may have crossed the 200 mark, but the daily average up to November 3 is 155 at the monitoring station in Sector 25,” said Debendra Dalai, vice-chairman of Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee.Dalai said increase in AQI can be attributed to fall in the mercury, which leads to temperature inversion and decrease in wind speeds, and stubble burning going on in the region.AQI could worsen in coming daysSurender Paul, director, India Meteorological Department, Chandigarh, said: “Although there is no significant change in wind speeds in the city, an anticyclonic movement has started forming over the region. It creates an airlock, preventing any scattering of pollutant particles in vertical motion.”Paul said anticyclonic movement will continue in the city for the next few days, and with no rain likely in the city up to Diwali, the AQI could worsen if stubble burning increases in the region.The AQI this year is still not as bad as last year, mostly due to the lockdown.However, in the poor bracket, the air can cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. The prominent pollutant in the air is PM 2.5, produced by burning, construction works and automobiles. It is small in size due to which it can get directly absorbed into the blood stream and can cause asthma, lung cancer and even heart disease.Cracker ban decision likely todayAmid fear of second Covid wave, the Chandigarh administration is considering banning the sale of firecrackers. However, the decision, which was expected on Wednesday, has been put off.It is likely to be taken by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Thursday.Even though a draw of lots for allotment of 96 licences for the sale of firecrackers was held on Tuesday, the administration withheld issuance of the licences. The administration had taken views of health experts, who advised against the bursting of crackers. There is a concern that pollution caused by firecrackers may cause spike in coronavirus cases in the city, UT adviser Manoj Parida had said on Tuesday. The administration had even issued a health advisory, asking people to stay indoors and desist from bursting firecrackers in order to prevent air pollution and to protect the elderly and people with co-morbidities. Congress divided over the issueDevinder Singh Babla, Congress councillor and leader of opposition in the municipal corporation House, on Wednesday posted a request to Badnore on Twitter, seeking complete ban on firecrackers in Chandigarh during Diwali this year. “It will lead to pollution levels beyond control and will further worsen the Covid situation and lead to spike in cases, making it difficult for senior citizens to breath,” he wrote.However, party’s city chief Pardeep Chhabra along with three other local leaders wrote to the administration, demanding the sale of firecrackers “if they have no ill-effects”, stating the “Congress is with cracker traders”, whose livelihood would be affected otherwise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-air-quality-gets-poor/story-4RmRquxzWGtiOoPbZaaoFP.html

Delay in payment on behalf of the procurement agency, ahrtiyas, and bankers will not be tolerated,” Khattar said, while reviewing a meeting of officers engaged in paddy procurement. “The farmer must be paid first. No payment should be left pending before Diwali.” He said matching of “J-Form and I-Form” is an internal matter of the procurement process and they can be matched later. The CM said the validity of tokens issued to the farmers for November 14 should be extended till November 16, 17,18 and there should be no need to issue fresh tokens. He directed the officers to ensure that the generation of ‘H-Form to J-Form, Gate Pass, I-Form’ for paddy procurement, lifting from mandi to warehouse and approval of I-Form should be made online. He said they should ensure the farmer gets the payment for his purchase within one week of the release of the H-Form or within 72 hours of the receipt of the I-Form. Khattar also directed officials to fix responsibility of everyone from secretary of mandi board to commission agents, miller and transporter. He said a chart of the entire process should be prepared mandi-wise, farmer-wise, and ahrtiya-wise and should be uploaded on the website. He said the farmer should be made aware of the day on which his ‘H-Form’ has been released so that he can accordingly come to the mandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/farmers-must-receive-payment-for-procured-crops-within-7-days-khattar-to-officials/story-9MmAXsNBp2o50bdLlJe3MI.html
04-11-2020||City||Haryana agriculture department, HARSAC at loggerheads over farm fire data||The Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) and the state agriculture department have been divulging contrasting data on the number of farm fire incidents in the state so far this year.Officials of the state agriculture department have claimed that the data on Active Fire Locations (AFLs) provided by HARSAC is misleading. They say most of the AFLs spotted by HARSAC were not found during physical verification. Recently, in a meeting with the chief secretary, the deputy commissioners of various districts had also termed the HARSAC data inappropriate.According to the HARSAC, the state has registered a 40% increase in AFLs this year. However, the state agriculture department claimed that there has been 25% decline in the number of stubble burning incidents.As per the figures provided by HARSAC, the state has reported 6,109 AFLs till November 2 against 4,288 during the same period last year. The area under farm fires has also increased to about 27% with around 33,000 hectares burnt till November 1 as against 26,000 last year.On the other hand, the agriculture department claimed that only 3,225 incidents of stubble burning were reported in the state from October 1 to November 1 as against 4,344 last year. Officials say the farm fire incidents are less as compared to last four years.Jagminder Nain, joint director (agriculture engineering), agriculture department, said “The HARSAC data shows more incidents of stubble burning than the numbers reported by Indian Council for Agriculture Research. This year, farm fires are less as compared to last year as per the data collected by Indian Council for Agriculture Research.”Karam Chand, deputy director, agriculture department, said around 50% of the AFLs shown by HARSAC are not found on the ground. Out of 974 locations given by HARSAC in Kaithal district, 447 incidents were not found during physical verification.He said the variations in data has led to major confusion about AFLs and actual cases of stubble burning. “Also, 91 locations identified by our officers were not shown by HARSAC,” he claimed. HARSAC director VS Arya said, “I have nothing to say if any other department is raising questions over this data.” Earlier, he had said, “The resolution of the satellite is 375×375 meters and an AFL is within this area. The fire could be near or around the captured area. Also, the satellite does not capture small fires like those of cremation or heaps of burning garbage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-agriculture-department-harsac-at-loggerheads-over-farm-fire-data/story-pkraLYgYEo8PKmuK42O8TI.html

Director meteorological department Sonam Lotus said, “The weather is likely to remain partly cloudy with the possibility of light snow at isolated places in the higher reaches of the two Union Territories over the next two days,” he said, adding that there was no chance of heavy snowfall over the next 10 days. This year, summer in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) was unusually dry. Meteorologist Mohammad Hussain said, “The year, the weather in J&K was abnormally dry. The western disturbance brought negligible precipitation and rainfall between July and October (monsoon) was 35% below normal.” The Valley mostly owes its precipitation to the western disturbance — winds blowing from the Mediterranean Sea. Hussain attributed the dry weather to global and periodic weather changes: “J&K is still going through a high pressure zone and the new prediction of light snowfall will not affect the dry weather in the plains. The plains in the UTs will remain dry. The situation will remain the same for the next three and four weeks.” The minimum temperature in Srinagar on Tuesday was 1.2°C and 20.6°C. The lowest temperature in Kashmir (-0.7°C) was recorded at Pahalgam, while Ladakh recorded a minimum of -5.9°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/snowfall-likely-in-j-k-ladakh-over-next-two-days/story-SoFeu6ETK6CWEc0Xstf2zL.html
04-11-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal Pradesh resumes bus services to Delhi||Eight months after it suspended its services due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Himachal Pradesh Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) on Wednesday resumed the bus service to the national capital, Delhi. Inter-state travellers were relieved after the first bus for the day left at 5am. In all, 25 buses will ply on different routes from the state to Delhi daily. “The resumption of bus services to the national capital has come as a relief for passengers, particularly in the festive season,” said Rama Nand Thakur, in-charge of HRTC bus services at the Inter State Bus Terminus in Shimla. Stakeholders in the tourism sector have been demanding the resumption of deluxe coaches to Delhi, including Volvo services, to facilitate tourists with rail and air traffic hit by the pandemic. However, the government is yet to resume luxury bus services. SAFETY GUIDELINES TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY HRTC drivers have expressed apprehension about the rise in Covid-19 cases due to the visits to Delhi. “Though the government has issued the standard operating procedures for bus travel, we fear a rise in cases due to the Delhi trips,” says Hriday Sharma, who drove an HRTC bus to Delhi after eight months. The state government resumed bus services on 25 inter-state routes in the first phase on October 15. These include the bus service to Chandigarh, Pathankot, Baddi, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Ambala, and Haridwar. DECISION IN VIEW OF FESTIVE SEASON State transport minister Bikram Singh said that the government has taken this decision in view of the festive season. He said people had been demanding the resumption of inter-state bus services. Himachal Pradesh runs buses on 728 routes across the region, including Jammu, Ladakh, Kashmir, Chandigarh, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab and Rajasthan. The Himachal Pradesh Road Corporation, which has a fleet of 3,719 buses, is already running in loss due to the suspension of services. It earns Rs 54 lakh a day from its bus services and is already reeling under a loss of Rs 1,300 crore. Last year alone, it bore a loss of Rs 154 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-pradesh-resumes-bus-services-to-delhi/story-03yTRuQwdhWt0DZqXWxTxN.html

After which from September 30 to October 29, the admission process of students in the waiting list was done. However, more than 35,000 seats remained vacant under the RTE, so it was decided to extend the waiting list students’ admission process by one more week,” said Dinkar Patil, state primary education department director. This year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the RTE admission process was delayed. In 9,331 RTE registered schools in the state for this year, a total of 1, 15,460 RTE vacancies existed.

Parab said the arrest of the journalist is in no way an attack on the freedom of press and questioned if Goswami was a BJP worker.Goswami was arrested in Mumbai by Raigad police for allegedly abetting the suicide of 53-year-old interior designer Anvay Naik in 2018. Parab said that Naik’s widow had moved court seeking reinvestigation, and the police arrested Goswami after the court order.“This case is not connected to the freedom of press in any manner. BJP workers and leaders are complaining as if Arnab Goswami is their functionary and he was falsely arrested. He has been arrested in the case for further investigation. Where does the question of freedom of press or arise in this? Parab asked.Parab said that Naik had named Arnab Goswami and two others in his suicide note, alleging that they had not paid his fees, forcing him to end his life.“The investigation on this suicide was not done at that time. Anvay Naik’s wife moved court and it granted permission to police to investigate the case. He added, “I reiterate that there is no vindictive action or attack on freedom of press from the government. The investigation in the cases has restarted after a court order.”Also read | ‘No one is above the law’: Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on Arnab Goswami’s arrestSlamming its former ally, the Sena minister said, “The question here is why is BJP shielding Arnab Goswami. A Marathi woman lost her husband... The BJP is shielding a man because of whom the woman has lost her husband and is giving it an angle of Emergency and attack on freedom of the press. If a man is arrested in connection to a case, does it mean the state is going towards Emergency?” He asked why there was no hue and cry over the arrest of the other two accused in the case. “Does it mean that BJP wants to save a person because of whom a man was allegedly driven to suicide?”The Sena leader went on to call Goswami a “parrot” of BJP, who could squeal on those at whose behest the case was suppressed in the previous government. “BJP’s parrot has been arrested and put in the cage today. I think it will have to be investigated whether BJP’s life is in this parrot,” he said.Parab added that the state government would inquire why the case was not investigated properly when it came to light. He added, “Strict action will be taken against those police officers who are found to be guilty to suppress the case. The government will inquire in this matter,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/arnab-goswami-arrest-not-freedom-of-press-issue-why-s-bjp-complaining-asks-sena/story-EKG1YlJcHwI3qKTsvr1bDL.html

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has no record of such a death. The deceased, Kshetrimayum Borish, hailed from Kakching, Manipur. The institute’s statement reads, “Borish had approached the clinic on campus on Monday (October 26) and was advised of tests. In the meantime, the doctor was monitoring his condition. The test results showed low platelet counts, suggesting dengue, and prompted the clinic to admit him to a hospital on Wednesday (October 28). Sadly, Borish passed away in the hospital on Friday (October 30). He has tested positive for confirmed dengue and negative for Covid-19. This is a shocking loss to the IISER community, including Borish’s friends and colleagues and especially to his family back in Manipur. The IISER Pune community is doing a voluntary fund-raising from faculty and others to support the family in this time of grief.” Dr Sanjeev Wavare, head, PMC insect control department, said, “We have no report of this death as of yet. In fact, we have not reported any deaths due to dengue, swine flu, chikungunya or even malaria this season.” As per the PMC data, from January 2020 till November 1, the city has recorded 1,576 suspected dengue cases and 75 confirmed cases and no deaths. The data also claims 28 suspected cases of chikungunya this year and two cases of malaria. PMC staff has been working hard to control the Covid situation in the city, which has reported maximum cases in the country. The civic body has not recorded any serious case of monsoon ailments, namely dengue, malaria, chikungunya and swine flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/iiser-reports-one-dengue-casualty-pune-civic-body-says-no-death-reported-this-season/story-Bs1ageuEkV3AkFXV53cFKN.html
04-11-2020||Pune||Survey reveals presence of Covid antibodies in 33.9% of PCMC population||A population-based SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody survey conducted by Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has found the overall antibody seropositivity rate is 33.9%. The study was conducted by the community medicine department of DY Patil Medical College and medical department of PCMC. The survey was carried out from October 7-17. PCMC was divided in 200 clusters of which 25 random samples from each cluster were taken. Hence, a total of 5,000 samples were collected. The survey found that presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in women (33.8%) is more than men (28.9%). “We can say that of 25 lakh population of PCMC, approximately 8.5 lakh have presence of antibodies against Covid. We are seeing a downward curve, but we cannot relax as Diwali is a bigger festival than Navratri so all norms need to be followed by the people,” said Shravan Hardikar, PCMC commissioner. The administration has asked residents to strictly follow hygiene norms as the winter season is approaching and there are threats of other diseases. “Lowering the guard is not an option looking at world statistics where the second wave of Covid is currently on. We need to keep a strict check on other respiratory infections as well which will be on the rise in winter. Special watch should be kept on fever OPDs. If number of cases of respiratory diseases increases then it should be informed to the administration,” said Dr Subhash Salunke, Covid technical committee advisor. “While the survey conducted in Pune covered specific localities, samples from across all areas in PCMC were taken,” Hardikar said. Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer at Symbiosis hospital, said, “The recorded antibody seropositivity rate is good, but it is not enough to say that we have established herd immunity and there is nothing to worry. All precautions need to be in place. Around 60-70 per cent seropositivity in a population will establish herd immunity.” “It is a very small sample and is scattered all over PCMC. The case could have been more interesting if it was done in a more focussed area and findings have been made,” Natarajan said. Dr Sanjeev Bagai, senior consultant paediatrician, nephrologist and Padma Shree Presidential Awardee tweeted, “Miniature sample size makes a statistical significant value irrelevant. These are called “biased & convenient” sampling. Any sero survey must include all categories of age, comorbidities, POS timelines, non-hot zones.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/survey-reveals-presence-of-covid-antibodies-in-33-9-of-pcmc-population/story-jvCiRZUCpQxcK6uVy887AI.html
04-11-2020||City||Baghjan blowout: Oil India Limited operated well without mandatory clearances, says NGT panel||The Oil India Limited (OIL) was operating the natural gas well at Assam’s Baghjan without required permissions when the uncontrolled escape of oil and gas, or blowout, began there in May, a National Green Tribunal (NGT) panel has said. The panel has recommended legal action against the public sector company and its officials over the violations that led to the blowout. The well later caught fire in June that continues to rage five months on and has claimed three lives and destroyed nearby houses.The panel led by retired Gauhati High Court judge Brojendra Prasad Katakey cited the violations and has made the recommendation in its progress report filed to NGT on Tuesday. It said despite Supreme Court orders, OIL did not carry out a biodiversity impact assessment study for the Baghjan well as it is located near the Dibru Saikhowa National Park and biosphere reserve, which is home to 36 mammal species including tiger, endangered Gangetic dolphins, feral horses, and 382 bird species.The panel said the OIL had also not taken environmental clearance from the Centre before starting drilling operations at Baghjan from November 2006.It has recommended that directions be issued to Assam’s Pollution Control Board for the action against OIL and its officials.Also read | Another 8 weeks needed to bring Baghjan gas well under control, says OILThe panel noted statutory obligations mandate all onshore oil and gas drilling projects to obtain consent under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, and authorisation under Hazardous Waste (Management & Handling) Rules, and Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management & Transboundary Movement) Rules.“OIL had never procured and/or received any Consent to Establish [CTE]/NOC [no objection certificate] and/or Consent to Operate [CTO] under the aforesaid Acts and Rules the manner prescribed for drilling operation of Well Baghjan-5 in 2006,” the report said. HT is in possession of a copy of the report.The panel found that the OIL had the mandatory consent under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act only for 2008-09, 2012-13 and 2018-19. It cited records and said the Pollution Control Board issued no consent for 2006-07, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2019-20.“It was therefore inferred prima facie that on the day of [the] blowout of Well Baghjan-5 on May 27 and explosion on June 9, OIL didn’t have the mandatory consents including the CTE/NOC and/or the CTO under the Water Act, Air Act and/or the Hazardous Waste (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016,” the report said.The report said the ambient noise levels near the well since the blowout is above the permissible standard. It directed OIL to bring the levels down and ensure treatment of people suffering due to the heightened noise. The panel has recommended Rs 25 lakh compensation to 173 families affected by the blowout and the fire. It has sought Rs 20 lakh to 439 less-affected families.The panel was set up after Bonani Kakkar, a Kolkata-based activist, and the Wildlife and Environment Conservation Organisation, an Assam-based NGO, filed separate applications before NGT seeking a probe into the cause and impact of the blowout and the fire. It will submit its final report next month.A team from Canada arrived at the site on Tuesday to attempt to put out the blaze. After initial attempts by teams from ONGC and OIL to control the blowout and fire, a team from Singapore-based Alert Disaster Control was brought in to plug the blowout and douse the fire. The team managed to replace the blow out preventer (BOP) on the well head, but efforts to contain the fire by injecting a ‘killing fluid’ failed. The team was able to divert the gas to a ‘flare pit’ nearby but the fire still continues. The Alert Disaster Control team left in October after OIL decided to bring a team from Canada and douse the fire by a technique called snubbing. “These are interim reports submitted from time to time by the committee to NGT. The final report is yet to be submitted. Once the final report is submitted by the committee, NGT would then issue directives to OIL. We would respond only when such directives are issued,” said Tridiv Hazarika, spokesperson, OIL. The Pollution Control Board and Assam officials didn’t respond to calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/baghjan-blowout-oil-india-limited-operated-well-without-mandatory-clearances-says-ngt/story-ajD4sTJbBCJ61AtLjcHeeI.html
04-11-2020||Pune||With drop in cases, Pune administration plans to give up requisition of pvt hospital beds||Six months after the state issued an order to take control of about 80% of beds in private hospitals for Covid-19 treatment, the Pune administration has decided to give up the requisition given that the number of cases has been going down. The administration after a meeting with private hospitals has decided to give them the choice to step down voluntarily only on the pre-condition that beds could be taken over again if the situation demands. During a press meet on Tuesday, divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “We have asked private hospitals to come up with a plan wherein we can give up the requisition in phases as per the criteria. The hospitals will send a plan by tomorrow and we will see whatever is possible. We will ensure that we have enough beds for at least 8,000 patients as per the guidelines given by the Centre, for all the categories, including home isolation and even for critical patients.“ We have enough beds for 8,000 patients if we put together both the jumbo facilities, Naidu and 25% of both Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) and Sassoon General hospitals. However, we will need a backup of ventilators and ICU beds for which we will consult with private hospitals,” he said.He said that as of now no ratio has been decided on reserving beds and that hospitals have been given the option of “step-down” programme in a phasewise manner. However, in some cases, hospitals will be allowed to be absolved of the requisition completely in case of super specialities dedicated to one speciality like heart, orthopaedics and ophthalmology, and hospitals with less than 40 beds will be allowed to not accept any new admission. These hospitals will be de-notified with the pre-condition that if required the administration will take over the required beds.With cases going down, PMC has shut down 18 Covid care centres out of the 23 which were started initially and only five are operational now. PCMC has only one CCC running. Rao said that they are closed temporarily and could be started on 72-hour notice. Criteria to give up requisition of bedsNon-oxygenated beds at private hospitals. Around 1,800 beds will be released. The price regulation on requisitioned beds for the treatment of Covid will continue if any of the beds are retained. The administration hopes to retain the required number of ventilators and ICUs as a backup plan in some private hospitalsThese beds can be taken over again if the positivity rate, which is currently around 8.9% for the district, goes above 20%. Sassoon staff and jumbo facility contract extended Although the number of Covid cases is coming down steadily, as preparation for a possible second wave of the infection the administration has decided to extend the contract for doctors and medical staff hired in June and whose six-month contract will end on November 15 by another six months. Divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao said, “We have extended the contract of the staff because if we do see a second wave like what is being reported in western countries then we do not want to go hunting for staff at the last minute. Also, in case of the jumbo facility too we have decided to keep it running till February 2021 for now after consulting the operator, but we will bring down the number of beds from current 600 to 400 for both the jumbo facilities, COEP and Magar ground facility to avoid unnecessary costs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/with-drop-in-cases-pune-administration-plans-to-give-up-requisition-of-pvt-hospital-beds/story-RwFLsILtu5uOQwB35SPOSN.html

The deceased were identified as Jigni village residents Bunty Khan, 30, Ruby Khan, 27, and one-year-old Aman. Two other kids ,Hussain and Ali, were rushed to a district hospital from where they were referred to Gajra Raja Medical College, Gwalior, in a serious condition, said police. “Police are investigating the matter as an explosive used in making crackers was found in large quantity at the spot. Villagers informed the police that Bunty used to illegally manufacture crackers at home. Bunty’s family, that lives close by, claimed that the blast occurred due to an LPG cylinder,” said Morena superintendent of police Anurag Sujaniya. He said, “The explosion blew up the house of Bunty Khan at around 6 am on Wednesday. The villagers informed the police. Police and fire brigade team reached the spot and held a rescue operation. In all, five people were rescued from the debris. They were rushed to a district hospital where Bunty, Ruby and Aman were declared brought dead.” A team of forensic experts reached the spot to know the exact reason behind the blast, said the police officer. A few years ago, two members of Bunty’s family had died in a similar kind of explosion, said the police. However, the deceased’s brother Usmaan Khan said, “After the death of two members of the family a few years ago, we had discontinued the making crackers, so something else must have caused the blast. Bunty was a street vendor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/madhya-pradesh-cracker-blast-blows-up-house-in-morena-three-killed-2-injured/story-syOmPygcuGOwEnAEorx6sJ.html

04-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi reporting third Covid-19 wave, says CM Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that the national capital is reporting a “third wave” of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. The CM said that the Delhi government would move the Supreme Court (SC) later on Wednesday to vacate the stay imposed by the Delhi high court (HC) on the city administration’s order of reserving 80% of the intensive care unit (ICU) beds for Covid-19 patients in 33 private hospitals. The declaration is significant, as the Delhi government had earlier maintained that it would wait for a week to decide whether a third wave has hit the national capital. The CM’s statement came after Delhi reported 6,725 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday and the overall tally went past 400,000.Also read| 3rd wave of Covid-19 in Delhi? Yes, says Satyendar Jain as Capital records 6.7K fresh casesKejriwal said he would hold a meeting to review Covid-19 management on Thursday.“I want to inform the public that Delhi is reporting a surge in Covid-19 cases over the past few days. I would call this a third wave of the pandemic in the city because in the end of September and the beginning of October, daily Covid-19 cases had started to drop below 3,000,” Kejriwal told media persons at Hiranki village, where he visited to check the effectiveness of the bio-decomposing process of converting stubble into manure. The CM also urged the public not to panic and assured that he is closely monitoring the situation. “At present, there is no scarcity of Covid-19 beds in Delhi. There is no scarcity of any form of health infrastructure in the national capital. It has come to our notice that in big private hospitals, only a few ICU beds with ventilators are lying vacant. The issue will be resolved in a day or two once the SC vacates the stay by the HC,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi government would take a call on Thursday whether firecrackers would be allowed this Diwali, he added. Diwali will be celebrated on November 14.“The meeting will discuss a gamut of issues such as allowing firecrackers to availability of Covid-19 beds, especially those in ICUs.The meeting is scheduled to be held at 4 pm,” Kejriwal said.Delhi’s positivity rate on Tuesday stood at 11.29% as fears abound that SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, is spreading at an unprecedented rate amid the festive season and growing pollution due to stubble burning in neighbouring agrarian states such as Haryana and Punjab and parts of western Uttar Pradesh (UP) . Typically, a rising positivity rate suggests an inadequate number of tests.The Delhi government’s bulletin on Tuesday stated that of the 59,540 swab samples tested in the past 24 hours, 13,560 were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, which was the lowest RT-PCR sample size in the past three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-reporting-third-wave-says-cm-kejriwal/story-mh1NnI6XTyqawv9A8iIMPO.html
04-11-2020||Delhi||3rd wave of Covid-19 in Delhi? Yes, says Satyendar Jain as Capital records 6.7K fresh cases||The steep rise in cases of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease in Delhi can be considered a “third wave”, health minister Satyendar Jain said on Wednesday. However, the spike could also be attributed to aggressive contact tracing and ramped up testing, he added.“About 6,800 beds are occupied in Delhi due to Covid-19 while 9,000 are available. We can call this the third wave of Covid-19 cases here but we have focused on aggressive testing in the last 15 days so the spike can be attributed to that too,” Jain said.Pointing out that the main issue was the availability of ICU beds, he said that the state government will approach the Supreme Court over the Delhi High Court’s order to stay its decision on reserving ISCE beds in private hospitals.On September 22, the SC stayed an order of the Delhi government reserving 80% of the ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, saying that prima facie, the order appeared to be “arbitrary”, “unreasonable” and in violation of the fundamental rights of an individual.“We’re going to the Supreme Court to address the High Court overturn of our mandate to reserve 80 per cent beds as ICU beds in private hospitals because the main issue is that of the availability of ICU beds,” Jain said. Jain, however, reassured people that the treatment protocols in both government and private hospitals were the same. On Tuesday, the national Capital again set a record for the highest Covid-19 cases reported in a single day with 6,725 new infections taking the total tally past 400,000.

04-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC fails to pay up 90% funds needed for marine biodiversity conservation||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is building a road along Mumbai’s coast, has failed to deposit 90% of funds required for the conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity as per specific conditions imposed under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) clearance issued for the project.Maharashtra’s Mangrove Cell has highlighted the non-compliance in a letter to Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, environment. HT has seen a copy of the letter.“We have received this letter and will be questioning BMC about their compliance with the CRZ conditions,” said Mhaiskar.Also read | Comply with 6 conditions to move corals for Coastal Road: MoEFCC tells BMCThe civic body had to pay 2% (Rs254 crore) of the total cost of the project (Rs12,721 crore) to the Mangrove Foundation (an autonomous society that assists the state government in marine conservation) on or before the commencement of work on the road in December 2018, according to the clearance given for the project in May 2017. The 9.9-km long road aims to connect the Princess Street Flyover in south Mumbai to the Worli end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link and cut short travel time between south Mumbai and western suburbs by 70%.“It is brought to your kind consideration that the project proponent [BMC] is yet to deposit Rs227.42 crore to the Mangrove Foundation which is a breach of the specific condition 12 of the clearance given to the project. Moreover, BMC has already approached the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority [MCZMA under the environment department] for the clearance of additional reclamation works to be carried out for the coastal road project,” read the letter by Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell). Tiwari requested the environment department to ensure that conditions under CRZ clearance are complied with before considering fresh amendments proposed by BMC.According to the letter, BMC partly complied with the order by depositing Rs25 crore with the Mangrove Foundation in June 2019. “Rs25 crore has been added to the Mangrove Foundation’s corpus and kept in fixed deposits as per the Foundation’s mandate. The interest earned thereon is utilized for improving coastal and marine biodiversity of Mumbai and Thane region and to build awareness among citizens...,” the letter said.Vijay Nighot, chief engineer (Coastal Road), BMC refused to comment on the matter. A BMC official, requesting anonymity, said, “We are yet to be given a breakup of how Rs25 crore has already been utilized. Once we have that and a roadmap of how remaining funds would be used, the transactions will be made.”“The funds will be used to study, document and conserve marine biodiversity in Mumbai, Thane, and surrounding coastal regions,” said MK Rao, acting principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife). “However, only part payment has been made so far. We hope with the intervention of the environment department, BMC will comply with the condition imposed upon them under the CRZ norms.”Environmentalists said the issue was first raised by the Mangrove Cell last week when BMC had approached MCZMA for additional reclamation for the project. “During the hearing, Mhasikar, as chairman, clearly told BMC that the funds had to be paid as per the CRZ mandate and the Mangrove Cell cannot be asked for utilisation certificate,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust, one of the petitioners opposing the project.Environmentalist Stalin D said seeking fund utilisation details was not a mandate under CRZ norms and BMC must unconditionally comply. “It is unfortunate to see BMC behave in an arrogant and insensitive manner. They are obligated under the law to deposit 2% of the project cost, which is a reserve fund for marine conservation. The law cannot be different for different project proponents,” he said.Goenka pointed out that it was money changing hands between two government departments. “This is blood money as funds are being demanded as a pound of flesh to protect the environment (by Mangrove Foundation) when an ecologically damaging project such as this is being allowed to destroy Mumbai’s coast,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-fails-to-pay-up-90-funds-needed-for-marine-biodiversity-conservation/story-mRhtqEWIJISW0TWEpvGErJ.html
04-11-2020||Mumbai||Comply with 6 conditions to move corals for Coastal Road: MoEFCC tells BMC||The Union environment ministry has listed six conditions for Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to comply with while giving it the final go-ahead for translocating two coral patches along the coastal road alignment. The conditions include the translocation must be carried out in presence of the forest department officials, and an expert from the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, or any marine expert from a national institute. The ministry has asked BMC to ensure adequate protection to the corals and to submit a completion report post translocation and periodic reports on the status of corals after translocation. HT has seen a copy of the permission document issued on October 28.The Maharashtra forest department has also added a few conditions while issuing its permit. They pertain to a time frame of October 29 to December 31 to complete the translocation.Corals are protected marine species sporadically spread across rocky intertidal regions along the Mumbai coast. They have the same protection as the tiger or elephant under the Wildlife Protection Act. Permissions are needed from the principal chief conservator of the forest before the translocation of the species.Also read | New plant species discovered in northern Western Ghats“Though a small patch of corals has come in the alignment, their protection is important as schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act. Thus, we had to seek permission. They will be shifted to other suitable sites. We need the road but we also need to ensure proper wildlife conservation,” said MK Rao, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife).On September 3, BMC applied for wildlife clearance and submitted a proposal to move 18 coral colonies across Worli and Haji Ali for further reclamation of the project. According to BMC’s proposal, the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa, had identified the corals. “The translocation is to be undertaken by NIO scientists and all conditions highlighted by the Centre will be complied with,” said a BMC official.Since March, BMC has reclaimed over 52 hectares of the sea for the 9.9-km Rs 14,000-crore eight-lane highway.EV Muley, a former national coordinator for UN’s Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, said there have been no solid conservation efforts to protect corals over the past decade. “There is no large-scale proof of the success of translocation or restoration of coral patches by any national institute. Even if translocation has been done, no follow-up studies have been conducted.”Environmentalists called uprooting corals and relocating them intricate operation like open-heart surgery. “Corals are delicate ecosystems that are highly sensitive to even small changes. Instead of conserving the remaining fragments of this biodiversity, this so-called development project is decimating it. The environmental destruction caused by the coastal road was always avoidable. Lack of political will and the financial greed is at the root of all the issues,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti, an NGO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/comply-with-6-conditions-to-move-corals-for-coastal-road-moefcc-tells-bmc/story-qvRuyS7ueAlddzEFkO7zII.html
04-11-2020||Mumbai||Abetment to suicide case: Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami arrested||Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami was on Wednesday arrested from Mumbai for alleged abetment to 53-year-old interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother Kumud Naik’s suicide in 2018.Goswami was being taken to Alibag near Mumbai in Maharashtra’s Raigad district, where he was expected to be produced before a local court later in the day.Inspector general of police (Konkan range) Sanjay Mohite confirmed that Raigad police have arrested Goswami but refused to give further details.Anvay Naik and Kumud Naik were found dead at their farmhouse in Alibag in May 2018. Anvay Naik’s widow, Akshata, registered a case after a note was found in which the two alleged that they were forced to end their lives because of unpaid dues amounting to Rs 5.40 crore by Goswami’s Republic TV and two others, Feroz Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda.Also read | Republic TV owners named as accused in TRP caseMaharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh announced a fresh investigation into the case in May 2020 after Anvay Naik’s daughter, Adnya, approached him alleging the Alibag police have not investigated it properly. The local police earlier closed the abetment case, saying there was not enough evidence against the accused.Republic TV has denied the allegations and maintained the company had cleared all payments due to Anvay Naik’s Concord Designs.Congress leader Sachin Sawant called Goswami’s arrest a tribute to Anway Naik. “Anway Naik and his mother were compelled to commit suicide after Arnab’s channel failed to pay his dues worth Rs 80 lakh. The [previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Devendra] Fadnavis government failed to investigate the case and do justice to the family.” He claimed there was a lot of political pressure on the then Fadnavis government to hush up the case for obvious reasons. “The [Narendra] Modi government [at the Centre] was protecting Arnab just because his channel was taking their agenda forward. Instead of condemning the action against the culprit, the BJP should feel ashamed for their failure to accord justice to the Naik family.” Sawant added they welcome the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s action in the case.Congress is a part of the MVA government.Fadnavis called the arrest an attempt to suppress an anti-government voice. “Emergency came to an end in 1977 but the tendency of imposing it still persists. After Shiv Sena, which stood by the Emergency and Congress, the party which imposed it joined hands in the state, the tendency has surfaced. Such attempts to suppressing the voice against the government are detrimental to democracy. The country has always stood against such attempts,” Fadnavis tweeted in Marathi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/abetment-to-suicide-case-republic-tv-editor-in-chief-arnab-goswami-arrested/story-yn5TzjLjqPnpYeD8GaMq3M.html

04-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi restaurants no longer need tourism licence, govt notifies order||The Delhi government on Tuesday issued an order notifying that restaurants in Delhi will no longer have to acquire a licence from the tourism department in order to function, the government said in a press statement.The notification comes around a month after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that the process was on to ensure that restaurants in the city can operate round the clock, and to do away with the requirement for obtaining tourism and health trade licences, apart from a police verification. He said his government was also tweaking some fire safety norms in heritage buildings of Connaught Place and Khan Market and a few excise rules to allow serving liquor in open spaces within the premise of an enterprise and to ensure more flexibility regarding storage liquor.These measures were part of the government’s “ease of doing business” policy, aimed at boosting the capital’s economy in the light of the Covid-19 pandemic.While tourism licence and excise rules directly come under the city government’s domain, the other measures would involve multiple agencies such as the Delhi Police and the three municipal corporations.A government statement said the tourism licence was initially issued by the Union government and came under the state domain only in 2003. Since then, the government of Delhi had made it mandatory for all restaurants with seating capacity of 30 and above to seek this licence.“Various reviews and considerations were done by the state tourism department over the last few months on the request of restaurant associations. However, owing to the recent circumstances concerning Covid-19, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has ordered the removal of the voluntary scheme of granting approval for standalone restaurants,” the statement said. Sandeep Khandelwal of Delhi hotels and restaurants owners’ association said, “This is a welcome move. Such licences and permits are often unnecessary as they lead to duplication. They waste the time of the authorities as well as entrepreneurs.”Regarding health trade licences, the government has already run into a standoff with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations (MCD). While the AAP has been asserting that the health trade licence now comes under exclusive domain of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, which comes under the Centre, MCDs have maintained they are reviewing the protocol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-restaurants-no-longer-need-tourism-licence-govt-notifies-order/story-GDiFWAaEwHCg4ZFgttyjzN.html
04-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Spot the poet||The hall is silent. The lights are turned off. A sliver of sunshine is sneaking inside through a barely-opened door, making poet Ghalib’s wall portrait faintly visible.Nobody is around but for this lone man sitting on the centre seat of the front row, here in the auditorium of central Delhi’s Ghalib Academy.The man is wearing the playful devil’s horns that light up at night—the kind sold by hawkers to dwellers in the India Gate grounds. He is also holding plastic rods glowing red and green.The scene is suitably surreal.“I walked in a minute back on seeing Ghalib’s photo (actually a portrait) outside the building,” says Muhammed Irshad. A street hawker, he was selling toys on the street. He says he has walked about the area more than once, but spotted this landmark celebrating the life and times of a great Delhi poet for the first time only today. A native of Samastipur, in Bihar, the middle-aged Mr Irshad recalls that he read a few of Ghalib’s poetry at school, back in the 1990s. “I had to leave studies long time back, and I don’t remember anything of the poems but I remember that I had liked the verses a lot.”Lounging back on the auditorium chair, as if binge-watching a feel-good web series, Mr Irshad lets a relaxing smile spread about his lips.He feels alone in this city, he says. His family lives in Bihar. He works hard, he declares. He gets the toys from a wholesale market in east Delhi’s Shahdara and sells them in the southern parts of the Capital.Looking about in the darkness, he collects his thoughts about the age-old question of the place of poetry in daily life. “Poets matter. Ghalib wrote more than a hundred years ago but he is still remembered... whereas we will not be remembered after our death.”Peering towards the stage, as if talking to an invisible presence there, he mutters “The good poems give good morals... you follow their sabak (lessons) and that helps you in life.”Now Mr Irshad gets up. Apparently there’s a museum upstairs, he says in a hushed tone as if sharing a piece of precious gossip. He plans to check it out. His devil’s horns continue to glow red.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-spot-the-poet/story-y3XKPWvZkKdllP0CeTDpTI.html

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the overall air quality index of Delhi was 302, in the ‘very poor’ category. On Monday, the city’s AQI had improved to ‘poor’ category, at 293.

04-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi government’s anti-firecracker drive begins||Environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday kick-started the Delhi government’s anti-cracker campaign, urging people to avoid fireworks on Diwali, or to at least to ensure they buy only the ‘green’, low-emission varieties, in an attempt to cut down on air pollution, which is a bigger concern this year due to the Covid-19 crisis.As part of the campaign, Rai visited Sadar Bazar, one of Delhi’s biggest wholesale firecracker markets, for an inspection and to ensure only green crackers are sold. Diwali this year will be celebrated on November 14. Every year, pollution levels see a major spike after the festival as people openly burst firecrackers. Under this campaign, 11 teams of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee have been directed to ensure no traditional, polluting crackers are used or sold. Apart from these teams, Delhi Police personnel and sub-divisional magistrates of all districts will inspect markets to ensure old stocks of traditional varieties are not sold clandestinely. “According to directions of the Supreme Court, polluting crackers have been banned in Delhi and only pollution-free green crackers have been allowed this year. The teams will ensure only the less-polluting varieties of crackers are sold. I would also like to request Delhiites to avoid bursting crackers, as much as possible,” said Rai. Rai said, “We are ensuring two things -- first, the firecrackers must have a ‘green cracker’ logo on them. Second, the crackers sold in shops must be from authorised companies. We are following Supreme Court guidelines. The Delhi government will follow any new directions to curb pollution.” Narendra Gupta, president of the fireworks and general traders association, Sadar Bazar, said traders assured the government they will comply with its order and sell only green crackers. In 2017, ahead of Diwali, the Supreme Court had put a temporary ban on the sale and purchase of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR. In the last two years, however, the court had ordered that only low-emission and improved fireworks could be sold in Delhi. Residents were allowed to burst only green crackers, which are said to have 30% lower emission compared to older ones. Surendra Kumar, a trader, said even though more green crackers are available this year, the number of traders selling these is much less compared to previous years. “If shops selling the less polluting varieties are fewer, then there is possibility of unauthorised dealers selling old stock. Business has taken a hit over the last two-three years because of lack of clarity on rules till this year,” Kumar said. He said since the new varieties are more expensive, many people prefer to get old ones from NCR towns such as Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Noida. Parvati Kandasamy, president of the joint resident welfare association in West Patel Nagar, said they have been sensitising residents to avoid cracker bursting this year. “Through our WhatsApp groups and social media pages, we are getting people to join our cracker-free Diwali campaign.,” said Kandasamy. Anumita Roychowdhury of Centre for Science and Environment, said the focus should be to save the city from the annual air emergency. “Even last year, we were doing reasonably well in maintaining pollution levels from falling, but with Diwali, we were back facing the severe category,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-government-s-anti-firecracker-drive-begins/story-6Z032C4zqBAi0omT78ovaL.html

Last year, the central agency purchased 2.45 lakh MT paddy directly from Punjab’s grain markets. The total estimated procurement in the state is likely to remain around 175 lakh metric tonne this kharif season, according to the Punjab government. The four state agencies — Pungrain, Punsup, Markfed and the Punjab State Warehouse Corporation — procure paddy from the state farmers and hand it over to the FCI, for which state is paid in advance in the form of cash credit limit (CCL). A senior official said the FCI’s process of procuring foodgrains is different from that of the state procurementagencies as it only purchased paddy froma few purchasing centres. “We adopt our own storage process rather than storing paddy in private mills to avoid losses and litigation. Therefore, we only procured paddy from purchasing centres located near our godowns,” the official said. On the other hand, state procurement agencies have managed to cross their set targets. The Pungrain has purchased 62 lakh MT (40.83%), Markfed 39 lakh MT (25.86%), Punsup 32 lakh MT (21.01%), Warehouse 16 lakh MT (10.69%), and private players 47,388 MT (.30%) so far. FCI regional general manager (Punjab) Arshdeep Singh Thind said there is a lot of logistics involved in their direct purchase of paddy from the grain markets. “Moreover, we get the paddy stock under the central pool system as the state agencies usually procure on the central agency’s behalf. In fact, direct purchase depends upon a number of grain markets allotted to the FCI for procurement,” Thind added. Of a total of nearly 4,000 purchasing centres in Punjab, the FCI is purchasing paddy from 160 allotted centres only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fci-trails-in-procurement-target-this-year-too-buys-just-1-2-of-punjab-s-total-paddy/story-hCAO8WLvlViF6qKdLw0CZO.html

The bench has sought a response from the state government and will hear the case on November 5.The bench, comprising of justices KK Tated, GS Kulkarni and NR Borkar, was informed by advocate Rupesh Jaiswal that an earlier division bench of justice SS Shinde and MS Karnik, while hearing the application of his client for emergency parole, had been presented with conflicting views on the issue. Jaiswal submitted that as another bench of the HC had granted parole to a man convicted under the Pcoso Act, his client was also eligible for the same benefit. He further submitted that the government notification of May 8 while excluding convicts charged under UAPA, MCOCA, MPID, PMLA, TADA and other special Acts from the benefit of emergency bail, parole and furlough, had not specifically mentioned convicts under the Pocso Act and hence there was no impediment in granting him parole.Jaiswal informed the full bench that apart from the above he had also placed orders which allowed convicts serving sentences of more than seven years also getting the benefit of emergency parole. Jaiswal, however, added that as there were conflicting orders with regards to whether Pocso Act was a special act and whether prisoners serving sentences above seven years were eligible for emergency parole, the division bench had made a reference to a larger bench. In light of the above Jaiswal submitted that the full bench was to decide on the reference.After hearing the submissions, the full bench observed that as the issue was about prisoners convicted under all special acts, hence it wanted to know the stand of the state on it. Asking the state to respond, the matter was adjourned to Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-to-hear-whether-convicts-under-all-special-acts-should-be-eligible-for-covid-19-parole/story-4TzHMhAuWUohSnfH5bcNdP.html
04-11-2020||Delhi||10°C: Chilly Delhi on cold wave brink||The national capital continued to experience winter chill weeks ahead of “normal” schedule, with the minimum temperature on Tuesday lower than in several hill towns, pushing the city to the brink of its first early November “cold wave” in at least 30 years.Delhi’s minimum temperature, recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official reading for the city, was 10 degrees Celsius at 6:30am. This was lower than the minimum temperatures recorded in Dalhousie (10.9 degrees), Kasauli (10.7 degrees), Dharamsala (10.6 degrees), Kangra (10.2 degrees), and Mussoorie (10.4 degrees).Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the temperature is expected to remain around the 10-degree mark through the week. The minimum temperature has been hovering at 3-5 degrees below normal for the past five days.A “cold wave” is when the minimum temperature 10 degrees Celsius or less, and 4.5 degrees less than normal for two consecutive days. Another chilly morning on Wednesday would officially put the city in the midst of a cold wave. Delhi’s minimum temperature on Monday was 10.8 degrees.The normal minimum temperature for this part of the year is 14-15 degrees Celsius. Cold waves in Delhi are not unusual in November-end. But officials said there has been no cold wave in the first week of November in at least the last three decades. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said temperatures dropping to such levels were highly unusual for Delhi and NCR towns at this time of the year. “In Delhi, there has been no drastic change in the conditions that would trigger such a drop in the temperature. The only difference is that over the last two days because of a western disturbance, there was light rain and snow fall over Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. In the coming two days too, there is a forecast of light rain over Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand. This will bring cold winds from these regions to Delhi and neighbouring cities, dropping the temperatures,” Srivastava said. Other experts suggested that the signs pointed to an unusually cold winter.“The winds are northwesterly, so cold air is blowing towards the plains from the Himalayas. But this is a La Nina year, and the circulation features are such that there is more cold air intrusion into the northern plains. We can expect a very cold winter this year,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences. La Nina, the cold phase of El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (Enso), is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), it is associated with strong monsoon, above average rains, and colder winters in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/10-c-chilly-delhi-on-cold-wave-brink/story-aL9FjYBMrqoe3pI7yqjeYK.html

Nilesh Jadhav, his brother Manoj Jadhav, their father Laxman Ramji Jadhav, and Tukaram Rupji Jadhav were granted bail by Judge PP Jadhav, on a personal bond of ₹15,000 each, with surety. Meanwhile, the bail hearing of the 62 other accused will be heard by the Thane court on November 26.The state criminal investigation department (CID) had named 208 new accused in the April 16 lynching case in which three people were killed. As of now, 366 accused have been arrested in the case, 11 juveniles. Five months after Gaurav Singh, former superintendent of police (SP), Palghar, was sent on compulsory leave by state home minister Anil Deshmukh following the lynching incident, he has now been posted as a superintendent of the Maharashtra Police Academy, Nashik, by the state home ministry.The state government in a reply to the Supreme Court, regarding a petition seeking to hand over the case to a Central agency, had last Wednesday, mentioned that no dereliction of duty was found on Singh’s part and thus was given a clean chit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-lynching-case-4-accused-granted-bail-by-thane-court/story-CSEVs6n0j3azZ4LyQh5yLP.html
04-11-2020||Delhi||Third wave: 6.7k new Covid-19 cases in Delhi||The Capital on Tuesday again set a record for the highest Covid-19 cases reported in a single day with 6,725 new infections taking the total tally in the Capital past 400,000, as the outbreak continued to worsen to levels never witnessed before in the city.Experts raised alarm over the continuously rising positivity rate – the proportion of tests that come back positive for Covid-19. The positivity rate on Tuesday stood at 11.29%, reinforcing the fact that the virus is spreading at an unprecedented rate amid festive season and rising pollution. A rising positivity rate typically suggests that a region is testing inadequately.This means that more than a tenth (10.7%) of all tests in the past week have come back positive in the last week – the highest weekly positivity rate has touched in the city since July 7, when it was at 10.5%.The rise in positivity rate took place even as the number of gold-standard RT-PCR tests on Tuesday witnessed a drop. According to Tuesday’s Delhi government bulletin, of the 59,540 samples tested in the past 24 hours, only 13,560 were RT-PCR – this is the lowest weekday RT-PCR sample size in the last three weeks.Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, tests are significantly better than rapid antigen tests at detecting positive cases – the latter has a higher tendency to give false negative. As a result, the higher the share of RT-PCR tests in overall testing, the more accurate the positivity rate is. In other words, the low RT-PCR count may be masking a much higher positivity rate on the ground. In the past week, 5,536 new cases were reported on average every day, the highest this number has ever been in Delhi. Before this, the seven-day average (also known as the case trajectory) was highest at 4,174 at the height of the second wave on September 17 and 3,446 at the height of the first, which was on June 26.Worried about the continuous spike in Delhi’s infections during the ongoing festive season, and at the start of winter, top officials from the Union and the Delhi governments met on Monday and discussed a recalibration of testing, treating and surveillance strategies.This was the second time that the Centre intervened into rapidly rising Covid cases in Delhi. In July, Union home minister Amit Shah held a round of meetings with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and other officials after which, testing, contact tracing and sero surveillance were ramped up in Delhi with the two governments working in coordination.Last Tuesday, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain claimed the positivity rate spike was down to testing the contacts of patients in a “targeted manner”.Health experts, however, disagreed. Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said, “The government says that the positivity rate is going up because more people are being tested. That is not true. For example, if you want to check the concentration of fat in a milk sample, it will be the same whether you test 100ml, 200ml or a litre. Of course, RT-PCR picks up more cases than the rapid antigen tests but the transmission in the city is going up.” He added that the government needs to put in restrictions to reduce interaction of people — curbs on how many can gather for weddings and funerals, closing of non-essential services such as the cinemas, bars and restaurants, and limiting the number of people on public transport. The government should also stagger the timings of the markets and enforce mask-wearing through challans, he said. “I don’t think we should attribute every rise and fall in the number of cases on testing; it does have a role, but a small one. That said, there is no rationale behind reducing testing because that will mean artificially reducing the numbers. And, we know RT PCR test picks up more cases than the rapid antigen test,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at AIIMS. “Look at what is happening outside, people are out and about. The markets are crowded, traffic is back to normal on the roads. The masks have become chin-accessories and no one is following social distancing. Add to that the increase in the levels of air pollution in the city and the dip in temperature,” Broor said.With the rise in the number of cases, the number of hospitalisations has gone up to over 6,700 – the highest this has been since hospitalisations peaked at just over 7,000 during the September surge. There are over 15,700 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 in hospitals across the city, of which 43.6% are now occupied.However, it is the occupancy in the intensive care unit (ICU) that has the government worried. As on Tuesday evening, almost 69% of the 3,175 ICU beds were occupied, according to data on the Delhi corona app. “1,000 ICU beds were added last month. But, given the surge in number, Delhi Government plans to scale up to 30,000 beds,” wrote Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Facebook.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/third-wave-6-7k-new-covid-cases-in-delhi/story-kkhC7Gj4As2WSGUvHcQomK.html

Gudiya Vishwakarma, a resident of Santosh Bhuvan in Nallasopara (East) was travelling on the train when she went into premature labour. The train made an unscheduled halt at Palghar and Dr Rajendra Chauhan, a gynaecologist was summoned by Western Railway (WR) staff. The patient and the new-born were later admitted to a maternity hospital.Vishwakarma, who was seven months pregnant, her husband Rajesh, 33, and their daughter Aayushi, five, were travelling on the train when she experienced severe labour pains and rushed to the on-board toilet. Meanwhile, Rajesh informed the travelling ticket examiner (TTE) on the train who contacted the traffic control office. The train then made an unscheduled halt at Palghar at around 12.30am, and Dr Chauhan was informed.I reached the coach along with other staff and managed to enter the toilet. Vishwakarma had already delivered her baby and was holding him in her hands with the umbilical cord still attached. My staff cut the cord, and as no ambulance was available, I held the baby while a moving stretcher was used to wheel the patient to Kanta Maternity Hospital near the railhead,” said Dr Chauhan.The birth was a normal delivery, and the patient and child were discharged on Monday evening. “Our doctor had told us that my wife would give birth sometime in December. As we live alone and I spend a lot of time at work, we decided to go to our hometown of Mariahu in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, so that Gudiya could be looked after better,” said Rajesh. “But God had willed otherwise, and she gave birth inside the train toilet,” he added.Dr Chauhan refused to charge Vishwakarma for treatment as a salute to the WR staffers who are transporting essential goods to all corners of the country during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/7-month-pregnant-woman-gives-birth-in-train-toilet-at-palghar/story-A1aZXLYRcElmF1cH3tQmBK.html

The accused Milind Deshmukh, a resident of Palghar district, attempted the police recruitment exam a couple of years ago, said police. “He failed to make the selection but continued making friends in the constabulary. Eventually, he started duping women constables by either promising them marriage or by taking money from them,” said an officer from Kalamboli police station. The police investigation revealed that Deshmukh, who was arrested on October 26, was previously arrested by Vashi police, Rabale police and Rabale MIDC police over a year and a half ago. In the Rabale case, Deshmukh conned a Thane woman constable of ₹1.75 lakh. The accused had a pattern of targeting women constables of the same force. Previously, he started duping Thane police constables, and this year, he conned Mumbai Police constables. He has stuck to his modus operandi after he successfully conned a few women at the start of his criminal career, said police. Investigators have not recovered any fake uniform from Deshmukh’s possession. They did, however, discover that he had uploaded a profile picture to give the appearance that he was in uniform. “The profile he created in the name of fictitious sub-inspector Ganesh More has a slightly cropped image, so it looks like he is in a uniform. He tricks women after continuing conversations with them on messaging applications, and tells them that his display picture is of him in uniform,” said Sanjay Sadigale, assistant inspector at Kalamboli police station. Police have meanwhile contacted other women constables he allegedly duped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-posing-as-cop-to-dupe-mumbai-women-constables-had-flunked-police-recruitment-exam/story-st10EMg2g5z2tOyxLzqemL.html

The MC’s executive engineers have been told to identify such units and snap their connections within five days. They will also have to submit an action-taken report in this time period. Action will also be taken against units that have more than one sewer connection to discharge waste.There are around 300 dyeing units near Tajpur road, Bahadurke road and Focal Point. While the common effluent treatment plant (CETP) for Bahadurke road dyeing industry has been made functional, CETPs for the other two are clusters are yet to be completed. Due to this, the dyeing units here are dumping untreated waste into MC’s sewer lines. Residents and councillors have long been complaining about the untreated water from these units, stating that this is leading to pollution of the Buddha Nullah.The MC’s sewer lines have also been getting choked due to the excessive discharge from these units. MC superintending engineer Rajinder Singh said, “We have received a letter from the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to take action against the erring dyeing units. The executive engineers have been told to do the needful.”PPCB and MC have been facing flak for failing to take action against the erring dyeing units and the National Green Tribunal (NGT)’s monitoring committee had also taken a note of the same in the past.Local bodies secretary to visit city todayWith the state government working on a 650-crore project to rejuvenate the Buddha Nullah, local bodies department secretary Ajoy Sharma is expected to visit the city on Wednesday to inspect the sewer treatment plants (STP). It is expected that a meeting will also be held regarding shifting of dairy units and removal of encroachments alongside Buddha Nullah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/buddha-nullah-pollution-mc-to-snap-connections-of-dyeing-units-dumping-untreated-waste-into-sewer-lines/story-UwHWOKD5AWUtuAnm7zrXVN.html

Both the rivulets merge in the Ghaggar river near Zirakpur adding to its pollution.Tenders for the project were floated in September. “The agency will also be accountable for the maintenance of the equipment to be installed at the site,” the official said.Meanwhile, the location for setting up of the monitoring station on the Sukhna choe is yet to be decided. “Proper space and infrastructure, and basic amenities like electricity are not available near the Sukhna choe. However, possibilities are being explored,” said the official.A joint team of the engineering department and the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) will inspect areas around the Sukhna choe this week to finalise the location within this month, the official added.Station to keep tab on effluent dischargeEven though the administration and the municipal corporation claim to have closed all but three sewage outlets discharging effluents in the choe, the monitoring stations will keep a tab if any such effluent is discharged.In a report submitted with the NGT on November 2, the CPCC had highlighted six locations where sewage was still being discharged in the two rivulets, with four points in Sukhna choe and two in N-choe.“The department concerned will get live updates if the pollution levels increase over the permissible levels. The entire process will be monitored online,” the official said.The system will monitor the pH value, the biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of water. “The station will be installed on the choe near the Mohali border, because when water enters there from Chandigarh, it will be to ensure that water is not contaminated from Chandigarh,” said the official.The N-choe passes through several gardens in the city, and is flooded during the rainy season. It enters Kajehri, Mohali, after passing through the Leisure Valley.

04-11-2020||Chandigarh||Traffic cones installed on cycle tracks in Chandigarh||For the safety of the cyclists in the city, the Chandigarh traffic police have started putting traffic cones to separate cycle tracks from the main roads.For now, the cones have been put on one side of the road besides Sukhna Lake, and they will soon be introduced in other parts of the city.Officiating senior superintendent of police (SSP, traffic) Manoj Kumar Meena said, “The move has been initiated for the safety of the cyclists as vehicles ply even on cycle tracks if they have been marked on the main roads. The move will prevent that and also stop people from parking on the side of the roads.”Deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic central) Palak Goel added, “We have used around 60 cones and have installed them at a distance of 100 meters from each other. On the first day, we received an overwhelmingly positive response and so the plan is to continue with this.”DSP Goel said a test of the project will be run in the Central Traffic Division; the roads between Sectors 16 and 17 and between Sectors 15 and 16 will be the next to get the cones in the next few days.Idea shared by city-based cyclists’ groupThe idea came from city-based Cyclegiri group, which had shared it with the SSP on Twitter. Administrator of the group, Akshit Passi, said, “There was a video of Chennai where the cones were being hailed as a cheap way to increase the safety of cyclists. We shared the idea with the traffic police and received a positive response from them.”Passi said the Sukhna Lake road desperately needed an intervention like this: “Many times auto rickshaws and taxis drop off people at the Lake on the roadside. Autos stay parked there, too, encroaching upon the cycle tracks.”A Twitter user, Basanta Raj Kumar, pointed out how cyclists who would earlier cover a large part of the road in the morning were now riding in their designated zones, making the motorists feel safer as well.Road safety activist Harpreet Singh said, “The move is in the right direction. Rather than cones, the traffic police along with the civic authorities can place something permanent there, especially on the roads with high density of cyclists.”In 2019, cyclists made for 10 of the total 104 traffic-related fatalities reported in the city, a slight improvement from 11 cases of 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/traffic-cones-installed-on-cycle-tracks-in-chandigarh/story-RcZqCt6lgYd872jeUpVW8L.html
04-11-2020||Mumbai||Centre objects to Metro-3 shed at Kanjurmarg, calls Maharashtra government decision as unilateral||In what is turning out to be another political tussle between the Central government and state, the former has objected to the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s decision to construct the Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) car shed at Kanjurmarg. While the state maintains the Centre has no claim upon the plot in question, the Centre has demanded work on the plot to stop and described the state’s decision as “improper and unilateral”.On October 12, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced that the Metro-3 car shed would be shifted from Aarey Milk Colony to a plot in Kanjurmarg. The car shed would be common to the underground Metro-3 and the overground Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli). However, in a letter dated October 15, to the Maharashtra chief secretary, the department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) stated the 102-acre plot for the car shed in Kanjurmarg was handed over by the state to Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) “without following extant procedure”. According to DPIIT, the Centre had filed a writ petition against several salt department lands — including the Kanjurmarg plot — and the decision is pending before Bombay high court. The letter — signed by Dr Guruprasad Mohapatra, secretary, DPIIT — goes on to say, “The improper and unilateral action of the collector and MMRDA has caused severe loss to DPIIT. I would request you to take necessary steps and restrain MMRDA from taking any further steps and to direct [the] collector to withdraw the orders passed in this regard in order to protect the interests of the Government of India.”However, state officials maintain the land belongs to the state government. “The divisional commissioner passed an order in 2018, handing over 49 plots, including the Kanjurmarg land, to the state as the salt department could not provide details of ownership. The order was also endorsed by the state revenue minister,” said a senior state official said, requesting anonymity. The official also added that there is no stay on the land parcel. Barricading and soil testing are already underway at the Kanjurmarg plot. DPIIT’s letter created a political storm on Tuesday. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashish Shelar said, “This is an ego battle where Mumbaiites will bear the loss. We had questioned the government on seeking approvals from the salt commissioner on the day it announced its decision.” Senior BJP leader Kirit Somaiya issued a press statement, in which he said MVA’s decision to shift the Metro-3 car shed will increase the project’s cost by ₹5,000 crore and extend the project’s deadline by five years. Somaiya also demanded the state release the report by the Manoj Saunik committee (appointed by MVA in December 2019), which advised against moving the car shed out of Aarey Milk Colony. “Despite filing multiple right-to-information queries, the government is not providing the report. The report must be released,” Somaiya said in his statement.Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had earlier tweeted that his government discarded the Kanjurmarg plot as an option because it was under litigation. However, Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said there was no ambiguity about the ownership of the plot and work at the Kanjurmarg site would continue. “The Kanjurmarg land allotted by the Collector to MMRDA for car depot of Metro has always been with govt of Maharashtra as per revenue records. The Collector, Mumbai Suburban, has done due diligence of all land records and all sub-judice matters in all competent courts,” he tweeted. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the salt department had not substantiated its claim on the plot in three years. “Now, after work has started at Kanjurmarg, they realised that the land belongs to them. This is not a coincidence. The Narendra Modi government is creating hurdles for the project,” he tweeted. Nationalist Congress Party leader Supriya Sule said, “That land belongs to Maharashtra and the state is utilising it for development works. The Central government is constantly committing the sin of taking away a state’s right.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/centre-objects-to-metro-3-shed-at-kanjurmarg-calls-maharashtra-government-decision-as-unilateral/story-awRngkRJ5ZTxqra7m2LsVK.html

Therefore, such a service becomes illegal and unlawful. For this reason, you are advised to discontinue the service immediately. Otherwise, it should be noted that legal action will be taken against you as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act.”Rapido’s services were introduced on Friday, at which time the transport commissioner’s (TC) office had not objected to the launch. The company, during the launch, had claimed that permissions for operating within the city had been given by the Maharashtra government.The RTO has given seven days to the company to respond and have warned of action.Transport commissioner Avinash Dhakane did not respond to calls or messages of Hindustan Times, nor did Rapido respond to requests for comment.The bike taxi service offered 2,000 two-wheeler taxis across in the city.

04-11-2020||Mumbai||SSR case: Mumbai police identify 50k more fake social media accounts created to defame state govt||Soon after Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, many social media accounts surfaced and started trending negative sentiments against the Maharashtra government, Mumbai Police and even maligned the image of commissioner of police, Param Bir Singh. Mumbai Police in their investigation have found 50,000 more such social media accounts used for defaming police and the government. Police said the numbers of such fake accounts have now crossed over 1.5 lakh. The accused used a paid program and proxy servers to remain anonymous and divert eyes of law enforcement agencies. In a press release, the police said that many accounts trended negative sentiments about state government, Mumbai Police and the Commissioner of Police using different hashtags. Many fake Twitter accounts were created by impersonating popular personalities like Bollywood actress Raveena Tandon.“During the investigation, we found that these fake accounts are controlled by a “BOT”. A single BOT program, which is a commercial tool and used for negative trending, has the power of 500 tweets/retweets per request and a huge capacity of 5 million tweets per month. These are paid programs which have the power to tweet in any language and can be executed from any part of the world using proxy server to remain anonymous,” the release stated.Also read: China to change school curriculum to add positive Covid-19 narrativeAccording to the release, a team of cyber and forensic experts submitted the report. The report has been generated using artificial intelligence and machine learning for the analysis of hashtags and related accounts which were created or surfaced between June 2020 and October 2020 to trend against dignified personalities.A team of cyber experts found more 1.5 lakh accounts during the technical investigation. Almost 80 percent of these accounts were suspicious as they were majorly making negative tweets and comments and their activities surprisingly showcased a drastic leap in the number of tweets per day, number of followers, a feat quite difficult for a genuine individual user to achieve. “At present, many accounts are trying to disappear. Many of them are deleting the negative posts, comments and tweets to evade the investigation process. A major percentage of the accounts are operating outside India in countries like China, Panama and Nepal,” the release added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-case-mumbai-police-identify-50k-more-fake-social-media-accounts-created-to-defame-state-govt/story-s8xPwwyVcW7vYIG3couk6J.html

04-11-2020||Mumbai||Metro-3 car shed: Centre lost ownership claim of Kanjurmarg plot before various revenue tribunals||Officials from the state revenue department said the Centre had lost ownership of the plot for the proposed Metro car shed at Kanjurmarg before several tribunals set up under the revenue department. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra have been at loggerheads over the plot since chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced the car shed would be shifted out of Aarey Milk Colony to Kanjurmarg. Since Thackeray announced the decision to construct a common car shed for Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz) and Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli) on October 12, BJP has criticised the move and pointed out that this change will increase the cost of the project. In a recent development, the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) has said the Centre has a claim on the Kanjurmarg land parcel and the state should not have transferred the land to Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), which is the nodal authority for the Metro. However, state officials say there is no ambiguity regarding the ownership of the Kanjurmarg plot. According to the state revenue department, the final decision on this issue was passed in 2018 by the then revenue minister and current BJP state president for Maharashtra, Chandrakant Patil.A senior revenue officer, requesting anonymity, said, “Their [the Centre’s] claim of ownership of 1,464 acres at Kanjurmarg was rejected by different tribunals of the revenue department, such as tehsildar, sub-divisional officer, additional collector and additional divisional commissioner. Later, the Centre filed an appeal before the revenue minister [Chandrakant Patil], who has quasi-judicial powers. After hearing both sides, Patil on November 1, 2018, had rejected the Centre’s claim and ordered that the plot is owned by the state government.”Patil didn’t respond to HT’s calls and messages.According to the letter sent to the Maharashtra chief secretary by DPIIT, which is a Central government department under the ministry of commerce and industry, the state’s decision to transfer the Kanjurmarg plot to MMRDA was “improper and unilateral”. DPIIT has said the question of the land parcel’s ownership is sub judice as the Centre had filed a writ petition in Bombay high court (HC) against the then state revenue minister’s order.Nitin Kareer, additional chief secretary, revenue department, said HC has not issued any stay on the Kanjurmarg land parcel.“The Centre has lost the case before all the courts as they have confirmed the ownership of the state government in their judgments. The same was mentioned in Centre’s letter as well, which we have received only on November 2. We are preparing our response to the objections raised by them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/metro-3-car-shed-centre-lost-ownership-claim-of-kanjurmarg-plot-before-various-revenue-tribunals/story-26X7Mck02rhGN09Lj3s9ZO.html
04-11-2020||Mumbai||BJP MLA files complaint against actor Amitabh Bachchan over question on quiz show||A legislator from the Maharashtra unit of the BJP has approached Latur police seeking action against actor Amitabh Bachchan and Sony Television Network for “hurting the sentiments of Hindus, and creating divide between Hindus and Buddhists.”During the October 30 episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati? host Bachchan posed a question about which scripture was burnt by Dr BR Ambedkar and his followers on December 25, 1927. One of the options was Manusmriti (the others were Vishnu Puran, Bhagvat Gita and Rigved). After participants, social activist Bezwada Wilson and actor Anup Soni picked the right answer, Bachchan said, “Ambedkar condemned the ancient Hindu text Manusmriti” that ideologically justified “discrimination and untouchability and burned its copies”.  To be sure, the questions and comments are scripted by the show’s producers, not Bachchan.The question led to outrage and, on Tuesday, the MLA from Ausa in Latur, Abhimanyu Pawar, submitted a complaint to the police on Tuesday. “All the four options were related to the Hindu religion and it establishes that it was a deliberate attempt to hurt their sentiments,” he said. The MLA also stated, “KBC has tried to create friction between Hindus and Buddhists by reviving the old memories about Dr Ambedkar’s bitter remarks against the Hindu religion, Manusmriti and his religious differences.” Dr Ambedkar along with his lakhs of followers converted to Buddhism on October 14, 1956. Latur SP Nikhil Pingle said, “We will decide on the sections to apply and whether to file an FIR. It may take couple of more days.” Spokespersons for Sony and Bachchan did not respond to requests for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-mla-files-complaint-against-actor-amitabh-bachchan-over-question-on-quiz-show/story-g8K2OqLFrtNkXF4efynBeP.html
04-11-2020||Mumbai||To reduce pollution, reserve Mumbai’s major roads for cyclists once a week: Mayor Kishori Pednekar||To reduce pollution in the financial capital, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar has suggested reserving major roads once a week only for cycling. Pednekar said that multiple government agencies would have to coordinate to implement this initiative. The suggestion was made during the road safety committee meeting chaired by member of Parliament (MP) Arvind Sawant on Tuesday.“There is a need to encourage cycling in the city. All government agencies should be working in tandem to ensure that cycling gets equal importance in road transport,” said Pednekar.Sawant supported the mayor’s proposal. “If not for the entire day, at least a few hours should be reserved for cycling, during which time no motorised transport should be allowed,” he said.Meanwhile, the MP directed the traffic police department to initiate action against illegal parking of two-wheelers and four-wheelers across the city. “The illegal parking menace has increased, creating huge traffic jams in several parts of the city. This should be disciplined,” Sawant said.The road safety committee was formed by the Centre in 2018 and holds meetings every three months. Key issues regarding illegal parking menace, vehicular pollution, road accidents and pedestrianisation were discussed at the meeting. Jitendra Gupta, member of Mumbai Transport Forum, said, “It is not feasible to stop motorised transport on roads as it will hamper the city’s economy at such a crucial time. The mayor should focus on the existing cycle track project which has been delayed for some time now. Also, this move should be data-driven and not just ideas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/to-reduce-pollution-reserve-mumbai-s-major-roads-for-cyclists-once-a-week-mayor-kishori-pednekar/story-O4Omu8it3rs1M8LZlAXO0K.html

One of the two being a juvenile was transferred to a correction home. The plaintiff also alleged that one Amit, who was also accused in the same case, was eliminated by the police in a fake counter.The petitioner said that one day her daughter and niece had gone to meet Amit in Karnal when two cops, who were in a drunken state, misbehaved with them. This resulted in a fight between the cops and Amit and the cops got injured. When the girls came to know of the cops’ murder, the duo themselves came forward and went to the police, but they were booked in the murder case instead and eliminated Amit, the plea alleges, further accusing that the duo were raped by 10-12 cops in custody.It has been alleged that both the women require immediate medical attention and treatment, which is being denied to them by the authorities concerned. Hence, directions need to be issued in this regard. Representations have been moved at different levels but to no avail, the plea alleges.The Sonepat woman has also sought permission to meet her daughter and niece, which is being denied to her since July. The petitioner said she met the two briefly on July 18, when the survivor’s told her that 10-12 policemen had raped and molested them.

The main objective is to take stock and assess the poll preparedness in the times of pandemic,” said a senior official.With the Bihar elections coming to an end by the end of this week, the ECI is now gradually shifting its focus towards Bengal where assembly polls are expected in the next few months.Also read: Army chief off to Nepal, visit expected to ease ties after border row“Groundwork is going on.

04-11-2020||City||SAD, BJP file 41 objections to delimitation of wards in Mohali||Former councillors from both Shiromani Akali Dal and Bharatiya Janata Party have filed 41 objections to the delimitation of wards in Mohali as 70% seats held by them in the previous municipal corporation House have either been recarved or reserved or dereserved to their detriment ahead of the upcoming civic body elections.In most of the objections, the councillors have accused the ruling Congress government in Punjab of acting like a dictator and carrying out delimitation to benefit its party councillors. However, municipal commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg rubbished all objections, stating that the delimitation was done as per rules and regulations of the state government. “The objections have been sent to the director, local bodies, who will take the final call,” he said.Former Akali councillor Parminder Singh Sohana, in his objections, questioned as to why the names of mayor or deputy mayor were not included in the delimitation board. “It clearly states that the intention of the Congress was not clean,” he said.Former BJP councillor Rajinder Sharma alleged delimitation was not done as per rules, and its only purpose was to benefit Congress councillors.Meanwhile, former Congress councillor Kuljeet Singh Bedi, who was also a member of the delimitation board, said: “Both SAD and BJP are making unnecessary hue and cry, as they know they are going to lose the elections badly. Everything has been done as per rules.”In fact, on the plea of five former councillors, the Punjab and Haryana high court on November 1 had put the Punjab government and Mohali administration on notice. The plea sought quashing of the July 31 notification through which the delimitation board was constituted as well as the October 28 notification that subsequently recarved the wards.The delimitation board was constituted by the local bodies department to redraw boundaries of wards based on the recent census. The population under the MC’s jurisdiction has gone up from 1.64 lakh to 1.87 lakh since the last delimitation.In the first MC elections held in Mohali in 2015, the Congress had won from 15 wards and the SAD-BJP alliance got 23 seats. The Azad group, led by Kulwant Singh, won from 10 while two seats went to Independents.With the support of his group besides 14 Congress councillors and the two Independents, Kulwant was elected Mohali’s first mayor in August 2015. Two years later, the Azad group merged into the SAD. In the upcoming elections, the SAD and BJP will be contesting separately after their alliance at the Centre broke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-bjp-file-41-objections-to-delimitation-of-wards-in-mohali/story-IGX5hLtCDal7hJYD7O1gtI.html
04-11-2020||City||Panchkula ACP among 16 cops injured as protesting villagers turn violent||Sixteen cops, including ACP Raj Kumar, were injured — six of them gravely — after being attacked by protesters at Rattewali village, 20km from Panchkula district headquarters, on Tuesday.The locals, who had blocked a road to stop mining in the area, damaged government vehicles and pelted stones at the police team, which had gone there to disperse them.“The government has allotted mining contract in Rattewali, but some miscreants had blocked the way for the past few days and were also obstructing vehicular movement,” said ACP Raj Kumar. After a dialogue failed on October 31, the protesters were issued a notice to vacate the area, but they remained adamant.Around noon, a police team along with duty magistrate Sunil Jakhara went to the spot to disperse the crowd. “At 1:30pm, they started pelting stones at us, and damaged an ambulance, my official vehicle and three other government vehicles. One of them even fired in the air. Initially there were around 120 of them, but their number swelled soon,” said the ACP.“The crowd got too violent within minutes. We ran towards the fields to save ourselves,” said home guard Ankit Kumar. Among others, ACP’s gunman Sonu got a severe injury on his right eye and head. DCP Mohit Handa said the cops were fully prepared but exercised self-restraint. A case of attempt to murder besides under other relevant sections has been registered against the protesters, he said, adding that 14 of them have been rounded up. “Police teams have been deployed to keep the situation under control,” he said.What mining officer, village sarpanch sayAccording to mining officer Omdut Sharma 45 hectares of riverbed area was auctioned to a Jharkhand company in 2017. Mining started in September, after environmental clearance and other formalities.As villagers protested on September 26, highlighting irregularities, a panel probed the matter and the firm was fined ₹53 lakh for digging more than the permissible limit. The contractor deposited ₹26 lakh on October 30, but the villagers were still not relenting.Sarpanch Roki Ram said the contractor has been allowed to resume digging without taking villagers into confidence, even as their fields are just next to the mining site. “Also, earlier some percentage of the revenue was shared with the panchayat or farmers, but this time we have got nothing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panchkula-acp-among-16-cops-injured-as-protesting-villagers-turn-violent/story-WDSxRVWXherpqKICQL9pZK.html
04-11-2020||Delhi||Dehi’s ISBTs reopen, 1542 buses come on Day 1; social distancing norms go for a toss||As interstate bus services resumed in Delhi after more than seven months, the scene at the city’s two major bus terminals (ISBTs), at Kashmere Gate and Anand Vihar, were in stark contrast. While Kashmere Gate had mostly all Covid-19 safety mechanisms in place, the latter was in disarray.On Day 1, 542 interstate buses carrying over 20,000 passengers arrived in the Capital through the three ISBTs (the third of which is at Sarai Kale Khan) till 5.30 pm. Passengers arrived from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, with some returning to the city for work, and many others travelling to celebrate Diwali with their friends and family.The Kashmere Gate ISBT saw a fair rush in the morning, with long queues at the entry gate as passengers were thermally screened and frisked using contactless devices, while staff members sanitised luggage inside the premises. Yet, social distancing norms were often thrown to the wind as people would rush in a horde, jostling to either get entry to the terminal, collect their luggage or to buy a ticket. Despite a properly designed waiting area, people crowded the narrow bus bays, even while drivers waited patiently till all the seats were occupied.Kavalpreet Kaur, who arrived at Kashmere Gate ISBT from Punjab on Tuesday morning pointed out that the terminal did not have any Covid-19 testing centre or camp for those who voluntarily wanted to get themselves checked.“I travelled all night in a bus that was full of passengers. A Covid testing centre here would not just help me, but also the city administration to identify and quarantine those who have the infection,” she said.Apart from a few security guards at the entry gate, Kashmere Gate ISBT had absolutely no police officer, district official or civil defence volunteer to warn or prosecute violators of Covid-19 norms. The situation was much worse at the other two ISBTs, especially at Anand Vihar, which shares its border with Uttar Pradesh. On Tuesday, the Anand Vihar ISBT received 257 interstate buses, followed by 242 buses in Kashmere Gate and 43 buses at Sarai Kale Khan.Despite being host to the most passengers, the Anand Vihar ISBT was short of proper arrangements. Four people were deployed for screening and sanitisation, two of who were deployed to check the temperatures of only the driver and conductor, and two others who sanitised buses — mostly from the outside. The Anand Vihar terminal had no facilities to thermally screening passengers, or to sanitise their luggage. It also did not have any sanitiser spray available for public-use. Female passengers, said they were especially hassled, saying the washroom was too dirty to use.Several also complained about passengers’ displaying a lack of hygiene.Yadunath Singh, and his family were boarding a bus from Anand Vihar ISBT, headed for his hometown in Ram Nagar, Uttarakhand, to celebrate Diwali.“I am fed up of people spitting here. This problem is peculiar to Anand Vihar ISBT. Don’t people know that Covid-19 spreads from droplets? There is not a single official to prosecute violators. While walking around the ISBT, most passengers had their masks either on their chin or hanging from their ears,” said an angry Singh.The testing centre, located between the bus terminal and Metro station, was not conducting any Covid-19 tests when HT visited the facility at 4pm. A district official deployed to oversee testing there said they wrapped up by 3.30pm. “We do 1,000-2,000 tests daily, most of which are performed using the rapid antigen method. The most RT-PCR tests we have conducted at this facility are around 300 on a single day. Very few have tested positive so far, but we immediately send those who do to the Covid Care Centre at Akshardham on an ambulance,” said an official deployed there. KK Dahiya, managing director of the Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (DTIDC) Limited that manages and operates all the ISBTs, said people are being de-boarded at the entry gate of the ISBTs, from where they are being allowed to leave for their respective destinations in the city. “There was no crowding observed on day one, as the number of buses allowed to enter the terminal has been slashed to 50% until November 15. Moreover, it was the first day, so fewer buses arrived. The number will gradually go up,” Dahiya said. Before the onset of the pandemic, the three ISBTs would witness a combined footfall of over 250,000 every day. On a daily basis, there were 3,500 trips of interstate buses and 2,000 trips of local buses.According to the SOP prepared by the Delhi government, interstate buses have to be sanitised by the respective depots of bus operators at the point of origin and before departure from the respective ISBT. The conductors or the drivers of interstate buses were also to submit a certificate issued by the respective depot of the bus being thoroughly sanitised, but only five such certificates of the 257 buses that arrived at Anand Vihar were submitted at the terminal. The story was same for the other two terminals as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehi-s-isbts-reopen-1542-buses-come-on-day-1-social-distancing-norms-go-for-a-toss/story-J6WO9Dg2zEWWfuiASw4xYJ.html

Despite this, online OBE were held for the university’s 260,000 final-year UG and PG students between August 10 and 31.University officials said they are looking to resolve students’ complaints within three days of them being filed.Yogendra Jaiswal, a student of Rajdhani College a BCom (Hons) student said he was given zero in two subjects, results that he said were “not possible”. “How can one get a zero in the open book format where we were allowed to use books? I have already taken admission in an MBA programme in a private institute in Pune and my family also took a bank loan of ₹16 lakh for my higher education. I have to submit my final-year mark sheets by November 10. They won’t allow me to join with this result.”Jaiswal visited his college on Tuesday, and was asked to submit a request for re-evaluation. “I do not know how much time the university will take to declare the results. I am extremely anxious about my future,” he said.RD Sharma, the college’s nodal officer to deal with OBE matters, said Jaiswal’s is not an isolated case in Rajdhani College. “We have received complaints of around 14-15 students who have either been marked absent or been given zero marks in some subjects. We have around five such cases in B Com (Hons) itself. We have contacted the University’s examination branch, which has asked us to forward the applications to them with the respective answer scripts,” he said.During the exams, students were given four hours to download question papers from the DU examination portal, complete the test, scan and upload the answer scripts. Students were also given an option to email the answer scripts to their college. Teachers evaluated these exam scripts online. Officials at other colleges said they have been receiving similar complaints from students. Binoy Bhushan, nodal officer at Aryabhatta College, said he has received at least 60 such complaints over the past week. “The students even have the acknowledgment slips issued to them by the University’s examination portal after they submitted their answer scripts and have still been marked absent in those subjects,” he said. Ramjas College’s nodal officer Ritu Sharma said they have received over 50 such complaints.“The complaints are from students who have either been marked absent or received a zero in some subjects. Students are distressed. Many of them have to apply for Masters courses, and deadlines to submit final results and provisional certificates of having qualified the undergraduate exams are fast approaching,” she said.At Hindu College, at least 25 students have been marked absent in one or more subjects despite appearing in the exams. College nodal officer KK Kaul said, “The University should issue a notification asking all other higher education institutions to extend the dates of submission of undergraduate results otherwise many students will miss out on their opportunities.” The University’s dean of examinations DS Rawat said the department is trying to resolve the complaints within three days of receiving them. “Many students have not entered their details, including paper code or roll number properly on the paper before scanning and sending it. Some of them have also sent the answers scripts to multiple email addresses. That’s why these issues are arising. We are taking note of each and every complaint and trying to resolve it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/marked-absent-given-zero-final-year-students-sweat-over-faulty-du-results-of-online-exams/story-tWJ7Uft2iBp0SJrk0GCoJL.html
04-11-2020||Delhi||Manish Sisodia reviews the progress of coding program in govt schools||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia Tuesday interacted with students and teachers of government schools to review the progress of the coding program, which was recently introduced in over 1,000 schools in partnership with Hindustan Times (HT).Under the HT Codeathon program, as many as 12,469 students from about 1,000 Delhi government schools are being trained in computer coding and programming skills. Of them, 1,018 students have already completed five chapters within a fortnight of the launch, said the education minister’s office in a statement released on Tuesday. The program was launched on October 8. Lauding the achievements of students, Sisodia said, “It is my dream to see our students create their own companies like Google, and watch them take it worldwide. Coding is giving these students the wings to fly from an early stage of schooling.”During their interaction with Sisodia, students also shared their experiences of being part of the program. Simran, a student of a government school in Civil Lines, who has created an adventure game, said, “Until now, I’ve been playing games created by other developers. But now I’ve got the chance to create my own game.” Bhaskar, a student of Class 9 at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Mahipalpur, said, “I had only heard of coding but now I have an actual chance to learn it.” He has also created a WhatsApp group so he can help other students to learn computer coding. Madhulika Pandey, a teacher at Govt Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Dwarka Sector 13, said, “These students, who didn’t even know to log in to a system until last month, are now creating their own programs. It’s a matter of great pride for me that I’m able to see them achieve so much in so little time. It’s heartening to see them improve so much every single day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sisodia-reviews-the-progress-of-coding-program-in-govt-schools/story-B0pQVdUy4SZXmyQkKxk9zJ.html

The contractual nursing staff at Kasturba Hospital and Hindu Rao Hospital Tuesday announced that they, too, will join strike from November 5 (Thursday) if their demand for the immediate release of pending salaries is not met. The regular nursing staff of Kasturba hospital, Hindu Rao hospital, Girdharilal Maternity hospital, Rajan Babu TB hospital are already on an indefinite strike since Monday. All these hospitals are under the North DMC.BL Sharma, president, Kasturba Hospital Nurses Union, said the nursing staff of Valmiki hospital has also joined the strike over non-payment of salaries. “It is unfortunate that health workers have to go on an indefinite strike during a pandemic, but the civic body’s apathy towards us has compelled us to do so. They should clear three months’ pending salaries of nurses and four months’ pending salaries of other paramedic employees immediately,” Sharma said. Indu Jamwal, president, Hindu Rao Hospital Nurses Union, said until now, only permanent nurses and other health workers were on strike but from Tuesday, even contractual nursing staff have joined the stir. “Contractual nursing staff at Hindu Rao and Kasturba hospitals, who were working until now, will join our indefinite strike from November 5. They have also not been paid for four months. We will not call off our strike until our dues are cleared,” she said. Nurses at hospitals across north corporation have not been paid salaries for the months of August, September and October while other paramedic employees have not been given salaries since June 2020. Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said, “We are trying to arrange funds so that we can pay at least two months’ salary to the agitating employees by Diwali. I appeal to the health workers that they call off their strike.”Doctors in north corporation-run hospitals had also gone on strike last month over non-payment of salaries and they withdrew the agitation only after the corporation paid their salaries till September. The nursing and other auxillary staff have remained unpaid, a nursing staff on strike said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nursing-staff-of-valmiki-hospital-join-ongoing-stir-over-unpaid-salaries/story-VaDa9MGkvY4Yt3nbufz4dM.html
04-11-2020||Delhi||Taxi driver held for sexually assaulting, strangling 3-year-old child in Burari||A 32-year-old private taxi driver was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting and murdering the three-year-old son of a female friend in north Delhi’s Burari on Thursday night, police said on Tuesday. The driver was arrested on Saturday, two days after the crime came to light, and has been sent to jail, they said. The police said the woman is a beautician and lives with her husband at their home in outer Delhi’s Mangolpuri. Apart from Delhi-NCR cities, the woman visits other states for professional purposes. She knew the taxi driver for the past six-seven months, as she often hired his cab for outstation visits. On October 20, the woman left the home with her three children after an altercation with her husband. She asked the taxi driver to pick them up in his cab and went to her parental home in Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr, said a senior police officer, who did not want to be named. According to the officer, on October 28, the woman and her children reached Jaipur in his taxi from Bulandshahr for some work. They all returned to Delhi on October 29. The woman chose to stay at the taxi driver’s home with her children because of the argument she had with her husband, the officer said. In the evening, the woman’s three-year-old son was constantly crying when the driver took the child out for a drive in order to comfort him, her permission, police said. “Around 10 pm, he returned with the unconscious child. There were bruises on the body. When the woman asked him, he tried to mislead her, saying it could be because of reaction to some medicine she had been administering to her son,” the officer said, quoting the woman’s statement. The woman rushed her child to a nearby government in his taxi. After examining the child, the doctors declared him brought dead and told her about the possibility of a sexual assault. The hospital authorities informed the police. “When the woman confronted the taxi driver, he fled. A case of murder and sodomy was registered at the Burari police station. He was caught on Saturday,” the officer added. The police officer said the man confessed and said he sexually assaulted the child in the taxi at an isolated place and strangled him to death to avoid getting identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/taxi-driver-held-for-sexually-assaulting-and-strangling-three-year-old-child-in-burari/story-xkpGzPDCGSebePQLdZqrPJ.html

04-11-2020||Chandigarh||Sero survey: Virus prevalence high in homemakers in Haryana||The second round of serological survey conducted by the Haryana health department has revealed that spread of coronavirus in the economically active population was in the range of 13.9% to 15.4%. About 14.8% population was found infected in the second round of survey as against 8% two months ago. The virus transmission was found the highest in the 38-47 (3,387 blood samples) and 48-57 (2,715 samples) age groups at 15.6% and 15.4% respectively.The survey was conducted to determine the extent of coronavirus spread and measure the proportion of population exposed to infection including asymptomatic individuals. Director general health services, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), Dr Usha Gupta said there was not much difference in the sero-positivity rate of active population in the state. Dr Gupta said it indicated that the virus spread was uniform among the active age groups. While 14.8% women were found having Covid-19 antibodies during the serological survey, the number of housewives tested for antibodies constituted a majority 45% of the 16,512 persons tested. Also, 53% women participants as against 47% men were tested during the survey. In terms of fatalities, housewives accounted for a higher 11% deaths. Dr Gupta said the probability of number of housewives being infected in big numbers indicated spread in households as well as exposure to vegetable vendors leading to infection. High number of asymptomatic patients The health authorities took 91% blood samples from people who did not have any comorbidity (an existing medical condition) for conducting the serological survey. “This indicates that the number of infected asymptomatic persons is sizeable. Since they did not have comorbidities, they did not develop any medical complication due to the virus infection,” a health official said. As per the findings of the survey, 61% participants wore mask during outing or visits of outsiders to their homes. Majority of the participants in Gurugram, Bhiwani, Kurukshetra, Sirsa, Rewari, Jhajjar wore a mask when going out or during visits by the guests. However, the number of mask wearing individuals was comparatively lower in Yamunanagar, Kaithal, Faridabad, Nuh, and Fatehabad districts, the report said. It also said that 61% participants were found to be following social distancing norms. People in Bhiwani, Gurugram, Kurukshetra, Sirsa and Rewari maintained better social distancing in comparison to the Faridabad, Nuh and Fatehabad districts while going out. Dr. Gupta said 720 samples were collected from each of the 22 districts covering both urban and rural population.A stratified multi-stage random sampling technique was used by selecting 12 rural and four urban clusters randomly for taking samples. “Blood samples were collected from selected individuals after taking written consent and then their sera were tested for immunoglobulin anti-bodies using ELISA test kit approved by ICMR,” she||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sero-survey-virus-prevalence-high-in-homemakers-in-haryana/story-6grIAnUdkwC5moTIFQeTEO.html
04-11-2020||Chandigarh||Bad air quality can increase Covid-19 fatalities, warns UT health department||Amid the deteriorating air quality, the Chandigarh health department has warned against bursting of firecrackers, which experts warned will increase the Covid-related complications, including fatalities. “Several studies conducted in Italy and the US have shown that high levels of air pollution are linked to higher rates of mortality due to Covid-19. Reports have also shown that 15% of the corona-related deaths are due to air pollution and the elderly and persons with comorbidities are at the greater risk,” the health department said. The constant threat of the second surge of Covid-19 looming large, clubbed with air pollution caused by bursting of crackers and fireworks, can be dangerous for the people with compromised lungs, the department has said. It further added that as winters set in, dry air could aggravate breathing difficulties, especially among those suffering from lung ailments. “If we add smoke to the ambient air by bursting crackers, then it could turn into a recipe for disaster. The poisonous gas that is emitted from crackers and fireworks is particularly dangerous for people who are suffering from coronavirus, whether in hospital or in quarantine. Even those who have recovered from the infection will become vulnerable if we do not restrain ourselves this Diwali,” the advisory stated. Against the 106 deaths in September, the number of fatalities has dropped to 62 in the month of October. As many as 228 people have lost their lives due to Covid-19 so far in Chandigarh. Director, health services, Dr Amandeep Kaur Kang, advised that people should stay indoors and refrain from bursting firecrackers during the festival season in order to prevent air pollution and protect the elderly and people with comorbidities. “Public cooperation will help in keeping the transmission of Covid-19 under control and decrease the risk of mortality in the coming months,” the department has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bad-air-quality-can-increase-covid-19-fatalities-ut-health-department-warns/story-eHWdgMXNerxKC8XZiv1qnM.html

According to PUTA, the V-C assured them that a complete schedule had already been prepared for all pending cases according to which all interviews would be done by mid-December. However, the body demanded that the complete schedule be handed over to them by Wednesday otherwise, they would continue to protest. The body also asked the V-C to approach the Punjab government to get clearance for an early implementation of the 7th pay commission. PUTA also took up the issue of unnecessary delay in payment of retirement benefits and payment of interest on the provident fund in the case of senior teachers.

04-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: A creeper that inspires poetry||The famous bougainvillea tree of Lodhi Garden, in Delhi, must now be decked with papery pink flowers—and so must be the many bougainvillaeas of the Parsi Cemetery behind Khan Market. While blinding red poppies recently surfaced in the East of Kailash public park, not far from Nehru Place. Before that, there was the blood of semal trees to be seen across the Delhi region—they have just started to fade. Soon enough, the golden-yellow glow of Amaltas flowers will arrive.It is that time of the year.But who is there to share their pictures on Instagram? Now that we mobile phone photographers are exiled to languish within homes—or at least those of us lucky enough to have a home.The city is under a 21-day-long lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. There is no knowing how long the daymare might last.A sensitive poet holed up within a flat somewhere in west Delhi’s A Block, Vikas Puri, is feeling the frustration. But Jasbir Chatterjee is resourceful, finding refuge by reliving the memories of MG Road, a place in Gurugram where she used to go to work until late last year.“I can still see in my mind’s eyes those magenta-colored bougainvillaeas outside my then office, and the red poppies, the white champas, the orange gulmohars, and the yellow amaltas... all laid out so nicely on the lovely MG Road—how gorgeous they looked under the morning sun,” recalls Ms Chatterjee, 54. With a day job as a customer care manager in a luxury car showroom, the “poet by hobby” is talking to this reporter on WhatsApp from the isolation of the second-floor apartment that she shares with her husband and daughter.For two years, Ms Chatterjee would make the Metro commute from her home to MG Road in the so-called Millennium City. The morning rush would be super-crowded (crowd?! how one misses the crowd!). Ms Chatterjee was never able to get an empty seat during the two-hour-long shuttle. But it was all worth the trouble—the journey would end in beauty—getting down at MG Road Metro station, exiting out from the staircase and then.... “finally the leisurely walk to the office, as I was rarely late, through the picturesque, tree-lined, flower-filled lane of MG.”That brief stroll was the most poetic element of her daily life shuttling between Delhi and Gurugram, she now feels. “MG Road gave words to the poetry in my soul, I would feel a sense of triumph after being through so many struggles to reach where I was at that point of time, both in my career and personal life.”This reporter, too, has witnessed the beauty in that stretch of MG Road. A pavement there teems with frangipani trees. Dense bunches of white flowers hang down precariously from the branches. The dusty ground would be covered with these flowers, some squashed by the feet of pedestrians.“May God bless those gardeners who toil so hard to make those bits of MG Road look like paradise,” says Ms Chatterjee. On her way back to the Metro station in the evening, “the shadows of the trees and the surrounding skyscrapers had a dream-like aura about them.”Ms Chatterjee now works in an office in Noida. “Sometimes I do spot an occasional bougainvillea around there, the overall surroundings are drab.”Which means that MG Road continues to haunt her. “I wonder how the flowers there are looking like these days, now that there is no one to admire them?”She leaves us with two poems she wrote about that place.Different livesOn a cool, pleasant evening,On MG Road,While a couplehugged each other,Another couple,A pair of crows,Stared into space;Their backs turned towards each other...Official bougainvillaeascall them official bougainvillaeasBecause they live and breatheInside office premises.They add bright, blazing colours,Soul, poetry, innocence, and freshnessTo our working hours.And inspire usTo find joy and happinessIn our own oppressive work lives, the inevitable politics…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-creeper-that-inspires-poetry/story-YmBkyIz0wj6QR6QEMWNaEO.html
