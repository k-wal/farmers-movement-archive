It ruled that the case lacked both “specific allegations” and “proof” of election wrongdoing.Trump’s campaign plans to appeal the ruling in the Supreme Court. The outgoing president has refused to acknowledge the election outcome and continues to try to overturn it based on unfounded claims of election fraud, which he and his Republican allies have failed to substantiate in any court yet.Trump has announced, meantime, he will campaign on Saturday in the state of Georgia, where sitting Republican senators are in a run-off election in January that will determine control of Senate. If they lose, the Republican-ruled chamber will go to the Democrats, who already control the House of Representatives.Friday’s ruling on Pennsylvania by the three-judge bench of the 3rd circuit courts of appeal was one more setback for the president, whose lawsuits have been dismissed and derided by courts.“Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy,” wrote judge Stephanos Bibas in the ruling. “Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.” Bibas is a Trump appointee, and the other two judges were all appointed by Republican presidents.The lawsuit seeking to block the state from certifying Biden’s victory was earlier dismissed by a lower court that said its fraud allegation was “without merit” and “like Frankenstein’s monster, has been haphazardly stitched together”.Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis tweeted after Friday verdict, “On to SCOTUS!” She was referring to the Supreme Court.Along with his legal efforts, Trump has also sought to rope in Republican legislatures in the battleground states to overturn the election. He tried unsuccessfully in Michigan and has now pinned his hopes on state legislators in Pennsylvania, who are running with the same discredited charges.Trump is fast running out of time. He has until December 8, the last day for states to certify the election outcomes. Electors of the electoral college granted to both him and Biden will vote on December 14 to formalise the results. Biden has beaten Trump 306-232 in electoral votes.Trump returns to the campaign trail in Georgia, a solidly Republican state won by Biden this time, amid wild poll fraud and corruption allegations levelled by him and his lawyers against Republican leaders of the state - governor Brian Kemp and secretary of state Brad Raffensperger.Both of them have been voters and supporters of the president, but find themselves in his crosshairs for backing his baseless election fraud claims. Republican senators seeking re-election, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have sided with the president for fear of angering his supporters. The Republican Party is at war with itself there.If Perdue and Loeffler lose, the Senate will be a 50-50 tie between Republicans and Democrats who hold 50 and 48 seats respectively after the November 3 elections. With vice-president Kamala Harris as the tie vote, Democrats in that case will seize the chamber.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-loses-yet-another-legal-battle-will-campaign-in-georgia/story-zIWFnqdzhv8WkfRGLP0y3L.html

Previously, it was forbidden to leave home for more than an hour and travel more than a kilometer from the place of residence.Meanwhile, stores resuming their operations should follow stricter sanitary rules -- they need at least eight square meters (86 square feet) of space per one customer. Beauty salons and hairdressers are required to provide services only by the previous appointment.The second stage of easing coronavirus-related restrictions is set to begin on December 15 and envisages a curfew instead of quarantine and lifting a ban on the citizens’ movement across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-begins-to-gradually-ease-covid-19-related-restrictions/story-nKG5YNszW4gLqRMQGt0xfO.html

In a television interview broadcast on Friday night, Lam said that the government is paying her salary in cash because she doesn’t have a bank account.“Sitting in front of you is a chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR who has no banking service made available to her,” Lam, said to be one of the highest-paid leaders in the world with a reported annual salary of $670,000, told a local English TV channel.Also Read | Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam vows to restore political orderWhy Carrie Lam doesn’t have a bank account?Lam is facing sanctions from the US treasury department in response to China’s national security law for Hong Kong. The department had announced sanctions on 11 individuals, including Lam and Hong Kong Police Force commissioner Chris Tang. It held Lam directly responsible for implementing Beijing’s policies of “suppression of freedom and democratic processes”.“Lam is designated for being involved in developing, adopting, or implementing the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in...Hong Kong,” read the statement. The sanction led to the freezing of US assets of a dozen Hong Kong officials in a city, famous as Asia’s key financial hub, with numerous US-based banks operating in the region.The Hong Kong leader said that she was “using cash every day for all the things”. “I have piles of cash at home, the government is paying me cash for my salary because I don’t have a bank account,” she added.

The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is returning to London to restart face-to-face talks this weekend. There are still major issues to be resolved around access to British fishing waters, security arrangements and competition.If a deal can be agreed, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to put it to parliament before Christmas. His majority of 80 in the house means any deal is likely to go through even if the Labour party abstains from voting. But Starmer believes the consequences of a no-deal Brexit from the transition period would be too dire for the party to simply abstain and stand on the sidelines, the Guardian said, without citing sources. The paper said Starmer is likely to avoid using language such as “supporting” the deal and will make a speech setting out more details of how Labour sees Britain’s future place in the world.David Frost, who’s leading the UK’s Brexit negotiating team, was downbeat on the chances of securing a deal this week. “Some people are asking me why we are still talking,” Frost tweeted. “My answer is that it’s my job to do my utmost to see if the conditions for a deal exist. It is late, but a deal is still possible, and I will continue to talk until it’s clear that it isn’t.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-labour-party-could-back-brexit-deal-says-report/story-dZ2QGtubMOFfVSDe4mYesL.html

28-11-2020||World||Iranian scientist killing could trigger serious confrontation with Israel. Here’s why||The killing of a top Iranian scientist could snowball into a serious confrontation in the region as the Islamic Republic has vowed to avenge the death. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran’s most senior nuclear scientist, was killed in an ambush near Tehran on Friday, triggering strong reactions from country’s top leadership.Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday accused Israel of assassinating the scientist, who was long suspected by the west of masterminding the secret nuclear programme for the country. “Once again, the wicked hands of the global arrogance, with the usurper Zionist regime as the mercenary, were stained with the blood of a son of this nation,” Rouhani said in a statement published on his official website.Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called for “definitive punishment” of those behind the assassination of the scientist, calling Fakhrizadeh as “the country’s prominent and distinguished nuclear and defensive scientist.”Hossein Dehghan, the military adviser to Khamenei, vowed to “strike as thunder at the killers of this oppressed martyr”, suggesting Israel’s hand behind the assassination. Taking to Twitter, Dehghan said that Israel seels to intensify the pressure on Iran for a “full-blown war” in the last few days of the Trump administration.Also Read | Iran’s supreme leader vows revenge over slain scientistWhat is JCPoA or Iran nuclear deal?The United States, Russia, China, Germany, Britain and France entered a deal with Iran in 2015, agreeing to provide sanctions relief in lieu of preventing the nation from developing nuclear weapons. Later in 2018, US President Donald Trump announced Washington’s withdrawal from that Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), calling it “the worst deal ever”.Since then, the Trump administration has continued to impose sanctions on Tehran as a part of its “maximum pressure” campaign. However, US’ withdrawal prompted Iran to renege on its commitments made under the nuclear deal and escalated its uranium enrichment.Also Read | Who is the Iranian scientist killed in Tehran?Why is Iran suspecting Israel?Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Iran of continuing to seek nuclear weapons and warned about a secret atomic warehouse. “Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh,” Netanyahu had said in 2018, referring to the now slain scientist. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspected the alleged atomic warehouse site in February 2019 and found traces of uranium. IAEA published a report on Iran’s nuclear activities and the implementation of its commitment under JCPoA.The global watchdog reported that Iran has stockpiled more than 12 times the amount of enriched uranium permitted under the nuclear deal. The UN agency observed that the presence of multiple uranium particles of anthropogenic origin at a location not declared to it still needs to be fully and promptly explained by Iran to allay any possible concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-scientist-killing-could-trigger-serious-confrontation-with-israel-here-s-why/story-GqTZOLLAoxeaFDZ7bOeVrL.html
28-11-2020||World||Protests to erupt over security law as France reels from police violence||Dozens of rallies are planned Saturday against a new French law that would restrict sharing images of police, only days after the country was shaken by footage showing officers beating and racially abusing a black man.The case shocked France with celebrities and politicians alike condemning the officers’ actions, and has brought debate over President Emmanuel Macron’s law to boiling point.Macron on Friday called the incident an “unacceptable attack” and asked the government to come up with proposals to “fight against discrimination”.One of the most controversial elements of the new law is Article 24, which would criminalise the publication of images of on-duty police officers with the intent of harming their “physical or psychological integrity”.It was passed by the National Assembly last week -- although it is awaiting Senate approval -- provoking rallies and protests across France.Rally organisers are calling for the article to be withdrawn, claiming that it contradicts “the fundamental public freedoms of our Republic”.“This bill aims to undermine the freedom of the press, the freedom to inform and be informed, the freedom of expression,” one of Saturday’s protest organisers said.Trade unions are expected to join the demonstrations, with members of the yellow vests -- whose sometimes violent protests in 2018 and 2019 shook the country -- also expected. In Paris, the authorities had demanded that organisers limit the rally to a single location, but on Friday evening officials authorised a march.And in a sign that the government could be preparing to backtrack, Prime Minister Jean Castex announced Friday that he would appoint a commission to redraft Article 24.Under the article, offenders could be sentenced to up to a year in jail, and fined 45,000 euros ($53,000) for sharing images of police officers.The government says the provision is intended to protect officers from doxxing and online abuse, but critics say it is further evidence of the Macron administration’s slide to the right.But media unions say it could give police a green light to prevent journalists -- and social media users -- from documenting abuses.They point to the case of music producer Michel Zecler, whose racial abuse and beating at the hands of police was recorded by CCTV and later published online, provoking widespread criticism of the officers’ actions.In another instance, journalists on the ground at a French migrant camp witnessed and recorded police brutality on Monday as the Paris area was cleared.In a letter seen by AFP, Paris police chief Didier Lallement wrote to officers ahead of Saturday’s demonstration that “in the coming days, the coming weeks... there’s no doubt you will face difficulty, doubt, even anger and fear”.But he insisted that he could “count on the integrity, sense of honour and ethics” among the force.Protests over police brutality have already taken place elsewhere in country.In the southern city of Toulouse demonstrators took to the streets on Friday evening brandishing placards with slogans like “police everywhere, justice nowhere”.In western Nantes police said around 3,500 rallied, while organisers put the crowd at 6,000-7,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-to-erupt-over-security-law-as-france-reels-from-police-violence/story-dtwexpSq1pmYLS9jLU7zWJ.html

An issue with a batch of testing chemicals meant their test results were void,” a department spokesman said in an emailed statement.“Swift action was taken to notify those affected and they have been asked to take another test, and to continue to self-isolate if they have symptoms.”The laboratory error that led to the problem was an “isolated incident” and was being investigated, the statement said.The government has announced an extra 7 billion pounds ($9.31 billion) for its Covid-19 testing and contact tracing system as part of an expanded programme of mass testing.The NHS Test and Trace system has been heavily criticised after a series of high-profile failures since its launch earlier this year, and ministers concede it has not performed as well as they had hoped.In September, nearly 16,000 positive case records were lost from the system for several days – causing a delay in contact tracing. The government blamed a “legacy” file system that cut off records after about 65,000 rows of data.Reuters analysis and interviews with contact tracers have shown issues with the system, and that when looking at non-household contacts, the proportion that is successfully traced is lower.The United Kingdom has had about 1.6 million coronavirus cases and over 57,500 deaths, according to a Reuters tally https://tmsnrt.rs/3cBeEYg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-testing-error-wrongly-tells-1-300-people-they-have-coronavirus/story-akr5aRtLp0NtM4hJlhKWVM.html

The people want political leaders to help them, not constantly fight for power,” Muhyiddin said.Malaysia is facing a new wave of coronavirus infections, with cumulative cases rising more than four-fold since September to more than 60,000 as of Friday.

28-11-2020||World||Joe Biden’s win means some Guantanamo prisoners may be released||The oldest prisoner at the Guantanamo Bay detention center went to his latest review board hearing with a degree of hope, something that has been scarce during his 16 years locked up without charges at the US base in Cuba.Saifullah Paracha, a 73-year-old Pakistani with diabetes and a heart condition, had two things going for him that he didn’t have at previous hearings: a favorable legal development and the election of Joe Biden.President Donald Trump had effectively ended the Obama administration’s practice of reviewing the cases of men held at Guantanamo and releasing them if imprisonment was no longer deemed necessary. Now there’s hope that will resume under Biden.“I am more hopeful now simply because we have an administration to look forward to that isn’t dead set on ignoring the existing review process,” Paracha’s attorney, Shelby Sullivan-Bennis, said by phone from the base on Nov. 19 after the hearing.“The simple existence of that on the horizon I think is hope for all of us.” Guantanamo was once a source of global outrage and a symbol of US excess in response to terrorism. But it largely faded from the headlines after President Barack Obama failed to close it, even as 40 men continue to be detained there.Those pushing for its closure now see a window of opportunity, hoping Biden’s administration will find a way to prosecute those who can be prosecuted and release the rest, extricating the US from a detention center that costs more than $445 million per year.Biden’s precise intentions for Guantanamo remain unclear. Transition spokesman Ned Price said the president-elect supports closing it, but it would be inappropriate to discuss his plans in detail before he’s in office.His reticence is actually welcome to those who have pressed to close Guantanamo. Obama’s early pledge to close it is now seen as a strategic mistake that undercut what had been a bipartisan issue.“I think it’s more likely to close if it doesn’t become a huge press issue,” said Andrea Prasow, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch.The detention center opened in 2002. President George W. Bush’s administration transformed what had been a sleepy Navy outpost on Cuba’s southeastern tip into a place to interrogate and imprison people suspected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.US authorities maintain the men can be held as “law of war” detainees, remaining in custody for the duration of hostilities, an open-ended prospect.At its peak in 2003 — the year Paracha was captured in Thailand because of suspected ties to al-Qaida — Guantanamo held about 700 prisoners from nearly 50 countries. Bush announced his intention to close it, though 242 were still held there when his presidency ended.The Obama administration, seeking to allay concerns that some of those released had “returned to the fight,” set up a process to ensure those repatriated or resettled in third countries no longer posed a threat. It also planned to try some of the men in federal court.But his closure effort was thwarted when Congress barred the transfer of prisoners from Guantanamo to the US, including for prosecution or medical care. Obama ended up releasing 197 prisoners, leaving 41 for Trump.Trump in his 2016 campaign promised to “load” Guantanamo with “some bad dudes,” but largely ignored the issue after rescinding Obama’s policies. His administration approved a single release, a Saudi who pleaded guilty before a military commission.Of those remaining, seven men have cases pending before a military commission. They include five men accused of planning and supporting the Sept. 11 attacks. Additionally, there are two prisoners who were convicted by commission and three facing potential prosecution for the 2002 Bali bombing.Commission proceedings, including death penalty cases related to the Sept. 11 attacks, have bogged down as the defense fights to exclude evidence that resulted from torture. Trials are likely far in the future and would inevitably be followed by years of appeals.Defense attorneys say the incoming administration could authorize more military commission plea deals. Some have also suggested Guantanamo detainees could plead guilty in federal court by video and serve any remaining sentence in other countries, so they wouldn’t enter the United States.Detainee advocates also say Biden could defy Congress and bring prisoners to the US, arguing that the ban wouldn’t stand up in court.“It’s either do something about it or they die there without charge,” said Wells Dixon, a lawyer for two prisoners, including one who has pleaded guilty in the military commission and is awaiting sentencing.The remaining detainees include five who had been cleared for release before Trump took office and have languished since. Advocates want the Biden administration to review the rest, noting that many, had they been convicted in federal court, would have served their sentences and been released at this point.“Whittle it down to the folks who are being prosecuted and either prosecute them or don’t, but don’t just hang on to them,” said Joseph Margulies, a Cornell Law School professor who has represented one prisoner. “At great expense, we walk around with this thing around our necks. It does no good. It has no role for national security. It’s just a big black stain that provides no benefit whatsoever.” Over the years, nine prisoners have died at Guantanamo: seven from apparent suicide, one from cancer and one from a heart attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-win-means-some-guantanamo-prisoners-may-be-released/story-JnoNzLz4UDpLX7DQBddzHP.html

Lawmakers are due to vote on the restrictions the day before.But a growing number of lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative party have voiced opposition to the tiered restrictions plan.Some argue that the areas they represent have low infection rates but the toughest rules, while others say the new measures will cause unnecessary economic harm to local businesses. Defending the government’s plans in an article in The Times newspaper, Gove said “difficult decisions” were necessary to confront the crisis. The virus “is no respecter of constituency boundaries and the hardships we are facing now are unfortunately necessary to protect every single one of us, no matter where we live,” he wrote.The level of infection across the country remained “uncomfortably and threateningly high,” Gove said, noting that the number of hospital beds filled with infected patients was not far from its peak earlier in the year.He said that from the current high base, the National Health Service would be under severe threat if infections started to rise again, and tougher measures were needed to manage the virus when the current lockdown ends. “These new tiers, alongside the wider deployment of mass testing, have the capacity to prevent our NHS being overwhelmed until vaccines arrive,” Gove said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-s-hospitals-could-be-overwhelmed-without-new-tier-lockdown-system-says-minister/story-t16Rc7uCsdqxy04SO4sI3K.html

It says there is no issue of sovereignty to be resolved over them.China has also been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing’s concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.Beijing’s rising assertiveness against counter claimants in the East and South Sea has resulted in unprecedented agreement across the Indian-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-condemns-china-s-claim-of-sovereignty-over-senkaku-islands/story-IBK9ZRezFqs9S5NxBZyvoL.html

28-11-2020||World||Justin Trudeau’s office mistakenly sends out statement rebuking Oppn leader in a conversation before it actually happened||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called out Opposition leader Erin O’Toole and his Conservative Party for spreading “misinformation” about the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a readout issued by the PMO. But there was a problem with that statement - it was issued before the two leaders had their conversation. An embarrassed PMO later had to clarify that the draft had been mistakenly circulated. The actual account of the dialogue was far more amicable, as it read that they “discussed the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as vaccine distribution in Canada” other than the incoming Joe Biden administration in the US, and the fate of two Canadians being held by China.The original readout which “raised concerns around Covid-19 misinformation being promoted by Conservative members of parliament” was sent 45 minutes before the scheduled time of the call and the final conciliatory version issued late in the evening.That faux pas came even as Trudeau’s government is facing mounting criticism over its slow reaction to the pandemic, particularly with regard to timely procurement of a vaccine by Canada and the lack of manufacturing facilities within the country, leading to reliance on imports.That matter has become even more of a lightning rod since Canada recorded a single-day high of cases on Friday, at 5,963, taking the total to 358,774 with the death toll at 11,894.Trudeau has now assured Canadians that all those who want to be vaccinated will be able to get a shot by September next year, while public health officials asserted that doses will start flowing in by the first quarter of 2021.Those assurances came as the government also announced a military commander will lead the massive distribution effort. Major-General Dany Fortin, presently chief of staff to the Canadian joint operations command, has been given that task while a new unit, the national operations centre, has been established within the Public Health Agency of Canada. The centre will coordinate the vaccination effort and will be supported by Canada’s armed forces.“Canada is well prepared for large-scale rollouts of vaccines, but this will be the biggest immunisation in the history of the country. We must reach everyone who wants a vaccine, no matter where they live,” Trudeau said, according to CBC News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-s-office-mistakenly-sends-out-statement-rebuking-oppn-leader-in-a-conversation-before-it-actually-happened/story-m6H7SRox7MCDb3PNARvImK.html

We will continue to use all our sanctions tools to prevent Iran from advancing its missile capabilities,” Pompeo said.The companies are Chengdu Best New Materials Co Ltd and Zibo Elim Trade Co, Ltd. in China and Nilco Group, which is also known as Nil Fam Khazar Company and Santers Holding and Joint Stock Company Elecon in Russia for transferring sensitive technology and items to Iran’s missile programme.President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the landmark Iran nuclear deal in 2018. After withdrawing from the Iranian nuclear deal, Trump has asked all countries to reduce their purchase of oil from Iran to zero or face secondary sanctions.Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. Pompeo said all countries need to be vigilant to efforts by Iran to advance its missile programme.“These measures are part of our response to Iran’s malign activities. These determinations underscore the continuing need for all countries to remain vigilant to efforts by Iran to advance its missile programme,” Pompeo said.“We will continue to work to impede Iran’s missile development efforts and use our sanctions authorities to spotlight the foreign suppliers, such as these entities in the People’s Republic of China and Russia that provide missile-related materials and technology to Iran. The sanctions imposed include restrictions on US government procurement, US government assistance, and exports and will be in effect for two years,” he said.Pompeo said the imposition of sanctions against these foreign entities is consistent with the efforts of the US to use all available measures to prevent Iran from advancing its missile capabilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-sanctions-on-russian-chinese-companies-for-supporting-iran-missile-programme/story-0dR3rQuGdhcjg3TkUZoO0N.html
28-11-2020||World||Los Angeles virus restrictions to halt nearly all gatherings||Los Angeles county on Friday announced a temporary ban on gatherings of people from different households under a new “safer-at-home order” triggered by a spike in Covid-19 cases, with religious services and protests exempt.The order affecting the United States’ second-largest city will take effect Monday and last at least three weeks, until December 20, the county’s public health department said.“In the new Order that goes into effect on Monday, residents are advised to stay home as much as possible,” said a statement.“All public and private gatherings with individuals not in your household are prohibited, except for faith based services and protests, which are constitutionally protected rights,” it added.Densely populated Los Angeles county has suffered over 7,600 coronavirus deaths -- more than a third of California’s fatalities -- although Covid-19 is increasingly prevalent in the Golden State’s remote rural areas.California last week imposed a night-time curfew across much of the state, while Los Angeles county on Wednesday barred dining at restaurants but allowed delivery to continue.The order comes as Los Angeles county’s average new daily cases passed 4,500 for the week, triggering the tougher measures.The “safer-at-home” measures are not as severe as the city’s first lockdown in March, which saw almost all businesses close their physical premises.But the new order reduces occupancy limits at various businesses that can remain open, including shops, spa and libraries.All schools can remain open unless they record outbreaks.“These targeted measures are in effect for the next three weeks and still allow for many essential and non-essential activities where residents are always masked and distanced,” said public health director Barbara Ferrer.“We know we are asking a lot from so many who have been sacrificing for months on end and we hope that L.A. County residents continue following Public Health safety measures that we know can slow the spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/los-angeles-virus-restrictions-to-halt-nearly-all-gatherings/story-IxOtgmIwLkua0Ie1wBMPwM.html
28-11-2020||World||Iran accuses Israel, US in assassination of nuclear scientist||Iran accused Israel and the US of being behind the assassination of one of its top nuclear scientists on Friday and vowed revenge, sharply escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf in the final weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency.Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was the head of research and innovation at Iran’s Ministry of Defense and widely seen as having a major role in the country’s nuclear program. He was killed close to the Damavand campus of Islamic Azad University, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of central Tehran, the semi-official Tasnim news reported.“Terrorists murdered an eminent Iranian scientist today. This cowardice -- with serious indications of Israeli role -- shows desperate warmongering of perpetrators,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet, without offering any evidence for Israel’s involvement.Iran’s army said the US also bore responsibility, according to the Iranian Labor News Agency. The Minister of Defense, Amir Hatami, told state TV the killing was “clearly linked” to the US assassination of General Qassem Soleimani by drone in January.The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment, as did officials at the Pentagon. The Central Intelligence Agency didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether the US had knowledge of plans to carry out an assassination.Trump re-tweeted a New York Times report on Fakhrizadeh’s killing without comment, as well as a tweet by an Israeli journalist who called the killing “a major psychological and professional blow for Iran.” Also Read |  ‘Serious indications of Israeli role’ in killing of scientist, says Iran FMPhotos published by the semi-official Fars news agency, purportedly from the scene, showed blood splattered on the street next to an Iranian-made black passenger car with the window down on the driver’s side. The car’s windshield had been shattered by several bullet holes.Fakhrizadeh’s death following the killing of four other Iranian nuclear scientists since 2010, with Tehran usually blaming the intelligence agencies of its arch foes, Israel and the USWhile Israeli officials didn’t comment, the country has long viewed Iran’s nuclear research efforts as one of its biggest national security threats. Israel has vowed to take any measures necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear warheads, weapons Tehran says it has never sought to develop.‘Stuxnet’ AttackThe US and Israel are also widely believed to have worked together on a cyber attack which struck centrifuges linked to Tehran’s nuclear program about a decade ago.Netanyahu had singled out Fakhrizadeh in an April 2018 presentation he gave on Iran’s nuclear program, claiming that the scientist was the director of a secret project to develop nuclear weapons.The United Nations’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has said “Project Amad” was mothballed in 2003, and Iran dismissed Netanyahu’s presentations at the time as “lies and war-mongering.”The assassination of Fakhrizadeh comes at a sensitive time in Iran as Trump’s defeat in the Nov 3 US election offers an opportunity to reset ties with the West after years of economic and military confrontation.Call for RevengeHis death could trigger the sort of popular anger that followed the targeted killing of Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad ordered by Trump. Iran fired missiles at bases housing American troops in Iraq in response to that attack, causing no fatalities but raising fears of a slide to war between the two adversaries.Iranian forces also inadvertently shot down one of their own passenger airplanes in response to the Soleimani strike.Zarif urged the international community to condemn the latest attack, while the head of Iran’s armed forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, called for the assassination to be avenged.In a letter to the UN Security Council, Majid Takht Ravanchi, Iran’s ambassador to the UN, urged the organization to condemn the attack and warned the US and Israel to refrain from any “adventuristic measures,” especially during the American presidential transition.Axios reported this week that Israel’s government had instructed the military to prepare for a possible US strike against Iran during the remainder of Trump’s term, though it said the order wasn’t based on intelligence or an assessment that the US would order an attack.Fakhrizadeh was also named in a March 2007 UN Security Council Resolution as having been involved in Iran’s “nuclear or ballistic missile activities.”Friday’s killing comes close to the 10th anniversary of the assassination of another scientist, Majid Shahriari, who was killed in a car bombing on Nov 29, 2010.Car BombingA number of Fakhrizadeh’s security guards were wounded in the Friday attack, in which his car was shot at before a Nissan laden with explosives detonated about 15 to 20 meters away, Hatami told state TV.Also Read | Who is the Iranian scientist killed in Tehran?Hatami said Fakhrizadeh was involved in an air-defense project for detecting spy aircraft without using radar systems and that “Israel was well aware of his role in affairs that could confound” Israel. Iran’s expanding missile program is a key concern for both the US and Israel, but it’s the nuclear issue that has drawn the greatest scrutiny.Iran broke limits on the amount of low-enriched uranium it was allowed to store under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers after Trump exited the accord in 2018 and imposed sweeping economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic.Tehran’s store of low-enriched uranium increased to about 2,443 kilograms (5,386 pounds) from 2,105 kilograms, according to the latest report by the UN monitors. That’s enough to create three bombs if Iran chose to enrich the material to weapons grade.President-elect Joe Biden has said the US could re-enter the nuclear agreement if Iran returns to compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-accuses-israel-us-in-assassination-of-nuclear-scientist/story-vQxWyFjsV26Xvfo8MNjaVO.html

A faction of the party, led by former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ has become strident in its opposition to Oli. HT learns that Oli has told his supporters he is open to a split in the party – an eventuality China has been working to avert. China has been seen as playing the role of a peacemaker in the NCP in the past.The prime minister’s change in stance comes at a time when he is making a concerted effort to mend ties with New Delhi and get the two countries to start discussions on differences over Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh.Also read: No change in foreign secy’s Nepal visit, say officials amid buzz over PM Oli’s futureA Nepal watcher in India said the shift in PM Oli’s approach could be attributed to an attempt to reclaim the nationalist agenda that was the mainstay of his campaign that resulted in the NCP’s win in 2018. That China lately appeared indifferent to his continuation in the government if this helps avoid a split in the party is also believed to have contributed to Oli’s stand.Interestingly, Chinese defence minister General Wei Fenghe is visiting Nepal over the weekend and it is expected that some of the conversations that he has could be linked to the NCP’s affairs.“Gen Wei will spend four hours at army headquarters,” a diplomat in Kathmandu said on condition of anonymity, suggesting that the Chinese outreach to the army could also be linked to the political flux in the government.Also read: India could resume foreign secretary-level dialogue with Nepal. There is one conditionThrough November, Oli has faced unusually sharp attacks from Prachanda who had put out a 19-page document hugely critical of the prime minister. Oli is expected to put forth his counter-proposal at the meeting of the communist party’s Saturday meeting of the nine-member secretariat that comprises the NCP’s most senior leaders, although a discussion on this is likely only later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-pm-oli-stuns-china-tells-envoy-yanqi-to-steer-clear-of-party-politics/story-gleVtkFnSt897CtsLtlmiL.html
28-11-2020||World||French president ‘very shocked’ by alleged police beating of Black music producer: Report||French President Emmanuel Macron is “very shocked” by images purporting to show a Black music producer being beaten up and racially abused by Paris police, BFM TV reported, quoting comments given to it by the presidency.French authorities are investigating allegations that the music producer, who has given his identity as Michel, was assaulted and racially abused during a police check after CCTV footage of the incident was released.Also Read: Violence erupts in Brazil after Black man beaten to death at Carrefour storeThe beating inside the entrance of a building was captured on closed circuit television and mobile phone footage which circulated online and was headline news on French TV channels.The alleged attack on Michel risks inflaming racial tension with allegations of repeated police brutality against Black and ethnic communities at the forefront of many people’s minds after the death of Black American George Floyd in Minneapolis in May sparked the “BlackLivesMatter” movement.Paris police had already faced criticism this week after social media photos and videos showed officers hitting protesters as they cleared out an illegal migrants campsite in a central Paris square.The music producer told reporters he was jumped on by police at his studio in Paris’s 17th arrondissement on Nov. 21.He said he had been walking in the street without a face mask - against French Covid-19 health protocols - and, upon seeing a police car, went into his nearby studio to avoid getting a fine. However, he said, the police followed him inside and began to assault and racially abuse him.Also Read: Europe needs its own sovereignty in defence, even with new US govt: Emmanuel MacronInterior Minister Gerald Darmanin told France 2 television on Thursday that the officers would be sanctioned if the alleged wrongdoing was confirmed.The incident occurred amid controversy over a draft law that would limit journalists’ ability to show images of French police officers at work. In response to protests and complaints from free expression advocates, the prime minister’s office said on Thursday it would set up an independent commission tasked with proposing a new version of the legislation.Some “BlackLivesMatter” protests broke out in Paris in June, a month following the death of George Floyd after a white police officer knelt on his neck in the street for nearly nine minutes in the course of arresting him. The outrage generated by Floyd’s death has resonated in France, in particular in deprived city suburbs where police often clash with youths from ethnic minority backgrounds. The protests in Paris in June focused on unsolved cases of people dying during police operations, such as Adama Traore, who died in police detention near Paris in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-very-shocked-by-alleged-police-beating-of-black-music-producer-report/story-6YDWvvCSBIoKRZvBrOHSfL.html
28-11-2020||World||‘10 Covid-19 vaccines could be available by mid-2021’: Global pharma group||Ten Covid-19 vaccines could be available by the middle of next year if they win regulatory approval, but their inventors need patent protection, the head of the global pharmaceutical industry group said on Friday.Vaccines by Pfizer and BioNtech, as well as Moderna and AstraZeneca have shown promising results in large clinical trials, but there is no question of “cutting corners”, said Thomas Cueni, director-general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). Also Read: First Covid-19 case reported in Wuhan, doesn’t mean virus originated here: China“So far 3 we have 3 out of 3 were hits. I would expect that we will see something similar with Johnson & Johnson, I would expect that we would see similar positive results with Novavax, and many others, Sanofi Pasteur, GSK are in there, Merck,” he said.‘Big Pharma’ and biotech firms have invested heavily in research and development and in boosting manufacturing during the pandemic to be able to roll out vaccine doses, Cueni told a Geneva news briefing.It would be a mistake to lift patent protection to allow compulsory licensing and try to make vaccines requiring such complex quality assurance without expert staff and quality control procedures, he said.“We will hopefully by the next summer have probably 10 vaccines which have proven their value. But all of them really need to be submitted by rigorous scientific scrutiny by the regulators.”At the World Trade Organization (WTO), India and South Africa have proposed allowing a temporary waiver to allow compulsory licensing for patented products during the pandemic. The United States, European Union and Switzerland and others have rejected it, trade officials say.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayCueni, asked about the proposal, said: “For me this questioning of IP is really primarily politics, but it’s politics which is not helpful because it would send very negative signals in terms of disrespect to the system which allowed the world to react so fast and so responsibly.”Vaccine manufacturing plants often need 50 quality assurance staff making hundreds of checks during production, he said, emphasising that the companies would not exploit the pandemic.Cueni said that IFPMA archives showed there had never been a compulsory license granted for a vaccine and pointed to the difficult technology and know-how. Nearly every member company had committed to “not-for-profit” or socially responsible pricing during the pandemic, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-covid-19-vaccines-could-be-available-by-mid-2021-global-pharma-group/story-clFmEqi56iXDDYbIAjL4WJ.html

He noted the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany have mass vaccine-production facilities but Canada does not.Opposition parties criticized Trudeau for not ensuring Canadians get priority access to vaccines.Trudeau said Friday he expects vaccines to start arriving early next year — but what month Canadians will get the first doses remains an open question.“The race to get to the starting line first, I can understand, but this pandemic doesn’t get over until we reached the finish line,” Trudeau said.“What really matters is when we get to cross the finish line and the fact that the doctors highlighted that if all goes according to plan, we should be able to have a majority of Canadians vaccinated by next September, puts us in a very good stead.”Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief medical officer, said it would be by the end of next year but said Trudeau’s timeline “is in the same ballpark.”Top Canadian health officials said Thursday Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate could be approved in Canada next month and if all goes according to plan 3 million Canadians could get shots by the end of March. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is meeting Dec. 10 to consider whether to give the go-ahead to Pfizer.Canada has a purchase deal to buy at least 20 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine.Ontario Premier Doug Ford hopes to get the first doses in January.“I can’t emphasize enough with the prime minister that the clock is ticking,” Ford said.Toronto is on lockdown and the country’s largest province of Ontario reported a record 1,855 cases on Friday.“We’re in for some of the toughest days of this pandemic,” Trudeau saidTrudeau said Canada, which has a population of 37 million, has signed deals that could give Canada the most per capita vaccines in the world. And he said the Canadian military will play a role in distribution of the vaccine. An army general will oversee it.“This will be the biggest immunization in the history of the country,” Trudeau said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-pm-trudeau-expects-most-of-canada-to-be-vaccinated-by-september/story-2kamZSoD4zHZfQN6vYVAxN.html
28-11-2020||World||Court tells Donald Trump: ‘Calling vote unfair doesn’t make it so’||A federal appeals court on Friday flatly dismissed President Donald Trump’s claim that the election was unfair and refused to freeze Joe Biden’s win in the key state of Pennsylvania.In a scathing review of the Trump campaign’s arguments that the president was cheated in his November 3 reelection bid, three appeals court judges unanimously said that allegations of unfairness were not supported by evidence.“Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so,” the court said.In appealing a lower court ruling, the Trump campaign claimed discrimination, the judges noted.“But its alchemy cannot transmute lead into gold,” the court said.It was the latest in more than two dozen court defeats around the country for the Trump campaign and Republicans who have alleged fraud and other misconduct contributed to the president’s loss.Trump persists in arguing that Biden’s clear victory is invalid.“Just so you understand, this election was a fraud,” he told reporters on Thursday.Last week a Pennsylvania state court rejected arguments by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani that the millions of votes in the state should be thrown out due to fraud.The judge in that case, however, embarrassed Giuliani by forcing him to admit that none of his precise claims before the court involved fraud or anything more than technical issues in overseeing the vote count.On Tuesday the Pennsylvania government officially certified Biden’s victory in the state, and the Trump campaign appealed to federal court to have that certification frozen.But the appeals court said Trump’s campaign had nothing substantial to argue.“Its allegations are vague and conclusory,” the judges said.“It never alleges that anyone treated the Trump campaign or Trump votes worse than it treated the Biden campaign or Biden votes.”With Biden’s national lead in the popular vote and the electoral college now virtually unassailable, the court indicated that another appeal, to the US Supreme Court, would go nowhere.“The campaign has already litigated and lost most of these issues,” the court said.“The campaign cannot win this lawsuit. It conceded that it is not alleging election fraud.”Nevertheless, Jenna Ellis, a Trump campaign lawyer who worked with Giuliani on the case, tweeted their intent to appeal.“The activist judicial machinery in Pennsylvania continues to cover up the allegations of massive fraud ... On to SCOTUS!” she said, referring to the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/court-tells-donald-trump-calling-vote-unfair-doesn-t-make-it-so/story-Sw9a6uvTLrhgAbjw4ZOfVJ.html
28-11-2020||World||UK asks regulator to assess vaccine||The UK government has requested Britain’s medicines regulator to assess the suitability of Oxford and AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine for temporary supply, as soon as the makers submit the necessary safety, quality and efficacy data.The UK will be one of the first countries to receive the vaccine, if authorised, with AstraZeneca expecting to have up to 4mn doses ready by the end of the year and 40mn by the end of March 2021, the deparment of health and social care said in a release.The UK was the first country to sign an agreement with Oxford University and AstraZeneca, securing access to 100mn doses of the prospective vaccine. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency confirmed the government’s request and said public safety “will always come first”.Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock said, “We have formally asked the regulator to assess the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, to understand the data and determine whether it meets rigorous safety standards. This letter is an important step towards deploying a vaccine as quickly as safely possible.”The letter asks the MHRA to assess the vaccine for authorisation under Regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations, which enables the temporary supply.Meanwhile, the death toll from Covid-19 of patients categorised as ‘Indian’ in official figures in the UK crossed the grim milestone of 1,000 on Friday, making the community the worst-hit among non-whites.Germany hit an unwelcome milestone in the pandemic on Friday, ticking above a million confirmed cases. The country’s disease control officials said Germany’s 16 states reported 22,806 cases overnight for a total since the start of the outbreak of 1,006,394. Despite the high number of infections, Germany has seen fewer deaths than many other European countries, with 15,586 - compared with more than 50,000 in Britain, Italy and France, for example.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-asks-regulator-to-assess-vaccine/story-ryLwx4dqHKEsUduTmOMsGK.html
28-11-2020||World||Will he leave the building?||US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would concede if the electoral college picked President-elect Joe Biden, and would leave the White House. But he vowed to continue pursuing poll fraud allegations until then.“Certainly, I will, and you know that,” Trump said when asked by reporters if he will leave the White House, which has become a concern as he has refused to acknowledge the outcome despite losing to Biden by a wide margin of 306-232 in electoral college votes. “It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede,” the US president insisted.The electors are scheduled to meet in their respective states on December 8 to elect the president. And on the basis of the current projected count - pending complete certification of results by all states - Biden will win. Trump spoke to reporters in the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room after holding a teleconference with US military leaders stationed across the globe. He thanked them for their service and jokingly warned them not to eat too much turkey, then turned to the election after ending the call. He repeated grievances and angrily denounced officials in Georgia and Pennsylvania, two key swing states that helped give Biden the win. Trump claimed, despite the results, that this may not be his last Thanksgiving at the White House. And he insisted there had been “massive fraud”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-he-leave-the-building/story-1BYigSfyf3lQGpGdd2fnbM.html
28-11-2020||World||Thanksgiving testing crunch foreshadows strain in December||Americans flocked to coronavirus testing sites in the week leading up to Thanksgiving in search of a clean bill of health for travel, which drove up wait times and strained capacity.Nationally, Saturday saw a record with 1.98 million tests performed, according to Covid Tracking Project data. California set its own new mark Tuesday. New York state reported a record high of 217,721 tests this week; its statewide positive test rate was 3.18%, up from a seven-day average of 2.89%.Daily Covid-19 cases climbed throughout November, and communal gatherings over the holiday could expedite the spread, pushing cases to new heights and requiring thousands of added tests. The constraints also foreshadow another round of difficulties in December, when Americans will travel again for the holidays.Brett Giroir, the Department of Health and Human Services official who leads the administration’s Covid-19 diagnostic testing efforts, said he expects screening to return to earlier levels after Thanksgiving. “People are going to get a test just to see if they’re negative before going on travel,” he said in a briefing this week. “I do believe we’ll be back to a baseline area for those type of tests.”The U.S. reported an additional 125,082 virus cases Thursday, according to Covid Tracking Project data, though data can stream in slowly over holidays. There have been more than 263,000 deaths cumulatively, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thanksgiving-testing-crunch-foreshadows-strain-in-december/story-V4ZGnAoC4BBfS9wPQdxpWN.html
28-11-2020||World||New rule could allow gas, firing squads for US executions||The Justice Department is quietly amending its execution protocols, no longer requiring federal death sentences to be carried out by lethal injection and clearing the way to use other methods like firing squads and poison gas.The amended rule, published Friday in the Federal Register, allows the US government to conduct executions by lethal injection or use “any other manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the sentence was imposed.” A number of states allow other methods of execution, including electrocution, inhaling nitrogen gas or death by firing squad.It remains unclear whether the Justice Department will seek to use any methods other than lethal injection for executions in the future. The rule – which goes into effect on Dec. 24 – comes as the Justice Department has scheduled five executions during the lame-duck period, including three just days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.A Justice Department official said the change was made to account for the fact the Federal Death Penalty Act requires sentences be carried out in the “in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the sentence is imposed,’‘ and some of those states use methods other than lethal injection.The official said two executions scheduled in December would be done by lethal injection but didn’t provide information about three others scheduled in January. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the internal department protocols.The change is likely to set off intense criticism from Democrats and anti-death penalty advocates, as the Trump administration tries to push through a number of rule changes before Trump leaves office. A spokesperson for Biden told the AP earlier this month that the president-elect “opposes the death penalty now and in the future” and would work to end its use. But he did not say whether executions would be paused immediately once Biden takes office.Attorney General William Barr restarted federal executions this year after a 17-year hiatus. This year, the Justice Department has put to death more people than during the previous half-century, despite waning public support from both Democrats and Republicans for its use.All states that use the death penalty allow lethal injection – and that is the primary method in all states where other methods are allowed, according to data compiled by the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. As lethal injection drugs become difficult to obtain, some states have begun looking at alternative methods for carrying out death sentences. Alabama joined Oklahoma and Mississippi in 2018 approving the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners, allowing the state to asphyxiate condemned inmates with the gas in some cases.In some states, inmates can choose the method of their execution. In Florida, for example, an inmate can specifically ask to be put to death by electrocution and in Washington state, inmates can ask to be put to death by hanging. In Utah, prisoners sentenced before May 2004 can choose to be killed by a firing squad. The state law there also authorizes the use of a firing squad if lethal injection drugs aren’t available.In 2014, following a botched state execution in Oklahoma, President Barack Obama directed the Justice Department to conduct a broad review of capital punishment and issues surrounding lethal injection drugs.Barr said in July 2019 that the review had been completed, allowing executions to resume and approved a new procedure for lethal injections that replaced the three-drug combination previously used in federal executions with one drug, pentobarbital. The one-drug protocol is similar to the procedure used in several states, including Georgia, Missouri and Texas.Before the Trump administration resumed executions this year, the federal government had put only three inmates to death since 1988. Though there hadn’t been a federal execution since 2003, until July, the Justice Department has continued to approve death penalty prosecutions, and federal courts had continued sentencing defendants to death.Trump has spoken often about capital punishment and his belief that executions serve as an effective deterrent and an appropriate punishment for some crimes, including mass shootings and the killings of police officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-rule-could-allow-gas-firing-squads-for-us-executions/story-p6rVhWf45BQp0Bzn5EUdJN.html
28-11-2020||World||US announces reward of up to USD 5 million for information about 26/11 mastermind||Twelve years after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the United States has announced a reward of up to USD 5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba member Sajid Mir for his “role” in the attacks in Mumbai in 2008.According to an official statement issued by the US Rewards for Justice program, “Sajid Mir, a senior member of the Pakistan-based foreign terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), is wanted for his involvement in the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India. The Rewards for Justice program is offering a reward of up to USD 5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction in any country of Sajid Mir for his role in these attacks.”On November 26, 2008, 10 terrorists, trained by the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation LeT, carried out a series of coordinated attacks against multiple targets in Mumbai -- the Taj Mahal Hotel, the Oberoi Hotel, the Leopold Cafe, the Nariman (Chabad) House, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus -- killing 166 people.In these gruesome attacks, nine terrorists were killed and the lone survivor, Ajmal Amir Kasab, was caught and sentenced to death. On November 11, 2012, Kasab was hanged at Yerwada Central Jail in Pune.“Sajid Mir was LeT’s operations manager for the Mumbai attack, playing a leading role in its planning, preparation, and execution. Mir was indicted in the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (Chicago, Illinois) on April 21, 2011, and was charged with conspiracy to injure the property of a foreign government; providing material support to terrorists; aiding and abetting the killing of a citizen outside of the US; and the bombing of places of public use. According to the indictment, during the attacks, Mir advised the attackers to kill hostages, set fires, and throw grenades and also sought the release of a hostage in exchange for the release of a captured attacker. A warrant for Mir’s arrest was issued on April 22, 2011. In 2019, Mir was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists List,” the department said.It added that on August 30, 2012, the Department of the Treasury designated Mir for holding leadership positions within the LeT. “According to the US Department of Treasury, as of 2005, Mir directed training for operatives preparing for overseas recruiting, money laundering, and operational planning. The LeT was designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US Department of State in December 2001,” the department added.However, Pakistani authorities continue to deny culpability and are yet to take action on the multiple dossiers shared by India. A trial underway in a Pakistani anti-terrorism court against seven suspects has made little headway in more than a decade, as Pakistani officials serially question the sufficiency and legitimacy of evidence against them.Pakistan has been placed on the FATF’s grey list of the country with inadequate controls over terror financing in 2018, saying Pakistan “still needs to demonstrate that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terrorism financing activity.”Pakistan has long been criticised for cultivating terror proxy groups and the country currently faces renewed pressure to act against terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-reward-of-up-to-usd-5-million-for-information-about-26-11-mastermind/story-DFUsJ4LK7pFIfdJVRZnLxK.html
