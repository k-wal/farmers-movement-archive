07-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: ‘Time to unite America’||As news channels called the United States presidential election in favour of 78-year-old Joe Biden, after he took the lead in his birth state of Pennsylvania, the president-elect tweeted: “America, I’m honored that you have chosen me to lead our great country. The work ahead of us will be hard, but I promise you this: I will be a President for all Americans—whether you voted for me or not. I will keep the faith that you have placed in me.”The President-elect is expected to address the nation from his campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware on Saturday evening. The longest-serving senator of Delaware, former vice president of the United States in the Obama administration, and three-time President hopeful has been elected as the 46th President of the United States of America. His running mate, California Senator Kamala Harris, will make history as the first woman, the first Black American and the first American of Asian descent (Harris’ mother hails from Tamil Nadu, her father from Jamaica), to serve as vice president. News channels and election trackers did not make a definitive call on the results even on Saturday morning, stating that Biden was “on the verge of presidency” with Biden projected to receive between 253 to 264 electoral college votes (different news channels have varying views on Arizona’s 11 votes) at the time of going to print. However, as Biden took a lead in Pennsylvania, which has 20 electoral votes, his tally crossed the mid-way mark of 270.Shortly after his election was made certain, Biden released a statement along the lines of what he has been saying in the past week that has seen President Donald Trump make unsubstantiated claims against postal ballots and Biden’ s lead. “I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris. In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America. With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation. It’s time for America to unite. And to heal. We are the United States of America. And there’s nothing we can’t do, if we do it together,” Biden said.On Thursday, Biden and Harris met a group of experts on the public health and economic crises the country is facing.Biden has promised to use his transition period to meet with the governors of every state and ask them to impose a nationwide mask-wearing mandate. Another key decision will be how Biden decides to deploy his running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris. His campaign has indicated that Biden will establish a White House-level coronavirus task force like Trump did, but it’s not clear if he will tap Harris to run it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-time-to-unite-america/story-qFXYWLknxcW6CmoXFpuAPN.html

Acknowledging that people would find it particularly difficult this year with all the lockdown restrictions, Johnson praised the Indian diaspora in the UK for all their sacrifices and efforts at working towards a safe and secure Diwali. He praised the “fantastic virtual Diwali festival” for bringing the spirit of Diwali into people’s homes while helping people stay safe.“I know that celebrating at a distance isn’t easy when you want to get together with all your family or visit your friends or share with them the Diwali fun, as well of course the odd samosa or gulab jamun,” said Johnson, in his inaugural address to the ‘iGlobal Diwali Fest 2020’. “So I want you to know that your sacrifices, and your determination to do the right thing really are helping to save lives, and tough though I know many aspects of this year have been, I have been blown away by the inspirational way in which Hindus, Sikhs and Jains have responded to this crisis with compassion, community spirit and a can-do attitude,” he said. The three-day virtual Diwali Fest kick-started on Friday with the UK PM’s message and will include sessions with UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, Opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer and Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey. The agenda also includes yoga, music and dance performances as well as an awards ceremony to honour British Indian community champions across different fields. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and West Midlands Mayor Andy Street will be among those delivering Diwali messages from different parts of England.Also Read | Liverpool begins UK’s first city-wide coronavirus testing“The Prime Minister, leaders of the main UK political parties and the Mayors of the country’s major metros lining up for Diwali in this way is quite unprecedented and reflects not only the real depth of UK-India ties but also the pivotal role of the UK’s 1.5-million strong Indian diaspora,” said Manoj Ladwa, CEO of the India Inc Group, the UK-based organiser of the event. Among some of the other virtual events scheduled over the weekend include a spiritual session with Art of Living Founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, bhajans from different parts of India and a Bollywood concert headlined by British Indian musician Navin Kundra. Diwali -- the festival of lights -- will be celebrated in India on November 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-will-overcome-covid-19-uk-pm-hails-victory-of-good-over-evil-diwali-spirit/story-aDLhPJ2PiVff1HSlPiEN7L.html
07-11-2020||World||Joe Biden beats Trump in race to the White House after winning tipping-point Pennsylvania||Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, has been elected the 46th president of the United States of America. And Kamala Harris will be the country’s first black and Indian-descent vice-president.Biden, 78, was projected winner of the 2020 White House race by multiple US media organizations at the same time on Saturday, the fifth day of counting, after he took a lead post winning Pennsylvania, the tipping-point state whose 20 Electoral College votes carried the Democrat well past the 270-vote threshold from 264, where he had been for the past two days, to 284. President Donald Trump, whose tally stood at 214 but may change, will be the first one-term president in 30 years. He was on his golf course when Biden was declared winner.“I am honoured and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris. In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America,” President-elect Biden said in a statement, adding, “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation. It’s time for America to unite. And to heal. We are the United States of America. And there’s nothing we can’t do, if we do it together.”But President Trump indicated it was not over. In a statement issued just before Biden’s statement, he said, “We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be exposed. The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process. Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media.”“Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election. It remains shocking that the Biden campaign refuses to agree with this basic principle and wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters. Only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room – and then fight in court to block their access.” “So what is Biden hiding? I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands.”The President has put together a legal team to shepherd the challenges hoping, perhaps, for a repeat of the 2000 recount which gave George W Bush his first term as president. He beat Democrat Al Gore, then the vice-president, in a recount of votes in Florida.The Trump campaign has called for donations to fund the legal fight. “This Election Isn’t Over,” it has said in texts and mail to supporters. “The President needs YOUR HELP! We can’t allow the Left-wing MOB to undermine our Election. President Trump needs his fiercest and most loyal defenders, like YOU, to step up and FIGHT BACK!”But the President’s aides and allies in the Republican party are also reportedly trying to prepare him for conceding, while arguing for his right to seek a recount of votes and sue to correct irregularities. “Mr. Trump’s legacy will be diminished greatly if his final act is a bitter refusal to accept a legitimate defeat,” The Wall Street Journal, a conservative media giant wrote in an editorial on Saturday. “Republican officials will turn away, and eventually so will the American public that wants to see the election resolved.”Biden, who was at home in Wilmington when news broke of his victory , is expected to make a victory speech later in the day. It was not known if President Trump planned to call him, as has been the practice, but he has demanded recounts in two states and has filed several lawsuits challenging the counting process and has alleged fraud and irregularities.Biden has indicated he is ready to move on and said in a speech on Friday that he had gone to work already getting updates and briefings on the Covid-19 epidemic. Biden had continued to increase his lead over Trump in Pennsylvania, when counting resumed on Saturday morning. He was also building on his lead in Georgia (16 electoral college votes), which is headed for a recount as requested by Trump, and in Nevada (6). He is also ahead in Arizona, whose 11 electoral college votes have already been given to him by some news organization, but the President has been chipping away at his lead. Trump leads in North Carolina (15) and Alaska (3).“My fellow Americans, we don’t have a final declaration of victory yet, but the numbers tell a clear and convincing story: We are going to win this race,” the former vice-president had said in a speech from his hometown Wilmington, Delaware, late on Friday, with Kamala Harris, his vice-presidential nominee by his side.“But while we’re waiting for the final results, I want people to know we are not waiting to get to work,” he added.Biden, who ran on the promise of tackling the Covid-19 epidemic as his top priority, said he and Harris on Thursday met a group of experts on the public health crisis and its impact on the economy. The deadly virus has killed more than 236,000 and infected nearly 9.8 million in the United States, shut down millions of businesses and left millions more jobless. The Democratic nominee went on to reiterate his promise to begin tackling the public health crisis from Day One in office.Biden acknowledged, however, “Tensions can be high after a tough election like we just had” referring to the acrimony surrounding the counting of votes, as the Trump campaign has launched an aggressive effort to stop counting in states where the President is trailing and allowing it to continue where he is increasing his numbers, such as in Arizona.He said: “But we need to remain calm. Patient. And let the process work out as we count all the votes. We are proving again what we have proved for 244 years in this country. Democracy works. Your vote will be counted. I don’t care how hard people try to stop it. I will not let it happen.”The former vice-president, who ran also on the promise of unifying the country, sought to dial down tensions. “Strong disagreements are inevitable in a democracy, and strong disagreements are healthy. They’re a sign of vigorous debate, of deeply held views. But we have to remember: The purpose of our politics isn’t total, unrelenting, unending warfare.”He added: “We may be opponents — but we are not enemies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-nominee-joe-biden-beats-trump-in-race-to-the-white-house/story-GjJ8Jse9n6FZJQQwWfc2TL.html

It didn’t specify when the amended laws will take effect.The legal overhaul means that consuming alcohol, living together before marriage and attempting suicide will no longer be considered crimes, The National newspaper reported, without saying where it got the information.While punishments for such actions haven’t been commonly applied, some criminal cases involving drunkenness or sex out of wedlock had risen to prominence over the years, marring the Persian Gulf country’s reputation as a magnet for skilled foreign workers. Like other Gulf Arab nations, the oil-dependent UAE relies on expatriates to operate much of the economy.The amendments mean that foreign couples who separate could apply the divorce laws of the country where they married, rather than those of the UAE, The National reported. The paper, based in the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi, said the legal changes are effective immediately.WAM said that foreigners in the Islamic country will also be able to choose the inheritance laws that apply to them.In addition to decriminalizing unspecified “actions that don’t harm others,” the government cancelled a mitigating excuse applied to “honor crimes,” WAM reported. Such crimes are commonly understood to include the assault or murder of relatives, usually female, for “dishonoring” their family. Regular criminal penalties would apply in such cases, WAM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-legal-overhaul-could-decriminalize-alcohol-cohabitation/story-WbEzVtSLvts6t4d36mbpCO.html

Prime Minister Khan also denies that the Army helped him win the election in 2018.Also Read | Pak soldiers did not even have weapons during Kargil war, claims Nawaz SharifKhan said that Sharif had run away from the country under the pretext of illness, adding that he was a “money worshipper” and had amassed his wealth by looting the country, the Dawn newspaper reported.The PML-N chief, currently out on bail, is facing multiple corruption charges. The Islamabad High Court had allowed him to go to London for medical treatment in November last year for a period of eight weeks for medical treatment. But he did not come back, while his lawyers told the court that he was still recovering.Khan also slammed Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz for openly accusing the Army of interfering in politics.She is taking advantage of being a woman because women are given respect in Pakistan, he said.“Nawaz Sharif and his sons cannot dare attack the Pakistan Army in the country and this is why they have fled abroad. Since Maryam Nawaz knows that we will not send her behind bars because she is a woman, she has started spewing venom against the Army,” he said.Khan said Pakistanis would never allow corrupt politicians to hurl allegations against the Army.Rebuking the “corrupt political leaders who have gathered under the Pakistan Democratic Movement”, Khan said a group of thieves and looters have gathered who were asking for special concessions after looting the country.“Two major political parties looted the country during the past 30 years but now it is a decisive time to take action against the corrupt and looters,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nawaz-sharif-a-jackal-trying-to-create-rebellion-in-army-says-pak-pm-khan/story-W7iu3ZihEA8vdDu7muAbKK.html

In an opinion piece in Asialyst, a French online newspaper specialising in news from Asia, Guillard said Islamist anger against France has hit predominantly Muslim Asian countries, in particular, Pakistan and Bangladesh.“Openly threatening against the French president, the demonstrators preach the boycott of French products and call on the local authorities to condemn their counterparts in Paris without further ado. Some leaders like Prime Minister Imran Khan are riding the wave, not without demagoguery,” he writes. Macron has been facing criticism from various Muslim-majority countries after he took a tough stand on radical Islam and defended cartoons of Prophet Muhammad. The French president said Islam was a religion in crisis.Macron pledged to fight “Islamist separatism”, which he said was threatening to take control in some Muslim communities around France. The main opposition comes from Pakistan and other Muslim countries where people hit the streets. On October 30, Islamabad had seen a procession of several thousand radical activists converging on the French embassy.In Lahore, two cities in Pakistan, 10,000 supporters of the radical Islamic party Tehreek-e-Labbaik took to the streets chanting slogans and carrying banners with once again unambiguous content. In Multan, a portrait of the French president was burned in the public square by a fevered Zealot crowd.At each of these demonstrations of anger against France, the local security forces were deployed in large numbers to prevent material destruction and assaults on diplomatic or consular buildings, and ensure the safety of personnel.Macron’s remarks did not go well with Pakistan Prime Minister Khan who slammed the French President, saying that he has “chosen to deliberately provoke Muslims”.Also Read | Thousands stage anti-France protests in Bangladesh, PakistanTaking to Twitter, Khan said, “Hallmark of a leader is he unites human beings, as Mandela did, rather than dividing them. This is a time when President Macron could have put healing touch and denied space to extremists rather than creating further polarisation and marginalisation that inevitably leads to radicalisation.”“By attacking Islam, clearly without having any understanding of it, President Macron has attacked and hurt the sentiments of millions of Muslims in Europe and across the world.”The Pakistan leader had in a bizarre letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought a ban on Islamophobic content similar to the prohibition put for the Holocaust on the social networking site.In the letter that he shared on Twitter, Khan said “growing Islamophobia” is encouraging extremism and violence “across the world” - especially through social media platforms such as Facebook.Pakistan also summoned the French ambassador for lodging a “strong protest” against the publication of “blasphemous” sketches and recent comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron, Dawn reported.In a statement, Pakistan Foreign Office Spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry said ambassador Marc Barety was handed over a dossier by the special secretary (Europe), Dawn had reported.The ambassador was told about Pakistan’s condemnation of the publication of blasphemous sketches and the comments later made by Macron, the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, the Pakistan National Assembly unanimously had passed a resolution condemning the publication of blasphemous caricatures in France and the “resurgence of Islamophobic acts” in some countries after a noisy session that witnessed the government and opposition delivering fiery speeches against each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-involves-in-demagoguery-over-macron-s-remark/story-seMZ3mXz3XvkbnETV4HCdL.html

No one has immediately claimed responsibility.Violence and chaos have increased in Afghanistan in recent months with an attack last week on Kabul University that killed 22 people, many of them students. The Islamic State affiliate claimed that attack as well as another assault on an educational institution on October 24, also in the capital, that killed 24 people.The surge in violent attacks comes even as government negotiators and the Taliban are meeting in Qatar to find an end to decades of relentless war in Afghanistan. The two sides have made little progress.The talks were part of a negotiated agreement between the United States and the Taliban to allow US and NATO troops withdraw from Afghanistan, ending 19 years of military engagement.According to initial reports, Siawash was near his home when the bomb attached to his car exploded. An eyewitness, Mohammad Rafi, said Siawash’s father and brother were the first to reach the vehicle that was engulfed in flames.Rafi said all three of those killed were inside the car.Siawash was a former TV presenter who anchored political programmes on TOLO TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-afghan-tv-presenter-killed-in-explosion-in-kabul/story-4e99ixjvmfhtctSPkAnFcJ.html
07-11-2020||World||UK court rejects petition for separate Sikh tick box in Census 2021||The high court of England and Wales on Friday rejected a judicial review claim brought by campaigners seeking quashing the legislation for the 2021 census because it did not include a separate tick box for Sikh ethnicity, stating that there was no error in law.The long-running campaign backed by several MPs was based on claims of alleged significant undercounting of the Sikh population in official statistics without a separate tick box. Census ethnicity figures are used for a range of purposes, including allocation of funds.Campaign group Sikh Federation (UK), which brought the claim, said it would continue to fight for separate recognition for the community. It had argued that the decision to exclude the tick box was based on legally unsustainable reasoning and therefore unlawful.A spokesperson for the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which is preparing for the 2021 census, said: “The census questionnaire has been designed to allow everyone to identify as they wish”.“As in 2011, there will be a Sikh religion tick box and everyone who wishes to identify as Sikh in response to the ethnicity question will be able to do so using search-as-you-type online and through a write-in option on paper”.“We are working across the country, with local groups and organisations, to raise awareness of the census and promote the different response options available.”According to ONS recommendations based on research and consultation, the religion question in the census will have a specific Sikh tick-box option, and those who wish to identify as Sikh in response to the ethnicity question will be able to do so using search-as-you-type online and a write-in option on paper.Justice Akhlaq Choudhury said: “It is important for the reader to note that this judgment is not concerned with whether or not there should be a Sikh tick-box in the census form or with the respective merits of the arguments for and against such a tick-box”.“Such matters are not for the Court to determine. This judgment is concerned solely with the question whether, as alleged by the Claimant, the Cabinet Office, which has responsibility for laying the necessary legislation for the 2021 Census, has acted unlawfully in the process leading to the making of the Census Order. This is solely a question of law”.The court ruled that it could not be successfully argued that ONS had failed to apply a stated policy to its assessment of whether to include an ethnic tick-box for the Sikh religion, adding that there was no unlawful failure to apply a published policy or unlawful application of an unpublished policy.Rosa Curling, of legal firm Leigh Day that represented the claimants, said: “Our clients are obviously disappointed the court did not agree with their concerns about the decision-making process leading to the exclusion of a Sikh ethnic tick-box in the next census”.“Our clients will continue their campaign through political channels and fight to rectify any disadvantages that might arise from a lack of data collected about their community.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-court-rejects-petition-for-separate-sikh-tick-box-in-census-2021/story-aNrZD8EGbaR2vzOY2dCAVL.html
07-11-2020||World||China opposes US’ move to remove ETIM from terrorist outfit list||China accused the United States of applying ‘double standards’ following the state department’s move to remove the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) from its list of terrorist organisations.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin expressed Beijing’s “strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition” to the move during a regular press briefing on Friday, reported Liu Zhen for South China Morning Post.“ETIM is an internationally recognised terrorist organisation that seriously threatens the safety of China and the world....The US backtracking on its designation shows double standards - they are using the terrorist organisation to promote their own interests and holding back international cooperation on counterterrorism,” said Wang.A Chinese analyst said that the move could encourage attacks against China.Li Wei, a counterterrorism expert from China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, a government-backed think tank in Beijing, termed the move ‘irresponsible’.“Against the current backdrop of increasing terrorist attacks in Europe, the US is applying double standards here....Not only is this decision irresponsible for international counterterrorism efforts, but it’s also irresponsible in terms of its own national security,” SCMP quoted Li.The counterterrorism expert also speculated that the US move would send a message to ETIM and encourage its activities against China.Beijing has accused ETIM of carrying out a number of deadly terror attacks across China and in other countries and claimed that it has ties with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.Liu writes that the group has been on the United Nations Security Council’s list of terrorist organisations since 2002, and it has been blacklisted by the European Union, Britain, and Turkey among others.Earlier, the US government had removed the ETIM from its list of terrorist organisations after nearly two decades that has led to the weakening of China’s anti-terror pretext for a draconian crackdown on Uyghurs in its Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the group had been removed from the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to an order issued on October 20 made public on Thursday.“I hereby revoke the designation of the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement, also known as ETIM, as a ‘terrorist organization,’“ the order reads, as quoted by Radio Free Asia.The US move comes amid worldwide condemnation of China’s policies in Xinjiang, where a large population of Muslim minorities is detained in re-education camps.About seven per cent of the Muslim population in Xinjiang has been incarcerated in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to US officials and UN experts.However, China regularly denies such mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training. People in the internment camps have said they are subjected to forced political indoctrination, torture, beatings, and denial of food and medicine, besides being prohibited from practising their religion or speaking their language.

They have to sign documents if they have to go out to work, buy essential products or for a health emergency.Earlier on Friday, French Health Minister Olivier Veran said it was premature to evaluate the effects of the second nationwide-lockdown as epidemic indicators show deteriorating sanitary situation.“It is too early to say whether the containment put in place is effective. It takes time between the moment when people reduce their contacts and the time when the virus circulates less rapidly,” Veran said.“We will have the answer within a few days...If things do not get better, it may be necessary to take additional measures,” he added.As the world is struggling to contain the pandemic, countries including France, China, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States are racing to find a vaccine.According to the website of the World Health Organization, as of Nov. 3, there were 202 Covid-19 candidate vaccines being developed worldwide, and 47 of them were in clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-s-covid-19-daily-infections-top-60-000-an-all-time-high/story-kEI4WrOBEPffppjnqTlqOL.html

07-11-2020||World||Kamala Harris on the verge of many, many firsts||Kamala Harris stands to write several chapters of history when she is formally declared US Vice-President-elect, a prospect that looks inevitable as the race for White House nears closure.Born of a mother from India and a father from Jamaica, Harris will become the first woman, first Indian American, first Black, first South Asian American and the first Asian ever elected as vice-president if Joe Biden wins the US presidential elections.Harris, who had accepted Biden’s announcement of her selection with a shout-out to her “Chithis” (Tamil for aunts) connected with several constituencies at the same time: African Americans, Asian Americans, South Asian Americans and, of course, the 4.5 million Indian Americans, 1.9 mn of whom are eligible to vote.Perhaps alarmed by her wide appeal, President Donald Trump, who had one said she would be a “fine choice” as a running mate for Biden began to target her right away. He called her “nasty” and a “monster”. He frequently mispronounced her first name as a tactic usually employed to make Americans of different ethnicities feel unwelcome — he had done the same with President Barak Obama by insisting on adding his middle name whenever he referred to him — and led his supporters to boo at her at his rallies.Trump ally and Republican Senator David Perdue took the President’s lead and mocked her name at a rally in Georgia. The Biden campaign turned that into a mobilisation opportunity with people jumping in to explain the meaning of their names, and offering suggestions on how to pronounce them right.The Indian American community was electrified by her selection. “Harris has mobilised Indian Americans, especially Democrats,” said a survey report by Carnegie. “Harris’ vice-presidential candidacy has galvanised a large section of the Indian American community to turn out to vote. On balance, while the Harris pick might not change a large numbers of votes (given the community’s historic Democratic tilt), her candidacy is linked to greater enthusiasm for the Democratic ticket.”Harris spoke of mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the United States from Chennai and was a breast cancer researcher, frequently while campaigning. “How I wish she were here tonight but I know she’s looking down on me from above,” Harris said the Democratic party convention while accepting her nomination as the vice-presidential nominee.“I keep thinking about that 25-year-old Indian woman—all of five feet tall—who gave birth to me at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California... On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for Vice President of the United States of America,” Harris said.Harris started her career in public office as a public attorney in Oakland, California.She was elected to the US senate in 2016 from the state of California and is now on track to be vice-president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-kamala-harris-on-the-verge-of-many-many-firsts/story-O7PwGrfaD7wwFP7TM4w1cL.html

07-11-2020||World||President’s last stand: Donald Trump not yet done, repeats ‘fraud’ claims||The walls are closing in, but don’t expect President Donald J Trump to go gently into the night.At around 9:30pm on Thursday, the US president stood before reporters at the White House briefing room, and began to speak in his usual combative style. “I’d like to provide the American people an update on our efforts to protect the integrity of our very important 2020 election. If you count the legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal votes, they can try to steal the elections from us. I’ve already decisively won many critical states including massive victories in Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio despite historic interference of Big Media, Big Money, Big Tech…” As he spoke, Trump’s lead in two key states — Pennsylvania and Georgia — was down to 73,633 and 9,426 from 164,414 and 23,009 respectively. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden had already eclipsed him in Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial “Blue Wall” battlegrounds on Thursday, and eventually overtook the President in Georgia early Friday. By Friday evening India time, Biden flipped the state of Pennsylvania, gaining a lead of 9,027 votes at the time of going to print, and looking on the road to becoming the 46th US president. Trump left the podium without taking questions, and held no other public events on Thursday. He also did not make any reference to the record surge of positive Covid-19 cases in the country His speech was fact-checked or cut midway by some TV networks on the grounds that they did not want to spread misinformation. Shepard Smith of CNBC, for example, interrupted the broadcast when Trump referred to the “tens of millions of unsolicited ballots (mailed out by election officers) without any verification measures” and stated, “we’re interrupting this because what the President of the United States is saying, in large part, is absolutely untrue.” Trump has been trying to create a distinction between votes polled on Election Day and the postal ballots that were mailed to voting centres — a legitimate form of the voting process used in unprecedented numbers this year on account of the coronavirus pandemic — and on Twitter soon after polling closed, called the votes “illegal”. His team launched a campaign asking voters to “help stop voter suppression, irregularities and fraud”, accusing the Democrats of trying to “steal” the elections,though the process has run smoothly across the country with no evidence of fraud.Trump’s legal team filed a flurry of complaints over vote monitoring in Pennsylvania and ineligible voting in Nevada. A case in Georgia related to 53 ballots was tossed out. His team won a court order requiring Pennsylvania to segregate mail-in ballots from voters who were asked to provide missing proof of identification during an extended period for allowing such fixes, as well as an order to allow observers to get closer to watch the counting of mail-in ballots in Philadelphia. The lawsuits filed on Wednesday in Georgia and Michigan were both dismissed.Trump’s campaign also said it planned to sue in Nevada, alleging some people voted despite not meeting residency requirements. It held a combative press conference in Las Vegas where Trump allies, Richard Grenell and Matt Schlapp, clashed with media, declined to identify themselves and didn’t take questions after claiming without proof the poll was fraudulent. Donald Trump Jr tweeted that his father’s best option was “to go to total war over this election to expose all of the fraud.” He demanded Republicans who would be on the ballot in 2024 to rally around the president. “Don’t worry @realDonaldTrump will fight & they can watch as usual!” he tweeted.With inputs from Agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-s-last-stand-donald-trump-not-yet-done-repeats-fraud-claims/story-2dTu9R2t2Hxn9PlLAPyAgM.html

We don’t have any evidence at the moment that it would,” Swaminathan told a virtual press briefing.The coronavirus mutations in minks need to be studied properly before experts can say if there can be any complications and what kind, Maria Van Kerkhove, Covid-19 Technical Lead at WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said.“What we understand is the minks have been infected with contact from humans, it circulates in the mink and then it could pass back to humans. So there’s always a concern when you have circulation and transmission from humans to animals and then from animals to humans. So there is a number of activities that are ongoing to understand the situation in Denmark,” Van Kerkhove said.According to the expert, mutations are normal and experts have been monitoring all changes in the virus since the beginning.“In this situation, there is a suggestion that some of these mutations may have some implications, but we need to do the proper studies to evaluate this. and that is ongoing right now with colleagues at the SSI in Denmark as well as our international working group,” Van Kerkhove said.What the study needs is more sequences to examine, the expert said.“As this virus continues to circulate the globe, as we see it in mink, in different populations, those sequences need to be shared because they need to be evaluated, they need to be studied, they need to be discussed,” Van Kerkhove said.There is no evidence yet that this particular mutation behaves differently from others, Michael J. Ryan, the executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, said.“It may have a slightly different signature, but it is still the same virus. What we have to evaluate over time is whether this virus has any difference in transmission or clinical severity or whether there are any implications for diagnostics or vaccines. But we’re a long, long way away from making any determination of that kind,” Ryan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/too-early-to-judge-if-covid-19-mutation-in-minks-can-impact-vaccine-who-chief-scientist/story-wstMLvUvGkgRAFADRTjqAL.html

Cases of the coronavirus disease have also been identified at mink farms in other countries, including the Netherlands and Spain, since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mutated-variant-of-coronavirus-linked-to-minks-found-in-214-people-in-denmark/story-Eaa6qCOSoaNMl9embnzmPP.html
07-11-2020||World||Liverpool begins UK’s first city-wide coronavirus testing||Liverpool on Friday began England’s first city-wide trial of coronavirus testing in an attempt to prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed during the country’s second wave of the pandemic.All of the northwestern city’s 500,000 residents as well as people working there will be offered repeat tests, even if asymptomatic, under the pilot, which will initially run for two weeks.Hundreds of soldiers took over a local holiday park, some of the 2,000 armed forces personnel called in to support the testing drive.Jurgen Klopp, manager of Liverpool football club, urged people to get tested.“Do it for yourself, your family, your colleagues and your city. Let’s do it together, let’s do it for Liverpool,” he said in a video message posted on the club’s Twitter account. Liverpool last month became the first English city to enter the most severe tier of regional lockdown as it battled a spike in cases, followed by nearby Manchester.A month-long nationwide lockdown then came into force on Thursday after cases began to spiral in all parts of England.Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson, whose brother died of Covid-19 last month, said the pilot could save lives and “get the city out of tier three restrictions”.Britain is already grappling with the worst toll in Europe with over 48,000 dead after testing positive for the disease.Matthew Ashton, Liverpool’s director of public health, told the BBC the pilot could last longer than two weeks, saying they “want to make sure it is long enough for us to be able to see the impact”.“The point of this is to get the city tested,” he said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday the kind of cheap new tests being used in Liverpool “can be a massive and possibly decisive use to us in this country in defeating the virus”.The tests involve swabs and new “lateral flow” tests, akin to pregnancy tests, which can provide a result within 20 minutes. New testing sites have been set up across the city, in schools, universities, offices and care homes. The government has already spent £12 billion ($16 billion) on testing programmes across Britain. But researchers say most members of the public have been failing to isolate after testing positive, and support staff have struggled to reach all of their contacts to limit the spread of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/liverpool-begins-uk-s-first-city-wide-coronavirus-testing/story-Kv4eWSkkDjHYYEIbMLTg4M.html

07-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Mr. President-elect?||Joe Biden, the scrappy kid from Scranton who overcame a stutter, was on the verge on Friday of winning the White House after overtaking President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, and the “tipping-point” state where he trailed by 700,000 votes at one stage. He led also in all but one of the remaining states that had not been called yet.Pennsylvania’s 20 Electoral College votes alone will suffice, however. Biden has been at 264 votes, according to the Associated Press tracker (other news outlets have him at 253 with Arizona still up for grabs according to them), to President Trump’s 214. That tally has remained unchanged for more than a day now. But as time passed and leads changed, he was fast emerging as the clear winner.The former vice-president was expanding his lead over the President in Pennsylvania, was narrowly ahead in Georgia (16 electoral college votes), a Republican stronghold that had last voted Democratic in 1992, and in Nevada (6). President Trump was ahead in North Carolina (15), but that alone was not sufficient to get him anywhere near a credible path to victory.There was been no word from Biden or his campaign on the outcome till the time of going to print on Friday. But a sense of anticipation was setting in. His Secret Service security was being beefed up, according to reports, and a “no-fly zone” order by the US Federal Aviation Administration went into effect for over his home in Wilmington, Delaware.But the Trump campaign reacted by, not surprisingly, rejecting increasing signs of the inevitability of Biden’s victory. “This election is not over. The false projection of Joe Biden as the winner is based on results in four states that are far from final,” Matt Morgan, Trump campaign’s general counsel, said in a statement. He indicated the campaign would seek a recount of votes in Georgia, and repeated the campaign’s grievances and allegations of election irregularities in Pennsylvania. Morgan also claimed the President was “on course” to win Arizona (11), where Trump has indeed narrowed the gap between him and Biden. Associated Press and Fox News have projected Biden will win the state, but the Trump campaign has contested that decision. “Biden is relying on these states for his phony claim on the White House, but once the election is final, President Trump will be re-elected,” he added. The Trump campaign has already said he would seek a recount in Wisconsin (10) and filed lawsuits in Michigan (16) and Pennsylvania seeking more access to the counting centres. The President was not conceding, not yet, at least. Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesperson, said in a statement reacting to those reports, “As we said on July 19th, the American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.”“Keep the faith, folks,” Biden tweeted shortly after the President’s angry White House speech on Thursday evening. He has repeatedly urged patience.Biden, who will be the oldest person to be sworn in as president when the time comes, at 78, has waited patiently for 32 years for this moment, having first run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1987. He dropped out then even before the primaries over plagiarism allegations. He tried again in 2008, but pulled out after a poor showing in the first of the nominating contests, the Iowa caucus, bowing out to Barack Obama and later joining the ticket as his running mate.The 2020 race did not start too well for Biden either. He fared poorly in the first two nominating contests, Iowa and New Hampshire; did somewhat better in the third in Nevada; and went to the fourth in South Carolina with the fate of his campaign hanging in balance. He crushed it, with the overwhelming support of the state’s Black Democrats. And went on to sweep the Super Tuesday contests, winning 11 of the 14 states, toppling Senator Bernie Sanders, the front-runner until then. He never looked back.And now, Biden is on the verge of winning. Or, as he wrote on one of the walls of his childhood home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday: “From this house to the White House with the grace of God.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-mr-president-elect/story-06a2dCDfWWrfqxTk8jOIML.html
07-11-2020||World||Australia condemns Chinese trade restrictions as diplomatic ties worsen||Australia said on Friday it was closely monitoring exports to China amid “deeply troubling” reports that Chinese buyers have been told not to purchase seven categories of Australian goods ranging from coal to wine, further souring diplomatic tensions.Australian media have reported that Chinese importers had been informally warned by customs officials that commodities including copper ore, barley, sugar, timber and lobster will face increased inspections from Friday.Trade minister Simon Birmingham said Chinese officials had publicly and privately denied any coordinated effort was being taken against Australia, and said he hoped Beijing “is true to its word”.“They deny any discriminatory actions that are being taken. But that doesn’t seem to be what industry is seeing and hearing at present,” he said on radio station 5AA.A Chinese source briefed on the matter said that trade in the goods was effectively halted for now, and other products such as beef could be affected in future. “It was not an absolute order, but a suggestion,” the person said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. China buys nearly a third of Australia’s exports.A Beijing-based wine importer and distributor told Reuters his customs agent in Shanghai was called to a meeting last week and warned that Australian wine would no longer be processed by customs after November 6. An employee at the company was also called to a meeting in Beijing on Monday and told that Australian wine would not be processed “until other issues were addressed,” he said. The other issues weren’t specified, he added.Relations between Australia and its largest trading partner have become strained after Beijing was angered by Australia’s call for an international inquiry into the source of the coronavirus, and Australian police raids connected to foreign interference investigations.Asked to confirm if China imposed restrictions on Australian imports, foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing on Friday that measures taken by China, which he did not specify, are “legitimate, reasonable and beyond reproach.”Some Chinese importers had already shunned Australian products, even without explicit government orders. Two beef importers told Reuters they had recently bought products from South America instead.“You don’t know what’s going to happen, and whether the cargoes will be able to come in when they arrive,” said a manager with a Beijing-based meat importer.“There is no explicit order on beef yet, but you can try to understand the situation yourself,” said the manager.Australian companies stopped sending rock lobster to China this week after new customs inspections were imposed on the live seafood, resulting in lobsters dying before they could reach customers. China also halted some imports of timber and banned barley shipments from an Australian-based exporter.“Clearly it’s unacceptable for precious fragile cargo like live seafood to sit on a port for days on end waiting to clear,” Birmingham told reporters.China earlier this year launched an anti-dumping investigation into Australian wine, and imposed dumping tariffs on Australian barley.Birmingham said the “range and extent of concerns that industry are hearing is deeply troubling”. “The constant stream, it seems, of concerning, troubling administrative or other decisions being taken in China, heightens the risk for Australian businesses.”Australia’s agriculture department held a meeting on Thursday for 400 farmers and exporters to China, warning of the recent delays and commercial losses, it said in a statement to Reuters. Department officials told exporters to seek advice from importers in China on potential disruptions.An editorial in the state-run China Daily newspaper on Friday said China’s investigations covered only a small portion of imports from Australia, adding Canberra should “steer clear of Washington’s brinkmanship with China before it is too late”.“Choosing sides will be a decision Australia will come to regret as its economy will only suffer further pain,” it said, referring to Australia’s US alliance. Australia joined the United States, India and Japan for the three-way Malabar naval exercise on Thursday, the first time Australia has participated since 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-condemns-chinese-trade-restrictions-as-diplomatic-ties-worsen/story-aDGu0cJMXBoCn56afzjTaO.html
