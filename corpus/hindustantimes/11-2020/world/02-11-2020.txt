02-11-2020||World||Labour blames Rishi Sunak for blocking lockdown earlier||Labour leader Keir Starmer on Monday blamed chancellor Rishi Sunak for blocking previous attempts to impose a three-week lockdown in England, which allegedly led to inaction, deaths and more caseload of Covid-19.As new cases and deaths surge, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday announced a month-long lockdown from Thursday until December 2. Ministers admitted that the lockdown could be extended if cases and deaths do not come down by then.Addressing a meeting of the Confederation of British Industry, Starmer described the decision not to lock down earlier as “his (Sunak’s) decision”. Sunak had reportedly opposed it in cabinet on the ground that it would further aggravate economic distress. According to Starmer, Sunak was trying to “pretend that you can protect the economy without controlling the virus”. He also used the occasion to burnish pro-business credentials of the Labour party under his leadership.He said: “The impact on business – and jobs – will be severe. Make no mistake, the Chancellor’s name is all over this. His decision to block a circuit breaker, to dismiss it as a ‘blunt instrument’ and to pretend that you can protect the economy without controlling the virus will now mean that businesses have to close for longer, more people will lose their jobs, and the public finances will be worse than they needed to be”.Labour is due to support legislation in the House of Commons on Wednesday on the second lockdown, but has often pointed out that its demand to impose the lockdown weeks ago had been dismissed – even ridiculed – by Johnson.Starmer said: “The government was slow to act – again. But it can’t now waste these four weeks. They must be used to fix test, trace and isolate – and to give control to local authorities; to get a grip on messaging and rebuild public trust; and to provide a clear and transparent roadmap to protect businesses and the NHS over the months to come”.Johnson was due to make a statement on the lockdown in the House of Commons on Monday, justifying the second lockdown and mentioning the possibility of deaths being twice as high as those in the first wave earlier this year, when daily deaths reached nearly 1,000.According to excerpts from his statement released, Johnson would say: “Models of our scientists suggest that unless we act now, we could see deaths over the winter that are twice as bad or more compared with the first wave. Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/labour-blames-rishi-sunak-for-blocking-lockdown-earlier/story-t44oLvzLIZowd8zoBjM1QM.html
02-11-2020||World||Portugal wins Inter-Parliamentary Union polls, Pak candidate bags least votes||Pakistan’s candidate in the election for the president of the governing council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) bagged the lowest number of votes and was easily defeated by his candidate from Portugal on Monday.A total of 394 votes were cast in the election and the candidate from Portugal won with a commanding lead of 222 votes, more than the absolute majority of 198 votes. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that India had backed the winning candidate.The election of the new president of the IPU for the period 2020-23 was done through remote electronic secret ballot. The voting was part of the virtual session of the governing council, the main decision-making body of the IPU comprising parliamentarians from around the world.The four candidates in the fray for the post of IPU president were Salma Ataullahjan of Canada, Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani of Pakistan, Duarte Pacheco of Portugal, and Akmal Saidov of Uzbekistan.The Uzbek candidate received 67 votes, the Canadian candidate 53 votes and the Pakistani candidate 52 votes. Sanjrani, the chairman of Pakistan’s Senate or upper house of Parliament, had widely canvassed for his candidature and even travelled to some countries as part of his campaign.Also read: 19 Indians test Covid positive on Vande Bharat flight to Wuhan, ChinaThe IPU is the apex body of parliaments of countries around the world. The people cited above said it had been clear from the start that the Pakistani candidate had little support.India has often criticised Pakistan at international forums for its continued support to terrorist groups and leaders, including those designated by the UN Security Council. Pakistan has also tried to raise the Kashmir issue at the Security Council several times with the backing of its close ally China but has found few other takers for its position.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla is leading the three-member Indian parliamentary delegation participating in the virtual session of the governing council of IPU during November 1-4. Besides the election, the session will decide on key issues such as the adoption of the IPU budget and programme of work for 2021.The presidency of the IPU is rotated between geo-political groups. The outgoing president is Mexican, MP Gabriela Cuevas Barron, who was elected in October 2017. India, part of the Asia-Pacific Group, held the presidency during 1999-2002.Under the principle of geographical rotation, the next president was to be from the “Twelve Plus Group”, which comprises 47 countries. The group had endorsed the Portuguese candidate by an overwhelming majority.The IPU president is the political head of the organisation and acts as the body’s representative at global events and gatherings. The IPU, with its headquarters in Geneva, comprises 179 national parliaments and 13 regional parliamentary bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/portugal-wins-inter-parliamentary-union-polls-pak-candidate-bags-least-votes/story-7fSv2caLj68PzNAnvfcs5K.html
02-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson will find out size of Tory rebellion in lockdown vote||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is poised to sacrifice political capital in order to get Parliament to agree to a month-long partial lockdown of England from midnight on Thursday. While not as a strict as the shutdown in spring, businesses are unhappy and the suggestion of an extension if the virus is still out of control has fuelled a rebellion in his ruling Conservative Party.When is the vote and why is it controversial?On Wednesday evening, in the House of Commons, mere hours before the new restrictions are due to go into effect. Some Tory members of Parliament, dissatisfied with the chaotic handling of the Covid-19 crisis, see this as further evidence the government has failed to get a grip on the situation. They also suspect that the government could try to extend it beyond Dec 2 end date and disrupt the Christmas holidays, a move that would make them unpopular with voters. That would require a fresh vote.Will all MPs vote?The principle of “English votes for English laws” was suspended by Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg during the pandemic to simplify the passage of legislation. While Conservatives in Scotland will not vote on Wednesday, as it is an England-only matter, Labour’s Scottish and Welsh MPs will. Labour has been calling for a nationwide lockdown for weeks. The Scottish National Party has not yet indicated how it will vote.Will Johnson lose the vote?No, he would need a rebellion of around 280 of his 364 Conservative MPs to vote against him. Some will instead abstain to show their opposition to the measure and leave Johnson relying on Labour votes, which would be an embarrassment for him. The Tories gave a signal on the scale of backbench disquiet about the effects of government measures to curb coronavirus on Oct 12 when 42 of them voted against a series of restrictions, including the introduction of a 10 p.m. curfew for pubs in England.What will the vote cost Johnson politically?Labour’s Keir Starmer has been calling for a nationwide lockdown for several weeks, giving Johnson’s decision to move away from localized lockdowns the appearance of a government in reactive mode. Combined with an increased bill for the public finances and inevitable job losses, his own party is becoming increasingly fractious and difficult to manage. That will have a knock-on effect on decisions Johnson takes, or tries to take, in the near future. Rumors swirl of Johnson being a one-term premier, even with the next election not until 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-will-find-out-size-of-tory-rebellion-in-lockdown-vote/story-vFEXlx01Ne3QPVJP6JTcOO.html
02-11-2020||World||6 key questions going into the 2020 United States presidential election||Election Day is finally upon us.Or at least what we still call Election Day, since more than 93 million Americans have already cast ballots in an election that has been reshaped by the worst pandemic in more than a century, its economic fallout and a long-simmering reckoning with systemic racism.Here are some key questions we are considering as the final votes are cast and counted:What do Americans want from a President?Elections are always about where Americans want to steer the country. That’s especially true this year as the US confronts multiple crises and is choosing between two candidates with very different visions for the future.President Donald Trump has downplayed the coronavirus outbreak even as cases surge across the US. He has panned governors — virtually all Democrats — who have imposed restrictions designed to prevent the spread of the disease. And he has bucked public health guidelines by holding his signature campaign rallies featuring crowds of supporters — often unmasked — packed shoulder to shoulder.His Democratic rival, Joe Biden, has said he’d heed the advice of scientists. He’s pledged to work with state and local officials across the country to push mask mandates and has called on Congress to pass a sweeping response package.Trump casts protests of systemic racism as radical and has emphasized a “law and order” message to appeal to his largely white base. Biden acknowledges systemic racism, picked the first Black woman to appear on a major party’s presidential ticket and has positioned himself as a unifying figure.The candidates also hold distinctly different views on everything from climate change and the environment to taxes and the scope of federal regulation.Whose turnout approach wins?The two parties took wildly different approaches to contacting voters amid the pandemic.Democrats stopped knocking on doors in the spring, going all-digital and phone. They resumed limited in-person contacts in September. Republicans continued traditional field work the entire campaign.The GOP can point to success in increasing their voter registration in battleground states. Democrats can point to their early voting success, including from notable slices of new voters. But only the final tally will vindicate one strategy or the other.Will voting be peaceful?Each major party can install official poll watchers at precincts. It’s the first time in decades Republicans could use the practice after the expiration of a court order limiting their activities. So it’s an open question how aggressive those official poll watchers will be in monitoring voters Tuesday or even challenging eligibility.The bigger issue is likely to be unofficial “poll watchers” — especially self-declared militias. Voter intimidation is illegal, but Trump, in the Sept. 29 presidential debate, notably refused to state plainly that he’d accept election results and instead said he is “urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it.”Also Read| Will never forget what China did to US: TrumpIn Michigan, where federal authorities recently arrested members of anti-government paramilitary groups in an alleged plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic secretary of state tried to impose a ban on carrying firearms openly at a polling place. A Michigan judge struck down the order.Whither the exurbs and smaller cities?Trump’s re-election depends on driving up his margins in rural areas and smaller towns and cities — those expansive swaths of red on the county-by-county results map from 2016.But acres don’t vote, people do, and Biden is casting a wide demographic and geographic net. His ideal coalition is anchored in metro areas, but he hopes to improve Democratic turnout among nonwhite voters and college-educated voters across the map.There are places where the competing strategies overlap: exurban counties — those communities on the edges of the large metropolitan footprints — and counties anchored by smaller stand-alone cities.Two potential indicators that could have close-to-complete unofficial returns sooner than later and portend broader results:Forsyth County, Georgia— Part of metro Atlanta’s growing, diversifying northern ring. Republican Mitt Romney won 80% of 81,900 votes in 2012, while Trump’s share dropped to 70% of nearly 99,000 votes in 2016. If that trendline continues, it would signal first that GOP-controlled Georgia is indeed a tossup. More broadly, it would suggest Trump’s suburban-exurban problems are real.Montgomery County, Ohio — Dayton and its surroundings. They make up one of the 206 “pivot counties” that flipped from President Barack Obama to Trump. Obama won 51.4% of the vote in 2012 to 46.8% for Romney (Obama’s statewide win was 50.6-47.6). Trump nipped Hillary Clinton in 2016, but mostly because she lost 15,000 votes from Obama’s 2012 count (137,139), while Trump fell only about 950 votes short of Romney’s mark (124,841). A clear Biden rebound with a Trump drop-off is not the trend Republicans want to see in a midsize metro footprint. A 1968 REDUX? HOW ABOUT 1980?Trump spent considerable energy this year posturing as a “law and order” president, blasting nationwide protests of racial injustice and occasional violence as left-wing rioting that previewed “Joe Biden’s America.”Also Read: For less-raucous Joe Biden, election hope rests on PennsylvaniaThe president’s allies pointed to 1968, when widespread unrest amid the Vietnam War, general social upheaval and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy benefited Republican Richard Nixon as he built his “silent majority.” But Nixon wasn’t the incumbent in 1968. In fact, the political atmosphere was so bad for President Lyndon Johnson that the Democrat didn’t seek re-election.Many Democrats and some Republicans are now pointing more at 1980, when Republican Ronald Reagan trounced President Jimmy Carter and the GOP flipped a whopping 12 Democratic Senate seats. Trump’s standing in the polls over 2020 has tracked only slightly above where Carter spent much of the 1980 election year, as he battled inflation, high unemployment and the Iran hostage crisis. But what appeared a tight race on paper as late as October turned into a rout. Even Democratic heavyweights like Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh and South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, once a presidential nominee, fell.It’s a more polarized era four decades later. But the lesson is that Trump would defy history to win reelection amid such a cascade of crises and voter dissatisfaction.When will the race be called?Absentee voting amid coronavirus has changed the vote-counting timeline, and there aren’t uniform practices for counting those ballots. That makes it difficult to predict when certain key battlegrounds, much less a national result, could be called.For example, Pennsylvania and Michigan — battlegrounds Trump won by less than 1 percentage point in 2016 — aren’t expected to have complete-but-unofficial totals for days. Florida and North Carolina, meanwhile, began processing early ballots ahead of time, with officials there forecasting earlier unofficial returns. But those two states also could have razor-thin margins.Early returns, meanwhile, could show divergent results. Biden’s expected to lead comfortably among early voters, for example. Trump is likely to counter with a lead among Election Day voters. Depending on which counties report which batch of votes first, perennially close states could tempt eager partisans to reach conclusions that aren’t necessarily accurate.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

02-11-2020||World||Germany launches four-week partial shutdown to curb Covid-19||A four-week partial shutdown has started in Germany, with restaurants, bars, theatres, cinemas and other leisure facilities closing down until the end of the month in a drive to flatten a rapid rise in coronavirus infections.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The restrictions that took effect Monday are milder than the ones Germany imposed in the first phase of the pandemic in March and April. This time around, schools, kindergartens, non-essential shops and hairdressers are to remain open.But leading officials decided last week that a “lockdown light” was necessary in light of a sharp rise in cases that has prompted many other European countries to impose more or less drastic restrictions.On Saturday, the national disease control center reported the highest number of infections in one day -- 19,059 -- since the pandemic began. Figures at the beginning of the week tend to be lower, and the center reported 12,097 cases Monday. But that compared with 8,685 a week earlier, underlining the upward trend.Germany has reported over 100 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past week. That is fewer than in many other European countries, but far above the 50 mark that officials set earlier this year as an alarm signal that requires action by local authorities.Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors are to review the situation after two weeks and discuss whether the measures need to be adjusted.“The aim is to get back under this level of 50 at which health offices are in a position to trace contacts,” Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told RBB Inforadio.Merkel said last week that authorities are currently unable to trace the source of three-quarters of infections.The restrictions taking effect Monday allow groups of at most 10 people, from a maximum two households, in public. Germans have been asked to refrain from making non-essential journeys and hotels are barred from accommodating people on tourist trips.Asked whether the restrictions might last beyond November, Braun replied: “Our declared aim is that we want to end the measures in this strictness at the end of November.”“This is also about enabling Christmas business for German companies, and Christmas celebrations with the family for all of us,” he added. “I consider that important ... the stricter the measures, the quicker they work, so we decided on relatively strict measures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-launches-four-week-partial-shutdown-to-curb-covid-19/story-1gYdiD1CFakfJn8nOHenJN.html

In a security advisory issued by its regional office in Bangkok, the UN’s department of safety and security asked UN personnel, particularly those of French nationality, to be alert and observant of their surroundingsThe advisory, which noted that the threat could extend to commercial or educational institutions perceived to be linked to France, also asked all staffers to consider the time they spent in locations associated with French interests.“It must be noted that factors such as appearances or spoken language in themselves do not denote nationality, and the outspoken threats against French nationals is assessed as having a potential to collaterally affect other nationalities as well,” according to the 28 October advisory seen by HT.The advisory follows the recent beheading of a French teacher in Paris at the hands of a religious extremist that led French President Emmanuel Macron to defend the right to depict Islam’s Prophet Muhammad in caricatures as freedom of expression and pledged to fight what he had described as “Islamist separatism”.Also Read: The challenge ahead for terror-hit France | OpinionThe UN safety department’s Threat and Risk Assessment Service (TRS) said there has been an observed increase in anti-Western sentiment and anti-France rhetoric across pre-dominantly Muslim States, including the Asia-Pacific region including Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Indonesia.There have been calls for attacks against French assets by extremist groups such as Islamic State and al-Qaeda. In Bangladesh, there have been large-scale protests against Macron’s support.In Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan led the pitch, accusing French President Emmanuel Macron of “attacking Islam” and of “creating further polarisation that would in turn lead to further radicalisation”. Pakistan’s Foreign Office also issued a statement condemning what it called a “systematic Islamophobic campaign under the garb of freedom of expression,” it said.The Ministry of Religious Affairs had also announced country-wide celebrations as part of Ashiq-e-Rasool (Love for Prophet Muhammad) from 30 October to 6 November. As part of these celebrations, small to medium scale public gatherings and religious conferences will be held by the government. Medium to large scale protest rallies are also likely through this week.France has endured three attacks blamed on Muslim extremists in the last two months: one by a Pakistani refugee that injured two people outside the newspaper’s old headquarters, the slaying of the schoolteacher, and a deadly knife attack last Thursday in a church in the Mediterranean city of Nice. All three have prompted terrorism investigations and France has been at its highest level of alert.India had last week come out in support of the French president who faced vicious attacks after he spoke in favour of the freedom of expression“We strongly deplore the personal attacks in unacceptable language on President Emmanuel Macron in violation of the most basic standards of international discourse. We also condemn the brutal terrorist attack that took the life of a French school teacher in a gruesome manner that has shocked the world. We offer our condolences to his family and the people of France,” the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement last week.The advisory underscored that the Twitter hashtag #IStandWithFrance was trending in India, with thousands of netizens expressing their support and appreciation for French President Macron’s decision to “take a stand against extremism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/threats-posed-by-extremists-lone-wolf-to-increase-says-un-security-agency/story-Ng6Byx7qjzgQTxKnuZlmvL.html
02-11-2020||World||Tory fears England lockdown extension, Rishi Sunak says its ‘time-limited’ by law||Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said the government expects strict new rules to bring Covid-19 infections down sufficiently in England, as he sought to reassure Conservative lawmakers who fear ministers will extend the four-week partial lockdown in December.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The tougher restrictions announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson will see pubs, gyms and non-essential shops closed from Thursday, subject to a vote in Parliament. But after senior cabinet minister Michael Gove said over the weekend the rules could be extended beyond the planned Dec 2 end-date, Sunak on Monday stressed they are “time-limited” by law and will expire.The fresh lockdown, which the government resisted for weeks amid calls for a so-called virus circuit breaker by the opposition Labour Party, threatens to foment a rebellion within Johnson’s Tory party, with a number of senior rank-and-file members voicing their opposition. They’re concerned about the impingements on civil liberties and the damage being wrought on the economy by repeated national closures.Sunak said the government expects the lockdown to reduce infections enough to resume Johnson’s regional, tiered approach to social-distancing rules in December -- though he also warned there’s no single criteria that will be used to determine if that’s the case. By saying the lockdown will be time-limited in law, it means MPs will get another vote if the government wants to extend it.‘Firm Hope’“Our expectation and firm hope -- on the basis of everything we know today -- is the measures we put in place, for the time that they are going to be in place for, will be sufficient to do the job that we need,” Sunak told BBC Radio.Johnson will deliver a statement to the House of Commons on Monday afternoon to set out the latest measures, after a leak on Friday night rushed him into an announcement on Saturday. He’ll say that scientific modelling showed that without action, the rate of deaths could be twice as bad as in the first wave of the pandemic.“Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level,” Johnson will say, according to his office. “I know some in the House believe we should have reached this decision earlier, but I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership.”The prime minister will also give details of extra assistance to self-employed people during the lockdown, raising state aid to more than current plans for 40% of their usual earnings, Sunak said. The chancellor has already increased aid to the employed by extending his flagship wage support program, which had been due to end at the weekend, for the duration of the new restrictions.Too LateBut the extension came too late for many people laid off by companies last week ahead of the program’s scheduled end. Sunak defended his decision to stick with his original time frame, saying it was only the changing health data and subsequent lockdown that forced a rethink.Bloomberg Economics said the second lockdown will mean the economy contracts in the fourth quarter and that the Bank of England will increase its asset purchase target this week by possibly more than the 100 billion pounds ($129 billion) previously forecast.A second national lockdown will be “truly devastating,” Carolyn Fairbairn, outgoing director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said on Monday. The government must keep as much of the economy open as possible and needs a clear strategy for exiting the lockdown, she said.Still, Johnson’s plan is almost certain to pass in the House of Commons because it’s backed by Labour. Of bigger concern to the prime minister will be the size of any Tory rebellion, and if he has to rely on opposition parties to win the vote.Also Read | England to enter into new month-long lockdown as UK virus cases pass 1 millionRebellionTory lawmakers have already shown their displeasure at the coronavirus restrictions, when 42 of them rebelled in a vote last month to confirm the government’s imposition of a 10 p.m. curfew on pubs and restaurants.“This repetitive cycle of lockdowns is immensely damaging to people’s livelihoods, is deeply depressing and is causing a huge toll in terms of people’s mental health and family relationships,” Graham Brady, who heads the influential 1922 committee of rank-and-file Conservatives MPs, told BBC Radio late Sunday.Adding to the potential danger is the latest intervention by Nigel Farage, one of the architects of Brexit. Following a pattern of entering the political scene when he senses Tory disquiet, Farage announced the re-branding of his Brexit Party as Reform UK He sent a message to supporters calling the government’s “woeful” response to the pandemic the “most pressing” issue facing the country.“The government has dug itself into a hole and rather than admit its mistakes, it keeps on digging,” Farage wrote. “The new national lockdown will result in more life-years lost than it hopes to save, as non-Covid patients with cancer, cardiac, lung and other illnesses have treatments delayed or cancelled again. Suicides are soaring. Businesses and jobs are being destroyed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tory-fears-england-lockdown-extension-rishi-sunak-says-its-time-limited-by-law/story-frbBoMgVqHF7RBmv8i9HJN.html
02-11-2020||World||19 Indians test Covid positive on Vande Bharat flight to Wuhan, future flights may be delayed||As many as 19 Indians are said to have tested positive for Covid-19 in a Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flight, which landed in the central Chinese city of Wuhan from New Delhi on Friday.The 19 including both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients have been taken to designated hospitals for treatment and quarantine as per protocol followed by the Chinese government.Asymptomatic patients are those who do not show symptoms of the disease like fever and cough but could infect others.It’s the largest number of Covid-19 positive cases for any VBM flight to China until now.Among the 277 passengers who came on the flight, at least 39 were found to have Covid-19 antibodies – an indication they had the disease but have recovered – and are being monitored.The remaining passengers are currently undergoing the mandatory 14-day quarantine in designated hotels.It was not immediately clear what impact the cases in the Wuhan VBM flight will have on the ones planned ahead for China . Flights are scheduled for November 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th and December 4th.More than 1,500 Indians are waiting to return to China in upcoming VBM flights expected over the coming weeks.The Friday flight was the sixth VBM flight by Air India to China to help Indians stranded in both the countries to travel back to their destinations.More than 1500 Indians are waiting to return to China in upcoming VBM flights expected over the coming weeks.There is still no word from China when nearly 23000 Indian students studying here will be able to return.The Delhi-Wuhan-Delhi flight was announced after the cancellation of the October 23 flight to Guangzhou in south China.The large number of positive cases in the Air India VBM flight could lead to the postponement of the upcoming flight to Wuhan later this month.India has sent a “request for approval” to Chinese authorities for next flight in November to land in Wuhan but is yet to get a response.Receiving the required permission will not be easy -- authorities in Ningbo in eastern China’s Zhejiang province had declined permission for a second VBM flight after a couple of passengers tested positive for Covid-19 for the first flight on September 11.With the pandemic situation in China normalising, health authorities are focussing on controlling imported cases and localised clusters.Until Friday, VBM flights to China have landed in Shanghai in eastern China, Guangzhou and Ningbo besides Wuhan.As of September 14, the Chinese embassy in New Delhi had said all Indians flying to China on “irregular commercial flights, charter flights or special flights from India to China, double nucleic acid tests of Covid-19, in the labs authorised by the ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research), the first within 120 hours (5 days) before boarding and the second within 36 hours before boarding” were mandatory.“The negative report of the second nucleic acid test within 36 hours before boarding to China needn’t be sent to the Embassy or Consulates, and can be printed out together with the first negative report as well as the stamped Health Declaration Form by the passengers for the flight check-in and China Customs procedures, except otherwise required by the competent departments of the Chinese Government as individual cases.”China’s civil aviation administration hasn’t permitted Air India’s VBM flights to land in Beijing as a precaution against, what Beijing calls “imported cases” of Covid-19.The coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province, in late December before spreading across the country and then globally, triggering the worst pandemic in several decades .India had dispatched three flights to Wuhan to airlift Indians stranded in the city when the virus was at its peak in the city in February this year.China has brought the pandemic under control though local clusters have broken out in cities like Dalian, Qingdao, Urumqi and Kashgar in past weeks, triggering partial lockdowns and mass nucleic acid testing.It has also placed strict measures to control imported cases including cancelling flights on routes where Covid-19 cases were reported.On Monday, mainland China reported 24 new confirmed Covid-19 cases for Sunday, including three cases of local transmission in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and 21 cases from overseas, the national health commission (NHC) announced.The NHC reported no new asymptomatic cases, down from 38 a day earlier. China does not count symptom-less patients as confirmed Covid-19 cases. Total confirmed Covid-19 cases until Sunday in mainland China stand at 85,997. The death toll remains at 4,634.With 21 new imported Covid-19 cases for Sunday, the total number of imported cases has risen to 3,401.Of the new imported cases, six were reported in Shanghai, five in Guangdong, three each in Shanxi and Gansu, two in Sichuan, and one each in Tianjin and Jiangsu, the commission said in its daily report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/19-indians-test-covid-19-positive-on-vande-bharat-flight-to-wuhan-future-flights-may-be-delayed/story-RofsxIM55RPXSFdnjyl0dP.html

It is rare for the PLA to disclose the names of private companies from which it plans to procure military equipment.It’s a sign that the world’s largest military force is expanding procurement from traditional suppliers, China’s state-owned enterprises, and buying specialised equipment from niche manufacturers.The PLA’s Tibet Command invited 22 private “arms companies” and held meetings to review their products to be potentially used during “plateau warfare and border defence”, national broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV) and the nationalistic tabloid, Global Times reported.“Many types of rotor-wing and fixed-wing aerial drones, including the Blowfish A2 helicopter drone developed by Zhuhai-based Ziyan UAV and the CW-25 vertical take-off and landing fixed-wing drone made by Chengdu-based JOUAV, were inspected by the PLA,” the CCTV report said.They are specially designed for use in high elevation, low temperature regions, with the aim of conducting unmanned missions including material supply, border defense and management, “…surveillance and armed reconnaissance along the border of southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR),” the CCTV report said.The reports didn’t specify which private Chinese company manufactures clothes made of graphene, which has been hailed as a “wonder material”.The website, Dailytechlife.com which tracks technology and invention, says as an item of cloth, graphene can be “thermal, waterproof, and fireproof” and have other advanced technical properties not normally associated with cloth.Beijing’s decision to look at private companies matches with its goal to merge the military and civil sectors.“PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) long-term goal is to create an entirely self-reliant defence-industrial sector—fused with a strong civilian industrial and technology sector—that can meet the PLA’s needs for modern military capabilities,” the USA’s Defence Department said in its annual report on China’s military in September.Calling it the “Military-Civil Fusion (MCF) Development Strategy”, the report said China is pursuing its “…MCF Development Strategy to “fuse” its economic and social development strategies with its security strategies to build an integrated national strategic system and capabilities in support of China’s national rejuvenation goals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-military-to-buy-graphene-clothing-chopper-drones-from-pvt-cos-for-india-border/story-Ddrzp2oFawwBxIwrMsFjoJ.html
02-11-2020||World||France may reverse bookstore closures amid lockdown anger||The French government is facing stiffer resistance to its second lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus, forcing it to rewrite rules on book sales and consider lifting restrictions early for smaller stores. France went into a second national lockdown on Friday as a surge in cases risks overwhelming the health system. Unlike in the spring, schools remain open and a wider range of businesses and retailers can continue to operate.But local shops selling items deemed non-essential, such as clothes, toys and books, are not permitted to open to the public. After a weekend of outcry and defiance from shopkeepers, French Prime Minister Jean Castex said late Sunday he would ban supermarkets from selling non-essential products such as toys or books “as a matter of fairness.” On Monday morning, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire went a step further, saying he would look at the option of reopening small stores as soon as November 12 instead of December 1.“I can totally understand that people are upset that you can sell items such as flowers and books in supermarkets but not in local shops,” Castex said in an interview on TF1 Sunday. He added that the lockdown measures “aren’t meant to annoy the French population but to protect them.” He said the pandemic “has taken dramatic proportions” with one person every 30 seconds hospitalized in France.Read more: Terror returns to France | HT EditorialLe Maire, who called for bookstores to be permitted to reopen in the first lockdown, will meet with shopkeeper federations this week to work on new protocols, such as shopping by appointment. That could allow as many retailers as possible to open from November 12. In the meantime, the finance minister urged French people to respect the latest rules and warned that a deeper health crisis would worsen the economic situation.“When we are in a health crisis, an economic crisis and a terrorism crisis, there is no room for the positions of individuals, there is just room for the collective position,” Le Maire said on RTL radio Monday. “That’s called the state and today we need to respect the rules of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-may-reverse-bookstore-closures-amid-lockdown-anger/story-D3sTkk3HrEbNl2XDS5c6OP.html
02-11-2020||World||Samuel Paty beheading: French schools reopen with minute of silence||French schools held a nationwide minute of silence Monday in tribute to a teacher who was beheaded for opening a class debate on free speech by showing students caricatures of the prophet of Islam.Samuel Paty was killed on Oct. 16 outside his school in suburban Paris by an 18-year-old refugee of Chechen origin to punish him for showing the caricatures published by the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which triggered a newsroom massacre by extremists in January 2015.Since their re-publication in September at the start of the ongoing Paris trial over the killings, France has endured three attacks blamed on Muslim extremists: one by a Pakistani refugee that injured two people outside the newspaper’s old headquarters, the slaying of the schoolteacher, and a deadly knife attack last Thursday in a church in the Mediterranean city of Nice. All three have prompted terrorism investigations, and France is now at its highest level of alert.French President Emmanuel Macron promised to increase protection of schools and churches immediately after the Nice attack, more than doubling the number of soldiers actively deployed in the country. Paty was killed at the beginning of a two-week French school holiday.On Monday, the school where he taught at Conflans-Saint-Honorine reopened for teachers only. France’s prime minister minister, Jean Castex, arrived to lend support. Other schools throughout the country resumed as usual to both students and teachers.At schools throughout the country, students will read the letter of Jean Jaurès, a 19th century French thinker and politician, to instructors urging them to teach the country’s children to “know France, its geography and its history, its body and its soul.”Macron has defended the decision to publish the caricatures, which he says falls squarely into two of France’s most cherished rights: freedom of expression and secularism. The cartoons were originally published in Denmark in 2005 and elsewhere later in countries where freedom of expression is considered inviolable. Many Muslims see them as sacrilegious.“We have the right to believe that these caricatures are in bad taste. There are plenty of people I believe are in bad taste. There are plenty of people who I think say idiotic things,” Gerald Darmanin, France’s interior minister, told BFM television. “But I’ll defend to the death your right to say them, as Voltaire said.”In Germany and the Netherlands, many schools were also paying tribute to Paty.“We can send a sign of solidarity with those teachers who are committed to democratic coexistence,” state Education Minister Sandra Sheeres wrote in a message to Berlin schools asking them to participate.Scheeres also asked those participating to explain the background to their students to make them aware of “tolerance and solidarity as well as against violence and extremism.”The Dutch education ministers asked schools, colleges and universities to find ways to express their support.“The Netherlands stands squarely behind teachers and the constitutional freedom of expression,” ministers Arie Slob and Ingrid van Engelshoven wrote. “Teachers must be able to do their work in freedom and security so our children and youth can develop into independent citizens who can live together in a country that is characterized by freedom, equality and solidarity.”___David Rising in Berlin and Mike Corder in The Hague contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-schools-reopen-in-mourning-after-beheading-of-teacher/story-EOcFBuqxXwNSV7jxFOmjrK.html
02-11-2020||World||Kabul University attacked by armed gunmen; 19 dead, 22 injured||Gunmen stormed Kabul University on Monday as it hosted a book fair attended by the Iranian ambassador to Afghanistan, sparking an hours-long gun battle and leaving at least 19 dead and 22 wounded at the war-torn country’s largest school.The ministry’s spokesman, Tariq Arian, also said there were three attackers involved in the assault, all of whom were killed in the ensuing firefight. As the sun slowly set over the Afghan capital, there were few other details though the Taliban issued a statement denying they took part in the assault.The attack came as the insurgents are continuing peace talks with the U.S.-backed government. Those negotiations, taking place in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, aim to help the U.S. finally withdraw from America’s longest war, though daily bloodshed continues and an Islamic State affiliate launches its own attacks on Shiites in the country.Five hours into the fighting, sporadic grenade explosions and automatic weapons fire echoed down the empty streets surrounding the university’s fenced compound. Afghan troops stood guard. Earlier, students were seen fleeing for their lives from the site.“Unfortunately, there are casualties,” Arian said as the assault unfolded, without elaborating.Ahmad Samim, a university student, told journalists he saw militants armed with pistols and Kalashnikov assault rifles firing at the school, the country’s oldest with some 17,000 students. He said the attack happened at the university’s eastern side where its law and journalism faculty teach.Afghan media reported a book exhibition was being held at the university and attended by a number of dignitaries at the time of the shooting.While Afghan officials declined to discuss the bookfair, Iran’s semiofficial ISNA news agency reported Sunday that Iranian Ambassador Bahador Aminian and cultural attaché Mojtaba Noroozi were scheduled to inaugurate the fair, which would host some 40 Iranian publishers. Iranian state television reported the attack occurred, but did not offer information on its officials.Iranian diplomats have been targeted previously by attacks in the country and nearly sparked a war between the two countries. In 1998, Iran held the Taliban responsible for the deaths of nine Iranian diplomats who were working in its consulate in northern Afghanistan and sent reinforcements to the 950-kilometer- (580-mile-) long border that Iran and Afghanistan share.No group immediately took responsibility for the ongoing attack though the Taliban issued a statement saying they were not involved. However, suspicion immediately fell on the Islamic State group.Last month, the Islamic State group sent a suicide bomber into an education center in the capital’s Shiite dominated neighborhood of Dasht-e-Barchi, killing 24 students and injuring more than 100. The Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan has declared war on Afghanistan’s minority Shiite Muslims and have staged dozens of attacks since emerging in 2014.Schools have been targeted for attacks in the past as well. Last year, a bomb outside of the Kabul University campus’ gates killed eight people. In 2016, gunmen attacked the American University in Kabul, killing 13.Violence has been relentless in Afghanistan even as the Taliban and a government-appointed negotiation team discuss a peace agreement to end more than four decades of war in the country. The talks in Qatar have been painfully slow and despite repeated demands for a reduction in violence, the chaos has continued unabated.A U.S. deal with the Taliban in February set the stage for peace talks currently underway in Doha. The deal also allows for the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops from Afghanistan.Meanwhile Monday, a vehicle hit a roadside mine in the country’s southern Helmand province, killing at least seven civilians, most of them women and children, provincial governor spokesman Omer Zwak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-gunmen-stage-attack-on-kabul-university-taliban-denies-involvement/story-uC7Archw9sFUVUEaPoxT9H.html

02-11-2020||World||Barrett to join Supreme Court arguments for the first time||Justice Amy Coney Barrett is expected to join her Supreme Court colleagues on Monday to hear arguments for the first time. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the high court began hearing cases by phone in May.That means the public won’t see the new justice, but they’ll be able to hear her if she asks questions, as all her colleagues have been doing. Also because of the pandemic, the court has been allowing the public to listen to arguments in real time, a change from the past.Participating in oral arguments will be among the first things Barrett will do after being confirmed last week in a 52-48 virtual party-line vote, with Republicans overpowering Democrats to install President Donald Trump’s third Supreme Court nominee. She did not participate in decisions the high court issued last week involving extended timelines for receiving and counting ballots in Pennsylvania and North Carolina because of the need for a quick resolution and “because she has not had time to fully review the parties’ filings,” the court’s spokeswoman said in a statement. But her vote also wouldn’t have changed the outcome in either case.The two cases Barrett will hear Monday are relatively low-profile, a dispute involving the Freedom of Information Act and another involving disability benefits for railroad employees. On Tuesday, however, as the country finishes voting, the court’s cases include one about sentencing young people to life without parole. And on Wednesday, the day after Election Day, the court hears a case that involves a clash of LGBTQ rights and religious freedoms in a major swing state, Pennsylvania.Click here for complete US Presidential Election coverage. Next week brings a case that could threaten the Affordable Care Act, one that was front and center during Barrett’s confirmation hearings last month. Democrats claimed that the Obama-era health law, known as “Obamacare,” would be in jeopardy if Barrett joined the court. Trump has urged the court to overturn the law.The justices have said they will continue to hear cases by phone through at least December. So it’s unclear when Barrett will move in to her offices at the court, taking over the space of her predecessor, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. On Monday, Chief Justice John Roberts is expected to offer a traditional, short welcome, to Barrett before arguments begin, wishing her “a long and happy career in our common calling.” And the court will have a typical two hours of argument in two cases.Read more: Will never forget what China did to US: TrumpThe pandemic has upended other traditions. If the justices were in their courtroom, Barrett would join her colleagues in a round of handshakes before taking the bench, a tradition every time the justices meet for argument or their private conference that was suspended months ago because of the pandemic. Spectators would see her emerge from behind the court’s red curtains and take a seat on the far right hand side of the bench, the junior-most justice’s seat. She would be seated next to Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s first nominee to the court.And while arguments in the courtroom are a free-for-all, with justices constantly jumping in with questions, the court’s phone-arguments are more orderly. Each justice gets to ask each lawyer questions in order of seniority. As the junior justice, Barrett will ask her questions last.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barrett-to-join-supreme-court-arguments-for-the-first-time/story-aDvUrVgAEyrMd5gXtRe0IJ.html

The households were vandalised and later set on fire on Sunday after a Bangladeshi man, who lives in France, allegedly praised President Emmanuel Macron for taking steps against “inhumane ideologies” after a teacher in Paris was decapitated for showing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, bdnews24.com reported.The headmaster of a kindergarten school in Purbo Dhour welcomed Macron’s action in a comment on the post.As the rumours about the Facebook post spread, tension mounted in the area on Saturday, the report said.Also Read | Thousands stage anti-France protests in Bangladesh, PakistanThe police arrested two people on charges of hurting the religious sentiments on Sunday, the report quoted Qamruzzaman Talukder, Officer-in-Charge of Bangra Bazar Police Station, as saying.They include the headmaster of the kindergarten.

02-11-2020||World||Typhoon Goni: 16 dead, thousands of homes damaged in Philippines||At least 16 people were killed as Typhoon Goni lashed the Philippines over the weekend, and about 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away in the eastern island province that was first hit by the ferocious storm, officials said Monday.Goni blasted into Catanduanes province at dawn Sunday as a super typhoon with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph). But the storm weakened considerably after making landfall and shifted direction to spare the capital, Manila, before blowing out into the South China Sea.The Office of Civil Defense said at least 16 people were killed in Catanduanes and nearby Albay province, where three others remain missing.Catanduanes, an island province of more than 260,000 people that is often lashed by Pacific storms, was isolated after losing power and communications due to Goni and another typhoon that had hit a week earlier. But officials there managed to connect to the outside world on Monday after disaster-response authorities flew to the devastated island with satellite phones.Catanduanes Gov. Joseph Cua and other officials said at least five people drowned and four were injured in the typhoon, which whipped up 5-meter (16-foot) storm surges. About 13,000 shanties and houses were damaged or swept away when the typhoon slammed into the province, they said. Many residents fled to safety from their homes as the typhoon approached.Cua described the onslaught as “severe” and reported that some coastal areas were swamped by frightening storm surges. His brief conversation with some Cabinet officials in Manila was broadcast live on state-run TV.About 10,000 shanties were “totally washed out along the coastlines that were hit by the typhoon,” Catanduanes Rep. Hector Sanchez said.About 80% of the electric posts on the island were toppled and roads linking the province’s 11 towns remained impassable to vehicles, Cua said.An army general on the island appealed for more troops to help distribute food packs and water to residents. He added that the army camp was destroyed by the typhoon and soldiers have camped out at the airport, which remained open.An air force cargo plane was to deliver food packs, drinking water, blankets and other relief goods to the island province.The typhoon also devastated the nearby province of Albay, where heavy rains washed down boulders and mudflows from Mayon Volcano, engulfing about 150 houses in a single community in the town of Guinobatan.Two residents were killed in the community and three others remain missing, Albay Gov. Al Francis Bichara said.Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was to conduct an aerial inspection of the typhoon-hit region on his way to Manila on Monday from his southern hometown, officials said. The 75-year-old leader has been criticized for his absences from public view amid the coronavirus pandemic and recent storms, but aides say he’s working even when away from the public.One of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan, which left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines in November 2013.The Philippines is lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It’s also located on the so-called Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-goni-16-dead-thousands-of-homes-damaged-in-philippines/story-mS3BX2wesdZ7MM3EthETsJ.html
02-11-2020||World||India could resume foreign secretary-level dialogue with Nepal. There is one condition||Army Chief General MM Naravane, who travels to Nepal this week to be conferred the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army, will meet Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on November 5. The meeting, being described as crucial, could lead to resumption of foreign secretary-level dialogue between the two countries, people familiar with the matter said.New Delhi had paused talks with the Himalayan nation’s communist government earlier this year after its parliament cleared a new map in June this year that incorporates Indian territory near its border with China. The move, believed to have been backed by China’s communist party, was an effort by KP Sharma Oli to whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments in Nepal to consolidate his hold on the party and the government.Over the last few months, the two neighbours softened their posture and attempted to reboot ties. In September, PM Oli decided to stop distribution of next school textbooks that had been published with the country’s revised political map.In October, PM Oli cleared Gen Naravane’s three-day visit starting November 4 and removed deputy prime minister Ishwar Pokhrel from the defence ministry. Pokhrel, seen as a sharp and consistent critic of India, was believed to have been reluctant to host Gen Naravane.PM Oli retained the charge of the defence ministry and will meet Gen Naravane this week as the country’s defence minister.“If the conversation goes as well as expected, India will reciprocate with resumption of the foreign secretary-level talks and a meeting of the Joint Technical Level Boundary Committee,” a top government official said.Research and Analysis Wing chief Samant Kumar Goel who made a quiet visit to Nepal last week held one round of talks with PM Oli where both sides emphasised the civilisational, cultural and multi-faceted friendly relations with the two countries.Gen Naravane’s Nepal visit comes at a time PM Oli is still in the middle of an acrimonious power struggle within the Nepal Communist Party. The communist party was formed in 2018 after the merger of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre.Over the weekend, PM Oli, who is confident of getting the numbers to stay in power, is learnt to have made it clear that he wanted the merged party to split rather than cede control to buy peace with detractors led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal. The intra-NCP struggle, which had been simmering for months, erupted after PM Oli appointed three ministers in his cabinet without consulting Dahal with whom he shares the post of NCP co-chairman. A peace pact agreed to by the two sides earlier mandated that consultation with the party.But PM Oli refused to abide by this agreement and is seen to have engineered a rebellion in the Province 6 government run by chief minister Mahendra Bahadur Shahi, a confidant of Dahal. A vote of no-confidence moved against the chief minister under this plan wasn’t successful but brought out the differences between the two camps out in the open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-india-nepal-take-firm-step-to-reboot-ties-a-5-nov-meet-will-be-crucial/story-X77guYbrNk007s2XGZ5XAO.html
02-11-2020||World||Top Trump adviser Scott Atlas apologizes for interview to Russian agency listed as foreign agent in US||One of President Donald Trump’s top medical advisers issued an apology on Sunday for giving an interview to a Russian news agency that’s registered as a foreign agent in the US.Scott Atlas, a physician and one-time Fox commentator who rose to the president’s inner circle after repeatedly downplaying the risk of the coronavirus, issued an apology Sunday, in particular to US national security officials.In the interview with RT, formerly known as Russia Today, Atlas was deeply critical of lockdown measures and also criticized US media for its portrayal of the pandemic.“The lockdowns will go down as an epic failure of public policy,” he told the Russian agency. US public health officials are “killing people with their fear-inducing shutdown policies.”Atlas also said that deaths in Asia are lower than the US not because of public health measures, but because of what he termed higher existing immunity in countries like South Korea to the novel coronavirus because of previous viruses in the region.White House Slams Fauci After Comments on PandemicAtlas is a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where members of the medical faculty issued a public letter in September disavowing Atlas’s remarks. He responded with a legal threat.Atlas routinely diverges from consensus health advice of senior public health officials. Two weeks ago, Twitter blocked a tweet of his that said masks don’t work in slowing the virus’s spread. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have both criticized Atlas.More than 230,000 Americans have died from the virus, and more than 9 million cases have been confirmed. The virus is surging again in the U.S., with a record 99,000 cases reported on Friday. Roughly 1,000 people are dying in the U.S. daily from the virus.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-trump-adviser-scott-atlas-apologizes-for-interview-to-russian-agency-listed-as-foreign-agent-in-us/story-ksP9GaZbFTyr7QQXNx1inK.html
02-11-2020||World||US Elections 2020: Trump hints at firing Dr Anthony Fauci after presidential polls||President Donald Trump is suggesting that he will fire Dr. Anthony Fauci after Tuesday’s election, as his rift with the nation’s top infectious disease expert widens while the nation sees its most alarming outbreak of the coronavirus since the spring.Click here for full US Elections 2020 coverageSpeaking at a campaign rally in Opa-locka, Florida, Trump expressed frustration that the surging cases of the virus that has killed more than 230,000 Americans so far this year remains prominent in the news, sparking chants of “Fire Fauci” from his supporters.“Don’t tell anybody but let me wait until a little bit after the election,” Trump replied to thousands of supporters just after midnight Monday, adding he appreciated their “advice.”Trump’s comments on Fauci less than 48 hours before polls close all but assure that his handling of the pandemic will remain front and center heading into Election Day.It’s the most direct Trump has been in suggesting he was serious about trying to remove Fauci from his position. He has previously expressed that he was concerned about the political blowback of removing the popular and respected doctor before Election Day.Trump’s comments come after Fauci leveled his sharpest criticism yet of the White House’s response to the coronavirus and Trump’s public assertion that the nation is “rounding the turn” on the virus.Fauci has grown outspoken that Trump has ignored his advice for containing the virus, saying he hasn’t spoken with Trump in more than a month. He has raised alarm that the nation was heading for a challenging winter if more isn’t done soon to slow the spread of the disease.In an interview with the Washington Post this weekend, Fauci cautioned that the U.S. will have to deal with “a whole lot of hurt” in the weeks ahead due to surging coronavirus cases.Fauci said the U.S. “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” to stem rising cases as more people gather indoors during the colder fall and winter months. He says the U.S. will need to make an “abrupt change” in public health precautions.Fauci added that he believed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden “is taking it seriously from a public health perspective,” while Trump is “looking at it from a different perspective.” Fauci, who’s on the White House coronavirus task force, said that perspective emphasizes “the economy and reopening the country.”In response, White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump always puts people’s well-being first and Deere charges that Fauci has decided “to play politics” right before Tuesday’s election. Deere said Fauci “has a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy” but instead is “choosing to criticize the president in the media and make his political leanings known.”Trump in recent days has stepped up his attacks on Biden for pledging to heed the advice of scientists in responding to the pandemic. Trump has claimed Biden would “lock down” the nation once again. Biden has promised to heed the warnings of Fauci and other medical professionals but has not endorsed another national lockdown.Trump has recently relied on the advice of Stanford doctor Scott Atlas, who has no prior background in infectious diseases or public health, as his lead science adviser on the pandemic. Atlas has been a public skeptic about mask wearing and other measures widely accepted by the scientific community to slow the spread of the virus.Other members of the White House coronavirus task force have grown increasingly vocal about what they see as a dangerous fall spike in the virus.Trump’s aggressive approach to Fauci carries some risks this close to Election Day,A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in September showed 68% of Americans have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in Fauci to provide reliable information on the coronavirus. That compares with 52% of Americans who trusted Biden to do that and just 40% for Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/us-elections-2020-trump-hints-at-firing-dr-anthony-fauci-after-presidential-polls/story-6PLn7MKtZvEIJSGy6kQagL.html

Rescue efforts were continuing in eight buildings in Izmir where 79 people were killed, making Friday’s earthquake the deadliest in Turkey for nearly a decade. Two teenagers died on the Greek island of Samos, authorities said.Television footage showed the girl, Elif, being pulled from the rubble and carried by rescue workers on a stretcher to an ambulance, 65 hours after the earthquake struck. Elif’s two sisters and brother were rescued along with their mother on Saturday, but one of the children subsequently died. “A thousand thanks to you, my God. We have brought out our little one Elif from the apartment block,” Mehmet Gulluoglu, head of Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD), wrote on Twitter.Read more: ‘I never lost hope’: 70-year-old pulled out alive in Turkey as earthquake toll hits 75More than 3,500 tents and 13,000 beds have been supplied to provide temporary shelter, according to AFAD, which said 962 people had been injured in Friday’s earthquake.More than 740 victims have so far been discharged from hospitals, AFAD said.It was the deadliest earthquake in Turkey since one in the eastern city of Van in 2011 which killed more than 500 people. A quake in January this year killed 41 people in the eastern province of Elazig.Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey.The Friday earthquake, which the Istanbul-based Kandilli Institute said had a magnitude of 6.9, was centred in the Aegean Sea, northeast of Samos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-year-old-rescued-from-rubble-turkey-quake-death-toll-hits-81/story-OzgTdR8IGIhdGcf5RCKmAK.html
02-11-2020||World||For less-raucous Joe Biden, election hope rests on Pennsylvania||The difference was as stark as any moment during the tempestuous 2020 presidential campaign. While Donald Trump barnstormed five states 48 hours before the election, Covid-conscious Joe Biden homed in on one valuable patch of political turf: battleground Pennsylvania.Instead of also jetting to Michigan or Wisconsin, swing states he most likely must flip to defeat Trump, Biden spent Sunday campaigning in his birth state, pleading for some voter love in the City of Brotherly Love to help pull him over the finish line.“Philadelphia, two more days!” the 77-year-old former vice president boomed to a few hundred people weathering the chill and drizzle as they sat in -- or on -- their cars at a drive-in rally.“We need every single one of you to get out and vote on Tuesday,” he implored. “In two days we can put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation.”Biden narrowly leads Trump in Pennsylvania, according to the RealClearPolitics polls average showing him 4.3 percentage points up.But his style Sunday was less of a momentum-seizing challenger about to topple the most controversial US leader in a century, and more of a cautious contender going up against a loud-mouthed Goliath.At a surprise stop in Philadelphia, a few dozen people gathered in a parking lot to hear a masked Biden speak -- sometimes in tones so hushed people could barely make out what he was saying.The neighborhood scene, at dusk during a break in daylong rain, was picturesque, but felt more like a campaign stop by a young wannabe stumping in Iowa six months before the first nomination contest.Journalists were kept out of one Biden stop altogether when he addressed a union in nearby Chester, making those in the small pool of reporters following him wonder why he would not want every second of possible exposure.- Safety over ‘bravado’ -The race is boiling down to this eastern state of nearly 13 million residents that Trump won by just 44,000 votes four years ago.A full-on Sunday focus on Philadelphia apparently is not enough.Biden is scheduled to hold at least three more major events Monday in Pennsylvania, including an Election Night eve drive-in event in Pittsburgh, featuring pop star Lady Gaga.The Republican incumbent spent all day Saturday campaigning in Pennsylvania, holding far more audacious and rowdy rallies than Biden. They featured thousands of supporters with “Make America Great Again” caps. Social distancing and face masks? Not so much. “Nobody’s ever seen anything like this,” Trump said to cheers.Biden’s events are a world apart, the poster children of health-conscious campaigning during the Covid-19 era. An aide wipes down the microphone and lecturn just before Biden speaks. Unlike Trump, the 77-year-old Democrat wears a mask whenever he is not on stage.Voters at Biden’s events didn’t appear to mind the differences.“I care more about the votes than the optics, and I think the votes are on our side,” Birgit Hottenrott, a 52-year-old mother, told AFP at Biden’s drive-in rally.“The optics may be more visible from him,” she said of Trump, but “everybody’s safety is what’s so much more important than ego and bravado.”Biden is trying to squeeze every last vote particularly out of Philadelphia’s black community, a constituency that traditionally supports Democrats but which fell short of expectations in 2016 with Hillary Clinton.He brought his campaign to Sharon Baptist Church where some 50 cars were gathered in the parking lot to hear and honk for Biden.Bishop Millicent Hunter, a black pastor in Philadelphia, said that while she was confident of Biden taking Pennsylvania, she was on a mission “to encourage people that this is not a time to become complacent.”When pressed on whether she worried about a 2016 repeat, in which Clinton led in polls in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin only to lose those states and the election, she hesitated.“I think we’ve seen that movie, it was a tragedy,” the 60-something pastor said. “I just still think this is going to work for Joe Biden.”- ‘He’s a disgrace’ -Biden laid into Trump for having the “gall” to suggest doctors and hospitals were “falsely inflating” Covid-19 death numbers in order to boost profits.“It’s more than offensive, it’s a disgrace. He’s a disgrace,” he said, as supporters honked in agreement.Trump presents himself as “a tough guy, a macho man,” Biden sneered. “Gimme a break.”Each candidate has brought contrasting styles to Pennsylvania, and Joseph Gidjunis, a photographer and Biden volunteer from Philadelphia, made clear he understood the stakes in his state. “Everyone is doing their closing messages here because the Keystone State could be the key to their victory,” the 38-year-old said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-less-raucous-joe-biden-election-hope-rests-on-pennsylvania/story-7l5RmAO6vzxk7JdP7yUgDL.html
02-11-2020||World||World’s largest consumer of sugar wants people to eat more||In a world where sugar has attracted increasing scrutiny for its impact on health and obesity, there are moves afoot in the biggest consuming country to persuade people to eat more of the sweetener.Mills in India are eyeing increased consumption as a way to cut the nation’s chronic oversupply, which stems partly from the favorable incentives provided to growers in politically powerful rural areas. High production costs mean the country finds it hard to sell sugar on the global market without subsidies.To push forward their initiative, the mills have begun an online campaign to boost domestic demand, involving workshops and webinars, where everyone from nutritionists and endocrinologists, to public health experts and medical practitioners will share their expertise and knowledge.“Sugar is the most preferred source of the body’s fuel for brain power, muscle energy and every natural process that goes into proper functioning of our body cells,” the Indian Sugar Mills Association said, adding that the calories in sugar are the same as calories from any other food, and it’s only when calories are not burnt adequately or too many are consumed, that body weight increases.Social MediaConsumption in India has stagnated at 19 kilograms per capita per year compared with a global average of 23 kilograms as social media campaigns saying the cane-based sweetener is unhealthy discourage people from eating it, according to the association. Per capita consumption growth between 2000 and 2016 was among the lowest in the world, it said.If per capita consumption rises to the global average, domestic demand will climb by 5.2 million tons a year, according to Sudhanshu Pandey, the top bureaucrat at the food ministry. That would slash the surplus, cut overseas sales and save the government money by reducing export subsidies.India, also the world’s second-biggest producer, exported a record 5.65 million tons in 2019-20, with the help of these subsidies, which are opposed by Australia, Brazil and Guatemala. Mills are aiming to ship 6 million tons in 2020-21 with production expected to rise 13% after good rains boosted planting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-s-largest-consumer-of-sugar-wants-people-to-eat-more/story-vtqeA30xBm8oaXcwBqeaqN.html
02-11-2020||World||Canada stabbing attack suspect who killed two people identified, charged with murder||The 24-year-old who went on a stabbing rampage on Halloween night in Quebec City has been identified as Carl Girouard, who is believed to be from Sainte-Thérèse, a suburb of Montreal.He was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder as he made an appearance via video before a judge. Dressed in medieval costume, Girouard allegedly attacked multiple people, resulting in two fatalities and leaving five others injured. The city’s police, Service de police de la Ville de Québec, named the two victims as François Duchesne, 56, and Suzanne Clermont, 61.The stabbing spree occurred in the historic district of Quebec City, and according to Radio-Canada, police were first notified at about 10.30 pm local time on Saturday night, and launched a manhunt, finally captured him at around 1 am on Sunday.Police said there was no terror connection to the attacks, and that “he chose his victims at random” and came to Quebec City “with the intention of doing the most damage possible.”He used a Japanese katana sword for the attacks which took place at four locations in the city.According to the police, while Girouard did not have a criminal record, he had come to their notice five years earlier for wanting to allegedly commit a violent act.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his shock over the incident in a statement issued by his office. “We wish a full recovery to those who have been injured. We are keeping you in our thoughts. On behalf of the Government of Canada, we will always be there for you,” he said.“I would also like to thank first responders for their crucial work. They responded quickly to this tragedy and were there to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens.”Girouard is expected back in court on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-stabbing-attack-suspect-who-killed-two-people-identified-charged-with-murder/story-JULEGTURLLI3ITtzIaVv9N.html
02-11-2020||World||Pakistan dismisses India’s strong opposition to its moves in Gilgit-Baltistan||Pakistan, whose prime minister has officially declared a “provisional provincial status” to Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), has rejected India’s assertion that Islamabad did not have any locus standi to bring such material changes to the region, which is part of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.In a statement issued on Sunday, the Pakistan foreign office said it categorically rejected the Indian ministry of external affairs’ “irresponsible and unwarranted statement” regarding GB.India had firmly rejected the attempt by Pakistan “to bring material changes to a part of Indian territory under its illegal and forcible occupation,” after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan declared the provisional provincial status to GB, carved out from the former occupied Northern Areas.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said on Sunday that the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, “including the area of so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’, are an integral part of India by virtue of the legal, complete and irrevocable accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Union of India in 1947.”“The government of Pakistan has no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied by it,” he said. Attempts by Pakistan to “camouflage its illegal occupation cannot hide the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom for over seven decades to the people residing in these Pakistan-occupied territories”, Srivastava added. In its statement, the Pakistan foreign ministry claimed that India has no locus standi whatsoever on the issue — legal, moral or historical. “For more than 73 years, India has been in illegal and forcible occupation of parts of Jammu and Kashmir. Regurgitation of false and fabricated claims by India can neither change the facts nor divert attention from India’s illegal actions and continuing humanitarian crisis resulting from perpetration of the worst human rights violations” in Kashmir, it said.“Pakistan’s position on the Jammu & Kashmir dispute remains firmly anchored in the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions. The final resolution of the Jammu & Kashmir dispute is only possible through the exercise of the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination by holding free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations.”It said the so-called provisional reforms in GB reflect the aspirations of its indigenous populace, adding that administrative, political and economic reforms are their long-standing demand.“Pakistan calls upon India to immediately end its illegal and forcible occupation of parts of Jammu & Kashmir and comply with its international obligations by allowing the Kashmiris to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination through a free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations as enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” the statement said.The Pakistan government plans to make GB its fifth province, conduct elections there in mid-November, and send representatives to both houses of Parliament. Khan’s ruling party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, hopes to boost its numbers from the elections in GB. The move has the support of Pakistan’s military leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-dismisses-india-s-strong-opposition-to-its-moves-in-gilgit-baltistan/story-X73i4Sa5JmdbGFYQFhPWQN.html

He is the first openly gay person to hold the position. He also retains the finance portfolio, Al Jazeera reported.Women and the Maori community were also strongly represented in the 20-member Cabinet, including new Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta, who has a “moko kauae” - a traditional Maori tattoo on her chin. Ardern has revamped her ministerial line-up in the wake of a landslide election victory in October.“The next three years will be very challenging for New Zealand,” she told reporters in Wellington. “With the global outlook worsening, we won’t be immune to the ongoing effect Covid-19 is having around the world.”Taking pride in her Cabinet’s diversity, Ardern added appointments were made on merit.“It is both a Cabinet with huge merit and talent and which is incredibly diverse,” the 40-year-old said.“I think it’s an important point to make - these are individuals who have been promoted for what they bring to the Cabinet, they also reflect the New Zealand that elected them. I think as a country we should be proud of this,” she said.Prime Minister Ardern is now set to serve a second term. With 87 per cent of the votes counted, Ardern’s centre-left Labour Party has won 48.9 per cent of the vote, meaning her party looks likely to score the highest result that any party has achieved since the current political system was introduced in 1996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jacinda-ardern-unveils-incredibly-diverse-cabinet/story-4YSsHFH56OOodioXR2ZJSM.html

At the same time, he indicated that his team is gearing up for a legal battle on the election night itself.“I think it is a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election. I think it is a terrible thing when people or states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over because it can only lead to one thing,” Trump said.“We are going in the night of -- as soon as the election is over -- we are going in with our lawyers,” he said as he criticised the decision taken by the Supreme Court to allow ballots to be received after Election Day in several battleground states.Click here for complete coverage of US Election 2020“I think there is a great danger to it and I think a lot of fraud and misuse can take place,” the president said. “I think it is a very dangerous, terrible thing. And I think it is terrible when we cannot know the results of an election the night of the election in a modern-day age of computers. I think it is a terrible thing,” he added.Critical of the Supreme Court decision, Trump said: “I think it is a very dangerous decision because you are going to have one or two or three states, depending on how it ends up, where they are tabulating ballots, and the rest of the world is waiting to find out. And I think there is a great danger to it, and I think a lot of fraud and misuse could take place.” Trump said if people wanted to get their ballots in, they should have gotten their ballots in long before. “They do not have to put their ballots in the same day, they could have put their ballots in a month ago. And we think it is a ridiculous decision,” he said. The president said he is doing well in the election. “We have great crowds. The first two were extremely cold. But they are great people, so that warmed it up,” he said.“We are doing tremendous numbers. Florida is doing very well. Ohio, as you heard, is doing phenomenally well. I think we are ahead in Ohio from four years ago, and we won by eight. If you look at North Carolina, we are doing great. I think we are doing well all over,” he asserted.“Georgia...is in our camp all the way. Texas is beyond good. We seem to be doing well all over. And that is not based on polls, that is based on numbers based on early ballots. So we are very happy with it. I think Michigan is plus-two, it just came out. We are plus-two in Michigan.

William, grandson of Queen Elizabeth and second-in-line to the British throne, kept his diagnosis a secret because he did not want to alarm the country, The Sun newspaper reported.“There were important things going on and I didn’t want to worry anyone,” William was quoted by the newspaper as having told an observer at an engagement.He was treated by palace doctors and followed government guidelines by isolating at the family home Anmer Hall, in Norfolk, the newspaper said, adding he still carried out 14 telephone and video call engagements during April.“William was hit pretty hard by the virus - it really knocked him for six. At one stage he was struggling to breathe, so obviously everyone around him was pretty panicked,” a source told The Sun.The BBC also confirmed the news from sources late on Sunday, with Kensington Palace and the office of Prince William refusing to comment officially to the news outlet. The palace was not immediately available for comment late on Sunday. The residence of William’s father, Prince Charles, had said on March 25 that Charles tested positive for the coronavirus. The heir to the throne had self-isolated at his residence in Scotland for seven days with mild symptoms.Britain has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak and has reported 46,717 Covid-19 deaths - defined as those dying within 28 days of a positive test.

She is the former attorney general of California and was the junior senator from California at the US Senate for two terms.Also Read | US Presidential Election 2020: Who will it be, America?Here’s how America votesThe processThe Constitution of the United States of America mandates that the president be elected by an electoral college currently comprising 538 members or electors. Electors are nominated by the state’s party committees; the number is determined by the strength of a state’s House of Representatives and Senates. The electors usually follow a winner-takes-all system, voting for whichever candidate has won the popular vote in their state.Does popular vote count?The presidential candidate who wins the popular vote in the state picks up all the state’s electors except in Maine and Nebraska, which allow their electoral vote to be split. The candidate with 270 or more electoral votes wins. Winning the popular vote nationally is not enough — Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million in 2016, but Donald Trump got more electoral votes.Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic...More than a third of all eligible voters (including President Trump) have already cast their ballot in person, and via mail in a record-setting early voting turnout.Besides presidential elections...Americans will also vote to elect 435 members of the House of Representatives, 33 members of the senate (a third of the 100 seats of the upper chamber are up for election every election cycle), 11 state governors (and two of US Territories), and members of 86 state legislative chambers (lower and upper chambers) on November 3.Cost of the electionThe 2020 elections to the White House, House of Representatives are expected to cost an estimated $14 billion — a record. This includes money spent by candidates, parties and outside bodies and does not include expenses incurred by state governments. Joe Biden could become the first presidential nominee to raise $1 billion, or more.ResultsThey may take longer to be announced this time because of the sheer volume of mailed-in ballots. Some states will begin counting their mail-in ballot before election day, some will start on election day, some will wait till the close of polling.The main issues this electionCovid-19Biden has made the Trump administration’s response to the epidemic the centre of his campaign.

02-11-2020||World||China’s Xi wants to diversify supply chains amid US curbs||Chinese President Xi Jinping called for setting up independent and controllable supply chains to ensure industrial and national security, just as the U.S. moves to cut China off from key exports.“We must strive to have at least one alternative source for key products and supply channels, to create a necessary industrial backup system,” Xi said in an April speech on the nation’s economic development that was only published Saturday by the Qiushi Journal, a publication of the ruling Communist Party. The magazine didn’t say why it had waited to release the remarks.Xi said the impact of the coronavirus epidemic exposed hidden risks in China’s industrial and supply chains, without elaborating, thus necessitating “independent, controllable, safe, and reliable” chains.Beijing last week outlined strategies for greater self-sufficiency as it unveiled its five-year economic plan after a plenum of top leaders and as tensions with the U.S. intensify. The U.S. has pressured allies to shun equipment from Huawei Technologies Co., barred dozens of China’s largest tech companies from buying American parts, and even slapped bans on ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat.Initial details of the five-year plan stressed the need for sustainable growth and also pledged to develop a robust domestic market. Officials didn’t specify the pace of growth they would seek over the period, but said the National Development and Reform Commission would work on guidelines to be submitted to country’s parliament in March.Xi’s April speech called for strengthening China’s advantages, saying its strong position in international industrial chains could act as a deterrence for external parties to cut off supply. He also called for China to consolidate its role as a global leader in the digital economy, and actively participate in formulating international rules in digital currency and digital tax to create new competitive advantages.Xi emphasized the role of state-owned enterprises -- a sticking point in trade negotiations with the U.S. -- calling them “an important pillar and support for national rejuvenation and for the party to govern.” He said SOEs must be “stronger, better, and bigger,” but that they also needed reform, without specifying.The speech also touched on expanding domestic demand, improving urbanization strategies, optimizing technology resources, and prioritizing the environment and public health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-xi-wants-to-diversify-supply-chains-amid-us-curbs/story-lmblJ8vYkcy3bO4Xh4FduL.html
02-11-2020||World||Pakistan considering treason case against PML-N leader over remarks on release of Abhinandan||The Pakistan government is mulling over registering a treason case against a senior Opposition leader for his controversial statement that the country handed over captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman to India under pressure, a top minister has said. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Wednesday said that “legs were shaking and forehead perspiring” at a meeting of Pakistan’s top leaders, including Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, wherein Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi pleaded to release Wing Commander Abhinandan, saying if he was not released, India would attack Pakistan. “Legs were shaking and forehead perspiring, and the foreign minister (Qureshi) told us, ‘For God’s sake, let him (Varthaman) go back now because India is attacking Pakistan at 9 PM in the night’,” Sadiq said, recalling the meeting which was also attended by parliamentary leaders, including those from Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and PML-N, and added that “India was not planning to attack...They just wanted to kneel before India and send back Abhinandan.” Responding to Sadiq’s remarks, Pakistan Interior Minister Ejaz Shah told reporters that the government was pondering over registering a treason case against Sadiq as police have received a number of complaints against him. He said those toeing the line of India should better go to Amritsar. Posters of Sadiq have also appeared in Lahore, dubbing him a “traitor”. A number of posters and banners with pictures of Wing Commander Abhinandan and Sadiq were displayed in the constituency of the former National Assembly Speaker. Portraying Sadiq in Abhinandan’s getup, the posters read: “Mir Sadiq, Mir Jaffar... Ayaz Sadiq.” The PML-N has strongly reacted to the move blaming the PTI government for ‘awarding traitor certificates’ to its political opponents. PML-N Punjab information secretary lawmaker Azma Bokhari said the one who put up “traitor” posters of Sadiq must be having a criminal record like in the past cases registered against the PML-N leadership. The 37-year-old Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during aerial combat. In the early hours of February 26, 2019, the IAF jets bombed the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camps in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan and avenged the Pulwama terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel. Before his jet was hit, Abhinandan downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan. He was released on the night of March 1 by Pakistan. In a speech in the National Assembly, Sadiq said that Prime Minister Imran Khan skipped the high-level meeting, which was attended by top leadership, including Army chief Gen Bajwa and Foreign Minister Qureshi.

02-11-2020||World||Vaccinationalism will prolong pandemic: Andrea D. Taylor of Global Health Innovation Center||High-income and a few middle-income countries with vaccine production capacity such as India and Brazil have pre-ordered nearly 3.8 billion doses, and are negotiating options for five billion more for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to an analysis released by the United States (US)-based Duke Global Health Innovation Center.India has pre-ordered 600 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine, with another 1 billion doses under negotiation. India is second only to the US, which has pre-ordered 810 million and another 1.6 billion doses under negotiation.This “vaccinationalism” will lead to some countries being able to vaccinate their entire populations — and some many times over— while denying low-resource regions such as sub-Saharan Africa access to Covid-19 protection until 2024, said Andrea D. Taylor, the assistant director of programs at Global Health Innovation Center, Duke University, who led the analysis.Excerpts from the interview:What is the global annual manufacturing capacity for Covid-19 vaccines? This is unknown. What we do know is that capacity is dynamic and changes depend on a number of variables. Additional investments can open up more manufacturing capacity in three different ways: reserving capacity with existing vaccine manufacturers such as the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations,(CEPI) has recently done, building new manufacturing capacity as the United Kingdom (UK) and many countries are doing, and retrofitting pharmaceutical manufacturing centres that produce therapeutics to be able to produce Covid-19 vaccines. The manufacturing capacity is not set in stone and we can indeed expand it to some degree with targeted investment.How many people can get vaccinated by June 2021, assuming we need two doses for each person?There are too many unknowns to answer this question. None of the current vaccine candidates are through the regulatory process yet. There is some hope that at least one or two vaccines will be approved and start to ship by March 2021, but again, we do not know what will happen. Some manufacturers, including the Serum Institute of India (SII), are manufacturing and stockpiling doses of leading vaccine candidates in a bid to have a jump start if the candidates are approved. This will help to ensure that millions of doses are ready to go if the vaccines do receive approval.How have some nations managed to pre-order COVID-19 vaccines before others?Our analysis indicates that there are four factors that have allowed countries to secure pre-orders of Covid-19 vaccines: capacity for vaccine development in-country, capacity for vaccine manufacturing in-country, large investment of public dollars into the development vaccines, and purchasing power to make large orders that assume some level of risk, given that the product is not yet approved. Primarily, it is the high-income countries that have most or all of these factors and have been able to secure enough doses to cover their entire populations and in some cases several times over. There have been some middle-income countries, including India, that are able to leverage their vaccine development and manufacturing capacity to secure pre-orders. Some other middle-income countries that do not have any of these factors have been able to support clinical trials and use that to leverage purchase deals. But our analysis shows that low-income countries have not been able to make any pre-orders and are losing out.Also read | Public participation a must to contain infection spreadWhich countries are the worst offenders? In terms of numbers of confirmed doses, the US has pre-ordered the largest number at 810 million confirmed, with another 1.6 billion doses under negotiation, followed by India at 600 million doses confirmed, with another 1 billion doses under negotiation, and the European Union (EU) at 400 million doses confirmed, with another 1.565 billion doses under negotiation. But in terms of per cent of population covered by confirmed purchases, Canada has pre-purchased enough vaccine to cover 527% of their population, followed by the UK at 277%. Of course, it is important to remember that mostly likely only some of the vaccines purchases will come through, depending on regulatory approval.How will Advanced Market Commitments (AMCs) set back access to vaccines in less and least developed nations? What will be the size of the global population denied access to vaccination?We do not have the data to predict this, as the landscape is changing almost daily. What we do know is that, because of manufacturing constraints, AMCs reduce the number of doses available to partnerships like Covax that are committed to equitable access for the least developed nations. As a manufacturing powerhouse, India will play a critical role in ensuring that low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) do have access to the vaccine. India’s stated commitment to prioritising distribution not only within India but also to neighbouring LMICs is very important.Do you have projections of morbidity and mortality as a result of equitable access to vaccines? We do not have any data on this. Our study does not project morbidity and mortality. We may look at that in the future.Can the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Covax Facility ensure equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines?Yes, the Covax facility is our best opportunity to ensure global access for three reasons. First, it mitigates risk by investing in a portfolio of vaccine candidates to maximise the likelihood of having one or more succeed through the regulatory process. Countries are doing this individually, but it is generally only high-income countries that can afford large orders of multiple vaccines. For the rest of the world, Covax’s portfolio approach is critical.Second, the Covax Facility, through partners CEPI and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) can reserve manufacturing capacity globally without tying it directly to a specific vaccine, ensuring that there will be capacity to ramp up production once a winner is identified.Third, and this is most critical for equitable access, Covax can function as an air traffic controller, ensuring that vaccines ship out to all countries at the same time, rather than the first doses to the highest bidder. Through Covax’s coordination, all participating countries can receive initial doses to vaccinate frontline workers at the same time. There is no global coordination of distribution, as doses become available, without Covax. Given that many countries are acting in national interest, what is the way forward to stop the spread of Covid-19?It is understandable that countries are acting in their national interest; they are incentivised to focus first on the safety of their populations. But globally, this leads to a pattern of behaviour that will leave some countries with little to nothing, deepen existing inequities, and prolong the pandemic. Our research points to the need for countries and multilateral funders to unlock additional manufacturing capacity, particularly in the Global South, and invest in preparing countries for effective distribution of vaccines. High-income countries should also work with Covax, as a global coordinator, to ensure that, once their populations are covered, excess doses are redeployed where they are needed most around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinationalism-will-prolong-pandemic-andrea-d-taylor-of-global-health-innovation-center/story-QJst27YNJ93DHdG3PHH0zO.html

Vaccine candidates of several companies are at various stages of trials meaning that it might take some more time before the world eventually gets its first shot against Covid-19.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe pandemic, meanwhile, continues to surge across Europe, after a brief lull in cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom has announced a new four-week lockdown in England, which will come into effect from Thursday. Also, the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Sunday he had been identified as a contact of someone who tested positive for Covid-19.Read: UK’s Johnson says there is no alternative to lockdownHere are the latest updates on a potential Covid-19 vaccine:1. India’s Bharat Biotech International Limited on Sunday said it is planning to launch its vaccine candidate in the second quarter of 2021, after getting approval from regulatory authorities. The Hyderabad-based company said it plans to conduct recruitment and dosage for the third phase of its vaccine trials in November. Sai Prasad, Bharat Biotech’s executive director, said the trial will take place in 25 sites across 10-12 states in the country. During the trials, two doses each for the vaccine and placebo recipients will be provided.Read: WHO chief says he is identified as contact of Covid-19 positive person2. A global study has said India has used its manufacturing capabilities to pre-order 600 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine and is negotiating for another billion. The doses, says the study, are enough to vaccinate at least half the population. Only the United States, which has the highest number of cases, has pre-ordered more doses--810 million-- than the second worst-hit India. Most experimental Covid-19 vaccines require two doses.Read: Global study sees India having edge in Covid-19 vaccines3. Israel has started human trials for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, with 80 volunteers participating in the initial phase. The number of volunteers will be expanded to 960 by December. If the first two phases are successful, a third phase will be launched in April/May 2021 with 30,000 volunteers. If these trials are successful, the vaccine will be ready for the general public by the end of next summer.(4.) 4. AstraZeneca Inc, which is among the companies testing a vaccine candidate, has said Britain’s health regulator has started an ‘accelerated’ review of its potential vaccine. AstraZeneca is working on the vaccine along with the University of Oxford and their vaccine candidate is called ‘AZD1222’ or ‘ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.’ In an ‘accelerated’ review, also called a ‘rolling’ review, regulators can view clinical data in real-time and talk to drug makers on the manufacturing process and trials to accelerate the approval process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-bharat-biotech-to-launch-candidate-in-q2-2021-israel-starts-human-trials/story-QQWn3o8pBlnVHhIMzEBnTN.html
02-11-2020||World||‘I never lost hope’: 70-year-old pulled out alive in Turkey as earthquake toll hits 75||Rescue workers in western Turkey extricated a 70-year-old man from a collapsed building Sunday, some 34 hours after a strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea struck Turkey and Greece, killing at least 75 people and injuring close to 1,000.The man was pulled out of the rubble overnight and doing well at a hospital, according to the Turkish health minister. The minister tweeted that the survivor, Ahmet Citim, told him, “I never lost hope.” The operation that saved Citim was the latest in a series of remarkable rescues after the Friday afternoon earthquake.But on the third day since the disaster, search-and-rescue teams appeared to be finding more bodies than survivors in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city. They continued searching in eight toppled buildings, but work was paused at one when authorities determined the damaged structure next door was also at risk of falling, forcing rescuers and people waiting outside to retreat.The earthquake was centered in the Aegean northeast of the Greek island of Samos. Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) raised the death toll Sunday in Izmir province to 73. The agency said 961 people were injured in Turkey, with more than 220 still receiving treatment Sunday.The earthquake also killed two teenagers on Samos and injured at least 19 other people on the island.There was some debate over the magnitude of the earthquake. The US Geological Survey rated it 7.0, while the Istanbul’s Kandilli Institute put it at 6.9 and AFAD said it measured 6.6.The quake triggered a small tsunami that hit Samos and the Seferihisar district of Izmir, drowning one elderly woman. The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Hundreds of aftershocks followed.Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said 26 badly damaged buildings would be demolished in Izmir.“It’s not the earthquake that kills but buildings,” he added, repeating a common slogan.Turkey has a mix of older buildings and cheap or illegal construction, which can lead to serious damage and deaths when earthquakes hit. Regulations have been tightened in light of earthquakes to strengthen or demolish buildings and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities but it is not happening fast enough.Two destroyed apartment buildings in Izmir where much of the rescues are taking place had received reports of “decay” in 2012 and 2018, according to the municipal agency in charge of such certificates. Turkish media including the Hurriyet newspaper said one of the apartments, which was built in 1993, was at risk of earthquake damage because of its low quality concrete and the lack of reinforcements. However, the building continued to be occupied.A 73-year-old survivor from one of those buildings said she was on her third-floor balcony when the quake struck and believes there were at least 50 people in the building, which also had a café on the bottom floor.“In the first tremor nothing happened. During the second tremor, the seventh floor, sixth and fourth floors fell on top of another like a sandwich,” Suzan Dere said. “The building collapsed in a cloud of dust onto the street with a very loud noise. It all happened within one minute.”Turkey’s justice minister said prosecutors have begun investigating several collapsed buildings and promised legal repercussions if experts identified neglect.AFAD said nearly 6,400 personnel had been activated for rescue work and hundreds of others for food distribution, emergency help and building damage control.Turkey is crisscrossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well.In a rare show of unity amid months of tense relations over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean, Greek and Turkish government officials issued mutual messages of solidarity over the quake toll.Pope Francis on Sunday asked the faithful to pray for the people of the Aegean Sea.The quake occurred as Turkey was already struggling with an economic downturn and the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Turkey has more than 10,000 confirmed virus deaths but some experts have accused the government of concealing the true impact of the virus with the way it counts new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-never-lost-hope-70-year-old-pulled-out-alive-in-turkey-as-earthquake-toll-hits-75/story-eRHh5VfAOGyoAv9LIiXYzM.html

The Texas Tribune newspaper reported that the sideswiped vehicle was being driven by a Biden campaign staffer.According to the Biden campaign, staff aboard the bus called emergency-911 to report the incident, and local law enforcement responded to the calls and assisted the bus in reaching its destination.Neither Biden nor his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris, was aboard the bus. The Texas Tribune reported that its passengers included Democratic U.S. House of Representatives candidate and former Texas state Senator Wendy Davis.“FBI San Antonio is aware of the incident and investigating,” special agent Michelle Lee, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Antonio, told Reuters in an email. “No further information is available at this time.”Close race in Texas The highway confrontation came as polls showed an unexpectedly tight race between Biden and Trump in Texas, which has long been a Republican stronghold.“Rather than engage in productive conversation about the drastically different visions that Joe Biden and Donald Trump have for our country, Trump supporters in Texas instead decided to put our staff, surrogates, supporters and others in harm’s way,” Biden’s Texas campaign spokesman, Tariq Thowfeek, said in a statement. “We’ll see you on November 3rd.”Texas Republican Party Chairman Allen West, in a statement, dismissed media reports of the incident as “more fake news and propaganda,” adding: “Prepare to lose ... stop bothering me.”Speaking about the Texas bus incident on the campaign trail on Sunday in Philadelphia, Biden called Trump’s endorsement of such actions abnormal and divisive, saying: “We’ve never had anything like this. At least we’ve never had a president who thinks it’s a good thing.”Commenting during a campaign stop of his own in Michigan on Sunday, Trump said: “Did you see our people yesterday? They were protecting his bus.”Texas was not the only place where “Trump trains” of supporters forming vehicle convoys have caused consternation. Video footage on social media on Sunday showed vehicles flying pro-Trump flags blocking traffic on the Whitestone Bridge over the East River in New York City’s Bronx borough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-probing-donald-trump-caravan-confrontation-with-joe-biden-campaign-bus-in-texas/story-ogeIq8Lk21zrDf3l9BXSqM.html

Scientists have warned a worst-case scenario of 80,000 dead could be exceeded this winter.“Models of our scientists suggest that unless we act now, we could see deaths over the winter that are twice as bad or more compared with the first wave,” Johnson is expected to say, according to his office.“Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level.”Britain has reported 46,717 Covid-19 deaths - defined as those dying within 28 days of a positive test. A broader measure of those with Covid-19 on their death certificates puts the toll at 58,925.Essential shops, schools, and universities in England will remain open but pubs and restaurants will be shut apart from for takeaways. Outbound international travel will be discouraged except for work and non-essential retail will close.Lawmakers will vote on these measures on Wednesday and the opposition Labour Party has offered its support.The rest of the United Kingdom - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have their own lockdown policies and enacted tougher health restrictions last month.Cabinet minister Michael Gove on Sunday said England’s lockdown could be extended beyond December 2 if necessary, but Johnson will tell lawmakers that an extension is not the plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-johnson-says-there-is-no-alternative-to-lockdown/story-4sgOJGlUySl7tQ8noVX2JJ.html

Topping the list of Indian Americans are well known community leaders Swadesh Chatterjee, Rameshk Kapoor, Shekar N Narasimhan, R Rangaswami, Ajay Jain Bhutoria, and Frank Islam.Among other prominent Indian American bundlers are Neil Makhija, Rahu, Prakash, Deepak Raj, Raj Shah, Rajan Shah, Radhika Shah, Jill and Raj Singh, Nidhi Thakar, Kiran Jain, Sony Kalsi, and Bela Bajaria.Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has also been listed as a bundler. Given that the list of bundlers includes all those who have raised more than USD 100,000, the number of Indian Americans in far less than those of former presidents Barack Obama and Bil Clinton campaigns. Some of the traditional Indian-American Democratic donors like hotelier Sant Chatwal are missing from the list.According to The Wall Street Journal, the list of “bundlers” includes a who’s who of Democratic politics, including former and current governors, Senators, Cabinet secretaries and big names from Hollywood.Film producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, writer and director Lee Daniels, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; media mogul Haim Saban and former US Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker are on the list, the daily said.According to CNN, Biden is on track to become the first presidential candidate to raise USD 1 billion from donors in a two-year cycle, and he entered the final sprint to Election Day with a big cash advantage over US President Donald Trump.In August and September alone, Biden raised more than USD 700 million.

Top US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci said the US “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” to stem rising cases. He told the Washington Post he believed Biden “is taking it seriously from a public health perspective,” while Trump is “looking at it from a different perspective.” As England goes into coronavirus Lockdown 2 from Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson called in the army to help with a massive testing drive. AstraZeneca said on Sunday UK’s health regulator had started an accelerated review of its potential vaccine.

02-11-2020||World||Police fire warning shots as thousands protest in Belarus||Thousands of protesters in Belarus swarmed the streets of the capital to demand the resignation of the country’s longtime president for the 12th straight Sunday and encountered police firing warning shots in the air and using stun grenades to break up the crowds.As many as 20,000 people took part in the rally, the Visana human rights center estimated. Large crowds of people gathered in the eastern part of Minsk headed toward Kurapaty, a wooded area on the city’s outskirts where over 200,000 people were executed by Soviet secret police during Stalinist-era purges.Demonstrators carried banners reading, “The people’s memory (lasts) longer than a life of a dictatorship” and “Stop torturing your people!” The crowds directed chants of “Go away!” at Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who won his sixth term in an August 9 election that is widely seen as rigged. Lukashenko’s crushing victory over his popular, inexperienced challenger, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, has triggered the largest and the most sustained wave of mass protests of his 26 years in power.The 66-year-old former state farm director, who was once nicknamed “Europe’s Latest Dictator,” has relentlessly suppressed opposition and independent media in Belarus but struggled to quell the recent unrest. Large protest crowds have assembled in the streets of Minsk and other cities almost daily, despite police countering the demonstrations with water cannons, stun grenades, rubber bullets and mass detentions.The Belarusian Interior Ministry threatened to use firearms against the rally-goers “if need be.” On Sunday, police acknowledged officers fired several warning shots into the air during the demonstration in Minsk “to prevent violations of the law.” Armoured off-road vehicles equipped with machine guns were seen in Minsk for the first time in almost three months, along with water cannon vehicles and other anti-riot equipment. Several metro stations were closed, and mobile internet service did not work.Police detained over 150 people in Minsk and other Belarusian cities where protests were held Sunday, according to the Viasna center. Several journalists were among the detainees, and many of those detained were beaten up, human rights activists said.“The authorities are trying to close the lid on the boiling Belarusian pot more tightly, but history knows very well what this leads to,” Viasna leader Ales Bialiatski said.Tsikhanouskaya entered the presidential race instead of her husband, a popular opposition blogger, after he was jailed in May,. SHe challenged the results of the election in which she secured 10% of the vote to the incumbent president’s 80%, then left Belarus for Lithuania under pressure from the authorities.She issued a statement Sunday in support of the ongoing protests.“The terror is happening once again in our country right now,” Tsikhanouskaya said. “We haven’t forgotten our past, we won’t forget what is happening now.” Over 15,000 people have been detained since the presidential election, and human rights activists have declared more than 100 of them to be political prisoners.All prominent members of the opposition’s Coordination Council, which was formed to push for a transition of power, have either been jailed or forced to leave the country.Lukashenko scoffed at suggestions of dialogue with the opposition and instead intensified the crackdown on protesters, ordering officials to expel students from universities for participating in demonstrations and to take action against plant workers that go on strike.On Thursday, the government shut Belarus’ borders with Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine, They said the move was intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, although officials previously accused neighbouring countries of trying to destabilize Belarus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-fire-warning-shots-as-thousands-protest-in-belarus/story-kek3uVywgxqb1dMtYcKlGM.html
02-11-2020||World||Canada deputy PM self-isolates after contact with Covid-positive person||Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland has gone into self-isolation after a person she came into contact with tested positive for the coronavirus.Freeland is the first high-profile Canadian to have quarantined after receiving a notification on the Covid app launched by the government.She made the announcement on Twitter, saying, “Today, I had a COVID-19 test after I received a notification from the COVID Alert App. I am self-isolating at home while I wait for the results of the test.”Freeland, who is an MP from Toronto, also handles the critical finance portfolio after her predecessor Bill Morneau quit the cabinet recently after becoming embroiled in a controversy related to the grant of a nearly billion-dollar contract to a charity to which he and his family, as well as that of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has close links.Freeland is the latest among major Canadian leaders to have been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. In September, leaders of the two principal Opposition parties in Canada’s Parliament, Erin O’Toole of the Conservatives, and Yves-François Blanchet of the Bloc Québécois, went into self-isolation after testing positive for the virus. Both recovered and returned to the House of Commons session.In mid-March, as the pandemic first started making its presence felt in Canada, Trudeau also went into self-isolation for several weeks after his wife Sophie Gregoire was infected during an event in London.The government has faced criticism in recent days as the second wave of the pandemic has exposed the lack of an efficient and timely testing protocol, with results often delayed, as well as the low uptake of the app. While about five million persons have so far downloaded the app, a couple of provinces have yet to adopt it citing shortcomings in how it works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-deputy-pm-self-isolates-after-contact-with-covid-positive-person/story-xGUvVc0gC8zlw0VqjA5iSM.html
