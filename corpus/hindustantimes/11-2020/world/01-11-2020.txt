President Trump’s campaign had raised $596mn by the same date.The 2020 elections to the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives are expected to be most expensive yet, with total spending estimated to be around $14 bn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-fund-raising-indian-americans-among-bundlers-for-biden/story-77Q70tf2KgLT0gINgdXMyO.html
01-11-2020||World||For Donald Trump’s government immigration, visa agency frauds are key focus||The head of the agency handling citizenship and visa applications was surprised when he faced blowback for cutting a reference to the US being a “nation of immigrants” in its mission statement. The son of a Peruvian immigrant added language about “protecting Americans” instead.L. Francis Cissna argued that America is indisputably a nation of immigrants but that US Citizenship and Immigration Services’ mission statement wasn’t the place to say so. Joseph Edlow, who now oversees the agency, said he hasn’t thought about the 2018 kerfuffle, but it crystallized for many how the Trump administration has changed the government’s approach to legal immigration.USCIS, established with the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, is emphasizing fraud detection, enforcement and vetting those seeking to work, live or become US citizens. Applicants, attorneys and employees call it overkill, while immigration critics say it’s overdue. New Trump administration rules range from making asylum protections more difficult to get to disqualifying more low-income applicants from green cards.Processing times are longer, and the agency’s backlog of cases stands at 5 million. Making it tougher to get permission to live and work in America has had consequences for USCIS itself: its roughly $5 billion annual budget is funded almost entirely by application fees, which have dwindled with the stricter rules. Financial pressures mounted this summer as USCIS narrowly averted furloughs for 70% of its roughly 20,000 employees.Curbing legal immigration has been a priority for President Donald Trump as he’s reshaped the immigration system, arguably more than any predecessor. He’s thrilled supporters with an “America first” message and infuriated critics who call his signature domestic issue insular, xenophobic and even racist.Before the election, The Associated Press is examining several Trump immigration policies, including r estrictions on international students, a retreat from America’s humanitarian role, a virtual shutdown of asylum and now curbing legal immigration.Trump failed to get Congress to support cuts to the system of immigrants bringing over relatives, but Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, said moving to a more “merit based” system, based on skills, would be a priority if the president is reelected.Democrat Joe Biden offers a sharp contrast: preserve family-based immigration and “streamline” naturalization for green-card holders. He wants a path to citizenship for about 11 million people in the US illegally, which would require congressional support.Miller told the AP that USCIS was plagued by a “huge amount of fraud” and its workforce “came to see itself as a representative of the benefit-seeker rather than the representative of the American people.”“This administration has undertaken a thorough revamping of the agency to restore its congressional mission of ensuring that benefits are only awarded to those who are genuinely eligible under law and that, ensuring in admitting them, no harm is done to our economic or national security interests,” he said.Some critics say USCIS hasn’t provided enough evidence of widespread fraud. Even Louis D. Crocetti Jr., first director of USCIS’ anti-fraud unit who supports Trump’s policies and calls fraud common, says the agency should release more findings.“If you don’t do that, how can you really justify getting the millions of dollars and continuing your operation?” said Crocetti, who retired in 2011.The changes are evident in USCIS offices. Workers who decide on citizenship and permanent residency applications in the San Diego office saw their workload grow about 20% when officials ordered all applicants for employment-based green cards be interviewed.Edlow said the blanket interview requirement has been scrapped and whether such applicants are called in depends on the case.Workers are preparing for Trump’s rule that dramatically expands criteria for denying green cards to those receiving taxpayer-funded benefits. The US Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 vote in January that the policy could take effect, but the coronavirus put it on hold until September.Processing times for employment-based green cards jumped to 14.5 months in an 11-month period ending Aug. 31, up from 6.8 months in the 2016 fiscal year. For citizenship, it rose to 9.1 months from 5.6 months.An analysis of all visa categories by the American Immigration Lawyers Association found long waits doubled to 10 months in the 2019 fiscal year from five years earlier.Natividad Rodriguez, 85, has been waiting since July 2019 for a citizenship interview, the final step before the oath. The Chicago woman and Mexican native had hoped to vote this year.“We have been waiting a long time,” said daughter Ana Maria Fuentes, who helped her mother apply. “It’s too much time.”In their defense, administration officials note they approved more than 800,000 citizenship applications in fiscal 2019, the highest since 2008.But the administration also is trying to reduce applications. For example, USCIS last year started requiring that no spaces on forms be left blank, even if a question doesn’t apply, like a middle name. Agency officials say employees were taking too much time filling in incomplete applications.Blank spaces have led to rejections, attorneys say. An American Immigration Lawyers Association survey this year found nearly 200 examples nationwide. Applications also were rejected for writing “none” or “not applicable” instead of “N/A,” which most instructions said to use.The administration checks up on those who clear the hurdles. On a recent afternoon, all cubicles in the anti-fraud wing of the USCIS San Diego office were empty because its nine investigators were knocking on visa-holders’ doors, including one who raised flags because the spouse was living in Georgia.Nationwide, anti-fraud unit staffing has roughly doubled to about 2,000 under Trump, from less than 1,000. The unit projects 249,335 requests to investigate fraud in fiscal 2021, up from 119,424 in 2016. Edlow says checking if people are “actually married when they say they are” or are working at the job they listed is “an investment in the safety and security of this country.”As costs from anti-fraud work rose, agency revenue took a hit after Trump ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields young people from deportation, and Temporary Protected Status, given to 400,000 people escaping natural disasters and civil strife.Fiscal challenges came to a head in May when USCIS threatened furloughs to tackle a projected $1.2 billion shortfall. The agency didn’t need the money, Edlow said, because application fees rebounded more than expected as offices reopened in June from coronavirus shutdowns and contracts were reviewed for cost savings.USCIS has been without a Senate-confirmed director since Cissna left in May 2019 in a purge of Homeland Security leaders. Attorneys have challenged the legitimacy of acting Homeland Security leaders in a bid to block new USCIS rules, with mixed results.A judge in September halted a 20% average increase in visa and citizenship fees, saying in part that two top Homeland Security officials were appointed illegally. Edlow, USCIS deputy director of policy, has been running operations since February.While some agency employees support the focus on increased vetting, others say some changes are unnecessary and may discourage people from seeking legal status.“Our job is to keep the doors open but safely secured. The way that it is being administered now, it doesn’t seem like the doors are open,” said Gary Thurman, an employee in Missouri speaking as vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3928 South.Edlow said he’s focused on better training and technology, including a transition to electronic files.“Is it going to happen overnight? No, it’s not,” Edlow said. “I do want to get back to a point where we’re flush with money.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-donald-trump-s-government-immigration-visa-agency-frauds-are-key-focus/story-x2Mlke6u33nv49etLkLmpK.html

Now Imran Khan wants to hand over GB’s tourism sector to his friends but we will not him do so,” he added.The party chairman also asked the people of Gilgit-Baltistan to come out in numbers on November to decide their future.Zardari made the statement on Saturday while addressing a corner meeting in Gahkoch area of Ghizar district.Central PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira, Senator Karim Khawaja, Pir Syed Jalal Shah, Amjad Hussain Advocate and, Dr Aleem Arshad were also present.Meanwhile, despite the ongoing protests against the Pakistan Government over its decision to change the status of Gilgit-Baltistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday announced the granting of provisional-provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan, Geo News reported.Massive protests have been taking place against the Imran Khan-led government over the issue of Gilgit Baltistan.“One of the reasons for me coming to Gilgit-Baltistan is to announce that we have decided to grant Gilgit-Baltistan the provisional provincial status,” Khan said while speaking during his visit to Gilgit-Baltistan.This comes following Saudi Arabia removing Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan from Pakistan’s map.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilgit-baltistan-will-overwhelmingly-vote-against-imran-khan-asserts-bilawal-bhutto-zardari/story-I8JPFrn1fYs0KoAAPYZDeL.html
01-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Cuba has a big stake in US election after Trump’s trashing of detente||Pensioner Esperanza Chacón, 89, prays every day for Donald Trump to lose the US presidential election. Like many Cubans, her livelihood has been threatened by Trump’s tightening of the US trade embargo on the Communist-run island. Chacon’s son in Miami sends her the equivalent of $60 to $100 a month, to supplement her state pension worth just $12, but the Trump administration’s latest Cuba sanction, unveiled last month, looks set to cut off remittances.“He’s ending my ability to live and feed myself, at this age!” said Chacon.“So I’m praying every day he doesn’t win the elections.” Cuba has more at stake in the upcoming US election than most countries in Latin America as the Trump administration has focused much of its foreign policy in the region on measures aimed, it says, at bringing about democracy in the country and its socialist ally Venezuela.Trump unraveled a detente with Cuba started by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, that had fostered remittances and travel to the Caribbean isle, as well as foreign investment and the private sector.The Republican president reverted instead to a decades-old US policy of choking the one-party state’s already inefficient state-run economy to force reform.Democratic challenger Joe Biden - the vice president during Obama’s attempts to engage with Cuba - has promised to promptly reverse Trump policies that “have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights.”“The US election results are enormously important for Cuba because they will make the difference between continuing Trump’s policy of trying to starve Cuba into submission and Biden’s policy of restarting engagement,” said William LeoGrande, a Cuba expert and professor of government at Washington’s American University. The Trump administration has dealt blows to tourism, foreign investment, and Cuba’s energy supply by tightening restrictions on US travel, sanctioning oil shipments from Venezuela and activating a law allowing litigation against firms “trafficking” in expropriated properties, among other measures.“Most the people who stayed at our bed and breakfast were Americans so reservations were down some 40 to 50 percent by the time the pandemic hit,” said Jesus Manuel Rivero. His Casa Flamboyan B&B ranks No. 1 in Havana on Tripadvisor. Washington has also attacked Cuba’s medical missions in a campaign that saw its allies ousting them, hitting the country’s top source of hard currency. Trump says the Cuban government traffics in the doctors, keeping them in slave-like conditions. Havana has strongly denied the allegation. All this has worsened Cuba’s cash crunch. The embargo cost it a record $5.6 billion over the last year, the government has said, and exacerbated shortages of even basic goods like food.Under Trump, the reduction of the US embassy in Havana to skeletal staffing and closure of the consular office after diplomats complained of a mysterious illness has also made it tough for Cubans to get visas to visit their family in the United States.A Biden presidency would likely not only reverse Trump’s policies but also resume dialogue on matters of mutual interest like health and security that had fizzled out of late, said Emily Mendrala, who coordinated congressional discussions on Cuba policy during a stint in Obama’s National Security Council and now runs the Centre for Democracy in the Americas.Cuban dissidents, meanwhile, are divided over the US election. Some hope for a Biden win, saying engagement deprives their government of an excuse for its economic woes or repression. Others, like Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the island’s largest opposition group, the Patriotic Union of Cuba, say that too much leniency toward the Cuban government as - in his view - under Obama emboldens it to crack down as it wishes.“Whoever wins the Nov. 3 elections must listen to the calls for freedom of the Cuban people and other oppressed peoples,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-cuba-has-a-big-stake-in-us-election-after-trump-s-trashing-of-detente/story-UIWA1QZrx2nZRHCqzqejsK.html
01-11-2020||World||In George Floyd’s hometown, a season of protest ends at the polls||Dexter Faircloth walked the streets of Houston’s Third Ward, the historic Black neighbourhood where he was born and raised, shouting greetings and asking an urgent question.“Y’all vote?! Did you?” Faircloth, 35, hollered repeatedly at people, who smiled when they recognized him as he canvassed the area last weekend.Faircloth, a corporate trainer, says he has always been an advocate for his community. But that role became more urgent when his friend and Third Ward native, African-American George Floyd, died in May after a white Minneapolis police knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.The summer’s simmering anger and demands for justice that Floyd’s death ignited have transformed into huge voter turnout for Black Americans in some parts of the country. That is especially true of the Third Ward, where hopes for change have energized many in the final days of the race between President Donald Trump, a Republican, and Democratic rival Joe Biden.Early voting at the Third Ward’s three polling stations is up more than 650% compared to 2016 figures, according to data from the Harris County Clerk’s Office.“Look, man. Voting is not the end-all-be-all. It’s just the start,” Faircloth said. “But we’re telling people: ‘If you want change, this is how you begin to change things.’“The Third Ward, a patchwork of old wooden homes, bodegas, and barber shops with hand-painted storefronts less than a mile from downtown Houston’s skyscrapers, houses some of the city’s crown jewels for African-American culture, including Texas Southern University. Floyd, who played college football and basketball, was a mentor to neighbourhood boys and encouraged them with his optimism, Faircloth recalls. Third Ward residents were enraged by the brutal manner in which Floyd died, which was captured on video by a bystander. “Seeing that video was almost as if we were watching slaves being beaten in real life,” Faircloth said. “Instead of whips, the weapons were a knee and a badge.”Third Ward residents who knew Floyd best marched daily, as Black Lives Matter protests spread across the globe. In Houston, they were joined by Police Chief Art Acevedo, who told Reuters he remembers Faircloth and other young Black leaders from the Third Ward helping maintain the peace during protests.Floyd’s death was a tragic reminder that policing is not where it should be, Acevedo said. He recalls telling Third Ward residents, and others in Houston, that there’s not just one way to fix that problem. “We told people that it’s really important that they not just take to the streets, but that they take to the polls during the election,” he said.“Voting for George”Voters who Reuters spoke to in the Third Ward and nearby said they emerged from this summer’s protests not just more politically active, but also confident they can make their voices heard.“It feels like we’re in a new Civil Rights era,” said JD Fontenot, a pharmacy student at Texas Southern University.The world he and other young minorities are beginning to help shape feels like a mirror image of the days of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, he said, and voting is a first step.“The fact that our vote is directly linked to Black people’s freedom in America is on the minds of people right now,” Fontenot said.So is tension between Blacks and whites.“The racial injustice we are seeing right now, which had been subliminal but now spews forth in the open, is making it clear to the Black community that we have to come out and vote,” said daycare worker Veronica McClendon, 53, who was born and raised in the nearby Fifth Ward.Faircloth and two other members of the Alpha Phi Alpha Black fraternity - Carlos Pinkerton and Sheldon Hadnot - canvassed door-to-door in the Third Ward last weekend.When they spotted Arnetta Taylor outside her home, they wouldn’t take no for an answer. Dispelling her concerns about a missing voter registration card, they explained other forms of ID she could use and got her commitment to go to the polls.“Take my number and call me on Monday to make sure I voted! I’m 46-years-old and I’ve never voted in my life, but I will now,” Taylor said.She was clear about her motivation.“We’re voting for George,” she said. “We’re voting for Breonna Taylor, too. We’re voting for a lot of Black people that have been killed in this way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-george-floyd-s-hometown-a-season-of-protest-ends-at-the-polls/story-aNboe9ZNi8iIDaeo89c05J.html

Reports said he was dressed in medieval costume and armed with a “bladed weapon.”The incident occurred late Saturday night and the suspect was apprehended local law enforcement at approximately 1 am local time on Sunday. According to local media reports, the rampage occurred near the Chateau Frontenac, on rue des Ramparts in the city, close to the National Assembly area.Police said the suspect did not live in the city but was apparently from the suburbs of Montreal. The perpetrator of the horror on Halloween night “chose his victims at random,” police said, adding he was not associated with any terror organisation. While the city police’s anti-terror unit was involved in the investigation, it tweeted, “According to our initial information, there is no indication that the suspect may have acted on motives other than personal ones.”Given that Quebec is Canada’s Francophone province and practises the sort of laicite associated with France, there was speculation connecting the episode with recent terror attacks there, but that may be unfounded.The Service de police de la Ville de Québec, the city’s police department warned residents to avoid the Parliament Hill area and asked them to remain inside.“We still ask the citizens of Quebec City to stay inside with the doors locked because an investigation is still underway,” the department said in a tweet in French.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his dismay over the attack. “My heart breaks for the loved ones of the two people killed in last night’s horrific attack in Quebec City. I’m also wishing a full recovery to the injured,” he said.“We’re keeping you in our thoughts and will be there for you. To all the first responders, thank you for your critical work.”The premier of the province, François Legault, conveyed his shock in a tweet: “Quebec is waking up after a night of horror. Words fail me to describe such a tragedy. I offer my condolences to the loved ones of the victims.”Those injured in the incident were taken to a local hospital for treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-terror-angle-in-halloween-night-stabbing-attack-in-canada-police/story-znoVDy9bm6XIVwx6DaVxZI.html
01-11-2020||World||England’s lockdown may be extended beyond December||Less than a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a month-long lockdown for England, one of his top ministers and closest allies signalled the measures might have to be extended if they fail to contain the spread of the coronavirus.“It will get reviewed on December 2, but we’re always driven by what the data show,” Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said on Sky News’s Sophy Ridge show. “We will always take the decision in national interest based on the evidence, the best information that we have.”When pressed by Ridge on whether the restrictions could be extended if the data wasn’t good, Gove replied, “yes.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday announced that England would go into a second, partial lockdown as virus cases spike and government scientists warn the health system faces being overwhelmed. Total virus cases in the UK since the outbreak began have now passed 1 million and the country has suffered more than 46,000 fatalities, the highest death toll in Europe.“If we were to have a situation where we found our NHS overwhelmed, it will also have inevitable effects on our economy, on people’s overall confidence and their ability to go about their daily lives,” Gove said. “This is a protective step that we need to take that nobody relishes. We feel that there is no alternative.”Faced With Hard Science, Johnson Hopes Lockdown Saves ChristmasJohnson had for weeks sought to avoid further restrictions that the government worries will hurt the economy. Under the new measures essential shops will shut, alongside bars and restaurants, but schools will stay open in a bid to allow people to remain working. In a BBC interview, Gove indicated that the government may prefer to extend the lockdown rather than further disrupt the education system.The government also U-turned on its financial support policy, extending its furlough program, which had been due to end on Saturday, until the end of the new lockdown. That’s the fourth time officials have changed the nature of the replacement for furlough since a successor was announced in late September and Gove said it will be reviewed if the lockdown is extended.The dramatic steps mark an end to the tiered, localized approach the government had been taking to virus curbs, a strategy Gove said he hopes the nation will return to in December. It also comes after weeks during which Johnson said he wanted to avoid the “nuclear option” of nationwide restrictions, despite advice from scientists in September to introduce a shorter “circuit-breaker” lockdown coinciding with school holidays.The UK’s sluggishness in imposing new measures given the record surge in virus cases is likely to raise questions about why officials didn’t act earlier, while the move is also politically embarrassing for Johnson. It risks both upsetting his own rank-and-file lawmakers and vindicating opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer’s repeated calls for a temporary lockdown.“Three weeks ago we called for a circuit break,” Starmer said in a BBC interview. “At that stage the government rejected it out of hand, ridiculed it, now only to do precisely the same thing. But there’s a cost to that delay. The lockdown now will be longer, it can be harder. And there’s a very human cost to this.”Even the announcement was fraught, coming days earlier than expected due to a leak of the plan’s details following a meeting of just four senior ministers. That breach is now under investigation, Gove confirmed Sunday as he defended the decision.“The virus has proven to be more malignant in the way in which it spread than any of us had anticipated or feared,” Gove said. “The first thing is that the advice that we were receiving at the time indicated that a regional approach was entirely appropriate. It’s impossible to know definitively until the end of this pandemic which were the mistakes, and which were the missteps.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-s-lockdown-may-be-extended-beyond-december/story-u5ihXOflMYCTT4aYteCPzJ.html
01-11-2020||World||Analysis: Bidencare or Trumpcare? Health plans will affect US economy differently||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wants to expand the Affordable Care Act(ACA), President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare legislation.Republican President Donald Trump wants to end it altogether, and replace it with something that has yet to be defined. An ongoing debate over which approach is better for the economy is partly about price tags. Bidencare is forecast to increase federal healthcare spending by $2 trillion or more over 10 years. Trump’s approach is to hold federal spending stable or reduce it.Bidencare supporters emphasize the stimulative effects of government spending, especially in a period of economic distress, and the benefits of insuring more people in the middle of a pandemic. Those who prefer Trump’s approach say it would avoid debt or tax increases they say would drag on future economic growth.The United States has about 30 million people without health insurance now, down from about 46.5 million in 2010, when the ACA was passed. Bidencare would cut that figure by a further 15 million to 20 million, an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates. Trump isn’t expected to try to reduce that. Healthcare spending is equal to 17% of the US economy, far more than any other industrialized country, so the Trumpcare vs. Bidencare debate is no small economic matter. It’s further complicated by the fact that extra spending doesn’t translate to a healthier populace than other counties. “Improving healthcare performance is a critical part of strengthening America’s health, economy and fiscal future, and should be top a priority for the next president and Congress,” says Peterson Foundation CEO Michael Peterson.Bidencare focuses on lower-income Americans Bidencare would cover more Americans by increasing subsidized health insurance purchases through tax credits. It would also offer a “public option,” allowing anyone who wants it to buy in, even if their job offers private insurance. Lower-income families shut out of ACA’s expanded Medicaid eligibility because of where they live could get it premium-free. Any boost to health and financial stability is likely to be biggest for millions of low-income households, particularly Latino and Black families who have been particularly hard-hit during the pandemic.For these groups especially, says the University of Michigan School of Public Health’s Helen Levy, being able to accumulate assets “is really important if you think about supporting economic mobility.”Minorities get and die from Covid-19 at higher rates than whites, data shows. Some of that is probably because Blacks and Latinos are more likely to work in jobs that put them at higher risk of transmission. But even without Covid-19, minorities face higher rates of chronic disease and earlier death than whites. They also have lower rates of health insurance despite substantial gains since the advent of the ACA, a study by Kaiser Family Foundation shows. Biden said he would pay for his plan through higher taxes on the wealthy, and use the clout of expanded public insurance to keep down medical costs. Increasing the number of insured Americans could have positive economic consequences. There’s evidence that the uninsured who do get sick get care in expensive settings like the emergency room, says University of California, Los Angeles(UCLA) public health policy professor Gerald Kominski. That takes a toll on their financial health and, when they can’t pay, strains the finances of hospitals that provide their care, with taxpayers footing part of that bill as well. People in states where uninsured rates fell under Obamacare had fewer past-due debts, were less likely to use payday loans or file for bankruptcy, had better credit and were less likely to be evicted than those in states that did not expand Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. “The whole reason people should get insurance, from an economist’s perspective, is to protect them against catastrophic losses,” says University of Minnesota professor Sayeh Nikpay. Trumpcare less clear, but cheaper Trump tried and failed to get Congress to repeal the ACA in his first four-year term, and is likely to continue to it in some form during a second term. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a challenge to the law a week after Tuesday’s presidential election. A ruling to dismantle the ACA would put coverage of 21 million Americans in jeopardy, according to the Urban Institute, though most legal scholars don’t expect the court to do so. If it does, Trump hasn’t specified a plan to replace it. One blueprint may be the Health Care Choices Proposal, put together by conservative health policy experts at the Galen Institute and the Heritage Foundation. The plan would turn money now used for the ACA over to states to help people buy private health insurance and to provide coverage for low-income households. An analysis by the right-leaning nonprofit think tank American Action Forum found the proposal would lower premiums by 18% to 24%. The number of uninsured would remain steady. “The macroeconomic effects would be better than either current law or proposals to devote more public resources to the ACA,” says author Doug Badger. Reducing premiums, he said, would be the “best form of economic stimulus” because it would put money in the pockets of regular Americans.That analysis is disputed. Bidencare’s high price tag does worry Bipartisan Policy Center Senior Vice President William Hoagland, a former staffer to Republican lawmakers. But, he said, it’s worth paying for broader health insurance access, which he said would lead to a stronger economy. “I’m going to come down on the side that a healthy country, and a reduction in chronic conditions, improves productivity, and improving productivity increases economic growth,” he remarked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/analysis-bidencare-or-trumpcare-health-plans-will-affect-us-economy-differently/story-YElveDZRMK1Y7FWiN7itPP.html

Bloomberg reported on Friday that MHRA had also begun an accelerated review for the Covid-19 vaccine candidate from Pfizer Inc.AstraZeneca and Pfizer are among the front runners in the race to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, with the race also including Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Inc.Their vaccine candidates are in late stage trials, interim data from which are expected in the coming weeks.The British drug maker said on Monday its Covid-19 experimental vaccine produces an immune response in both old and young adults.

01-11-2020||World||White House goes after Dr Fauci for his Covid-19 death toll concerns||The White House slammed Anthony Fauci after the nation’s leading infectious disease expert ramped up criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted in a Washington Post interview published Saturday night that the US is “in for a whole of of hurt” from the Covid-19 pandemic, and forecast a rising death toll over the winter.Fauci also said he has “real problems” with Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist who’s become President Donald Trump’s favored pandemic adviser in recent months.“It’s unacceptable and breaking with all norms for Dr. Fauci, a senior member of the President’s Coronavirus Taskforce and someone who has praised President Trump’s actions throughout this pandemic, to choose three days before an election to play politics,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.The White House attacked Fauci for giving credit to Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential campaign for “taking it seriously from a public health perspective.” Trump is “looking at it from a different perspective” that is “the economy and reopening the country,” Fauci told the Post.Deere said Fauci was “choosing to criticize the president in the media and make his political leanings known by praising the president’s opponent — exactly what the American people have come to expect from The Swamp.”230,000 DeathsTrump himself has increasingly taken aim at Fauci. The president last month labeled Fauci, 79, who is nonpartisan and has served in his role since 1984, a “Democrat,” but said he would keep him around because firing him would generate more controversy.The White House’s sharp criticism of Fauci could feed the notion that Trump is downplaying the pandemic, which has hurt the president’s standing among voters, according to opinion polls.More than 9.1 million people in the US have been infected by the coronavirus and over 230,000 people have died -- making the US the site of the worst recorded outbreak in the world. The nation had 99,000 cases on Friday, hitting a new daily record just four days before Election Day.Trump resumed massive rallies in the final stretch of the campaign, including five planned for Sunday alone, defying Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend Americans avoid large crowds.Fauci said in the interview that the country needed to make an “abrupt change” in abiding by public-health measures, or else the number of cases could reach more than 100,000 per day.High Alert”We’re in for a whole lot of hurt. It’s not a good situation,” Fauci told the Post. “All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.”“Dr. Fauci may have just admitted that he is afraid the cure will be worse than the disease and that unlike the president he has no confidence in the American people to make the best choice for themselves armed with CDC best practices,” Deere said.In the interview, Fauci also criticized Atlas for lacking the expertise necessary to give Trump informed advice. Atlas has invoked controversial theories about the coronavirus, such as claiming that much of the country is immune due to exposure to other viruses. Epidemiologists say there’s no evidence to support his claims.“He’s a smart guy who’s talking about things that I believe he doesn’t have any real insight or knowledge or experience in,” Fauci said of Atlas. “He keeps talking about things that when you dissect it out and parse it out, it doesn’t make any sense.”Atlas responded to Fauci Saturday night on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-goes-after-dr-fauci-for-his-covid-19-death-toll-concerns/story-rXWFSgJeLm5lgoshhbJYNJ.html
01-11-2020||World||Sean Connery’s widow reveals actor suffered from dementia||Iconic British actor Sean Connery, who has died at the age of 90, suffered from dementia in his final years, his widow Micheline Roquebrune revealed on Sunday.Connery, famous for playing the original on-screen James Bond, passed away at his home in the Bahamas, prompting an outpouring of tributes.He died peacefully in his sleep surrounded by family members, his widow Micheline Roquebrune told the Mail on Sunday.“I was with him all the time and he just slipped away,” the 91-year-old told the newspaper.“He had dementia and it took its toll on him. He got his final wish to slip away without any fuss.“It was no life for him. He was not able to express himself latterly.”Connery will be honoured in a private funeral ceremony, with a memorial event to be held later, according to a publicist. The actor, who was knighted in 2000, won numerous awards during his decades-spanning career encompassing an array of big-screen hits, including an Oscar, three Golden Globes and two Bafta awards.But it was his smooth, Scottish-accented portrayal of the suave licensed-to-kill spy 007 that earned him lasting worldwide fame and adoration.The first actor to utter the unforgettable “Bond, James Bond”, Connery made six official films as novelist Ian Fleming’s creation, giving what many still consider to be the definitive portrayal.Former 007 actor Pierce Brosnan joined the flood of weekend tributes to the Scottish actor, who he said “led the way for us all who followed in your iconic foot steps”.“You were my greatest James Bond as a boy, and as a man who became James Bond himself, you cast a long shadow of cinematic splendour that will live on forever,” Brosnan added.- ‘Model of a man’ -Connery, born in Edinburgh in 1930, married French artist Roquebrune in 1974, a year after he divorced first wife Diane Cilento.The couple first met in Morocco in 1970. They had lived outside his native Britain for decades, previously owning a home in the Spanish resort of Marbella and then in the Bahamas.In one of the last photographs said to have been taken of the 007 legend, and published by the Mail on Sunday, Connery can be seen clasping the hand of a smiling Roquebrune.The picture was taken on the pair’s 45th wedding anniversary on May 6, according to the paper.“He was gorgeous and we had a wonderful life together,” the Tunisian-born widow said.“He was a model of a man. It is going to be very hard without him, I know that. But it could not last for ever and he went peacefully.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sean-connery-s-widow-reveals-actor-suffered-from-dementia/story-fR8okt1BlIIjgi0LLcSS5L.html
01-11-2020||World||China to begin work on section of Sichuan-Tibet Railway near Indian border||China is all set to begin the construction of the strategic Sichuan-Tibet Railway between Ya’an in southwest Sichuan province and Linzhi in Tibet, close to the Indian border in Arunachal Pradesh, the official media reported. China Railway announced on Saturday the bidding results for the construction of two tunnels and one bridge, as well as the power supply project for the Ya’an-Linzhi section of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, indicating that construction of the project is about to begin.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway is the second such project in Tibet after the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. It will go through the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the world’s most geologically active areas, a report by the state-run China News reported.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway starts from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, and travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours, the report said.Linzhi, which is also known as Nyingchi, is located close to Arunachal Pradesh border.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Linzhi also has an airport, one of the five built by China in the Himalayan region.The newly-built Ya’an-Linzhi section runs 1,011 kilometres and includes 26 stations. Trains are expected to run at speeds between 120 and 200 km per hour, a staffer in charge of the project said.The total cost of the entire Sichuan-Tibet Railway project is around 319.8 billion yuan (USD 47.8 billion), Global Times reported.The Sichuan-Tibet railway is also of great significance in safeguarding national unity and maintaining border stability, the daily quoted Chinese experts as saying.“After the Sichuan-Tibet railway starts operation, Tibet will have more exchanges with other parts of the Chinese mainland. Strategically, China’s Tibetan region will have much stronger capabilities in material transportation and logistical supplies,” Lin Minwang, deputy director at the Center for South Asian Studies at Fudan University, said.Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University told the daily “If a scenario of a crisis happens at the China-India border, the railway will provide a great convenience for China’s delivery of strategic materials.” The Sichuan-Tibet Railway will not only accelerate and enhance the overall economic development of the Tibet region but will play an important role in safeguarding border stability, the daily’s report said.The construction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway is of strategic importance that benefits the overall development of Tibet, Xiong Kunxin, an ethnic studies professor at the Tibet University in Lhasa, said.As a major infrastructure project, the railway is set to improve transport that has hindered exchanges between the Tibet region and the rest of China, and could help transport advanced equipment and technologies from other places to Tibet, and bring local products out, Xiong said.Observers said the new railway line will put Tibet on a “fast track” to catch up with other more developed regions of China, the reports said.Both Sichuan and Tibet are rich in resources with their unique natural landscapes, huge mineral reserves, and a wide variety of medicinal herbs.After the completion of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, it is expected to greatly boost local tourism all along the line, it said.“It will also enhance person-to-person exchanges between different regions and ethnic groups, promote understanding and cultural integration,” Xiong said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-begin-work-on-section-of-sichuan-tibet-railway-near-indian-border/story-HbLgHBN0GY5G8p8DCSpIKM.html
01-11-2020||World||Chinese Communist Party aims complete military modernisation by 2027||The just-concluded key conclave of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) has finalised plans to build a fully modern military on par with the US by 2027, media reports here said.By the year 2027, which marks the centennial of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), China will build a fully modern military, a goal that is in alignment with the national strength and will fulfil the future national defence need, state-run Global Times quoted Chinese analysts as saying on Saturday.The Plenary session of the ruling CPC headed by President Xi Jinping which held a four-day meeting adopted his proposals for the formulation of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035.While the 14th Five-Year plan envisages massive overhaul of the country’s domestic market to boost consumption in order to reduce China’s reliance on shrinking exports markets, the Vision 2035 visualises a long-term plan, reflecting the development vision of Xi including the military.Politically, Xi’s Vision 2035 plan sparked speculation that he could continue in power for the next 15 years.Xi, 67, has emerged as the CPC’s most powerful leader after its founder Mao Zedong, holding the posts of CPC General Secretary, head of the military besides the presidency with prospects of a life-long tenure.A constitutional amendment in 2018 has removed the two-five-year term limit for the President, which would enable Xi to continue in power for life. His second term as the president is due to end in 2022.According to the Communique of the fifth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee released on Thursday, the country’s national defence capabilities and economic strength should be strengthened at the same time and reach the centennial goal of building a modern military by 2027.The meeting headed by Xi has set a new goal to turn the PLA into a modern military force by 2027, by which time, China aims to build an army on par with that of the US, the Hong Kong based South China Morning Post reported.With the centennial goal of building a modern military by 2027, China aims to develop the military with the capability to defend national sovereignty, safeguard against security threats posed by the hegemonism in western pacific region and protect overseas development interests as China’s overseas economic presence grows, Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times.“The centennial goal is in line with national strength,” Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the tabloid.Hong Kong military analyst Song Zhongping told the Post that the new centennial goal can be interpreted as “putting the PLA as a leading modern force in the world, one that can be on par with the US army”.Sunfei Wu, deputy head of Hong Kong think tank Tianda Institute said this is the first time the Chinese leaders have included the military in such development goals. He said the goal was primarily targeted at Taiwan.“Basically, the target is to build PLA’s capability to match the US army by 2027, so It can effectively deter interference by the US Army around the Taiwan Strait,” he said.Julian Gewirtz, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council for Foreign Relation, said the inclusion of these longer-term goals was significant, “though it is hard to say it means Xi will definitely rule until then”.“It‘s important to note that this Plenum isn’t just discussing the next five-year plan,” he continued. “It’s also building out the vision for 2035, spanning greater technological self-reliance and other goals for economic and social development.Why 2035? The easy answer is that it’s the halfway point between the ‘two centenary goals’ of 2021 and 2049.“Whether or not Xi rules until 2035, this provides a medium-term frame for the actions under way, especially since the next several years will likely remain very challenging for China,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-communist-party-aims-complete-military-modernisation-by-2027/story-V6ltsi8znS5xCbKmCu50fK.html
01-11-2020||World||UK PM calls in army to roll out tests as lockdown looms||As England goes into Lockdown 2 from Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called in the army to help with rolling out a massive testing programme across the UK and believes that there is “realistic hope” of a vaccine for Covid-19 in the first quarter of 2021.The lockdown until December 2 is likely to be extended if it does not lead to lower incidence of the virus, deaths and hospital admissions, senior minister Michael Gove said on Sunday, as retail shops reported busy shopping for essential items before the start of lockdown.Johnson struck a note of optimism as he announced the lockdown: “I am optimistic that this will feel very different and better by the spring. It is not just that we have ever better medicine and therapies, and the realistic hope of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year”.“We now have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable and above all rapid turnaround tests; tests that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within ten to 15 minutes”.“And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests…The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days”, he said.Johnson’s lockdown announcement sparked another round of political jousting, with the opposition Labour reminding him that it had called for a lockdown weeks ago. Labour said it would support the relevant legislation for the second lockdown when it is put to vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday.Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the furlough scheme for employees running since April for one more month, but business organisations lamented the impact the second lockdown would have on an already challenging environment that has led to major job losses and closures.Sunak said: “Over the past eight months of this crisis we have helped millions of people to continue to provide for their families. But now - along with many other countries around the world - we face a tough winter ahead”.“I have always said that we will do whatever it takes as the situation evolves. Now, as restrictions get tougher, we are taking steps to provide further financial support to protect jobs and businesses. These changes will provide a vital safety net for people across the UK”.Continuing the optimistic note, Johnson told people in a live telecast: “I can tell you tonight that the scientists may be unanimously gloomy about the immediate options. But they are unanimously optimistic about the medium and the long-term future”.“We will get through this – but we must act now to contain this autumn surge. We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April. It is less prohibitive and less restrictive. But from Thursday the basic message is the same: Stay at home. Protect the NHS. And save lives”.As of Saturday evening, the UK had crossed 1 million cases: 1,011,660, with a day-rise of 21,915 new cases and 326 deaths (the cumulative death figure was 46,555).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-calls-in-army-to-roll-out-tests-as-lockdown-looms/story-jLosoi0mizMOR1EMtYcHZJ.html

The polls sampled more than 1,200 people in each state, and were conducted over a period ranging Oct 26 to Oct 31.Trump carried all four of these states narrowly in 2016, as he won the presidential election over Hillary Clinton despite falling short in the popular vote. Polls show Biden running better than Clinton did four years ago, though analysts say Trump still has a viable path to an election win.That path would likely require Trump winning at least two of the states in the Times polls released today, as well as several other states considered “toss ups” by nonpartisan election handicappers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-leads-donald-trump-in-key-swing-states-before-election-report/story-tTjqy6KTaSX9LopHCZ298K.html

They believe he may have spent time there after travelling from Lampedusa to Bari in early October on a ship used to quarantine migrants, judicial sources said.In Bari, he is believed to have been handed an expulsion order obliging him to leave Italy within a week, the judicial sources said. Investigators are looking into the possibility the suspected attacker stayed in the Sicilian town of Alcamo for a 10 day period, the sources added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/six-in-custody-over-nice-church-attack-in-france/story-KDgjscM6FcNwuV0N1EMmXN.html
01-11-2020||World||Thousands evacuated as super typhoon Goni makes landfall in Philippines||The world’s strongest storm this year killed at least four people and forced about 350,000 to flee their homes as it slammed into the eastern part of the Philippines early Sunday.Super Typhoon Goni brought “catastrophic violent winds” when it made landfall over Catanduanes province before dawn Sunday, before weakening as it crossed the main island of Luzon. It’s expected to be closest to the Philippine capital region late Sunday before exiting land the following day.“Goni is the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone” in history, said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections and co-founder of Weather Underground. The previous record was held by Super Typhoons Meranti and Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in 2016 and 2013 respectively.Goni’s maximum sustained winds have weakened to 175 kilometers an hour, while gusts slowed to 240 kilometers per hour after the typhoon’s third landfall in Quezon province at midday, down from 310 kilometers earlier Sunday, the Philippine weather bureau said in its latest report. Dozens of areas, including Metro Manila, have been placed under storm alert.There have been 347,000 people evacuated, according to Ricardo Jalad, executive director of the Philippines’ disaster risk-monitoring agency. Between 19 million to 31 million people could be affected by the storm, based on the population count in areas within its path, according to Mark Timbal, a spokesman at the Philippines’ disaster risk-monitoring agency.Authorities shut Manila’s international airport to aircraft for 24 hours from 10 a.m. local time, prompting Philippine Airlines and Cebu Air to cancel flights. Light railways in Manila suspended operations while Ayala Land Inc., one of the nation’s biggest builders, said all its shopping malls in Luzon are shut.Health Secretary Francisco Duque asked people to observe social-distancing measures in evacuation centers to prevent the spread of Covid-19. After Indonesia, the Philippines has the highest number of coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia.“The pandemic has made this much more complex, but we have been preparing for this situation,” Richard Gordon, a senator and chairman for Philippine Red Cross, said in a statement.At least four people died in Albay and the province was left without electricity as floods and debris destroyed dikes and washed away houses, Governor Al Francis Bichara said in an interview with DZBB radio. The storm also felled power lines in Quezon, where at least one person is missing, and damage to crops could reach one billion pesos ($21 million), said provincial Governor Danilo Suarez.The cyclone comes days after Typhoon Molave lashed the Southeast Asian nation, leaving at least 22 dead and causing a minimum of 1.8 billion pesos of damage to crops, before heading to Vietnam. Goni is following a similar route.An average of 20 cyclones pass through disaster-prone Philippines every year, which will likely complicate the nation’s fight against the coronavirus as hundreds of thousands of people are evacuated from typhoon-hit areas. In 2013, Haiyan struck the Southeast Asian nation and killed more than 6,300 people.Coconut, rice and corn plantations may suffer severe losses. Typhoon Goni could damage more than 928,000 hectares of land planted with rice and 58,431 hectares of corn, the Department of Agriculture estimates.The storm can have a “high humanitarian impact,” the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System said on its website, adding that nearly 50 million people are at risk.Another typhoon, Atsani, entered the Philippines on Sunday afternoon, the weather bureau said.The Philippines’ first catastrophe bond, which provides $150 million of tropical cyclone disaster insurance protection sourced from the capital markets, may be triggered, according to Artemis, which monitors catastrophe bonds, insurance-linked securities and weather risk markets.“The damage is extensive,” Christopher Dy-Liacco Flores, former mayor of Guinobatan town in Albay, said by Facebook Messenger. Flooding reached 16 feet deep. “Bridges have been washed away, flood control structures destroyed. Electric poles have fallen, roads destroyed and our agriculture is ruined.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-evacuated-as-super-typhoon-goni-makes-landfall-in-philippines/story-JOkohMSfMNtkyWAubBmlDJ.html

The pandemic brought our organizational and developmental models into a crisis; it exposed many injustices, the troubling silence and social and health failures, subjecting a great number of our brothers to the processes of social exclusion and degradation,” the pope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-requests-patience-solidarity-during-pandemic-times/story-3vxAdxhiaPJAHWTOBvg14H.html
01-11-2020||World||70-year-old pulled out alive in Turkey as earthquake toll hits 60||Rescue workers extricated a 70-year-old man from a collapsed building in western Turkey on Sunday, some 34 hours after a strong earthquake in the Aegean Sea struck Turkey and Greece, killing at least 60 people and injuring more than 900.It was the latest series of remarkable rescues after the Friday afternoon earthquake, which was centered in the Aegean northeast of the Greek island of Samos. Search-and-rescue teams were working in nine toppled or damaged buildings in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, but appeared to be finding more bodies Sunday than survivors.Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised the death toll Sunday in Izmir to 58. Two teenagers were killed Friday on Samos and at least 19 others were injured.There was some debate over the magnitude of the earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey rated it 7.0, while the Istanbul’s Kandilli Institute put it at 6.9 and Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said it measured 6.6.Ahmet Citim, 70, was pulled out of the rubble in the middle of the night and was hospitalized. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted that Citim said: “I never lost hope.” The minister visited the survivor and said he was doing well.The quake triggered a small tsunami that hit Samos and the Seferihisar district of Izmir, drowning one elderly woman. The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul, as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. Turkey’s disaster agency said 920 people were injured in Turkey alone.Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said 26 badly damaged buildings would be demolished.“It’s not the earthquake that kills but buildings,” he added, repeating a common slogan.Turkey has a mix of older buildings and cheap or illegal construction, which can lead to serious damage and deaths when earthquakes hit. Regulations have been tightened in light of earthquakes to strengthen or demolish buildings and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities but it is not happening fast enough.Two destroyed apartment buildings in Izmir where much of the rescues are taking place had received reports of “decay” in 2012 and 2018, according to the municipal agency in charge of such certificates. Turkish media including the Hurriyet newspaper said one of the buildings, which was built in 1993, was at risk of earthquake damage because of its low quality concrete and the lack of reinforcements. However, the building continued to be occupied.Turkey’s justice minister said prosecutors had begun investigating several collapsed buildings and promised legal repercussions if experts identified neglect.AFAD said nearly 6,400 personnel had been activated for rescue work and hundreds of others for food distribution, emergency help and building damage control.Turkey is criss-crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well.In a rare show of unity amid months of tense relations over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean, Greek and Turkish government officials have issued mutual messages of solidarity over the quake toll.The quake occurred as Turkey was already struggling with an economic downturn and the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Turkey has more than 10,000 confirmed virus deaths but some experts have accused the government of concealing the true impact of the virus with the way it counts infections.___Bilginsoy reported from Istanbul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/70-year-old-pulled-out-alive-in-turkey-as-earthquake-toll-hits-60/story-9sMXd3YWThjq4PoKkYFusM.html

Should those trials succeed a third stage with 30,000 volunteers is scheduled for April/May.“We are in the final stretch,” said Shmuel Shapira, Director General of the Israel Institute for Biological Research.The institute, which is overseen by the Defence Ministry, began animal trials for its “BriLife” vaccine in March and announced a week ago it had received regulatory approval to take it to the next stage.Shmuel Yitzhaki, head of the institute’s biology division, told Reuters that if all goes well the vaccine could reach the general population by the end of next summer.While the first batch of volunteers received the potential vaccine, around the country elementary students returned to school as a second nationwide lockdown comes to a gradual end.Restrictions in Israel, with a population of 9 million, are being slowly lifted following a steady decline in the rate of daily infections.First through fourth graders were the first to return to school on Sunday. Older kids are still learning from home.The government also approved the reopening in stages of businesses and recreational activities.The country reported 674 new cases on Friday - down from a peak of more than 9,000 several weeks ago.

Pakistan is facing strong domestic opposition from groups that accuse it of systematically exploiting GB of its resources and sharing no dividends with them. Any resistance is met with brutal government reprisal, with activists and leaders hounded, arrested and tortured.Maulana Fazlur Rehman, chief of Pakistan’s 11-party opposition alliance, the Pakistan Democratic Movement, is among opponents of Pakistan’s GB move. “A deal has been made over the blood of Kashmiris... Business is being done in the name of Kashmir diplomacy,” the cleric had said earlier and pledged “not to allow the partition of Kashmir”.In his speech on Sunday, Khan said he could not announce or talk about development packages for the newly carved province given the upcoming local elections.He said that special efforts were being taken to connect GB to the rest of Pakistan as the area had suffered due to poor connectivity.“You will see in the coming days, our development plans will go there [backward areas],” he said.Replying to criticism of the army by the opposition, Imran Khan said he could not stress enough the importance of a strong army for a nation’s security. “Pakistan is secure today because of its armed forces,” he said.“Our army is the main reason why we haven’t suffered the same fate as many other Muslim countries.”He praised the country’s intelligence agencies “for rendering ineffective India’s conspiracies to spread anarchy in the country.”(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-announces-provincial-status-for-gilgit-baltistan-despite-anger-at-home-opposition-from-india/story-589JQ9iMb9JlbS2Ix6ittN.html

Germany and France imposed similar partial shutdowns this week.Austria, Greece and Portugal followed the example of the European Union’s two big economic powers on Saturday with expanded shutdowns for November. Leaders across the region are seeking to beat back the virus surge before the end-of-year holiday season in Europe, where more than 215,000 have died and nearly 7 million have been infected.“Christmas is going to be different this year, perhaps very different,” Johnson told a news conference. “But it’s my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now, we can allow families across the country to be together.”Bars, restaurants, leisure facilities and cultural venues have to close in Germany starting Monday, while schools and most shops can remain open. France began its version of “lockdown lite” on Friday.Belgium is closing all non-essential stores and curtailing family visits to avoid crashing its health-care system. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, intent on avoiding a national lockdown, expanded economic aid for businesses and tightened restrictions in population centers.With protests multiplying and political unity fraying, officials had been trying to avoid the sweeping restrictions that plunged the continent into recession in the spring.Here’s the latest from the UK, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Greece, Portugal and Austria:UKJohnson announced a partial lockdown for England, seeking to contain a resurgent coronavirus outbreak that’s spreading faster than the government’s worst-case projections and threatening to strain the National Health Service.Furloughed workers will be eligible for state payments covering as much as 80% of wages through the new lockdown period, Johnson said, extending assistance that was due to end this weekend and be replaced by a less generous program.The lockdown will start on Thursday, pending a vote in Parliament, and last until at least early December, Johnson said.“We’re not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April,” he said. “The measures that I’ve outlined are less prohibitive, less restrictive. But I’m afraid from Thursday, the basic message is the same: stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”Cases in the UK, where pandemic policy is controlled separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, increased by almost 22,000 on Saturday. Britain’s Europe-leading death toll of more than 46,000 compares with about 36,600 deaths in France, which has a similar population.GermanyChancellor Angela Merkel and business leaders will discuss easing the burden on industry on Wednesday.“We need to do everything in our power to get the infection numbers under control” while protecting jobs, Merkel said in her weekly podcast.Merkel announced measures this week to severely limit movement, while keeping schools open and the economy ticking over. Germany is in a “dramatic situation,” with health-care services stretched close to the limit and authorities no longer able to track infections back to the source, Merkel said.If Germany waits until intensive care units are full, it will be too late, she said, warning of “four long and difficult winter months” ahead. More than 19,000 new cases were reported on Friday, the second-highest daily number yet.Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Friday the government still expects growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter.Merkel is struggling to retain control over the crisis. An address she made Thursday in parliament was repeatedly interrupted by heckling from opposition lawmakers as she condemned “lies and disinformation, conspiracy and hate.”FranceFrance’s goal is to limit the economic contraction to 15 per cent during the latest lockdown, about half of the 30% decline during the one that started in March, according to Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.That was caused in particular by a halt to construction work, while this time building sites and stores selling building materials will remain open, as well as government services handling permits.The new curbs were announced less than a week after France expanded a curfew to about two-thirds of the population.“The virus is circulating in France at a speed that even the most pessimistic forecast didn’t foresee,” President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday in an address to the nation.On Friday, France reported the most new deaths since April 20, the same day the first lockdown went into effect.ItalyItaly, which has been under a partial lockdown for the last week, could decide a ban on travel between regions and close shopping malls at weekends from Tuesday, local media reported Sunday. Milan, Naples, Genoa and Turin are among cities that could face harsher restrictions, with regional authorities empowered to impose “mini lockdowns,” according to Corriere della Sera and La Stampa.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will speak to parliament on the virus situation on Monday, followed by an evening cabinet meeting that is expected to approve the new curbs.Hospitals risk collapsing in three weeks if the outbreak doesn’t slow down, according to a report by La Repubblica. Other potential measures under consideration include closing restaurants and bars altogether from their current 6:00 p.m. curfew, and making online classes compulsory from eighth grade. Conte said at an online forum Saturday that keeping schools open will be a challenge.Italy has already set an 11 p.m. curfew, curtailed operating hours for restaurants and bars, and shut down gyms, swimming pools and entertainment venues.Reported new cases exceeded 30,000 Saturday, with almost 300 dead.SpainA majority of Spain’s 17 regions have already closed their domestic borders or will do so this week, preventing non-essential travel.Targeted regional lockdowns will remain in force until after Nov. 9, and cover consecutive bank-holiday weekends, which would typically lead to massive flows of travelers moving across the country.Regional authorities have extraordinary powers to declare curbs on movement after Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a state of emergency on Oct. 25. Spain this week reported more than 9,000 daily coronavirus infections on two consecutive days, the most since tracking started.GreeceResidents of Greece will face tighter restrictions during November, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said as the country recorded a record 2,056 new cases on Saturday.The country will be divided into high-risk and under-surveillance zones. In high-risk areas, including the capital Athens, restaurants, bars, cinemas, museums, theaters and gyms will close, though people will still be allowed to move among regions. Industry, schools, retail shops, hotels and hair salons will remain open nationwide. A nighttime curfew will start half an hour earlier at midnight, Mitsotakis said.PortugalPortugal extended restrictions to more regions, including its capital Lisbon, as the government tries to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic while keeping shops and restaurants open.Starting Nov. 4, restrictions that were already in place in three municipalities of northern Portugal will apply to a total of 121 districts that have reported more virus cases, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said at a press conference Saturday night in Lisbon. These locations are home to about 70% of Portugal’s population of 10 million, including the greater Lisbon and Oporto regions.Shops will have to close by 10 pm and restaurants by 10:30 pm. In addition, employees should work remotely when possible.AustriaAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz joined his peers in giving up on more-limited measures. A partial lockdown he unveiled Saturday is similar to neighboring Germany’s, with schools and non-essential stores open and restrictions on staying home applying only at night.Restaurants, cafes and hotels will close except for takeout and for business travelers. Gyms, cinemas and theaters will be shuttered. The rules take effect Tuesday through the end of November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-s-coronavirus-woes-multiply-with-leaders-drifting-to-lockdowns/story-RiAYm92NNMeLOB8yJRgVQN.html
01-11-2020||World||Pak PM Imran Khan gives provisional provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan||The Pakistan government has given Gilgit-Baltistan “provisional provincial status”, Prime Minister Imran Khan announced on Sunday, adding another twist to the ongoing controversy over the region claimed by India as part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Khan made the announcement while addressing a gathering in Gilgit to mark the so-called “independence day” of Gilgit-Baltistan. He also attacked the Indian government, accusing it of trying to foment unrest in Pakistan and creating a divide between the Shia and Sunni communities. “I want to greet the people of Gilgit-Baltistan today because we have decided that Gilgit-Baltistan will be given provisional provincial status, which was their demand for long,” Khan said, speaking in Urdu. “We have made this decision while keeping in mind the UN Security Council resolutions. We made the decision in between the UN Security Council resolutions But I know this was a long-standing demand of the youth here and I greet them today,” he said. He did not give further details or say when Gilgit-Baltistan would become Pakistan’s fifth province. Khan also said his government had a development package in mind for the region but that he couldn’t announce details because of the elections to be held on November 15. Khan highlighted the importance of a strong military for Pakistan in the face of what he described as a campaign by the Indian government to foment unrest across Pakistan and to create a split between the Sunni majority and Shia minority. He also said it was necessary for Pakistan to have a strong military in view of the oppression of the Kashmiri people by the Indian government following the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5 last year. He also accused the Indian government of oppressing the country’s Muslims through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). He praised Pakistan’s intelligence agencies for foiling what he said were India’s moves to create unrest at a time when opposition parties were making plans to discredit the military and judiciary. Khan particularly defended army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed from attacks by the opposition parties. Referring to PML-N leader Ayaz Sadiq’s remarks that Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, shot down in a dogfight during the military standoff triggered by the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019, was freed by Pakistan because of fears of an impending attack by India, Khan said the opposition leaders were “speaking like [Indian Prime Minister] Narendra Modi”. There was no immediate response to Khan’s remarks from Indian officials. When reports first emerged in September of Pakistan’s plans to make Gilgit-Baltistan that country’s fifth province, India had said such an action would have “no legal basis whatsoever” as the region had been militarily occupied. The Pakistan government plans to make the region a full-fledged province with constitutional rights such as representation in both houses of Parliament. The move reportedly has the backing of Pakistan’s powerful military establishment. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party is banking on the move to boost its chances in the elections. “Any action by Pakistan to alter the status of the militarily occupied so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’ has no legal basis whatsoever and is totally void ab-initio,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in September. The Pakistan government’s move comes two years after powers of the Islamabad-controlled council for Gilgit-Baltistan were transferred to a local assembly. In 2009, the Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order renamed the Northern Areas as Gilgit-Baltistan and the region was given province-like status but without representation in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-gives-provisional-provincial-status-to-gilgit-baltistan/story-O5mtkrQDQLh1VtSgF2yoaJ.html

Obama, who was the 44th US president, blasted Trump for his policies and rhetoric. “He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself or his friends or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show to give him the attention that he craves. But unfortunately, the rest of us have to live with the consequences,” he said. Obama was joined by Biden at both the Flint and Detroit rallies in Michigan, a battleground State. “I can tell you that the presidency doesn’t change who you are. It shows who are you. It reveals who you are. And for eight years, Joe was the last one in the room when I made a big decision,” he said. Obama praised 77-year-old Biden and said: “Biden is my brother. I love Joe Biden. And he will be a great president and he treats everyone with dignity and with respect”. “That sense of decency and empathy, the belief in hard work and family and faith, the belief that everyone counts, that is who Joe is and that is who he will be as president,” Obama said. Biden “made me a better president,” he added. “He has got the character and the experience to make us a better country. And he and Kamala (Harris) are going to be in the fight, not for themselves, but for every single one of us. And we sure can’t say that about the President we have got right now,” he said. Obama,59, alleged that Trump,74, is doing reality show in the White House. “You know when a country is going through a pandemic that’s not what you’re supposed to be worrying about,” he said. “And that’s the difference between Biden and Trump right there. Trump cares about feeding his ego. Joe cares about keeping you and your family safe. And he’s less interested in feeding his ego with having big crowds than he is making sure he’s not going around making more and more people sick. That’s what you should expect from a president,” he asserted. Also Read | Vote Donald Trump out of presidency; has divided, failed America: Joe Biden “What is his obsession, by the way, with crowd size? You notice that? This is the one measure he has of success. He’s still worried about his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine. It really bugged him. He’s still talking about that. Did nobody come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Is he traumatized? What’s with crowds?” he asked. “The lifeblood of a campaign is not rallies, it’s not TV ads, it is people willing to, you know, take a clipboard, talk to their neighbours and talk to their friends and talk to their co workers. Let folks know what the stakes are. And this kind of grassroots work and organising. Makes all the difference especially in an election, like this, where the stakes are so high,” Obama said. Obama said there was a need to revive the pandemic-hit economy again and it could be done well once Biden was elected. “We know that change is possible, but it’s not guaranteed. And if we care deeply about restoring a sense of decency to our federal government, a government that’s going to look out for ordinary people, that is gonna take this pandemic seriously and get on top of it so we can not only save lives, but also make our economy healthy again,” he said. “If we want a nation that is living up to its values, and its ideals so that, we set an example for the world. If we care about climate change and making sure that our criminal justice system is free of racial bias. Then we’re gonna have to work for it. And we’ve just got a few more days to make that happen,” he added. Obama said Biden understands his responsibilities. “And the other person who makes me hopeful is somebody I served with for eight years. Was in the room before I made any big decision, a person of character, a person of decency, a person of kindness. “A person who understands the solemn responsibilities you take on when you become president of the US, somebody who’s going to put you first. My friend, I could not be prouder to support him, and I could not be prouder. I hope in a few days to be able to call him Mr President,” Obama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-focused-on-feeding-his-ego-did-not-take-covid-19-pandemic-seriously-says-barack-obama/story-nO01DYcwkYwmCN5fakzMJM.html
01-11-2020||World||China starts once-a-decade census data collection exercise||Millions of census-takers began knocking on doors across China on Sunday for a once-a-decade head count of the world’s largest population that for the first time will use mobile apps to help crunch the massive numbers.Around seven million community workers and volunteers will drive the two-month data-collection effort, visiting homes ranging from residential skyscrapers in downtown Shanghai to remote Tibetan mountain villages.China conducts the census every ten years to determine population growth, movement patterns and other trends, using the findings to apportion resources for education, health, transportation, labour, elderly care and other services.The previous tally in 2010 counted 1,339,724,852 persons, an increase of 5.83 percent, or 73,899,804 people -- equal to adding more than the population of France over 10 years.Much of the attention on this year’s census -- expected to take two years to fully compile -- will focus on whether it indicates any population bump from China’s relaxation of its former “one-child policy”.The policy was introduced in the late 1970s to slow rapid population growth amid concerns over too many mouths to feed, but was relaxed four years ago to allow two children due to fears over China’s fast-ageing society and shrinking workforce.But the change has not yet resulted in a baby boom.The national birth rate last year was the slowest since the founding of Communist-ruled China in 1949, with many Chinese today choosing smaller families amid rising living costs.The government estimates the 2020 census could update the population to 1.42 billion, a 5.99 percent increase.A research institute affiliated with real estate giant Evergrande Group last week issued a study saying the government figure was an overestimate, and recommended that three children be allowed.“If adjustments are not made, it will seriously affect national rejuvenation and (China’s) rise as a great power,” the researchers said, citing two of the stated goals of powerful President Xi Jinping.‘Big Brother’ fearsThe study sparked a passionate online discussion, with many saying the real curbs on childbirth are rising costs and insufficient policy support for families.“Even a ten-child policy is useless until we create a society that is childbirth-friendly and childrearing-friendly,” said one widely “liked” comment on the WeChat platform of Chinese internet giant Tencent.Demographic experts have estimated it could take 15 years for the two-child policy to have any noticeable effect as other modern factors mitigate against rapid growth, including increasingly empowered Chinese women delaying or avoiding childbirth, and the slower population growth that comes with rising national affluence.Despite the door-to-door visits, most citizens are expected to enter their information via a smartphone app, adding to rising concerns about privacy protection.Vast amounts of Chinese economic activity and payments are handled through digital apps such as WeChat and its rival Alipay, offered by Alibaba-affiliated Ant Group.Many consumers accept the resulting surrender of data on their buying habits, travel, and other personal information as a small price to pay for digital conveniences. But others increasingly worry over privacy and data security, heightened further this year with China’s introduction of a nationwide system of digital “health codes” that score citizens on whether they pose a potential coronavirus threat and which must be shown to enter many public venues.The National Statistics Bureau, which oversees the census, vowed in May that all personal data gathered during the process will be kept strictly confidential and used for no other purpose than the census.The government in mid-October also separately unveiled a draft personal data protection law, which outlines stiff punishments for violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-starts-once-a-decade-census-data-collection-exercise/story-xqEaJt15HYuYU6G1THVasI.html
01-11-2020||World||Tropical Storm Eta expected to become hurricane by Monday||Forecasters expect the newly-formed Tropical Storm Eta to become a hurricane by Monday, shortly after the system formed in the Caribbean and tied the record for more named storms in a single Atlantic hurricane season.The system had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) early Sunday, the US National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. It was centered 205 miles (330 kilometers) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and 500 miles (805 kilometers) east of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Nicaragua/Honduras border.Forecasters expect Eta to become a hurricane by Monday. The system is forecast to be near the northeastern coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras by Tuesday morning. A hurricane watch was issued for parts of both countries. Eta was moving west at about 15 mph (24 kph).Rainfall totals could reach 15 inches (38 centimeters) in parts of Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and the southern coast of Hispaniola by Thursday evening. Local amounts of up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) could fall in portions of Honduras and Nicaragua, forecasters said.Eta is the 28th named Atlantic storm this season, tying the 2005 record for named storms. However, this is the first time the Greek letter Eta is being used as a storm name because in 2005, after the season ended meteorologists went back and determined there was a storm that should have gotten a name, but didn’t.Hurricane season still has a month to go, ending November 30. And in 2005, Zeta formed in the end of December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-eta-expected-to-become-hurricane-by-monday/story-vvrMfKvqQLTzlIWmfQHm8O.html

Talking at a National Security Council meeting, she instructed the government to bolster self-defence capabilities and stabilise economic and social order, along with increased intelligence gathering, reported Taipei Times.“The nation should modernize its defense capabilities, upgrade its asymmetric combat capabilities, promote indigenous arms development, and reform its reserve forces to brace for Beijing’s military expansion and aggression,” said Tsai.She also instructed the council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the US to maintain the support of both the Democratic Party, as well as the Republicans. Tsai advised the government to toe the line of Premier Su Tseng-chang who is working on Taiwan-US Economic and Commercial Dialogue, bilateral trade agreement, and negotiations with the US regarding the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in the light of Taiwan-US meetings about the TIFA that is suspended since 2017. “The Cabinet should take advantage of the Taiwan-US framework for strengthening basic infrastructure financing and market-building cooperation signed in September to promote supply chain cooperation in New Southbound Policy countries, as well as, Central and South American countries,” said Tsai at the council meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tsai-ing-wen-stresses-improved-relations-with-the-us/story-9cSICLuMrxvNTfYsDUH4XO.html
01-11-2020||World||Imran Khan grants provisional provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan amid massive protests||Despite the ongoing protests against the Pakistan government over its decision to change the status of Gilgit-Baltistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday announced the granting of provisional-provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan, Geo News reported. “One of the reasons for me coming to Gilgit-Baltistan is to announce that we have decided to grant Gilgit-Baltistan the provisional provincial status,” Khan said while speaking during his visit to Gilgit-Baltistan. This comes following Saudi Arabia removing Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan from Pakistan’s map. Massive protests have been taking place against the Imran Khan-led government over the issue of Gilgit Baltistan.This announcement is likely to spark massive outrage as it will have much wider implications which will set the tone for exacerbating tensions, that is already being played out in the east along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the India-China border.On October 8, in Muzaffarabad city of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), a massive protest was organised by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front and Student Liberation Front against the government’s decision to make Gilgit-Baltistan a province. Political activists said that they will sacrifice themselves but will not let Pakistan alter the status of the region. People from Gilgit-Baltistan, who have been living in other Pakistani towns, have also taken to the streets against Islamabad’s arbitrary decision.Gilgit- Baltistan, earlier known as Northern Areas has been governed by the “Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order of 2009”, which established an electoral framework. Elections have been held in the region under the Order that provides for only limited autonomy.The people accuse Pakistan of systematically exploiting the region of its resources and sharing no dividends with them. Any resistance they say meets brutal government reprisal with activists and leaders hounded, arrested and tortured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-grants-provisional-provincial-status-to-gilgit-baltistan-amid-massive-protests/story-hTYjKQpKv5EqV97ocrGq5K.html
01-11-2020||World||Super typhoon Goni batters Philippines, 1 million in shelters||A super typhoon slammed into the eastern Philippines with ferocious winds early Sunday, knocking down power in several towns and prompting the evacuation of about a million people in its likely path, including in the capital where the main airport was shut down.Typhoon Goni hit the island province of Catanduanes at dawn with sustained winds of 225 kilometers (140 miles) per hour and gusts of 280 kph (174 mph) — equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane. It was blowing west toward densely populated regions, including Manila, and rain-soaked provinces still recovering from a typhoon that hit a week ago and left at least 22 dead.There were initial reports of deaths, including a man who was reportedly pinned by a fallen tree in Albay province, but authorities said they were still verifying the details.About two hours after it blew ashore, the typhoon battered Albay with a slightly weaker sustained winds but more powerful gusts of 310 kph (193 mph), forecasters said.Diane Joco scrambled with her husband, parents, siblings and cousin out of their flimsy houses on stilts on the shores of Calauag town in Quezon province when the wind began to batter their wooden homes. Goni was forecast to hit parts of Quezon Sunday afternoon.Like many villagers, Joco and relatives decided not to evacuate and stayed in a neighbor’s sturdier house close to the coast to watch over their home.“We should be nearby to be able to repair any damage to our house quickly, otherwise it will fall apart and be blown away. We have no other house,” Joco told The Associated Press by phone. She suddenly yelled as she spoke, saying a part of the tin roof of her neighbor’s house was nearly ripped off by a frightening gust.Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara told a televised meeting of top disaster-response officials that at least two people died in his province while mudflows from Mayon volcano endangered some villagers. Other officials, however, said they were still checking those reports.Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government’s disaster-response agency, said the typhoon’s destructive force can cause major damage. “There are so many people who are really in vulnerable areas,” he said.The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within the next 12 hours, people will experience “catastrophic violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall associated with the region of the eyewall and inner rain bands.”Residents have been warned of likely landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 5 meters (16 feet) and powerful winds that can blow away shanties.One of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni has evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.Jalad said nearly a million people have been pre-emptively moved into emergency shelters. He warned of storm surges that could inundate coastal villages, including in Manila Bay.Forecasters said the typhoon’s eye may pass about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of metropolitan Manila, the sprawling capital of more than 13 million people, around nightfall on Sunday.Manila’s main airport was ordered shut down for 24 hours from Sunday to Monday and airlines canceled dozens of international and domestic flights. The military and national police, along with the coast guard, have been put on full alert.Hundreds of Covid-19 patients were moved to hospitals and hotels from tent quarantine centers, Jalad said. The war-like typhoon preparations will further strain government resources, which have been drained by months of coronavirus outbreaks. The Philippines has the second-largest number of confirmed infections in Southeast Asia.The Philippines is lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year. It’s also located in the so-called Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common and makes the poor Southeast Asian nation one of the world’s most disaster-prone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/super-typhoon-goni-batters-philippines-1-million-in-shelters/story-xbaCpg71OrubJa7ljYGVXL.html
01-11-2020||World||Sri Lanka faces tough time due to breakdown of key PCR machine amid surge in Covid-19 cases||Sri Lanka is facing a challenging time due to the delay in receiving Covid-19 test results, following the breakdown of a key testing machine amid a surge in the coronavirus cases, officials said. The island nation has so far recorded 10,663 Covid-19 cases and 20 deaths due to the disease.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 Health Ministry spokesman Dr Jayaruwan Bandara on Saturday said the main PCR testing machine at the Base Hospital in Mulleriyawa that can test 500-1,000 samples daily broke down earlier this week. Foreign technical experts are rectifying the fault of the malfunctioning machine and it would resume operation soon. Sri Lanka possesses 25 PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) test machines, which can test 8,000 samples daily. However, the breakdown of the PCR machine at the Base Hospital has hindered the detection of Covid-19 patients. Over 26,000 tests have been carried out so far in this laboratory. The laboratory, dedicated for Covid-19 testing, was built at a cost Rs 246 million with assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).The breakdown has resulted in the backlog of 20,000 PCR tests by Thursday, with a delay of about five days to release test results. “There is a delay in test reports, but it does not mean that the process has come to a halt,” Bandara said. He said the country lacks a fully automated testing system. “All tests are being done manually, virus separation takes about three hours and it takes another two hours to analyse the report. Then the printing -- all these take time,” he said, explaining the reason for the delay. Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy here said on Saturday that technical experts, who were rushed to Lanka from China, have identified the technical fault of the malfunctioning PCR testing machine after a 10-hour operation. The experts concluded that the machine would able to resume operation on Monday. Bandara said the nationwide coronavirus tally crossing the 10,000-mark is an indicator that public needs to be more aware to practice health safety measures to avoid the pandemic being spread further. Two big clusters, detected last month, have reported over 7,000 cases so far, he said. Bandara ruled out a nationwide lockdown again and said the public must help themselves and others by restricting their movements. The 72-hour quarantine curfew imposed on Western province -- which is also home to the capital, Colombo -- will also end on Monday, he said. Sri Lanka imposed a three-month lockdown until the end of June, with authorities lifting the restrictions after declaring that there was no community transmission of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-faces-tough-time-due-to-breakdown-of-key-pcr-machine-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-LUcsN9l7X7on7iUASEuT8H.html

According to local media reports, the rampage occurred near the Chateau Frontenac, on rue des Ramparts in the city.There’s no word as yet on a possible motive for the attacks. Quebec is the French-speaking province of Canada. The stabbing follows similar attacks in the past few weeks in France by Islamic radicals, and some Quebecers have been coming out to support France over the attacks there.The Service de police de la Ville de Québec, the city’s police department, warned residents to avoid the Parliament Hill area and asked them to remain inside. “We still ask the citizens of Quebec City to stay inside with the doors locked because an investigation is still underway,” the department said in a tweet in French.Reports said that the man was dressed in medieval costume and armed with a “bladed weapon.” Those injured in the incident were taken to a local hospital for treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-killed-five-injured-in-canada-stabbing-spree/story-vbXxYOgYzRxOEkG8tLbe8H.html

It’s not just that we have ever better medicines and therapies, and the realistic hope of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year,” Johnson said at a news conference.“We now have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable, and above all, rapid turnaround tests... that you can use yourself to tell you whether or not you’re infectious and get the result within 10 to 15 minutes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-prospects-to-give-reason-for-optimism-by-spring-2021-uk-pm-johnson/story-udmy7oqafrtvwTGKFsJUyL.html
01-11-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine predictions of pharma companies that didn’t come true||Numerous pharmaceutical companies have made predictions about coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines they are producing and most of them have turned out to be not true. After Covid-19 disease broke out last year and was termed a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March, pharma companies from around the world joined the race to be the first to bring out a vaccine.  Health officials too, have made forward-looking statements on the vaccine, but they have been less definitive that those made by pharma companies.Also Read: India’s daily Covid-19 count falls further, active cases remain below 6 lakhAccording to CNN, American physicist Dr Francis Collins, director of National Institutes of Health, told mediapersons that while he remains “cautiously optimistic” that the United States could have a Covid-19 vaccine authorised by the end of the year, there was a possibility that “it might take longer”.Top US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci had on Thursday based his assumption that initial doses of effective and safe Covid-19 vaccine could be available by December-end on current projections from pharma giants Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc.Pfizer had for weeks said it would know by October whether the vaccine it was producing was effective or not, but on Tuesday, according to news agency AFP, CEO Albert Bourla said the company still had not reached key benchmarks in assessing vaccine efficacy.  “We could supply some 40 million doses in the US in 2020 if clinical testing proceeds as expected,” he added.Also Read: England to enter into new month-long lockdown as UK virus cases pass 1 millionIn another such example, Oxford researcher Dr Adrian Hill told CNN that the vaccine being developed by his university and British firm AstraZeneca would be out by September. ”My guess is July would be good. August more likely. Might be September,” he said. ”We’re aiming for September but hoping to finish before that,” he said. Phase 3 trials of the vaccine are currently underway. Meanwhile, Moderna says it is on track to report early data from a late-stage trial of its Covid-19 vaccine in November. The pharma company is developing a vaccine called mRNA and says it expects to produce 20 million doses by the end of next year 2021.Covid-19 cases have crossed the 46 million-mark worldwide, according to the real-time statistics provider website worldometer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-predictions-of-pharma-companies-that-didn-t-come-true/story-Grx5OHIUufS0WM0vLjOjjO.html
01-11-2020||World||Donald Trump signs order to protect hydraulic fracking||US President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that he has signed an order to protect the American energy industry and hydraulic fracturing.“Just signed an order to protect fracking and the oil and gas industry. This means jobs, low energy bills, and continued American energy independence! Sleepy Joe [Biden] would ban fracking and destroy American energy jobs! He has no clue!” Trump tweeted.Trump said that hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, has become “one of the great success stories of our time,” opening up new sources of inexpensive and reliable energy and producing more jobs for Americans. In a memorandum released by the White House, Trump said, “As a result of new technologies and my Administration’s continued push for energy independence, our country recently became a net energy exporter for the first time since 1952, as well as the leading producer of oil and natural gas in the world. We are no longer beholden to foreign countries upon which we had depended for decades for the survival of our way of life.” According to a report from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), the use of fracking and other innovations had lowered energy prices thus saving US consumers USD 203 billion per year, or USD 2,500 in annual savings for a family of four.“This memorandum sets forth policies related to protecting American jobs, economic opportunities, and national security by ensuring appropriate support of hydraulic fracturing and other innovative technologies for the use of domestic natural resources, including energy resources. In support of these policies, this memorandum directs certain officials to assess the potential effects of efforts to ban or restrict the use of such technologies,” the White House said.In the memorandum, Trump stated that the lower energy prices that are the result of fracking benefit mostly low-income households in the US as they spend a larger share of their income on energy bills. “The CEA estimated that greater productivity had reduced the domestic price of natural gas by 63 per cent as of 2018; had led to a 45 per cent decrease in the wholesale price of electricity; and had reduced the global price of oil by 10 per cent as of 2019,” Trump’s memorandum reads.Trump has been a strong supporter of the oil industry in the United States. This election year he has criticized his Democratic rival Joe Biden for wanting to ban fracking, Sputnik reported. Biden, in the last presidential debate, had said he would not ban fracking if elected, but later mentioned he would eventually like to make a transition from the oil industry to clean energy production.The US Presidential elections are to be held on November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-signs-order-to-protect-hydraulic-fracking/story-wWQ9LrzLgHNjeXHQR2gOxJ.html

But the party elite, to whom the delegates are close, favour Laschet.Germany must hold its next federal election by Oct. 24, 2021 at the latest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-s-party-set-to-decide-on-her-successor-in-january/story-sSBWH5lC1sKDtIXuqSgQ0J.html
01-11-2020||World||Vote Donald Trump out of presidency; has divided, failed America: Joe Biden||Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden has urged the Americans to vote out President Donald Trump of presidency, alleging he has divided and failed the nation in the last four years. Trump, a Republican, is being challenged by Biden in the November 3 elections.“In three days, we can put an end to a presidency that has divided this nation. In three days, we can put an end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation. In three days, we can put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation,” Biden made in a passionate appeal at a drive in car rally in Detroit, Michigan, a battleground State.Biden said he was quite confident this time that Americans would vote Trump out of power. “Millions of Americans have already voted. Millions more will vote in the days ahead. And my message to you is simple: The power to change this country is in your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries. There is nothing that is going to stop the people of this nation from voting,” he said.Asserting that when America votes, America will be heard, Biden said that when America is heard, he believes the message is going to be loud and clear. “It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We’re done with the chaos. The tweets. The anger. The hate. The failure. The irresponsibility,” said the former vice president, launching a scathing attack against Trump.“We’ve got a lot of work to do. And if I’m elected your president, we’re going to do it. We’re going to act. We’re going to act to get Covid under control,” he said.Biden mocked at Trump, saying he was laughed by the world when spoke last time at the UN. “The President likes to portrays himself as a tough guy, a macho man. But when’s the last time you saw the President of the United States literally being laughed at by world leaders when he spoke at the United Nations? When’s the last time you saw a President of the United States being openly mocked by our allies at a NATO conference?” he asked.“And can you believe we have a President who acts like Vladimir Putin’s puppy? Putin put bounties on the heads of American soldiers serving in Afghanistan and Trump was too scared to challenge him. Donald Trump is not strong. He’s weak,” Biden charged.Alleging that Trump commands virtually no respect on the international stage, Biden said that this is a President who not only doesn’t understand sacrifice, he doesn’t understand the courage, the physical courage it takes to serve in uniform.Earlier in the day, he gave an identical speech in Flint, Michigan. “We have to vote to meet the climate crisis. Donald Trump calls it a hoax. I see it as jobs and health and safety,” he said. “The impacts of climate change too often fall disproportionately on communities of colour. We’ll make sure these communities benefit from hundreds of billions in federal investments in infrastructure and climate change. That will create local jobs to rebuild roads, fill the sidewalk cracks, install broadband, and create spaces to live, work, and play safely,” he added.Biden said that it makes a gigantic difference, once volunteering.“That’s how you win campaigns, every campaign that I’ve ever been in that I’ve won it’s been the folks who’ve been doing everything from making the phone calls, to sending out the petitions to knocking on doors...I mean you make a gigantic difference,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vote-donald-trump-out-of-presidency-has-divided-failed-america-joe-biden/story-ZtPHGcYaNrMLo4InCIQLHI.html
01-11-2020||World||President Trump protected US Constitution; can revive economy after pandemic, say his supporters||President Donald Trump has protected the US Constitution, ensured freedom of religion and expression of speech in America, his supporters in two adjoining battleground States of Ohio and Pennsylvania have said, emphasising that it is only him who can create jobs and revive the country’s economy after the pandemic.Many of the supporters, including a large number of women and small business owners, on Saturday argued that Trump is not influenced by anyone and has taken a strong stand against countries like China and Mexico to save America’s interest.“He is a Constitutional president. He just loves America. He did not have do this. He is a billionaire. He could have just retired and gone away. And instead, he is doing this all for us to keep us free,” Mexcine, a strong supporter of Trump, told PTI at the Pittsburgh-Butler Regional Airport, where Trump addressed one of his four rallies in Pennsylvania on Saturday.Trump, a Republican, is being challenged by his Democratic rival Joe Biden in the November 3 election.Mexine alleged that Biden has done nothing for the last 47 years, and puts fear into people instead of promise. “A lot of Americans don’t do well when they are frightened,” Mexcine said, adding that she would like President Trump to work towards keeping the country ‘more united’ and ‘keep doing what he is doing’ in the next term.Kane, another Trump supporter, said: “He has done so much for the country, while being in the office. Him being a billionaire, he just doesn’t have to do this. He cares about the country. He does not lie. He is not lying to us like the other side. And he values life. He is pro-life”.She disputed the argument on Trump’s tax return. “This job has nothing to do with his tax returns. He does not even take a salary being a president. He gives this to charity, she said. The New York Times had reported in September, claiming that the Republican leader paid USD 750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017, and also he avoided federal taxes for years. At the same time Kanne acknowledged that the country is divided more than it was four years ago. “I do not know why. I believe, it is the other side who is dividing it,” she alleged.Craig Roberts, who six months ago started a manufacturing job in rural Pennsylvania and says has created 17 jobs in the country, said that he is voting for Trump because of his policies on China that is bringing manufacturing jobs back. “We prefer Trump. One of the most important issue is that we are getting our supply chain out of China and into friendlier countries like India and Mexico and then back to the US,” he said.In the next term, Roberts wants President Trump to keep taxes low and get the supply chain back from China.Protection of religious rights and Christian values is the biggest issue for Chip, who attended Trump’s rally at Butler along with his wife. “Both are safe under Trump,” he said, explaining the reasons for his vote to the Republican incumbent. The president’s performance in the first term is “better than expected,” he said.“He is not your typical president, but seems to be getting things done,” he said, adding that the values and policies of Democratic presidential candidate Biden does not align with his believes.Sherrod, who came to the Trump rally with his wife and three kids, said that he is voting for Trump because he cares for freedom. “Freedom of speech. Freedom of religion,” he said, adding that the president offers him all the freedom that he wants. Biden is just “the opposite of that,” he said. “I think, he is all about power. That’s what I think about the Democratic party in power. Anything for power,” he said.Bruce Barns, who works in the service sector, said that he is worried that if the Democrats come to power, taxes are going to go up through the roof. His (Trump’s) first term has been really good, when you look at from the stand point of imports, trying to get jobs back home, and bringing the unemployment to a record low, pre-COVID-19,” Barns said.Reviving the country’s economy is the biggest thing done by Trump in the last three and half years. “I have more hours of work than before,” Eden said at an election rally in Youngstown, Ohio. “I do not want our country to be taken over by the Democrats,” he said.Mark McGrail, who does title searches for oil and gas industry in Ohio, said that prior to Covid-19, Trump created one of the best economy for the United States in the last 60 years. “The Biden-Harris ticket will kill the American economy. You look at the so-called Green New Deal. Energy is the life and blood of our country. And they tend to kill the energy sector of our economy,” Mark said in response to a question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-protected-us-constitution-can-revive-economy-after-pandemic-say-his-supporters/story-tD70zsKJrhWA5eDzrM76UN.html
01-11-2020||World||Donald Trump is a warrior; needs four more years as president: Ivanka||US President Donald Trump is a warrior and needs four more years in the White House, his daughter Ivanka Trump has said, asserting that he delivered more than his commitment to his countrymen. Addressing a large crowd on Saturday in Ohio, which is a battleground State for the November 3 presidential election, Ivanka said Trump has taken the US in the right direction in the last four years, including undoing the wrongs of his predecessors and political leadership for the past several decades. “Now more than ever America needs four more years of a warrior in the White House. My father fights so hard every single day for each of us. Now we have an opportunity to fight for him and fight for the future of this country,” she said. Trump, a Republican, is being challenged by his Democratic rival Joe Biden in the November 3 elections.Ivanka, the elder daughter of President Trump, is also a senior presidential advisor at the White House and has been playing an important role on issues like women, children, youths, jobs and unemployment. “With your help, your voice and your vote on November 3, we will win another historic victory and we will make America greater than ever before,” she said.Senator Robert Portman, who introduced Ivanka, described her as a superstar daughter of President Trump.“When I came to Washington, I quickly learned why the political establishment worked so hard to keep our president out of office. In the swamp, it is easy for politicians to survive, if they silence their convictions and if they skip the hard fights,” she said.“I was shocked to see just how many of these major challenges were kept unsolved so that they can campaign on the same issue in the next election. It’s really shocking. It happens all the time,” she said.Ivanka said the mission of Trump is to make America great again. “Trump did not come to Washington to win the praise of the Beltway elites. Donald Trump came to Washington for one reason, one reason only to make America great again,” she said.Ivanka, along with her brother Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump and sister Tiffney, has been aggressively campaigning in the battleground States seeking votes for her father. Like father and brother Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka has similar talking points, but connects with the audience very quickly, with short punch lines and interactive remarks.On Saturday, she asked for young kids in Halloween costumes. The moment she identified two young boys in the front rows dressed up in Halloween costumes, she asked them to join her on the stage. She chatted with the two for a few minutes and praised their dress. Later in her speech, she told the audience that she celebrated her birthday a day earlier on the road. The crowd immediately erupted in “Happy Birthday to You” song that lasted for about a minute.In her speech that lasted for about 35 minutes, she recognised several local entrepreneurs who have brought manufacturing back to Ohio and she spent an equal amount of time interacting with the several hundred people who had come to listen to her speech.“I’m sure there are some former Democrats here. I meet them across the country. Raise your hand… Look at that. The tent is growing,” she said. “The Democratic Party has a platform that lays out a plan to transform America into a socialist country,” she asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-is-a-warrior-needs-four-more-years-as-president-ivanka/story-nkdQDlQxX8ALTwUdmFMpzK.html
01-11-2020||World||Super Typhoon Goni makes landfall in Philippines||Super Typhoon Goni slammed into the Philippines Sunday with authorities warning of “catastrophic” conditions in the region expected to receive the hardest hit, where nearly a million people have been evacuated.The strongest typhoon of the year so far made landfall on Catanduanes Island at 4:50 am (2050 GMT Saturday) with maximum sustained wind speeds of 225 kilometres (140 miles) per hour, the state weather forecaster said.Over the next 12 hours, “catastrophic violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall” would be experienced in the Bicol region, which covers the southern end of the main island of Luzon and Catanduanes, it said.“This a particularly dangerous situation for these areas.”Goni -- which intensified into a “super” typhoon as it neared the Philippines -- comes a week after Typhoon Molave hit the same region of the natural disaster-prone archipelago.That storm killed 22 people and flooded low-lying villages and farmland, before crossing the South China Sea to Vietnam.“It looks like we will have really strong winds, increasing the chances of widespread flooding and landslides,” Mark Timbal, spokesman for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, told local broadcaster ABS-CBN on Saturday.“Storm surges are imminent on our east coast. We are monitoring Mayon and Taal volcanoes for possible volcanic mud flows.”Civil Defense chief Ricardo Jalad said “almost a million” people had left their homes in the Bicol region.Authorities spent Saturday marshalling rescue vehicles, emergency response teams and relief goods before the storm’s arrival.There was a “high risk” of potentially life-threatening storm surges of more than three metres (10 feet) high along parts of the coast, which could inundate low-lying areas, it warned.A storm surge of up to three metres is also forecast for coastal areas of the capital Manila. Covid complicates evacuationsSchools which have been empty since the start of the coronavirus pandemic are being used as emergency shelters as are government-run evacuation centres and gymnasiums.“Evacuating people is more difficult at this time because of Covid-19,” Bicol regional civil defence spokesman Alexis Naz told AFP.Mary Ann Echague, 23, and her family fled their home in the coastal city of Legazpi to an inland primary school where they were sheltering in a classroom with several other families.“We fear the wrath of the typhoon,” said Echague, who was with her two children, parents and siblings. They had carried with them a portable stove, tinned meat, instant noodles, coffee, bread, blankets and pillows.“Each time we’re hit by a typhoon our house gets damaged, since it’s made of wood and galvanised iron roofing,” she said.“We have always managed. We find a way to get by.”Hundreds of people have been left stranded after the coastguard ordered ferries and fishing boats into port in expectation of rough seas throwing up 16-metre waves.Goni is expected to weaken as it crosses southern Luzon and enters the South China Sea early Monday, the state forecaster said.The Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor.Its deadliest on record was Super Typhoon Haiyan, which unleashed giant waves on the central city of Tacloban and left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/super-typhoon-goni-makes-landfall-in-philippines/story-x5x0IoZWP6tH2QvQvvNvPM.html
01-11-2020||World||Barack Obama says Donald Trump failed to take pandemic, presidency seriously||Calling Joe Biden his “brother,” Barack Obama has accused Donald Trump of failing to take the coronavirus pandemic and the presidency seriously as Democrats leaned on America’s first Black president to energise Black voters in battleground Michigan on the final weekend of the 2020 campaign. Obama, the 44th president, and Biden, his vice president who wants to be the 46th, on Saturday held drive-in rallies in Flint and Detroit, predominantly Black cities where strong turnout will be essential to swing the longtime Democratic state to Biden’s column after Trump won it in 2016.The memories of Trump’s win in Michigan and the rest of the Upper Midwest are still searing in the minds of many Democrats during this closing stretch before Tuesday’s election. That leaves Biden in the position of holding a consistent lead in the national polls and an advantage in most battlegrounds, including Michigan, yet still facing anxiety it could all slip away.As of Saturday morning, nearly 90 million voters had already cast ballots nationwide, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Tens of millions more will vote by the time polls close on Tuesday night.Obama said he initially hoped “for the country’s sake” that Trump “might take the job seriously. He never has.” The former president, addressing voters in dozens of cars in a Flint high school parking lot, seized on Trump’s continued focus on the size of his campaign crowds.“Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized?” Obama mocked. “The country’s going through a pandemic. That’s not what you’re supposed to be worrying about.” Trump made an aggressive play for pivotal Pennsylvania, focusing largely on his white, working-class base. His first of four scheduled stops in Pennsylvania was in a small town in Bucks County on the eastern edge of the state.Repeating what has become a consistent part of his closing message, Trump raised baseless concerns about election fraud, pointing specifically at Philadelphia, a city whose large African American population is key to Biden’s fate in the state.“They say you have to be very, very careful — what happens in Philadelphia,” Trump charged. “Everybody has to watch.” The president also railed against a recent Supreme Court ruling that will allow Pennsylvania to count mail ballots received as many as three days after polls close. The extra time, Trump alleged without evidence, would allow for fraud and potentially deny him a win in the state. “What’s going on?” he asked during a late afternoon rally in Reading, Pennsylvania. “That was a very disappointing opinion, but I’ve had many disappointing opinions from the Supreme Court.” Several studies, including one commissioned by Trump himself, have failed to uncover any significant examples of election fraud. Good-government advocacy groups are concerned that the president’s repeated calls for his supporters to monitor the polls may lead to widespread voter intimidation. Republicans are betting that Trump can win a second term by driving up turnout among his strongest supporters — white, noncollege-educated men and rural voters — while limiting Biden’s advantage with Blacks and Latinos. Democrats in several swing states worry that voters of colour may not be excited enough about Biden to show up in the numbers they need.In Michigan, Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents the Flint area, said he had been pressing for a couple of months for Biden or Obama to visit the majority Black city where a water crisis that began in 2014 sickened the city’s residents, exposing stark racial inequities.“Showing up matters,” Kildee said. “The message is important, no question about it. But there’s a message implicit in showing up, especially in Flint. This is a community that has felt left behind many, many times and overlooked many, many times.” R&B legend Stevie Wonder was to perform in Detroit after Biden and Obama speak.Biden’s campaign announced it was sending Obama to Florida and Georgia on Monday. He is the campaign’s most valuable asset to help energize the nonwhite voters Democrats so badly need to defeat Trump. “Joe Biden is my brother. I love Joe Biden, and he will be a great president,” Obama said Saturday.The press for Michigan’s Black voters comes after voting was down roughly 15 per cent in Flint and Detroit four years ago — a combined 48,000-plus votes in a state Trump carried by about 10,700 votes. Overall, the Black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election, falling to 59.6 per cent in 2016 after reaching a record-high 66.6 per cent four years earlier, according to the Pew Research Center.Trump isn’t ceding Michigan to Biden. He visited Waterford Township, near Detroit, on Friday and held a rally in the state capital, Lansing, this past week, though the surging coronavirus cases are clouding his presidency.The worst week of the year, in terms of new infections, arrived with Election Day looming. More than 99,000 Americans reported new infections on Friday, a record high, according to Johns Hopkins University. Trump told Pennsylvania voters that his administration has done “an incredible job” dealing with the pandemic. He promised that the mass distribution of a vaccine was “just weeks away.”(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-says-donald-trump-failed-to-take-pandemic-presidency-seriously/story-LkkmU0yLqOo08C1yFNcK4L.html
01-11-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden barrel through key states on final weekend before vote||Donald Trump, challenger Joe Biden and their top surrogates were barreling through crucial states in the industrial Midwest and the coastal southeast on Saturday, in a frantic sprint to mobilize voters as they pressed their closing arguments with the US presidential election only days away.Using some of his most urgent language yet, Trump warned of “bedlam in our country” if no clear winner emerges quickly in the November 3 election, saying, without evidence, that it could take weeks to sort out a result and that “very bad things” could happen in the interim.Biden meantime told backers it was “time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home.”Underscoring the high stakes -- and the disruptive impact of the coronavirus pandemic -- a record 90 million early votes have already been cast, as the bruising contest heads toward the biggest turnout in at least a century. The virus has killed nearly 230,000 Americans, ravaged the world’s largest economy and was infecting record numbers of people across the US.Trump was focusing Saturday on the key battleground state of Pennsylvania -- “the state where the story of American independence began,” he said in the small city of Newtown, the first of four stops in that state amid a frenetic final sprint.Biden made his first joint appearance of the campaign with his former boss Barack Obama -- probably the most popular Democrat in the country -- in Flint, Michigan as they scramble to boost turnout in a state Trump carried by a razor-thin margin in 2016.Vice President Mike Pence, meantime, was campaigning in narrowly divided North Carolina while Biden’s running mate Kamala Harris was in Florida, another vitally important swing state.Pennsylvania has emerged as one of the top prizes this year. In his motorcade en route to rural Bucks County, the president passed hundreds of supporters holding up a forest of pro-Trump signs. The crowd then booed reporters in trailing vehicles.In remarks at an event there, Trump lashed out at Biden, saying he would shut down the state’s fossil-fuel industry.The president claimed credit for creating the “greatest economy in the history of this country -- the history of the world” -- while “foreign nations are in freefall.”Despite recent signs of recovery, however, millions remain jobless.And the race has been overshadowed by the surging pandemic, which had even sickened Trump and many members of his staff. More than 94,000 new infections were recorded Friday in the US -- another new high -- and total cases passed nine million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.In stark contrast to Trump, who has belittled mask-wearing by Biden and others, the Democrat has scrupulously followed the guidance of public health experts.After Biden and Obama appeared Saturday before a socially distanced drive-in rally in Flint, they made an unannounced stop in suburban Bloomfield Hills before heading later to Detroit to be joined by superstar singer Stevie Wonder. Biden leads in the state by nearly seven points, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls. The state’s 16 electoral votes could provide a sizable leap towards the 270 needed to win the White House. Trump, in eking out his 2016 victory, took advantage of low turnout rates among Michigan Blacks. As Biden campaigns with the nation’s first Black president, he clearly hopes to change that.Obama pulled few punches in Flint, saying 140,000 American lives would have been saved if the president had taken an approach to the pandemic similar to Canada’s. Trump, he added, was on course to be the first president in nearly a century to preside over a net job loss.Biden then took the stage to tear into Trump. “We’re done with the chaos, the tweets, the anger, the failure, the refusal to take any responsibility,” he said.The election takes place in a deeply divided country, with feelings so raw that gun sales have surged in some areas. Businesses in some cities, including Washington, are protectively boarding their windows, and police are preparing for the possibility of violence.Biden’s campaign announced he will address the nation on election night, after a vote that will undoubtedly leave millions bitterly disappointed, no matter who wins.Chasing every voteOn Friday the two candidates carried their battle to the American Midwest, barnstorming three heartland states each as they chased every last vote.Trump, who has long said the virus will “disappear,” remained defiant at rallies in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. He again downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, saying, “If you get it, you’re going to get better, and then you’re going to be immune.”After a campaign largely muted by the pandemic, Biden has taken the offensive, pushing Trump onto the back foot in unexpected battlegrounds like Texas, a large, traditionally conservative bastion now seen as a toss-up.On Friday, the state reported that a staggering nine million residents had already voted, surpassing its 2016 total.Harris visited Texas Friday in a bid to turn the state Democratic for the first time since 1976.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-barrel-through-key-states-on-final-weekend-before-vote/story-RfmPfsTEU6cgI2NygzMEtL.html
01-11-2020||World||US officials warn close vote will fuel Russian disinformation||Russia will continue to use disinformation to attempt to meddle in US politics no matter who wins the presidential election, but a close result would intensify its efforts, current and former US officials warned.The Russian effort in a close contest would probably focus on casting doubt on the integrity of the vote, the officials said. US intelligence has assessed that Russia is working to undermine former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign.“If it is close, expect a lot of noise about voter fraud and miscounting. This will happen in any case, but the Russians will amplify it,” said James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.One scenario troubling US officials is the possibility of simple, highly visible tactics that may create distrust about the integrity of the vote. For example, overwhelming state and local websites with traffic until they go offline -- a tactic known as distributed denial of service, or DDoS for short -- could create concern about the election’s integrity, which could be fanned on social media, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.A close election would probably exacerbate the problem. The US government has warned that if the vote count takes days, criminals and foreign actors might spread disinformation including “reports of voter suppression, cyber-attacks targeting election infrastructure, voter or ballot fraud or other problems intended to convince the public of the elections’ illegitimacy.”Bracing for DisinformationOfficials are bracing for disinformation in the aftermath of the election regardless of the outcome, but the intensity of Kremlin influence operations -- both in the days and the years that follow -- will depend on how the election plays out. A decisive victory on Nov. 3 for either candidate, however, means less fertile ground for Russia in the immediate aftermath of the election.Since 2016, other foreign powers have picked up Russian tactics. US intelligence is also warning that Iran and China are working to sway voters to advance their geopolitical goals. National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina said in a July statement that Russia prefers Trump, while China and Iran prefer Biden.But Russia remains a primary concern for many US officials and security experts given its track record and its continued brazenness in trying to influence American politics.An easing up by Russian trolls is unlikely if President Donald Trump is re-elected. They haven’t been deterred from targeting the US with cyber tactics and amplifying disinformation online in his first term, even as social media companies have taken more steps to weed out foreign campaigns and domestic influence campaigns have grown in volume and influence, the experts say.Four years after Russian actors hacked into Democratic Party emails and waged an online campaign to help Trump and sow chaos, they have continued to try to influence the current campaign, probing state and local systems, spreading disinformation on social media and sending phishing emails to political targets, according to social media companies and government officials.‘Absolutely Clear’“I am absolutely clear that by the intelligence we have gathered, we have full confidence that the Russians are going after our elections,” said Trump’s former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in an Oct. 29 interview with CBS News. “They are doing it now. They are going to continue to do it.”Biden has promised a tougher stance on Russian election meddling, and if he wins, the Kremlin may have reason to rethink the level of aggression in its use of disinformation, experts say. Regardless of U.S. response, disinformation is too effective a tool for Russia to give up altogether anytime soon, they said.“It is asymmetrical warfare and super cheap for them,” said Darren Linvill, an associate professor at Clemson University and lead researcher in its Media Forensics Hub. The small cost of producing such attacks is virtually the only price Russia is currently paying for disinformation, he said.Michael Daniel, who coordinated cybersecurity for the Obama administration, also said Russia won’t see much downside in continuing to use influence operations “for the foreseeable future.”“A much tougher question is what it would take to persuade the Russians to stop or dramatically scale back this activity,” said Daniel, the president and chief executive officer of the Cyber Threat Alliance.Biden has said his responses to foreign election meddling may range from sanctions to cyber-attacks.“If Biden wins, the Russians will test him to see how much they can still get away with,” said Lewis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-warn-close-vote-will-fuel-russian-disinformation/story-XkRInbW7R9rDQG30QVYsaP.html
01-11-2020||World||England in lockdown 2 from Thursday; Covid-19 cases cross 1 million||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday announced another lockdown in England from Thursday until December 2 after expert modelling predicted a sharp rise in deaths by December if tougher action is not taken and the overall number of Covid-19 cases in the UK crossed one million.The main difference from the first lockdown in March is that schools and universities will be allowed to remain open. Non-essential retail, restaurants, pubs and other hospitality sectors will remain closed, besides other restrictions on travel and leisure.The basic message is to ‘stay home’.Johnson said: “No one wants to be imposing these kind of measures anywhere…Our hope was that by strong local action strong local leadership, we could get the rates of infection down, whether disease was surging and address the problem, thereby across the whole country”.“We’ve got to be humble in the face of nature, and in this country. Alas, as across much of Europe, the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst case scenario of our scientific advisors, whose models now suggests that unless we act, we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day, a peak of mortality, alas, bigger than the one we saw in April”.An official statement said on Saturday evening: “Between 31 January and 31 October 2020, there have been 1,011,660 people who have had a confirmed positive test result,” adding that there were 21,915 new cases and 326 deaths in the last 24 hours.The second lockdown has been announced for England, the largest and most populated constituent of the United Kingdom, with local lockdown and tighter restrictions already in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scotland advised against travel to and from England.Latest modelling of deaths by experts from Imperial College London, University of Warwick, University of Cambridge and others predicted at least over 2,000 deaths per day – more than twice the peak earlier this year – by December, if another lockdown is not imposed. One of the models envisaged 4,000 deaths per day.The modelling, showed to Johnson and ministers on Friday, is said to have changed the government’s regional approach, which so far focused on a three-level alert system based on the number of cases at local levels, so that sectors of economy in areas with low cases could continue.The first lockdown, announced on March 23, led to a major fall in the number of new cases, deaths and hospital admissions. The development encouraged ministers to introduce the ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme in August, which now faces criticism for being partly responsible for the surge in cases.Other UK constituents are already under tougher local restrictions. Wales is under lockdown until November 9; Scotland’s new five-tiered system of restrictions will come into force on Monday; and in Northern Ireland, pubs and restaurants were closed for four weeks on October 16, with the exception of takeaways and deliveries.France, Belgium and Germany have already imposed tighter restrictions as the second wave of Covid-19 sweeps across Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-in-lockdown-2-from-thursday-covid-19-cases-cross-1-million/story-JpF71BUN86foEwW9dCoChN.html
01-11-2020||World||Early voting in US election tops 90 million||More than 90 million Americans have cast ballots in the US presidential election, according to a tally on Saturday from the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, setting the stage for the highest participation rate in over a century.The record-breaking pace, about 65% of the total turnout in 2016, reflects intense interest in the vote, in which incumbent Donald Trump, a Republican, is up against Democratic nominee Joe Biden, a former vice president.Huge numbers of people have voted by mail or at early in-person polling sites amid concerns about exposure to the coronavirus at busy Election Day voting places.Trump trails Biden in national opinion polls amid criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of Covid-19, which has killed nearly 229,000 people in the United States, with numbers of new infections once again breaking daily records as Election Day nears on Tuesday.Democrats hold a significant advantage in early voting due to their embrace of postal ballots, which Republicans have historically cast in large numbers but have shunned amid repeated and unfounded attacks by Trump, who says the system is prone to widespread fraud.Experts have predicted turnout will easily surpass the 138 million who voted in 2016. Only 47 million votes were submitted before Election Day four years ago.In 20 states that report party registration data, 19.9 million registered Democrats have already voted, compared with 13 million Republicans and 10.1 million with no party affiliation. The data does not show for whom the votes were cast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-voting-in-us-election-tops-90-million/story-7SnWiuC7B3dR6UyrZkG3uI.html
01-11-2020||World||US daily cases top record 100k; president Donald Trump turns ire at docs||Daily Covid-19 cases in the US hit a new global record of more than 100,000, pushing hospitals closer to the brink of capacity just four days ahead of the presidential election in which the pandemic is the top issue.Cases reached 100,233 on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, which is a new single-day record for the fifth time in the past 10 days for the US, surpassing the previous peak of 91,248 new infections posted a day earlier.It also represented the world’s highest national daily toll during the pandemic, exceeding India’s 24-hour record of 97,894 set in September. Total cases in the US topped 9 million, with more than 230,000 deaths.At an election rally on Friday, Trump alleged that doctors were getting paid more to attribute deaths to Covid-19 as opposed to other causes. “Our doctors get more money if someone dies from Covid,” he said in Michigan. His Democratic rival Joe Biden called out the president.“Did you hear what he said again today? He said that our doctors who are putting their lives on the line busting their necks, are making up deaths from Covid because they ’get more money’”.“Doctors and nurses go to work every day to save lives — they do their jobs,” Biden said.Deprived of big, raucous crowds due to Covid curbs, Trump delivered the shortest stump speech yet this cycle, around 21 minutes, to an audience of merely 250 people in Rochester, Minnesota. And he was not happy about it. “Your far-left Democrat attorney general, Keith Ellison, and your Democrat governor (Tim Walz) tried to shut down our rally, silence the people of Minnesota, and take away your freedom of assembly,” Trump told supporters. “They thought we would cancel—but I will never abandon Minnesota!”Trump lost Minnesota in the last election, but so narrowly that he has been tempted to seek a win there to offset vulnerabilities and potential reverses in his 2016 pathway to victory. But just four days from the close of polling on Tuesday, Trump is trailing Biden in the state by a wide margin of 8.1 percentage points at this time, in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls and by 4.7 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Trump is behind Biden countrywide, by 8.9 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls and by 7.9 points in the aggregated average of RealClearPolitics, which also has the former vice-president in the lead by 3.2 points in the top battleground states — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona.Trump and Biden will be crisscrossing battleground states over the remaining four days, with more than 87 million Americans having voted already in person or by mail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-daily-cases-top-record-100k-president-donald-trump-turns-ire-at-docs/story-97J3l7Ua2CTZHkVKuid73H.html
