She says there will be about 10 million doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine.Dr. Robin Shattock, one of the scientists behind another vaccine developed by Imperial College London, says it’s possible several vaccines will be needed to stop the pandemic.“The first vaccines may reach the bar of preventing severe disease, but they may not necessarily block transmission,” he says.Shattock says later vaccines likely will be more potent, but it’s still unclear how long immunity lasts and vaccines “most likely they will need to be boosted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-to-evaluate-data-for-potential-coronavirus-vaccines-to-roll-out-by-dec/story-EQrADQ54a3EgyZCIFp0KuN.html
04-11-2020||World||Ethiopia nears war as Prime Minister orders military action against regional government||Ethiopia’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning Prime Minister on Wednesday ordered the military to confront the country’s Tigray regional government after he said it carried out a deadly attack on a military base overnight, citing months of “provocation and incitement” and declaring “the last red line has been crossed.”The statement by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s office, and the reported attack by the well-armed Tigray People’s Liberation Front(TPLF), immediately raised concerns that one of Africa’s most populous and powerful countries could plunge back into war. That would send a shock wave through the Horn of Africa and beyond.Addressing the nation on TV, Abiy announced “several martyrs” in the attack in Mekele, the northern Tigray region’s capital, and Dansha town. The Prime Minister said “the end is near” for the regional force, which is based in Ethiopia’s most sensitive region, neighboring Eritrea. The two countries made peace in 2018 after a long border war.The TPLF had been the dominant part of Ethiopia’s governing coalition before Abiy took office in 2018 and announced sweeping political reforms that won him the Nobel last year. Those reforms, however, have opened space for old ethnic and other grievances. The TPLF, feeling marginalized, left the coalition last year. It remains a strong military force, observers say.Ethiopia on Wednesday declared a six-month state of emergency in the Tigray region, saying that “illegal and violent activities within the National Regional State of Tigray are endangering the constitution and constitutional order, public peace and security, specially threatening the country’s sovereignty.”There was no immediate word from the TPLF, and all internet and phone lines were cut in the Tigray region following the announcement. Tigray TV reported that airspace has been closed over the region, and it asserted that the northern command of Ethiopia’s military had defected to the Tigray government. The Prime Minister’s office told The Associated Press the defection report was “not true.”Ethiopia was already stressed by a dispute with Egypt over a massive Ethiopian dam project that has drawn rare attention by President Donald Trump to Africa, and by a multi-layer crisis with the Covid-19 pandemic, deadly ethnic violence and a locust outbreak.Now the greatest test of Abiy’s rule has has come.Tigray officials have objected to the postponement of Ethiopia’s national election, once set for August, because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the extension of Abiy’s time in office.On Sunday, a senior TPLF official, Getachew Reda, told the AP his side will not accept a negotiation with the federal government.“What we need now is a national dialogue, not a negotiation,” he said. The TPLF says the release of detained former officials is one precondition to opening talks.In September, people in Tigray voted in a local election, defying the federal government and increasing political tensions. Last month the federal government moved to send funding for the region to local administrations instead of the regional government, angering TPLF officials.“This war is the worst possible outcome of the tensions that have been brewing,” William Davison, International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Ethiopia, said Wednesday, urging a ceasefire. “Given Tigray’s relatively strong security position, the conflict may well be protracted and disastrous.”Abiy’s statement asserted that the TPLF attacked a military base in Tigray early Wednesday and attempted to take artillery and other equipment. The statement accused the TPLF of arming and organizing irregular militias.After months of “extreme patience” by the federal government, “a war however cannot be prevented only on the goodwill and decision of one side,” the Prime Minister’s statement said. “The last red line has been crossed with this morning’s attacks and the federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation” to save the country.Observers have worried for months about the growing tensions and their implications for the long turbulent Horn of Africa region, where Abiy cast himself as a peacemaker shortly after taking office.A report by the United States Institute of Peace said the fragmentation of Ethiopia “would be the largest state collapse in modern history, likely leading to mass interethnic and interreligious conflict ... and a humanitarian and security crisis at the crossroads of Africa and the Middle East on a scale that would overshadow the existing conflicts in South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.”The international community needs to rally around the idea of national dialogue in Ethiopia, the International Crisis Group warned a week ago.“The alternative, given the country’s multiple and bitter divides, is a potential march to war that would be catastrophic for Africa’s second most populous country and would send shock waves, and refugees, into other Horn of Africa countries as well as across the Mediterranean,” the group wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopia-nears-war-as-prime-minister-orders-military-action-against-regional-government/story-oyj6qxoHjDjhZbXnkFOdwN.html

Two teenagers died on the Greek island of Samos, which lies south of the epicenter of Friday’s earthquake. The US Geological Survey registered the quake’s magnitude at 7.0, although other agencies recorded it as less severe.Mehmet Gulluoglu, head of Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, said search and rescue operations had been completed at 17 buildings that fell in Izmir. The rescue operation has been roaring at full tilt since Friday, pulling 107 survivors from the rubble.Of the 1,035 people injured in the quake, 137 remained hospitalized on Wednesday, the agency added.Following a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged not to give up until the final person was recovered. Rescuers’ spirits were raised Tuesday when they pulled a 3-year-old girl from the wreckage of her family home 91 hours after the quake.The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul, as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Some 1,700 aftershocks followed, 45 of which were greater than 4.0 magnitude.In Izmir, the quake reduced buildings to rubble or saw floors pancake in on themselves. Authorities have detained nine people, including contractors, for questioning over the collapse of six of the buildings.Turkey has a mix of older buildings and new buildings make of cheap or illegal construction that do not withstand earthquakes well. Regulations have been tightened to strengthen or demolish older buildings, and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities, but experts say it is not happening fast enough.The country sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/earthquake-toll-rises-to-116-in-turkey-rescuers-finish-searches/story-UxdYoRQq7BvLbm6Ys6fwNO.html

Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, was ahead with 225votes to Trump’s 213 in Associate Press tracker at the time of writing of this report.The president had won Florida, Iowa and Ohio as voting had continued into early Wednesday morning and Biden expressed confidence about picking up Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and said he was “on track” to win the election.Click here for complete coverage of the US Presidential Election 2020Neither of them had flipped a state yet, although Biden was closest to it, having held a steady lead in Arizona, a Republican-leaning state Trump had won in 2016. Fox News called it for Biden and then retracted under fire from the Trump campaign for jumping the gun. But an angry Trump referenced it at length in his controversial White House speech.“We feel good about where we are,” Biden had said earlier. “We really do. I’m here to tell you tonight we believe we’re on track to win this election.”He added: “We are feeling really good about Wisconsin and Michigan. And by the way it’s going to take time to count the votes but we’re going to win Pennsylvania.”Around the same time, Trump first sought to insert his false claims and grievances into the election process with a tweet, which was flagged by Twitter as disputed or misleading content, that he was “up Big” and wrongly claimed “they are trying to STEAL the Election”.Trump and Biden were locked in close fights in battleground states as counting of votes progressed haltingly in some battleground states because of the high volumes of early votes, especially those mailed in.But Trump did not lose in a landslide as some pundits had forecast, and Biden did not close the contest early as some had said he might.Trump had picked up Florida, Iowa and Ohio among the battleground states he had won in 2016, and was leading in North Carolina. He also held on to Texas and Georgia, the solidly Republican states that Democrats had hoped to flip in a late campaign push.Trump was also leading in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the three Democratic states — the Blue Wall states — he had flipped in 2016 to win the presidency. But his leads in these states were expected to change as large number of early votes — especially mail-in ballots — remained to be counted.Michigan authorities have said they will not be ready to make an official announcement of the outcome till late Wednesday. Pennsylvania might also not have a result to announce until then.Just as Biden had made a play for Georgia and Texas to an extend and failed, Trump had made a go for New Hampshire and Minnesota, both states won by Hillary Clinton in 2016, and failed. Biden won them both.But Trump appeared to have held his own thus far despite having trailed Biden in polls for much of the race, and succeeded in mobilising his supporters with frenetic pace of campaigning in the finals days when he was multiple rallies across multiple states every day.Jason Miller, a senior member of Trump’s re-election campaign, told reporters on a conference call, earlier on Tuesday: “We feel very, very good about our ground game, we feel very good about where we’re turning out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-won-declares-trump-vows-to-move-supreme-court-to-stop-counting/story-EHU8Gm35Uf7cOkMAKjrk3I.html

New Jersey hasn’t sent a Republican to the US Senate since 1972.Booker, 51, was backed by a campaign fund and other accounts that as of November 1 had raised $14.5 million. Mehta, 42, had reported just $564,000, more than half of it a loan backed by the candidate, according to Federal Election Commission filings.Booker won a special election in 2013 over Republican Bob Hugin to fill the seat of the late Frank Lautenberg, a fellow Democrat. Hugin, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Celgene Corp., had spent $36 million of his own fortune on that race.In January, Booker ended his 2020 presidential campaign after failing to qualify for a candidates’ debate. A progressive champion of marijuana legalization and criminal reform, same-sex marriage, a $15 federal minimum wage, and stricter gun laws, Booker faced a challenger who showed unabashed support for Donald Trump in a state where the President is unpopular.Mehta on Twitter said he and his wife attended a Trump fundraiser in Bedminster on October 1, less than 24 hours before the White House disclosed that the President was positive for the coronavirus. In response to Governor Phil Murphy’s suggestion that all attendees quarantine, Mehta said Murphy was fear mongering, and there was no need to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-cory-booker-defeats-indian-american-trump-loyalist-rik-mehta-in-senate-race/story-O2DxCacBmNtMKBOrPPjOIN.html
04-11-2020||World||Voters favor Biden on handling of Covid-19, Trump on economy||Voters in the US presidential election faced a public health crisis and a wounded economy, but neither candidate emerged as the clear choice to handle both of those issues, according to AP Votecast.More voters — both nationwide and in key battlegrounds — said former Vice President Joe Biden would be better able to handle the coronavirus pandemic, the top concern for about 4 in 10 voters. But President Donald Trump edged out Biden on the question of who would be better to rebuild an economy besieged by nearly 11 million job losses and small businesses staring down a bleak winter. About 3 in 10 voters nationally ranked the economy as the most pressing issue.The question of whether the pandemic or the economy mattered more to voters was a heated debate in the campaign. Trump argued that the economy should not be a casualty of the disease and maintained, without evidence, that the nation was “rounding the turn.” Biden has warned that the economy can never fully heal unless the coronavirus is first contained and businesses can fully reopen.A majority of voters were receptive to that argument. About 6 in 10 voters said the government’s higher priority should be limiting the spread of the coronavirus, even if it damages the economy.AP VoteCast is a nationwide survey of more than 132,000 voters and nonvoters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.Despite the months of debate, three-quarters of all voters said they knew all along who they supported. And Trump weighed heavily on their minds — two-thirds said their decision was driven by their opinion of the untraditional president, either for or against.Trump voters overwhelmingly endorsed their president. About 8 in 10 said their vote was in support of him, not in opposition to Biden. Meanwhile, Biden voters were closely split over whether they mainly supported Biden or opposed Trump with their vote for president.Millions of voters rushed to cast their ballots early, and did so with a clear sense of anxiety and worry. About 6 in 10 voters — including most Biden voters and about a quarter of Trump voters — said they think things in the country are on the wrong track.Trump’s campaign tried to make the handling of the economy a top selling point for his reelection, an uphill battle as unemployment spiked to double digits this spring. A comeback has recently showed signs of stalling as federal aid lapsed because the Trump administration and House Democrats could not reach a compromise. Only about 4 in 10 voters said the economy was good or excellent, with the rest describing conditions as not so good or poor.Still, Trump’s image as a boon to business was resilient, despite the pandemic downturn.Trump continued to draw support from a coalition of white men, white voters without a college degree and those living in small towns and rural communities. Biden enjoyed more backing from women, college graduates and Black, Hispanic and Asian voters.The coronavirus outbreak has claimed more than 230,000 American lives and has been surging across the country in recent weeks. Still, voters were divided on whether the nation has contained the spread of the virus. About half of voters said the virus is at least somewhat under control, while roughly half described the coronavirus as out of control.Voters in key battleground states shared anxieties about the virus and its spread. In Wisconsin, which saw an October spike in cases, close to half of voters said the pandemic was the top issue facing the country and about 6 in 10 said it was not under control. About two-thirds said the government should prioritize stopping its spread even if it means economic pain.About half of Wisconsin voters said that Biden would do a superior job of combating the virus, roughly the same as in Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Trump had an edge in stewarding the economy, with roughly half of voters in these states saying he would do better than Biden.More than 100 million Americans rushed to vote early and by mail, taking advantage of new rules intended to make voting safer and easier during the pandemic. Trump has sought to sow doubt about the new voting systems and the legitimacy of the count, and claimed without evidence that some voters would cheat. The survey found about 3 in 10 expressing doubts that their votes would be accurately counted.Concerns about voting were somewhat higher in Pennsylvania, another key state in the election, compared with other states: 36% were not confident the vote count would be accurate.Tensions over structural racism increased this summer after the police killings of several Black Americans, setting off peaceful protests and in some cases riots, looting and violence. Trump positioned himself as a defender of police and cast the protesters as radicals — part of an appeal to suburban and older voters who he thought would embrace a law and order message.Nationally, about three-quarters of voters called racism a serious challenge for society as a whole and for policing in particular. About a quarter said they want to see the police be tougher on crime; about a third think police are too tough.Notably, majorities of voters in two battleground states — Wisconsin and Minnesota — disapproved of protests over policing. Both states saw violence and destruction during demonstrations after police shootings of Black men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/voters-favor-biden-on-handling-of-covid-19-trump-on-economy/story-m7ss0Yiz3JdOWLRXzv1o9J.html

Facebook suspended them for inauthentic behavior.One of those suspended, SVNewsAlerts, had more 78,000 Twitter followers, after adding more than 10,000 in the past week. The account frequently warned of election-related unrest and highlighted issues with voting safety and reliability. It pointed to fraud claims about Democrats and called attention to Republican President Donald Trump’s rallies and speeches.Other accounts suspended by Twitter included FJNewsReporter, Crisis_Intel and Faytuks. A Facebook page also named SVNewsAlerts, which was suspended on Tuesday afternoon, had more than 20,000 followers. Facebook declined to comment further.False or exaggerated reports about voting fraud and delays at the polls circulated on social media throughout the day, in some cases helped along by Republican accounts and online publications.The FBI and the New York attorney general also said they were looking into a spate of mysterious robocalls urging people to stay home, which were reported in multiple battleground states.The hashtag #StopTheSteal spiked from a few dozen mentions to more than 2,000 mentions over a 15-minute period in the morning, according to media intelligence firm Zignal Labs.Zignal said unfounded claims about closed polling stations and excessively long lines in Republican-leaning areas in Pennsylvania, one of the most hotly contested states, received more than 33,000 mentions on Twitter.Twitter appended fact-checking labels to multiple tweets from the @PhillyGOP account, which was among those using #StopTheSteal. The Philadelphia Republican Party did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Twitter labels.Far-right sites Breitbart and The Gateway Pundit both published articles claiming “the steal is on” in Pennsylvania that racked up thousands of shares on Facebook and Twitter.In one video shared widely among conservative audiences, a Trump poll-watcher was seen being turned away from a site. Philadelphia officials investigated and concluded the man had mistakenly been barred under an expired law, which required authorization to enter a specific polling spot. He was then admitted.The video was viewed 2.4 million times on Twitter.Followers of the conspiracy movement QAnon also spread the Pennsylvania reports, according to researchers at misinformation tracking firm Alethea Group.

Biden still has multiple paths to the 270 electoral votes he needs without Florida despite having spent lots of time and money trying to flip the state that backed Trump in 2016.Also Read | Polls close in first six US states, Indiana called for TrumpVoters, many wearing masks and maintaining social-distancing to guard against the spread of the coronavirus, experienced long lines in a few locales and short waits in many other places. There were no signs of disruptions or violence at polling sites, as some officials had feared.The winner - who may not be determined for days - will lead a nation strained by a pandemic that has killed more than 231,000 people and left millions more jobless, racial tensions and political polarization that has only worsened during a vitriolic campaign.A third of US voters listed the economy as the issue that mattered most to them when deciding their choice for president while two out of 10 cited Covid-19, according to an Edison Research exit poll on Tuesday.In the national exit poll, four out of 10 voters said they thought the effort to contain the virus was going “very badly.” In the battleground states of Florida and North Carolina, battleground states that could decide the election, five of 10 voters said the national response to the pandemic was going “somewhat or very badly.”The poll found that nine out of 10 voters had already decided on their choice before October, and nine out of 10 voters said they were confident their state would accurately count votes.The poll found signs Trump was losing support among his core base of supporters in Georgia and Virginia.Edison’s exit polls showed Trump winning seven in 10 white men in Georgia, down from eight in 10 against Hillary Clinton in 2016. And while Trump was winning with six in 10 voters who were at least 65 years old in Georgia, that was down from a seven in 10 four years ago.In Virginia, Trump is winning six in 10 whites without college degrees in Virginia, down from seven in 10 in 2016. Trump is also winning six in 10 white men in Virginia, down from seven in 10 in 2016.Biden, the Democratic former vice president, has put Trump’s handling of the pandemic at the center of his campaign and has held a consistent lead in national opinion polls over the Republican president.Biden, 77, appeared to have multiple paths to victory in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner; at least 270 electoral votes, determined in part by a state’s population, are needed to win.Opinion polls show Trump, 74, is close enough in several election battleground states that he could repeat the type of upset he pulled off in 2016, when he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton despite losing the national popular vote by about 3 million ballots.“I’m hopeful,” Biden told reporters in his home state of Delaware, after earlier appearing in the pivotal state of Pennsylvania to make an 11th-hour appeal to voters.Ahead of Election Day, just over 100 million voters cast early ballots either by mail or in person, according to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, driven by concerns about crowded polling places during the pandemic as well as extraordinary enthusiasm.The total has broken records and prompted some experts to predict the highest voting rates since 1908 and that the vote total could reach 160 million, topping the 138 million cast in 2016.In anticipation of possible protests, some buildings and stores were boarded up in cities including Washington, Los Angeles and New York. Federal authorities erected a new fence around the White House perimeter.A REFERENDUM ON TRUMPSupporters of both candidates called the election a referendum on Trump and his tumultuous first term. No US president has lost a re-election bid since Republican George H.W. Bush in 1992.Among the most closely contested states that are expected to determine the outcome are Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia, with Democrats hoping that Biden may even threaten Trump in states that once seemed certain to go Republican such as Ohio, Iowa and Texas.Voters on Tuesday will also decide which political party controls the US Congress for the next two years, with Democrats narrowly favored to recapture a Senate majority and retain their control of the House of Representatives.Trump is seeking another term in office after a chaotic four years marked by the coronavirus crisis, an economy battered by pandemic shutdowns, an impeachment drama, inquiries into Russian election interference, US racial tensions and contentious immigration policies.Biden is looking to win the presidency on his third attempt after a five-decade political career including eight years as vice president under Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama.Biden has promised a renewed effort to fight the public health crisis, fix the economy and bridge America’s political divide. The country this year was also shaken by months of protests against racism and police brutality.(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Additional reporting by Steve Holland and Susan Heavey in Washington and Katanga Johnson and Rich McKay in Atlanta Writing by Joseph Ax, Alistair Bell and John Whitesides; Editing by Will Dunham, Paul Thomasch and Howard Goller)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-donald-trump-and-joe-biden-neck-and-neck-in-vital-battleground-of-florida/story-e65pGlgjbfxmDfv0NeFmSP.html
04-11-2020||World||For Donald Trump Jr, red wave in globe, but not India||Donald Trump Jr, the US president’s son, tweeted a world map as a mock electoral map showing India, with wrong boundaries, painted in blue, the colour associated with Democrats, and much of the rest of the world in Republican red. “Okay, finally got around to making my electoral map prediction,” he tweeted on Tuesday. The other countries painted in blue were Mexico, China, Sri Lanka and what looked like Liberia. The map also showed California in blue, which it is, and another East Coast state. For the president’s son, a leading surrogate for his father to show India blue, even if playfully, would settle a debate in Indian American community about who is getting their support.“From this house to the White House, with the grace of God,” Joe Biden wrote on a wall of his childhood home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which he visited on Tuesday with his grandchildren. His family had lived there before moving to nearby Delaware state, which has been home since. Biden began the day with a visit to the church and then to the grave of his elder son, Beau Biden, who died in 2015 of brain cancer.Melania Trump voted at Palm Beach in Florida, the family’s adoptive home, on Tuesday, saying she was feeling “great”. Asked why she did not vote with her husband last week, she said, “It’s Election Day, so I wanted to come here to vote today for the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-donald-trump-jr-red-wave-in-globe-but-not-india/story-GHSOPyVPWDtP6CyXo2VE5J.html

04-11-2020||World||Biden briefly confuses granddaughter with son in verbal gaffe||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden briefly appeared to confuse his granddaughter with his son as he spoke in Philadelphia on Election Day, in a verbal gaffe which was swiftly seized on by the Trump campaign.Biden, a former stutterer renowned for becoming easily tangled in his words, was introducing the daughter of his son Beau -- who died of brain cancer in 2015 -- to supporters in the city in Pennsylvania when he called her “none other than my son Beau Biden.”He quickly corrected himself to say “this is my granddaughter Natalie,” before realizing he had wrapped his arm around the wrong grandchild, noting his mistake and pulling over Natalie.With campaigning wrapped up and both candidates now waiting for final votes to be cast and the election to be called, the confusion gave President Donald Trump’s campaign one final blunder to offer up to its supporters as evidence of what it has long alluded to as Biden’s senility.“WATCH: Joe Biden mixes up his granddaughters,” the Trump campaign posted on Twitter with an accompanying video of the incident.Trump, 74, also makes gaffes on a regular basis, both verbally and on Twitter, but insists he has all the “best words.”Biden mentions Beau on almost every public occasion. As Delaware’s attorney general from 2007 to 2015, and an Army reservist who served in Iraq, Beau had flirted with the idea of following his father’s footsteps into the Senate, and seemed destined to hit the national stage.Biden had started the morning with a visit to the Delaware church where Beau is buried alongside Biden’s first wife and daughter, who died in a car wreck in 1972.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-briefly-confuses-granddaughter-with-son-in-verbal-gaffe/story-gufS5aOICjcCElUvrOgwXK.html
04-11-2020||World||US approves Taiwan drone purchase as arms sales escalate||The Trump administration has notified Congress that it has approved the sale of $600 million in armed drones to Taiwan, the latest in a series of arms transfers for the island.The State Department said Tuesday it had Ok’d Taiwan’s purchase of four “weapons ready” remotely piloted aircraft and related equipment. The move is likely to infuriate China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has reacted angrily to previous weapons sales’ announcements to the island.“This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,” it said. “The proposed sale will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, economic and progress in the region.”It said the sale would improve Taiwan’s defense by bolstering its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities and could help deter military action against it.Just last week, the administration approved plans for a $2.37 billion sale of Harpoon missile systems to Taiwan. That came hours after Beijing had announced sanctions on U.S. defense contractors, including Boeing, the lead contractor on the Harpoon deal, over a previous weapons deal.China’s ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan, which split with the mainland in 1949 during a civil war, as part of its territory and has threatened to invade. Washington promised in the 1980s to reduce and eventually end weapons sales to Taiwan but insists its dispute with Beijing must be settled peacefully.Chinese-U.S. relations have plunged to their lowest level in decades amid disputes about security, technology, the coronavirus pandemic and human rights.Taiwan has long been an irritant in relations. Washington has no formal relations with the island’s democratically-elected government but is its main ally. U.S. law requires the government to ensure Taiwan can defend itself. Weapons sales to the island have increased in quantity and quality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-approves-taiwan-drone-purchase-as-arms-sales-escalate/story-Q4Opziygpk8TH3KjXDhaeO.html

After reviewing CCTV footage of the attack in an area teaming with bars and restaurants not far from the historic sights of central Vienna, Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said the video “does not at this time show any evidence of a second attacker”.Vienna police have asked people who filmed moment of the attack to share their recordings with the authorities to aid in tracking the gunman’s route through the capital, rather than posting them to social media.On Fejzulai’s computer, investigators found incriminating evidence including a photograph recently posted on Facebook showing him carrying the automatic weapon and a machete used during the attack.Police said he was also wearing a fake explosive belt.- ‘Repulsive’ attack -Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz condemned the shooting as a “repulsive terror attack”, which he said killed a waitress, a young passer-by and an older man and woman.He called on the European Union to fight against “political Islam” saying it was an ideology that represented a “danger” to the model of the European way of life, in an interview published in Germany’s Die Welt newspaper.His government will face questions about how an individual known to security forces had been able to buy weapons and cause havoc on the streets of the usually peaceful capital, often listed as having the world’s highest quality of life.The investigation is spanning several countries, with Switzerland making two arrests and Macedonia, where Fejzulai has family roots, cooperating with the Austrian authorities.The attack came after several Islamist atrocities in France, including an assault on churchgoers in the Mediterranean city of Nice and the beheading of a schoolteacher near Paris.The recent re-publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in France has caused new tensions worldwide, sparking protests in some Muslim-majority countries and calls from several terror groups for their followers to take revenge. Britain on Tuesday upgraded its terrorism threat level from “substantial” to “severe”.- ‘Fooled the system’ - Nehammer said Fejzulai had been convicted and jailed for a terror offence in April last year for trying to travel to Syria.The dual Austrian and Macedonian national had then been admitted to a government-funded de-radicalisation programme and had managed to secure an early release in December from a 22-month prison sentence.“The perpetrator managed to fool the de-radicalisation programme of the justice system, to fool the people in it, and to get an early release,” Nehammer said.“It was clear that the attacker, despite all the outward signs of having integrated into society, did exactly the opposite.”A large swathe of central Vienna was cordoned off around the location of the shootings as police combed the area.“It sounded like firecrackers, then we realised it was shots,” one witness told public broadcaster ORF after the attack began. Another spoke of at least 50 shots being fired.- ‘Shock and sorrow’ -The small Alpine nation of nine million people had until now been spared the sort of major attacks that have hit other European countries such as France, Germany and Britain in the last decade.The last significant attacks date back to the 1970s and 1980s and were carried out by pro-Palestinian militants.“This isn’t Berlin and it isn’t Paris. We’re perhaps a big city but nothing really bad ever happens here,” said hotel receptionist Sharut Gunduz.The bloodshed triggered an outpouring of solidarity from world leaders with French President Emmanuel Macron saying the people of France shared the “shock and sorrow” of the Austrian people.Across the country, flags were lowered to half mast on public buildings and people observed a minute of silence at noon as church bells rang out.Kurz, President Alexander Van der Bellen and other officials took part in a wreath-laying ceremony in honour of the victims.- ‘Common struggle’ -Twenty-three wounded people were in hospital Tuesday, with seven in a critical condition, Vienna’s hospital association said.Police said an officer was among those hurt.Germany joined the Czech Republic in stepping up checks at their borders in order to stop possible accomplices.“The fight against these assassins and those who instigate them is our common struggle,” said Chancellor Angela Merkel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-claims-responsibility-for-deadly-attack-in-vienna-as-austria-mourns/story-cCeSqtAFhbrAGZ3ALVlEuM.html
