A Kenosha detective testified that Black told him during an interview about how he purchased the assault-style rifle at a Ladysmith hardware store after getting some money from Kyle Rittenhouse, who at 17 was too young to legally buy a gun, the Journal Sentinel reported.Black’s attorney, Robert Keller, argued for the charges to be dismissed or at least reduced to a single count, a motion Keating denied.The weapon was stored at Black’s stepfather’s house in Kenosha until Black and Rittenhouse each took rifles downtown on Aug. 25, according to police records. Late that night, police said Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz.Rittenhouse is charged with first-degree intentional homicide, attempted homicide, reckless homicide, recklessly endangering safety and illegal possession of a firearm. His attorneys say Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense.His preliminary hearing is set for Dec. 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trial-ordered-for-accused-gun-supplier-in-kenosha-killings/story-MhO4vEV0NFVBkATgNgYSEJ.html

Birhanu did not offer any evidence to support his accusations. There was no immediate WHO comment on the allegation against Tedros, who is Ethiopian of Tigrayan ethnicity.The accusations came at a time when the WHO is under considerable strain trying to coordinate global efforts against the Covid-19 pandemic after the United States, its biggest donor, froze funding over a spat involving China. Cases and deaths are rising again in many countries around the world.Tedros served as Ethiopia’s health minister and foreign minister from 2005-2016 in a ruling coalition led by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).The TPLF effectively ruled Ethiopia for decades as the most powerful part of the coalition, until Prime Minister Ahmed Abiy took office in 2018.Abiy has since folded the other three regional parties into his own national party, but the TPLF refused to join.Birhanu accused Tedros of using his international platform to try to get diplomatic support and weapons for the TPLF. “He has been doing everything to support them, he has campaigned to get the neighbouring countries to condemn the war. He has worked to facilitate weapons for them (the TPLF),” he said in a televised news conference. “He tried to lobby people by using his international profile and mission to get support for the TPLF junta.”Birhanu did not give further specifics.Unverified accusations from Ethiopia are not enough to remove Tedros, 55, from his post. He was elected in May 2017 as the WHO’s first African director-general on a platform of promoting universal healthcare. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump announced the United States would withdraw from the WHO in July 2021 - in line with US law requiring a year’s notice - after accusing Tedros of not doing enough to hold China to account for what Trump described as initial attempts to cover up the Covid-19 outbreak.Tedros has dismissed the suggestions, saying: “We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind.”The United States was the biggest overall donor to the Geneva-based WHO, contributing more than $400 million in 2019, roughly 15% of its budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopia-accuses-who-chief-of-backing-tigray-rebels-by-leveraging-his-international-profile/story-TOayZ4gS7XjStU2XHfLFRJ.html

The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has released findings from an inquiry commissioned by in 2016 after rumours and allegations of war crimes on members of the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2016.General Angus Campbell told a press conference on Thursday that the ADF is rightly held to account for allegations of “grave misconduct” by some members of the elite forces. He said that the Inspector-General’s report detailed credible information regarding “deeply disturbing allegations” of unlawful killings. “This shameful record includes alleged instances in which new patrol members were coerced to shoot a prisoner in order to achieve that soldier’s first kill in an appalling practice known as ‘blooding’,” said General Campbell.Also Read | Elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghans, report findsWhat lies ahead for the soldiers accused of unlawful killings?Army chief Lieutenant General Rick Burr said in a statement that he has directed removal of the title ‘2 Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment’ from the Australian Army’s Order of Battle. He stressed that the incidents outlined in the report occurred across the Regiment, however, it was clear that there was a nexus of alleged serious criminal activities, in 2 Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment. “As I continue to analyse the extensive findings, be assured that where there is evidence of misconduct individuals will be held to account. This may be through disciplinary or administrative action,” said Burr.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier indicated that a special investigator would be appointed to mull over prosecutions from the findings of the report. According to Australian media reports, police investigations into the alleged war crimes would likely take years before possible criminal trials begin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-lies-ahead-for-australian-soldiers-accused-of-unlawful-killings-in-afghanistan/story-QX0IIGJchHHclha7WWhw2N.html

19-11-2020||World||Moderna CEO says Covid-19 vaccines can be made even faster||The fourth and final day of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum is focusing on the future of health care around the globe in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 56 million people and killed over 1.3 million.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The Thursday program kicked off with a session spotlighting virus hunters, who said early-warning systems are needed to prevent another pandemic.Stephane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna Inc., whose vaccine was found to be 94.5% effective in a preliminary analysis of a large late-stage clinical trial, said more investment in early testing is needed. If so, vaccines could be created even faster.Other speakers include Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and CEO of genetic testing firm 23andMe Inc.; Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization; Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund; and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies.The forum opened with remarks from Justin B. Smith, CEO of Bloomberg Media and executive chair of Bloomberg New Economy. “This will not be the last pandemic to menace society,” he said.Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said even a modest investment in vaccines against the most-threatening viruses could help companies like his create inoculations much faster during the next emerging epidemic.Moderna brought its Covid-19 vaccine to the verge of regulatory authorization in about 300 days. But if health authorities had invested in early testing of vaccines against 10 or 20 of the most-threatening emerging viruses, Moderna could shave several months off those timelines in the next epidemic, he said.During the panel, he said Moderna’s vaccine trial was on track for getting final results from its big trial in a week or so.“What makes me more excited is the fact that 11 people with severe disease, they were all on placebo,” Bancel said. That suggests that not only will the vaccine prevent almost all cases but that the remaining few infections will be mild.People still need to employ public-health measures like wearing masks, Bancel said. The vaccine “is not a silver bullet,” Bancel said.Also Read | HTLS 2020: ‘Oxford Covid-19 vaccine will be priced at Rs 500-600,’ says Adar PoonawallaThree of the world’s top virus hunters said that nations need to invest in systems that would detect emerging viruses before they infect people and spread around the world.“We haven’t had the kind of early-warning system and investment in this kind of early-warning system that we’ve needed from the very beginning,” said Anne Rimoin, a professor or epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. “We really need to be able to invest in protecting ourselves from viruses.”Rimoin spoke on a panel with Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance and Linfa Wang, director of the program in emerging infectious diseases at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.Viral outbreaks are “happening more frequently, they’re spreading quicker, they’re killing more people and they’re crushing our economies most substantially,” said Daszak. He estimated that there are 1.7 million unknown viruses in the world. It would cost over a $1 billion to identify 70% of them, but it would be money well spent, Daszak said potential emerging viruses should be viewed as a national security threats and tracked with the same intensity the government watches out for terrorist threats abroad, Daszak said.After 9/11, the US government “tracked every single phone call coming into the US, a pretty revolutionary piece of surveillance,” Daszak said. “Why aren’t we doing that with pandemics?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-ceo-says-covid-19-vaccines-can-be-made-even-faster/story-40YTYv5aMlxzb43KK6w36J.html
19-11-2020||World||Adviser to Iran’s leader says US attack risks ‘full-fledged war’||An adviser to Iran’s supreme leader who is a possible 2021 presidential candidate is warning that any American attack on the Islamic Republic could set off a “full-fledged war” in the Mideast in the waning days of the Trump administration.Speaking to The Associated Press(AP), Hossein Dehghan struck a hard-line tone familiar to those in Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, a force he long served in before becoming a defence minister under President Hassan Rouhani.A soldier has yet to serve as Iran’s top civilian leader since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, in part over the initial suspicion that its conventional military forces remained loyal to the toppled shah. But hard-liners in recent years openly have suggested Iran move toward a military dictatorship given its economic problems and threats from abroad, particularly after President Donald Trump pulled America out of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.“We don’t welcome a crisis. We don’t welcome war. We are not after starting a war,” Dehghan said Wednesday. “But we are not after negotiations for the sake of negotiations either.”Dehghan, 63, described himself as a “nationalist” with “no conventional political tendency” during an interview in his wood-paneled office in downtown Tehran. He’s one of many likely to register to run in the June 18 election as Rouhani is term-limited from running again. Others likely include a young technocrat with ties to Iranian intelligence and former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Dehghan’s military service came under presidencies representative of the groups that largely compose Iran’s tightly controlled political arena — reformists who seek to slowly change Iran’s theocracy from within, hard-liners who want to strengthen the theocracy and the relative moderates between. Those calling for radical change are barred from running for office by Iran’s powerful constitutional watchdog known as the Guardian Council, which serves under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.While discussing the world Iran finds itself in, Dehghan’s points mirrored many of Khamenei’s. The former head of the Guard’s air force who achieved the rank of brigadier general said any negotiations with the West could not include Iran’s ballistic missiles, which he described as a “deterrent” to Tehran’s adversaries.Propaganda involving Iran’s missile program has surged in recent weeks.The front page of the English-language Tehran Times on Wednesday showed a map of Iran’s missile ranges with red stars marking American bases across the region under the words “Back off!” printed in big, bold letters. A headline above warned Iran would respond to “any melancholy adventure by Trump.”“The Islamic Republic of Iran will not negotiate its defensive power with anybody under any circumstances,” Dehghan said. “Missiles are a symbol of the massive potential that is in our experts, young people and industrial centers.”Dehghan warned against any American military escalation in Trump’s final weeks in office.“A limited, tactical conflict can turn into a full-fledged war,” he said. “Definitely, the United States, the region and the world cannot stand such a comprehensive crisis.”President-elect Joe Biden has said he’s willing to return to the nuclear deal, which saw sanctions on Iran lifted in exchange for Tehran limiting its uranium enrichment, if Iran first complies with its limits. Since Trump’s withdrawal, Iran has gone beyond all the deal’s restrictions while still allowing United Nations nuclear inspectors to work in the country. Dehghan said those UN checks should continue so long as an inspector is not a “spy.”In the time since, an advanced centrifuge assembly plant at Iran’s Natanz nuclear site exploded and caught fire in July. Dehghan said that reconstruction at Natanz was ongoing after satellite photos showed new construction at the site. He described the incident as “industrial sabotage.”“Those who were in charge of installing some devices possibly made some changes there that led to the explosion,” Dehghan said, without elaborating.A Dehghan presidency likely would be looked upon with suspicion in Washington and Paris. As a young commander in the Guard, Dehghan oversaw its operations in Lebanon and Syria between 1982 and 1984, according to an official biography given to Iran’s parliament in 2013. Israel, Iran’s arch-enemy in the Mideast, had just invaded Lebanon amid that country’s civil war.In 1983, a suicide bomber in a truck loaded with military-grade explosives attacked a US Marine barracks in Beirut, killing 241 American troops and 58 French soldiers. While Iran long has denied being involved, a US District Court judge found Tehran responsible in 2003. That ruling said Iran’s ambassador to Syria at the time called “a member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and instructed him to instigate the Marine barracks bombing.”Dehghan vehemently denied he was involved in the bombing, though he was the Guard’s top commander there at the time.“The US tries to link anything happening in the world to someone in Iran,” he said. “Do they really have evidence? Why do they link it to me?”While stressing he wanted to avoid conflict, Dehghan warned Israel’s expanding presence in the Mideast could turn into a “strategic mistake.” Israel just reached normalization deals with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.“It is opening an extensive front,” he said. “Just imagine every Israeli in any military base can be a target for groups who are opposed to Israel.”Dehghan also said Iran continues to seek the expulsion of all American forces from the region as revenge for the US drone strike in Baghdad that killed Guard General Qassem Soleimani, the head of its expeditionary Quds Force in January. That strike saw Iran launch a retaliatory ballistic missile strike on US troops in Iraq that injured dozens and nearly sparked a war.Iran’s retaliatory strikes were a mere “initial slap,” Dehghan said. And there would be no easy return to negotiations with the US in part due to that, he added.“We do not seek a situation in which (the other party) buys time to weaken our nation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/adviser-to-iran-s-leader-says-us-attack-risks-full-fledged-war/story-T2Q9otKeK4G6oOgvbhAZSP.html
19-11-2020||World||Cyber and space domains focus of £16.5 billion UK defence push||The UK government on Thursday announced the establishment of a National Cyber Force manned with intelligence and military personnel as part of a £16.5 billion push in the defence sector as the country prepares for life out of the EU from January 1, 2021.Setting out the new impetus, Johnson told the House of Commons that £1.5 billion will be invested in military research and development, designed to master the new technologies of warfare. The new funding raises the UK’s defence spending to at least 2.2% of its GDP.Officials said the multi-year settlement of £16.5 billion takes the total extra spending to £24.1 billion over the next four years.Johnson said, “(We) will establish a new centre dedicated to Artificial Intelligence and a new RAF (Royal Air Force) Space Command, launching British satellites and our first rocket from Scotland in 2022.“I can announce that we have established a National Cyber Force, combining our intelligence agencies and service personnel, which is already operating in cyberspace against terrorism, organised crime and hostile state activity.”“And the RAF will receive a new fighter system, harnessing Artificial Intelligence and drone technology to defeat any adversary in air-to-air combat,” he added.Johnson also announced the building of more ships for the Royal Navy, including the ongoing construction of two aircraft carriers, each estimated to cost £3 billion. They are expected to be operational in 2023 as part of the force’s Carrier Strike Group.“Next year, HMS Queen Elizabeth will lead a British and allied task group on our most ambitious deployment for two decades, encompassing the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and East Asia. We shall forward deploy more of our naval assets in the world’s most important regions, protecting the shipping lanes that supply our nation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cyber-and-space-domains-focus-of-16-5-billion-uk-defence-push/story-6zRkebPnhD05t8H9j8MJfO.html

As a result, it is crucial that Covid-19 vaccines are tested in this group who are also a priority group for immunisation.”Co-author Maheshi Ramasamy said, “The robust antibody and T cell responses seen in older people in our study are encouraging. The populations at greatest risk of serious Covid-19 disease include people with existing health conditions and older adults.”Melissa Andrew of Dalhousie University, Canada, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a linked comment, “It is encouraging that more studies in older adult populations are underway and will hopefully bring opportunities to implement nuanced analyses of how underlying health status and frailty affect vaccine safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and efficacy in older adults in real-world settings. Older adults and those who care about them are eagerly awaiting this progress towards safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-safe-in-older-adults-induces-immune-response-lancet/story-GPWZkUQpjTaz5Fd3ucuAVO.html
19-11-2020||World||EU warns Hungary against use of Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine||Hungary’s plans to import and possibly use Russia’s touted Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine raise safety concerns and could damage trust in potential shots, the European Commission said, opening a new front in the EU’s fraught relations with Budapest.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s hard line against migration and what critics say is his increasingly authoritarian grip on power - an accusation he has repeatedly denied - as well as his pursuit of close relations with Russia have caused repeated clashes with the European Union.A new showdown is expected on Thursday when EU leaders hold a video conference that may address the bloc’s massive Covid rescue plan and seven-year budget, which Hungary and Poland’s nationalist governments are blocking because they make access to money conditional on respecting the rule of law.Hungarian plans to conduct trials of and possibly produce the Russian vaccine, an unprecedented step for an EU member state, add to existing frictions with Brussels.Asked about these plans, a spokesman for the Commission, the EU’s executive, said: “The question arises whether a member state would want to administer to its citizens a vaccine that has not been reviewed by EMA.”Under EU rules, Sputnik V must be authorised by the European Medicines Agency before it can be marketed in any state of the 27-nation bloc, EMA said.“This is where the authorisation process and vaccine confidence meet. If our citizens start questioning the safety of a vaccine, should it not have gone through rigorous scientific assessment to prove its safety and efficacy, it will be much harder to vaccinate a sufficient proportion of the population,” the Commission spokesman added in an emailed statement.A recent study of 8,000 people in the United States and Britain found that fewer people would “definitely” take a Covid-19 vaccine than the 55% of the population which scientists estimate is needed to provide so-called herd immunity.Also Read | Covid-19 vaccine update: India may produce Sputnik V; Sinovac’s candidate triggers ‘quick’ immune responseExperts have said that misinformation and perceived weak safety checks on candidate vaccines play a central role in reducing confidence in their efficacy. Orban’s government has said it plans to trial and licence Sputnik V, and this week would begin importing a small number of doses that could lead to larger imports and mass-production in Hungary next year if the shot proved safe and effective.Russia’s sovereign wealth fund said last week that interim trial results showed Sputnik V is 92% effective at protecting people from the Covid-19 respiratory disease, and the country is preparing for mass inoculations.Vaccines being developed by US firms Moderna and Pfizer - the latter in cooperation with Germany’s BioNTech - have showed slightly better results on a much larger sample of people exposed to the virus.The Hungarian government did not respond to questions on whether it wanted to licence the Sputnik V vaccine at home or through the required EU process.“Vaccines should be out of politics and countries should have a choice how to protect their citizens,” said Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund which has underwritten the development of Sputnik V.He added that Russia was ready to share data with the European Medicines Agency and said it aimed to produce the vaccine in Hungary and in other willing EU nations. A subsidiary of the wealth fund also requested scientific advice from EMA in late October but has received no reply so far, the fund said.EMA said that it had received no data from Russia or Hungary on Sputnik V or any other Covid-19 vaccine.Sputnik V is expected to be trialled and produced in other countries across the world beyond Russia, with Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates among those who have expressed an interest in the shot.IMPORT DOUBTSBut the EU questions even the import of Sputnik V by one of its member states.Temporary import and distribution of unauthorised vaccines is allowed for emergency use in the EU “in response to the suspected or confirmed spread of pathogenic agents, toxins, chemical agents or nuclear radiation, any of which could cause harm,” the relevant EU law reads.This rare exemption has been widely debated in recent months by EU experts, the European Commission said.“The widely supported view is that it should be considered very carefully,” the commission spokesman said. Such emergency procedures, he said, would also conflict with the EU’s current vaccine strategy.Under that strategy, the EU has signed contracts with five vaccine makers, including Pfizer, for the supply of nearly 2 billion doses of their potential Covid vaccines and is talking with at least two other manufacturers for additional shots.That would cover the 450 million combined population of all EU states, including Hungary, which under those deals also ordered millions of doses of the Pfizer, Astra Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines now in development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-warns-hungary-against-use-of-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-sKWno4HlxunpX3aOwbCmVN.html

Cases are also up in Lebanon and Pakistan. Jordan, Tunisia and Lebanon have reported the biggest single-day death spikes from the region.From Pakistan, Faisal Sultan, special assistant to the prime minister for national health services, told reporters the winter surge had arrived. Although Pakistan managed to control the outbreak with targeted restrictions earlier this year, the forecast turned more alarming as the country unlocked, he said.“The second wave is just as risky if not more than the first,” Sultan said, adding that winter in Pakistan brings an increase in social interaction, with schools, events and wedding parties in full swing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-of-deadly-second-wave-of-virus-across-middle-east/story-2oJTIiSGcPSMHqapq7ZJZP.html

Khan was received by Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar and Afghan President’s Special Representative for Pakistan Mohammad Umer Daudzai and senior officials upon his arrival at Kabul airport on his maiden trip to Afghanistan, officials said. He was received by President Ghani received on his arrival at ARG Presidential Palace, situated in the heart of Kabul city. Khan was accompanied by Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, adviser on commerce Abdul Razak Dawood, ISI chief Lt. Gen. Faiz Hamid, foreign secretary Sohail Mehmood and special representative for Afghanistan Muhammad Sadiq. According to officials, the two leaders discussed ways to further strengthen the bilateral relations, the peace process and regional economic development and connectivity. They agreed to strengthen the bilateral relations as the people of Pakistan and Afghanistan are linked through bonds of history, faith, culture, values, and traditions. Khan expressed confidence that his visit would help foster a stronger and multifaceted relationship between the two countries. This is Khan’s first visit to Afghanistan since assuming office in 2018. It is the highest-profile visit by a Pakistani official to Kabul since peace talks began between the Taliban and the Afghan government in Doha in September. It comes days after the Pentagon announced it would reduce the number of US military personnel in Afghanistan from 4,500 to 2,500 by mid-January. The announcement came as there has been an uptick in violence, with the Taliban continuing to carry out attacks targeting government leaders, security forces, and civilians. President Ghani last visited Pakistan in June 2019.The Pakistani Prime Minister’s visit is being billed as a symbol of increasing confidence between the two countries, triggered by Pakistan’s role in bringing the Taliban to the negotiation table, after years of acrimony between Islamabad and Kabul. Earlier, the two leaders had a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the 14th Organisation of Islamic Cooperation(OIC) Summit in Makkah in May 2019. Khan also had a telephonic conversation with President Ghani in September 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-sets-out-to-bolster-ties-with-afghanista-through-imran-khan-s-maiden-visit/story-nssC7yuLgqVGD5NcbnrTpI.html
19-11-2020||World||Covid-19 restrictions reduced global pollution levels by nearly 20%, shows NASA study||The coronavirus-induced restrictions around the world significantly reduced pollutants produced by the combustion of fossil fuels, NASA researchers have found. They used computer models to generate a Covid-free 2020 for comparison purposes and concluded that pandemic restrictions, which led to a reduction in the use of fossil fuels by industry and transportation, subsequently reduced global nitrogen dioxide concentrations by nearly 20 per cent.The researchers received data from 46 countries relaying hourly atmospheric composition measurements in near-real-time. As many as 50 of the 61 analysed cities show nitrogen dioxide reductions between 20-50 per cent. According to the report, NASA model projections accounted for the normal variations in weather and atmospheric circulation since no two years are exactly alike. “We all knew the lockdowns were going to have an impact on air quality,” Christoph Keller, the lead author of the study, said in a statement.“It was also soon clear that it was going to be difficult to quantify how much of that change is related to the lockdown measures, versus general seasonality or variability in pollution,” he added.Also Read | All you need to know about NASA’s plan to involve private players in space explorationThe report suggests that Wuhan, the first epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, was also the first to show reduced nitrogen dioxide emissions. The study showed 60 per cent lower emissions than simulated values expected. As the restrictions were imposed in Milan and New York, the cities recorded a 60 per cent and a 45 per cent decrease respectively.Emma Knowland, a co-author, stated that at times, a decrease in air pollutants was recorded even before the official policies went into place. Knowland opined that people were probably reducing their transit because the talk of the Covid-19 threat was already happening before they were actually told to shut down. The findings of the study were presented at the 2020 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-restrictions-reduced-global-pollution-levels-by-nearly-20-shows-nasa-study/story-j6Kl55d6mJIO9jtxaIE5eL.html

Saeed is already in jail as in February this year, he was sentenced to 11 years in jail in two other terror-financing cases. At present, he is lodged at Lahore’s high-security Kot Lakhpat jail.“The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) of Lahore on Thursday sentenced four leaders of Jamat-ud-Dawa, including its chief Hafiz Saeed, in two more cases,” a court official told PTI. Saeed and his two close aides - Zafar Iqbal and Yahya Mujahid - have been sentenced to 10 and a half years each, while JuD chief’s brother-in-law Abdul Rehman Makki was sentenced to six months imprisonment.“Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta of ATC Court No. 1 heard the case No. 16/19 and 25/19 filed by Counter Terrorism Department in which the verdict has been announced after the statements of witnesses were cross-examined by Naseeruddin Nayyar and Mohammad Imran Fazal Gul Advocate,” the official said.A total of 41 cases have been registered by the CTD against the JuD leaders, out of which 24 have been decided while the rest are pending in the ATC courts. Four cases have been decided against Saeed so far. Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.

Governor Yuriko Koike said residents should focus on things such as wearing masks and using disinfectant, and should gather only in small groups for short periods of time.The government lacks the legal means for a harsh lockdown, but has shown it can keep the virus under control without one. In addition, officials want to avoid heavy restrictions as they try to get the country’s recessionary economy back on track.“Even without the virus spread, we were expecting the economy to struggle after a rebound, so this is shaping up to be a double blow,” said Yuichi Kodama, an economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. He added that more than 20 trillion yen ($192 billion) may be needed for a third extra budget, depending on how the situation develops.The city on Thursday reported 534 cases, a new high after the previous day’s tally of 493 overtook a record set in August. The nationwide total also set a daily record -- 2,259, according to TBS -- as prefectures including Osaka, Aichi and Hokkaido posted their highest number of infections.The increase comes as the virus is surging globally with the onset of colder weather in the northern parts of the world. While Japan’s numbers are low compared with other countries, the increase is a reminder that, in the absence of an effective vaccine, even the most successful countries at containing the virus are vulnerable to resurgences.Japanese officials have stressed that hospital capacity isn’t under any strain. Koike said Thursday that avoiding serious cases is the biggest priority.Also Read |  Japan has worst day of Covid-19 cases yet amid fears of winter waveTokyo had lowered the alert from its highest level in September, prompting the city to end voluntary restrictions on operating hours for bars and restaurants.With cases climbing again, a debate has emerged over generous government subsidies for travel and eating out as part of a Go To campaign to support businesses, which some have blamed for fueling the latest wave. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Wednesday that the central government had received no request from Tokyo to be removed from areas eligible for subsidies. He added there was no need to refrain from travel between prefectures across the board.Virus-Delayed Tokyo Olympics Looks to Allow Spectators“The Go To campaign was meant to be one of the main pillars, but if this becomes difficult they may have to add different measures to support the economy and people’s livelihoods,” Kodama said.The higher alert level was implemented days after International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach told reporters in Tokyo he was confident that next year’s Olympics could safely be held with spectators present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-raises-virus-alert-to-highest-level-amid-record-cases/story-2XG9EqGEZoTvFl0bj1fXxI.html

All you need to know||An open letter to Facebook leadership from its content moderators has provided fascinating details regarding the discontent brewing among the workers, who were allegedly forced to return to office spaces amid the coronavirus pandemic. Over 200 Facebook content moderators from across the world have questioned the decision of the social media giant to force them back to the office, despite the risks of contracting coronavirus.Why Facebook ‘forced’ moderators back to the office? Facebook relies on thousands of contractors, who are officially employed with companies like Accenture and CPL, to spot and remove the content found violating the company’s policies. The employees have said that Facebook tried using Artificial Intelligence to moderate the content but failed, and then chose to “risk” their lives by calling them back to the office. They have alleged that Facebook undertook a massive live experiment in heavily automated content moderation without informing the public.“The AI wasn’t up to the job. Important speech got swept into the maw of the Facebook filter - and risky content, like self-harm, stayed up,” they wrote, adding that the platform’s algorithms are years away from achieving the necessary level of sophistication to moderate content automatically. They stated that the algorithms cannot spot satire and cannot respond quickly enough to self-harm or child abuse.“Facebook needs us. It is time that you acknowledged this and valued our work. To sacrifice our health and safety for profit is immoral,” the employees asserted.Also Read | CEOs of Twitter, Facebook defend content moderation practicesWhat are their demands?The content moderators have listed five demands, saying they deserve the rights and benefits of full Facebook staff. 1. To keep moderators and their families safe, the employees have demanded that everyone who is at high risk or who live with someone who is at high risk for Covid-19 should be permitted to work from home indefinitely. 2. The employees said that work that can be done from home should continue to be done from home, demanding to maximize at-home working. They have also claimed that there is a “pervasive and needlessly secretive” culture at Facebook. 3. They want Facebook to offer hazard pay if the company wants moderators to “risk their lives to maintain ‘community’ and profit”. The employees said that people working in the office on high-risk material, such as child abuse, should be paid hazard pay of 1.5x their usual wage. 4. The content moderators stated that Facebook to end outsourcing and bring the content moderation workforce in house, giving them the same rights and benefits as full Facebook staff. 5. The employees want the social media giant to offer “real healthcare and psychiatric care”. They said that content moderators bear the brunt of the mental health trauma associated with Facebook’s toxic content and they deserve “at least as much mental and physical health support as full Facebook staff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-facebook-risking-lives-of-moderators-after-failed-ai-experiment-all-you-need-to-know/story-lJxNxfKhPOIXMykWUDgsbJ.html

But many are now wary of seeming to toe the FAA line after the US agency was faulted for lax oversight. “It’s too soon,” agreed Anton Sahadi, who had two young relatives on board the doomed flight. “It wasn’t just the Lion Air flight, but also the victims in Ethiopia... The victims’ families haven’t 100% recovered yet.”Families of the Ethiopian crash victims said in a statement they felt “sheer disappointment and renewed grief” after the FAA’s decision to return the aircraft to service.“Our family was broken,” Naoise Ryan, whose 39-year-old husband died aboard Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, said.In Indonesia, some of the aggrieved relatives said clearance had been granted faster than compensation. “Why has the flight permit been granted while the affairs of the victims’ family have not been fully resolved?” asked Latief Nurbana, a civil servant who lost his 24-year-old son.He said compensation payments and arrangements with the Boeing Community Investment Fund (BCIF) were still unsettled.The BCIF’s website said that the distribution of funds to provide philanthropic support to communities affected by the crashes would be completed by Jan. 15, 2021.A Boeing spokeswoman and spokesman for Lion Air did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In both accidents a stall-prevention system known as MCAS, triggered by faulty data from a single airflow sensor, repeatedly and forcefully shoved down the jet’s nose as the pilots struggled to regain control.Adita Irawati, an Indonesian transportation ministry spokeswoman, said Indonesia would allow the Boeing 737 MAX to fly once the FAA issued airworthiness directives. On-the-ground and simulator training for pilots would be included in that process, and the timing would be dependent on compliance with the requirements, Irawati said. Grieving relative Sahadi said profit should not guide an urgency to get back in the air. “This means they don’t prioritize safety, considering there have been fatal mistakes that led to these two airlines having terrible accidents,” Sahadi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/too-soon-to-let-boeing-737-max-fly-again-say-families-of-lion-air-crash-victims/story-y9E2gLUH9jnzFHF7f1TtGP.html

We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure.”Late-stage, or Phase III, trials are ongoing to confirm the findings, researchers said, and to test whether the vaccine protects against infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of people, including people with underlying health conditions.The first efficacy data from those Phase III trials is “possible in the coming weeks”, the Lancet report said.Read more | Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine ‘encouraging’ for older age groupsThe Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine candidate, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, had been among the front-runners in global efforts to develop shots to protect against infection with the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2.But rival drugmakers Pfizer Inc, BioNTech and Moderna Inc have in the past 10 days edged ahead, releasing data from late-stage Covid-19 vaccine trials that shows more than 90% efficacy.Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots, both of which use new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), the AstraZeneca experimental shot is viral vector vaccine made from a weakened version of a common cold virus found in chimpanzees.The Phase II trial reported in The Lancet involved a total of 560 healthy volunteers, with 160 aged 18-55 years, 160 aged 56-69 years, and 240 aged 70 or over.Volunteers got two doses of the vaccine or a placebo, and no serious side effects related to the AZD1222 vaccine were reported, the researchers said.AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets close to reporting results of its late-stage trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-shot-candidate-shows-promise-among-elderly-in-trials/story-3S7atJ8j2KBSrCi9qMZpvK.html

The development came on a day when Canada’s cyber-spy agency warned that “state-sponsored” programmes of countries such China posed the “the greatest strategic threats to Canada”.The opposition motion came in reaction to reports that China was using proxies to coerce Canadians of Chinese origin into silence and not criticising the regime of President Xi Jinping. It calls for a “robust plan” from the government “to combat China’s growing foreign operations here in Canada and its increasing intimidation of Canadians living in Canada, and table it within 30 days of the adoption of this motion”.Meanwhile, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre), which is part of the Communications Security Establishment, released a report identifying China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as foreign states that posed a security threat to Canada in this realm.“State-sponsored actors are very likely attempting to develop cyber capabilities to disrupt Canadian critical infrastructure, such as the supply of electricity, to further their goals,” the report from the Cyber Centre stated. While it judged such action was “unlikely”, it added that “cyber threat actors may target critical Canadian organisations to collect information, pre-position for future activities, or as a form of intimidation”.It described such state-sponsored activity as the “most sophisticated” threat that Canada faced. The report also pointed out that such nations will “almost certainly continue” their attempts to steal intellectual property related to research in Canada into countering the Covid-19 pandemic. “State-sponsored actors will almost certainly continue to conduct commercial espionage against Canadian businesses, academia, and governments to steal Canadian intellectual property and proprietary information,” it stated.It also warned that such dangers were not restricted to within the country, but was “almost certainly higher for Canadian organisations that operate abroad or work directly with foreign state-owned enterprises”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-mps-urge-justin-trudeau-government-to-toughen-stand-on-chinese-intimidation-huawei-s-role/story-fsKUpMUDu9ZXXc95mzRyqJ.html
19-11-2020||World||China perceives rising India as ‘rival’; wants to constraint its partnership with US, allies: report||China perceives a rising India as a “rival” and wants to constrain its strategic partnership with the US, its allies, and with other democracies, the State Department said in a report, emphasising that Beijing intends to displace America as the world’s foremost power. Coming ahead of the transition of power from Donald Trump’s administration to President-elect Joe Biden’s administration after the November 3 US presidential election, the detailed policy document highlights that China is undermining the security, autonomy and economic interests of many nations in the region. “China perceives rising India as a rival and seeks to impel it to accommodate Beijing’s ambitions by engaging economically while constraining New Delhi’s strategic partnership with the US, Japan, Australia and its relations with other democracies,” the report said. “China is undermining the security, autonomy, and economic interests of many others in the region — such as member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including those in the vital Mekong Region, as well as the nations of the Pacific Islands,” the report added. The 70-page report states that awareness has been growing in the US - and in nations around the world - that the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has triggered a new era of great-power competition.Read more | China is fortifying defences across Ladakh border, not prepping to disengage “Yet few discern the pattern in China’s inroads within every region of the world, much less the specific form of dominance to which the party aspires,” said the report. The CCP aims not merely at preeminence within the established world order — an order that is grounded in free and sovereign nation-states, flows from the universal principles on which America was founded, and advances US national interests —but to fundamentally revise world order, placing the People’s Republic of China (PRC) at the center and serving Beijing’s authoritarian goals and hegemonic ambitions. “In the face of the China challenge, the US must secure freedom,” said the report. China, it said, seeks to diminish US influence by fostering a sense in the region’s nations that China’s dominance is inevitable. “Prime targets include US treaty-based allies — Japan, South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines — as well as emerging strategic partners such as India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Taiwan,” it said. The People’s Liberation Army, the report said, recently provoked skirmishes along its disputed border with India, which killed dozens on both sides, and remains in a tense standoff with India’s military.Read more | China increases movement as rifts develop in Nepal Communist Party Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated after the June 15 Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers died. The report also highlighted Beijing’s hard relations with Taiwan, which it claims as its territory. “Beijing menaces democratic Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province, intending to reunify Taiwan with the Mainland — by force if necessary. And the PLA Navy and Chinese Coast Guard increasingly challenge Japan’s administrative control of the Senkaku Islands,” it said. “The Trump administration achieved a fundamental break with conventional wisdom. It concluded that the CCP’s resolute conduct and self-professed goals require the US and other countries to revise assumptions and develop a new strategic doctrine to address the primacy and magnitude of the China challenge,” according to the document. The report also highlighted the outbreak of contagious coronavirus from China’s Wuhan city. The disease has so far infected 56,178, 674 people and killed 1,348,348 others across the world. The US is the worst affected country. “The CCP’s recklessness in allowing the novel coronavirus born in Wuhan to develop into a global pandemic coupled with the concerted disinformation campaign that Beijing undertook to conceal China’s culpability should put doubts to rest. Yet many people lack a proper understanding of the character and scope of the China challenge,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-perceives-rising-india-as-rival-wants-to-constraint-its-partnership-with-us-allies-report/story-XSV96blPwTzWIQQoPlCq6K.html

The findings published in ‘Lancet’ on Thursday based on 560 healthy adult volunteers shows that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine is “safe and well tolerated” with a lower reactogenicity profile in older adults than in younger adults, meaning the older age groups could build immunity to the disease.“These findings are encouraging because older individuals are at disproportionate risk of severe Covid-19 and so any vaccine adopted for use against SARS-CoV-2 [Covid-19] must be effective in older adults,” the researchers note.The team is also testing whether the vaccine stops people developing Covid-19 in larger Phase 3 trials and early results from this crucial stage are expected in the coming weeks.“We were pleased to see that our vaccine was not only well tolerated in older adults, but also stimulated similar immune responses to those seen in younger volunteers,” said Dr Maheshi Ramasamy, an investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group.Read more | Where are we in the Covid-19 vaccine race?“The next step will be to see if this translates into protection from the disease itself,” she said.This means there are now four promising vaccines on the horizon after Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik and Moderna already reporting good preliminary data from Phase 3 trials.The UK has already ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine, being manufactured by pharma major AstraZeneca.The vaccine also has a tie-up with the Serum Institute of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-university-covid-19-vaccine-encouraging-for-older-age-groups/story-1rAkszKRBQYSWEbqQkUf5O.html

Angus Campbell said Thursday the shameful record included alleged instances in which new patrol members would shoot a prisoner in order to achieve their first kill in a practice known as “blooding.” He said the soldiers would then plant weapons and radios to support false claims the prisoners were enemies killed in action.Campbell told reporters in Canberra the illegal killings began in 2009, with the majority occurring in 2012 and 2013. He said some members of the elite Special Air Service encouraged “a self-centered, warrior culture.”The chief was announcing the findings of a four-year investigation by Maj. Gen. Paul Brereton, a judge and Army reservist who was asked to look into the allegations and interviewed more than 400 witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of documents. Brereton recommended 19 soldiers be investigated by police for possible charges, including murder.“To the people of Afghanistan, on behalf of the Australian Defence Force, I sincerely and unreservedly apologize for any wrongdoing by Australian soldiers,” Campbell said.He said he’d spoken directly to his Afghan military counterpart to express his remorse.“Such alleged behavior profoundly disrespected the trust placed in us by the Afghan people who had asked us to their country to help them,” Campbell said. “It would have devastated the lives of Afghan families and communities, causing immeasurable pain and suffering. And it would have put in jeopardy our mission and the safety of our Afghan and coalition partners.”As well as the 39 killings, the report outlines two allegations of cruel treatment. It says that none of the alleged crimes were committed during the heat of battle.Only parts of the report have been made public. Many details, including the names of alleged killers, remain redacted.The report said a total of 25 current or former troops were involved as perpetrators or accessories in 23 separate incidents, with some involved just once and a few multiple times.It said some Australian troops would regularly carry “throw downs” — things like foreign pistols, radios and grenades that they could plant on those they killed so the Afghan civilians would appear like combatants in photographs.The report said most of the alleged crimes were committed and concealed at a patrol commander level by corporals and sergeants, and that while higher-level troop and squadron commanders had to take some responsibility for the events that happened on their watch, they weren’t primarily to blame.The report paints a picture of a toxic culture in which soldiers were competing against those from other squadrons, accounts of deaths were sanitized or embellished, and many procedures to ensure safety and integrity had broken down.“Those who wished to speak up were allegedly discouraged, intimidated and discredited,” Campbell said.The report recommended 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation. Campbell said he’s accepting all the report’s recommendations.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has already announced a special investigator will help pursue possible prosecutions because the workload would overwhelm existing police resources.Many troops are also likely to be stripped of their medals and the defense force will undergo significant structural changes. The report says that where there is credible evidence of unlawful killings, Afghan families should be compensated immediately by Australia without waiting for the criminal cases to proceed.“This will be an important step in rehabilitating Australia’s international reputation, in particular with Afghanistan, and it is simply the right thing to do,” the report states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elite-australian-troops-unlawfully-killed-39-afghans-report-finds/story-5xOKyesB3AHvvPVkOC5yAO.html

Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi addressed the nation live on television and radio, urging people to remain vigilant with their virus precautions. Samoa was among a dwindling handful of nations to have not reported a single case of the virus. According to the Samoa Observer, the prime minister said the patient was a sailor who had been staying in a quarantine facility since flying in from New Zealand on Friday. He said the sailor returned a positive test four days after arriving, but then a second test on Thursday returned a negative result. The prime minister said the Cabinet would meet Thursday to decide on any changes to the current virus settings, the Observer reported. Samoa is home to about 200,000 people. In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea added more than 300 new coronavirus cases for a second consecutive day as authorities began enforcing toughened social distancing rules in some areas. The 343 new cases recorded Thursday by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency took the country’s total to 29,654 with 498 deaths. Elevated physical distancing rules took effective in the greater Seoul area, the southern city of Gwangju and some parts of the eastern Gangwon province. In those areas, gatherings of more than 100 people during rallies, concerts and other events is prohibited, while audiences at sporting events and religious services are limited to 30-50 per cent of capacity. Dancing at nightclubs and drinking at karaoke rooms is also prohibited.

19-11-2020||World||‘Get Covered 2021’: Coalition seizes on Covid-19 pandemic to boost ‘Obamacare’ sign-ups||As Covid-19 spreads uncontrolled in many places, a coalition of states, health care groups and activists is striving to drum up “Obamacare” sign-ups among a growing number of Americans uninsured in perilous times.The campaign kicking off Thursday is called Get Covered 2021 and contrasts with a lack of outreach to the uninsured by the Trump administration, which is still trying to overturn the Affordable Care Act, even in the coronavirus pandemic.“There’s renewed energy around getting people covered this year, given how Covid-19 is impacting so many people’s lives,” said Joshua Peck, a former Obama administration official helping lead the effort.About 26 million people were uninsured last year — before the wave of layoffs that followed the virus shutdown this spring. Experts agree that number has risen, perhaps by 5 million to 10 million, but authoritative estimates await government studies that take time to produce.Nonetheless, research from the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that about 6 in 10 uninsured people would be eligible for some form of subsidized coverage under the Obama-era law. Open enrollment for subsidized private plans through HealthCare.gov is underway and ends Dec. 15.The new sign-up campaign will culminate Dec. 10 with a national “Get Covered America Day,” ahead of the final weekend of open enrollment, traditionally crunch time for prospective customers. Some consumers may get a second chance with the incoming administration. President-elect Joe Biden would reopen HealthCare.gov, creating a special enrollment period for people affected by the coronavirus pandemic.The Get Covered 2021 coalition is anchored by 14 states that run their own health insurance marketplaces, plus Washington, D.C. Also participating are groups that represent doctors and hospitals, as well as the health insurance industry and organizations that advocate for patients. Several liberal advocacy groups and a California-based consortium of public and private employers round out the membership.“The focus of our efforts will be on tapping into the networks and reach of these organizations,” said Peck.The Dec. 10 mobilization will feature a national social media campaign and efforts to generate local news coverage in communities across the country. The campaign website GetCovered2021.org will be able to link interested consumers to their state insurance marketplace or the federal HealthCare.gov.Peck said the campaign faces what he called “tailwinds and headwinds.”The pool of uninsured people eligible and potentially interested has grown. Those who have lost employer coverage and have no immediate job prospects may be anxious to have secure health benefits again, with no exclusions for preexisting medical conditions.On the other hand, Peck continued, the uncertain coronavirus economy has strained family budgets for many people, and even a subsidized monthly premium around $80 may be too much. Additionally, the Trump administration is taking no special action to promote the availability of coverage at a time of greater need for many.Administration officials say they are focused on providing a smooth sign-up experience for consumers. About 11.4 million people currently have private coverage under the ACA. For more than 8 in 10, the premiums are subsidized.Earlier this month, a seemingly skeptical Supreme Court heard the Trump administration’s case for overturning Obamacare. A decision is expected by late spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/get-covered-2021-coalition-seizes-on-covid-19-pandemic-to-boost-obamacare-sign-ups/story-f6Z0nCBVHDIwqLvSlb3PFO.html

Raytheon Missiles and Defense develops and produces missile systems for use by the United States military.During his employment with the company, Sun had access to information directly related to defense-related technology. Some of this defense technical information constituted, what is defined as “defense articles”, which are controlled and prohibited from export without a license under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).According to federal prosecutors, from December 2018 to January 2019, Sun travelled from the United States to China on a personal trip. On that trip, Sun brought along unclassified technical information in his company-issued computer, including data associated with an advanced missile guidance system that was controlled and regulated under the AECA and the ITAR.Despite having been trained to handle these materials correctly, Sun knowingly transported the information to China without an export license in violation of the AECA and the ITAR.“Sun was a highly skilled engineer entrusted with sensitive missile technology that he knew he could not legally transfer to hostile hands,” Assistant Attorney General John C Demers said on Wednesday.“Nevertheless, he delivered that controlled technology to China,” he said. The United States relies on private contractors to help build its “unparalleled defence technology”, said United States Attorney Michael Bailey. “People who try to expose that technology to hostile foreign powers should know that prison awaits them. The close cooperation of the victim defense contractor and the dedication of the FBI made this case a success,” he added. “This is not about a laptop mistakenly taken on a trip, this was the illegal export of US missile technology to China,” Assistant Director Alan E Kohler, Jr. of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-american-sentenced-to-38-months-for-exporting-sensitive-military-technology-to-china/story-QEG96vUJwzEyqNUPKSIJ2L.html

That has prompted fears world markets might split into smaller segments with incompatible industry standards, hurting productivity.“We will never go back in history by seeking to decouple or forming a ‘small circle’ to keep others out,” Xi said.Thursday’s event came ahead of a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders hosted by Malaysia. The meeting Friday is due to be conducted via internet due to the pandemic.Xi’s comments followed Sunday’s signing of the world’s largest free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, by Beijing and 14 other Asian neighbors.The Chinese-initiated RCEP appeals to other developing countries because it reduces barriers to trade in farm goods, manufactured goods and components, which make up most of their exports. It says little about trade in services and access for companies to operate in each other’s economies, which the United States and other developed countries want.The Trump administration has cut off Chinese tech giant Huawei’s access to most U.S. components and technology on security grounds. Washington has shut Huawei and a rival Chinese telecom equipment vendor, ZTE, out of the U.S. market. The White House is pressing the Chinese owner of video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation, which American officials say is a security risk.Xi promised to cut tariffs but gave no details.“We will further reduce tariffs and institutional costs, cultivate a number of import trade promotion innovation demonstration zones, and expand imports of high-quality products and services from various countries,” he said.China’s repeated promises to set up trade zones and ease import restrictions prompt complaints by the United States, Europe, Japan and other trading partners that Beijing is using such isolated steps to avoid complying with promises made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 to allow foreign companies to compete freely in its economy.China is one of the world’s biggest importers, but the United States and other governments complain Beijing is dragging its feet on carrying out two-decade-old promises to open its markets to foreign competitors in banking, finance and other services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-will-avoid-decoupling-amid-tension-with-us-europe-says-xi-jinping/story-hTrPLorzLxx8RAw2ZAyV4O.html

Study claims Hepatitis C drugs can be effective against Covid-19||Even as countries across the world are scrambling to find a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has claimed more than a million lives, there might be some hope on the horizon. This “hope,” though, is not related to the development of a Covid-19 vaccine but, rather, with Hepatitis C disease.A study conducted by the United States’ Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory has found that several drugs used to treat Hepatitis C can be effective against an enzyme, which has the ability to help Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease or Covid-19, spread in human cells. The results of the study have been published in science journal Structures.The study found that the enzyme, a protein enzyme called Protease, is used by Sars-Cov-2 to replicate itself once it has entered the human cell. In order to become a functional protein, Protease needs to cut a long chain of compounds that the virus expresses. It is the prevention of the functioning of the main Protease which can be used to stop the virus from spreading. It is here that the Hepatitis C drugs can be used.The study was conducted as part of efforts to develop treatments for Covid-19 by repurposing existing drugs that are used for other viral diseases. As a part of this exercise, researchers looked at several drug molecules, including three Hepatitis C drugs, which are Protease inhibitors: telaprevir, narlaprevir and boceprevir. A technique called ‘in vitro enzyme kinetics’ was used to conduct the study.No vaccine has been developed as yet to treat Covid-19 though several candidates are in different phases of trials across the globe. The disease has affected more than 56 million people and has claimed more than 1.3 million lives, a worldometers tally shows. As per the tally, nearly 40 million people, too, have recovered from the infection thus far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ray-of-hope-study-claims-hepatitis-c-drugs-can-be-effective-against-covid-19/story-57X6PRGxTVWeZZYphDvlON.html

James Story’s nomination as the Venezuelan ambassador was confirmed Wednesday by a US Senate voice vote. Relations between the US and Venezuela have had a long, rocky past that includes President Donald Trump’s administration winning an indictment against Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro as an alleged narcoterrorist. But Joe Biden’s win could be a new chapter in the two countries’ relationship as experts have predicted that the president-elect might move away from Trump’s hard-line approach of isolating Maduro.Who is James Story? Story, 50, a South Carolina native is a career diplomat nominated by Trump in May and he has been serving as the embassy’s charge d’affairs, the diplomat who heads a mission in the absence of an ambassador. His foreign service’ career has taken him to Mexico, Brazil, Mozambique and Afghanistan. He will likely play a key role helping guide US policy on Venezuela during the transition of President-elect Joe Biden and he will carry out the job from the capital of neighboring Colombia.Read more | Indo-US ties will pick up, Joe Biden no stranger to India: S JaishankarHow have US- Venezuela relations been? The two countries haven’t exchanged ambassadors since 2010, when relations first started to fray under the late President Hugo Chávez. The two nations totally broke diplomatic ties last year, each withdrawing its diplomats shortly after Washington backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country’s legitimate leader. US leads a coalition of dozens of nations that rejected Maduro following his election in 2018 to a second term in a vote widely considered fraudulent because the most popular opposition leaders were banned from running. US has heavily sanctioned Maduro, his inner circle and the state-run oil firm, attempting to isolate them. The Trump administration offered a $15 million bounty for Maduro’s arrest after a US court indicted him on drug charges.What do the experts say on US- Venezuela ties? Experts say heavy sanctions have failed to remove Maduro from power, opening Venezuela to US competitors like China, Russia and Iran, while making life harder for millions of residents of the South American nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-time-in-decade-us-names-ambassador-to-venezuela-amid-tension/story-LCoDjfOCIZN5b7pWxrez2I.html

In a virtual roundtable with healthcare workers on Covid-19, Biden alleged on Wednesday that his transition team has not been receiving any cooperation from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has refused to concede the November 3 US election and has filed multiple lawsuits challenging poll results in several States. “One of the problems that we’re having now is the failure of the administration to recognise - the law says that the General Services Administration has a person who recognises who the winner is and then they have to have access to all the data and information that the government possesses to be prepared,” he said. It does not require there to be an absolute winner, Biden said, adding that it says the apparent winner. “We have been unable to get access to the kinds of things we need to know about the depth of the stockpiles. We know there’s not much at all. We get to the point where we have a sense of when these vaccines come out, how they’ll be distributed, who will be first in line, what the plan is,” he said.Read more | US Election 2020: Legal battles Trump may face after losing presidential privileges “There’s over 300 million Americans and beyond our border that they’re going to have to be taken care of. There’s a whole lot of things that are we just don’t have available to us. So much as made available soon, we’re going to be behind by weeks or months being able to put together the whole initiative relating to the biggest promise we have with two drug companies coming along and finding 95 per cent effectiveness/efficiency in the vaccines, which is enormous promise,” Biden said. He said it is the only slowdown right now that his transition team is facing. “We put together I think a first-rate team that you would all be proud of and we’re all ready to go and doing an awful lot of work right now,” he noted. This week, some of the nation’s largest medical groups joined Dr Anthony Fauci, as well as members of the Biden-Harris Covid-19 Advisory Board, in calling for the GSA to stop delaying ascertainment and ensure a seamless transition as Covid-19 infection rates surge across the country. The experts emphasised the need for a smooth transition to bolster the Covid-19 response and prevent further harm to the American people. They said that ascertainment was necessary for the Biden-Harris transition to help determine the public health and economic steps to get the virus under control, to deliver immediate relief to working families, to address ongoing racial and ethnic disparities, and to reopen the schools and businesses safely and effectively. In a letter, the CEOs of the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association urged the Trump administration to “work closely with the Biden transition team to share all critical information related to Covid-19.” “Real-time data and information on the supply of therapeutics, testing supplies, personal protective equipment, ventilators, hospital bed capacity and workforce availability to plan for further deployment of the nation’s assets needs to be shared to save countless lives” they wrote in the letter. “All information about the capacity of the Strategic National Stockpile, the assets from Operation Warp Speed, and plans for dissemination of therapeutics and vaccines needs to be shared as quickly as possible to ensure that there is continuity in strategic planning so that there is no lapse in our ability to care for patients,” they said. The letter cited their perspective as ‘providers of care for all Americans” who see the suffering that is occurring due to Covid-19. “We see families who have lost both parents from Covid-19; we see children suffering from long-term effects due to a Covid-19 infection; and we see minority populations disproportionately suffering from the devastation of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is from this front line human perspective that we urge you to share critical data and information as soon as possible,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vaccination-plan-could-lose-weeks-or-months-biden-on-transition-delay/story-j4lFgEJqwJha2DGjmO3TqK.html
19-11-2020||World||Covid-19 negative report gives false hope, don’t go out yet: Experts||Across the world, including India, people are in a midst of festivities with Chhath being celebrated and Thanksgiving approaching followed by Christmas in December. Even as people are learning to live with the pandemic, cases of the coronavirus disease are also exploding and more and more people are taking part in gatherings with Covid-19 negative certificates. But does it really guarantee that the person with a negative test result will not spread Covid-19?Scientists do not agree with this at all and say that there is no guarantee that a negative report will be safe. Rather, they add, it creates false hope. Therefore, they say it is advisable that a person who has been exposed to Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease, should still follow the mandated guidelines as a precautionary measure.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“You should not rely on test results alone to safely socialise in person. A test can only tell you if you are positive at a given moment in time, and can also fail to detect cases if you are infected but not yet shedding substantial virus,” Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security, was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.A person who has been exposed to the virus can take days to actually show symptoms of the viral disease. Experts say a test result could fail to detect the presence of the virus in the body if the exposed person is tested shortly after getting infected. The virus needs to reproduce enough copies of itself for it to be detected in the Covid-19 tests. The incubation period for Covid-19 is up to 14 days. And before that, a person can test negative and have no symptoms at all.There is also a possibility that a person may contract the virus after getting the test done. Hence it is advisable for the exposed person to stay under quarantine for at least a week after exposure to the virus.There are several types of Covid-19 tests that can be taken to confirm whether a person has contracted the coronavirus disease.Antigen tests are rapid tests which give you results within an hour or so. They are performed with nasal swabs and look for the presence of a specific protein on the surface of the virus. As the person gets results within hours, they are widely being used to test asymptomatic persons. However, there is a high chance of getting a false negative report with a rapid antigen test.Molecular tests are the RT-PCR tests which look for virus’ genetic material in the body. This test is performed with nasal swabs or throat swabs or both. RT-PCR tests are more credible but then it can take days to give you results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-negative-report-gives-false-hope-don-t-go-out-yet-experts/story-cgpztiw4LgNIzmg1E2TrYL.html

The claims included that Diana’s phone was bugged and that her bodyguard was plotting against her.Charles Spencer has demanded an inquiry and an apology. The BBC has apologised for faked bank statements purporting to show that two senior aides were being paid for information on Diana. But the corporation has said that the documents played no part in her decision to take part in the interview.Read more | As transition period nears end, where do UK, EU currently stand on Brexit talks?The 1995 interview, in which Diana famously said “there were three of us in this marriage” — referring to Prince Charles’ relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles — was watched by millions of people.Diana died in a Paris car crash in 1997 as she was pursued by paparazzi.The BBC said Bashir, currently its religion editor, is signed off work by his doctors because he is recovering from heart surgery and complications related to contracting Covid-19 earlier this year.The broadcaster said John Dyson, a former Supreme Court judge, is “an eminent and highly respected figure who will lead a thorough process”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bbc-names-ex-judge-to-lead-probe-into-1995-diana-interview/story-fIIEBkZctpHqLIAYfMPM8J.html
19-11-2020||World||Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine deliveries could start ‘before Christmas’||Pfizer Inc and BioNTech could secure emergency US and European authorization for their Covid-19 vaccine next month after final trial results showed it had a 95% success rate and no serious side effects, the drugmakers said on Wednesday.The vaccine’s efficacy was found to be consistent across different ages and ethnicities - a promising sign given the disease has disproportionately hurt the elderly and certain groups including Black people.The US Food and Drug Administration could grant emergency-use by the middle of December, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters TV. Conditional approval in the European Union could be secured in the second half of December, he added.“If all goes well I could imagine that we gain approval in the second half of December and start deliveries before Christmas, but really only if all goes positively,” he said.The success rate of the vaccine developed by the US drugmaker and German partner BioNTech was far higher than what regulators had said would have been acceptable. Experts said it was a significant achievement in the race to end the pandemic.Of the 170 volunteers who contracted Covid-19 in Pfizer’s trial involving over 43,000 people, 162 had received a placebo and not the vaccine, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective. Of the 10 people who had severe Covid-19, one had received the vaccine.“A first in the history of mankind: less than a year from the sequence of the virus to the large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine, moreover based on a whole new technique,” said Enrico Bucci, a biologist at Temple University in Philadelphia. “Today is a special day.” BioNTech’s Sahin said US emergency use authorization (EUA) would be applied for on Friday. An FDA advisory committee tentatively plans to meet on Dec. 8-10 to discuss the vaccine, a source familiar with the situation said, though the dates could change. The FDA did not respond to requests for comment. Covid-19 runs rampantThe final trial analysis comes a week after initial results showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. Moderna Inc on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine showing 94.5% effectiveness.“We now have two safe and highly effective vaccines that could be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and ready to distribute within weeks,” US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.The Moderna vaccine is likely to be authorized within seven to 10 days of Pfizer receiving its EUA, US officials said, with states ready to begin distribution within 24 hours.The better-than-expected results from the two vaccines, both developed with new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, have raised hopes for an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life.The news was especially welcome with the virus again running rampant around the world, setting records for new infections and hospitalizations almost daily. The Pfizer-BioNTech shot was found to have 94% efficacy in people over age 65, a particularly high-risk group.“This is the evidence we needed to ensure that the most vulnerable people are protected,” said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at the University of Liverpool’s department of pharmacology.Global shares rose as the trial results countered concerns around the soaring infection rate. Pfizer shares were up 1.6% while BioNTech jumped 3.8% in the United States. Moderna shares fell 3.6%. Investors have treated vaccine development as a race between companies, although there is likely to be global demand for as much vaccine as can be produced for the foreseeable future.Distributing shotsPfizer said it expects to make as many as 50 million vaccine doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.While some groups such as healthcare workers will be prioritized in the United States and Britain for vaccinations, it will be months before large-scale rollouts begin in either country. On Wednesday, Pfizer said it had offered to provide Brazil with millions of doses in the first half of 2021. It also has agreements with the European Union, Germany and Japan where distribution could begin next year. Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s top emergency expert, said it would be at least 4-6 months before significant levels of vaccination were taking place around the world.Distribution of a Pfizer-BioNTech shot is complicated by the need to store it at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius. It can, however, be kept in normal refrigeration for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.Moderna’s vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20C though it is expected to be stable for 30 days at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36°-46°F).Fatigue and headachesPfizer said vaccine was well-tolerated and that side effects were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The only severe adverse events experienced by volunteers were fatigue (3.8%) and headaches (2%) after the second dose. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events.“These are extraordinary results, and the safety data look good,” said David Spiegelhalter, a professor and expert in risk and evidence communication at the University of Cambridge. Of the dozens of drugmakers and research groups racing to develop Covid-19 vaccines, the next late-stage data will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson said it is on track to deliver data this year.Authorization of vaccines for children will take longer. Only Pfizer has started vaccinating volunteers under age 18 and as young as 12. Moderna and J&J have said they hope to start testing the vaccine in younger people soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-deliveries-could-start-before-christmas/story-YSPXmP8cnJKs0Be3fVD4yO.html
19-11-2020||World||After 95% efficacy, what’s next for Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine candidate||US pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc on Wednesday announced its vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) had a 95% success rate, which was higher than an earlier analysis. Announcing the new test results for the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with German biotech firm BioNTech, Pfizer said it is safe and works on older people as well who are most at risk of dying due to the respiratory disease.The news of the final analysis of the trial’s data came as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to worsen across the world. As per the John Hopkins University, as many as 56,166,387 people have contracted Covid-19 so far and 1,346,741 people lost their lives due to the viral disease.While it is encouraging news for the US and European countries, which already have a deal with Pfizer for millions of doses, countries like India are going to face major hurdles with the logistical issue such as cold storage as the Pfizer candidate requires -70 degrees of temperature. Even countries with more robust cold chain systems may have to shed money to store the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.Here is what is next for Pfizer vaccine after the success in the clinical trial:1. The company will send applications to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to seek emergency-use authorisation. The shots will be distributed within 24 hours after the drug regulator body gives its nod to emergency use.2. Pfizer also have begun “rolling submissions” for the vaccine with regulators in Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada and soon will add this new data to its application.3. While the government in the United States has started preparation for the distribution as it has identified 64 jurisdictions that will lead vaccine distribution for their areas.4. Pfizer is also working to determined how long the protection would last after a person takes the two-dose regimen of its candidate. It is also working to understand whether people might need boosters.5. Based on its current projections, Pfizer is expected to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.6. The firm has so far inked deals for hundreds of millions of doses of the Covid-19 vaccine with countries like the US, the UK, Japan and the European Union region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-95-efficacy-what-s-next-for-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/story-cqK3AGWAmdsDYIUH43fdZM.html
19-11-2020||World||Covid-19: What are clinical trials and how do they work?||To find out whether experimental Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective, researchers design clinical trials involving thousands of volunteers, divided into groups that receive either the drug under investigation or a placebo. Data from such trials have shown that two vaccines -- one developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, the other by Moderna and the US National Institutes of Health -- are about 95 percent effective.Here’s a look at how trials work:Who leads clinical trials? American pharmaceutical Pfizer itself has led and financed a clinical trial of its vaccine involving almost 44,000 people in the United States, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina.Volunteers who are accepted receive two doses 21 days apart and get regular follow-up.The Moderna-NIH vaccine is given 28-days-apart at locations across the US on some 30,000 volunteers, in a trial part funded by the taxpayer.The trials are “blinded” meaning neither the volunteers nor the health care providers know who gets the medicine and who gets a saline solution placebo.How do we know if the vaccines worked? Volunteers have not been deliberately infected with the virus. This option, known as a challenge trial, was considered but deemed too risky given that there aren’t any Covid-19 treatments that are proven as highly-effective.Instead volunteers are expected to go about their lives as normal, and are given the same advice about mask use, distancing and hand washing as everyone else.Over the course of time, a certain number naturally become infected, and since they’re getting regular follow-up, the trial investigators quickly find out.If the vaccine is effective, the number of people who fall sick in the vaccine group should be lower than the number of people who get ill in the placebo group.The aim is to find a difference great enough to exclude the possibility it occurred by chance. Statistical methods come into play to achieve a predetermined level of certainty. It’s worth noting that the primary goal is to prevent people from getting sick, with good vaccines also protecting people from severe illness.Stopping people from getting infected at all, and thus being able to transmit the virus forward, is a secondary goal for Moderna.Moncef Slaoui, chief of the US government’s Operation Warp Speed, said Wednesday he expects the vaccines will achieve these goals too, though at a lower efficacy rate.Why have a placebo?  The only way of knowing whether a vaccine works is by providing a “control”, which is a demonstration of what would happen in its absence. Of course, different people have different risk profiles in terms of their ages, underlying conditions, and how much risky behavior they engage in. That’s why the trials need to be scaled to tens of thousands of people to eliminate confounding factors.Who analyzes the data? To ensure scientific rigor is upheld, the data is firewalled from the companies and analyzed by experts in a “data and safety monitoring board” whose membership is kept secret to prevent political pressure.Over the course of a trial, these committees will lift the hood on the data that’s been collected so far and see which patients belonged to which group.They can then inform the manufacturer in case of conclusive results and the manufacturer can then use the data, if it’s favorable, to apply for a marketing authorization. The boards also closely monitor safety, looking at the frequency and severity of side-effects, a key factor in determining regulatory approval.95 percent efficacy? Pfizer’s efficacy analysis featured 170 people who fell sick with Covid-19 in the seven days following the second dose, which might seem like a small number of people compared to the total trial participants (44,000).But it’s enough to say the result is statistically significant with a high-degree of certainty. That’s because 162 people who fell ill were on the placebo, and only eight were in the vaccine group -- a difference so great it’s extremely improbable to come about by chance.An efficacy of 95 percent signifies that the risk of catching Covid-19 is reduced by 95 percent in the vaccinated group compared to the placebo group.Placebo group get vaccine? They will all be transferred to the vaccine arm -- but it is still being decided when that will happen, said Slaoui. The Pfizer and Moderna trials will therefore lose their “control” groups, but the participants will still be followed for two more years to determine how long immunity lasts and whether there are longer-term safety effects.It will also make it harder to recruit new people to ongoing trials for vaccines that aren’t yet as close to applying for approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-what-are-clinical-trials-and-how-do-they-work/story-YkOas2TfZ7kQY5v2izwzSL.html

Deaths are averaging more than 1,155 per day, the highest in months.The out-of-control surge is leading governors and mayors across the US to grudgingly issue mask mandates, limit the size of private and public gatherings ahead of Thanksgiving, ban indoor restaurant dining, close gyms or restrict the hours and capacity of bars, stores and other businesses.New York City’s school system — the nation’s largest, with more than 1 million students — suspended in-person classes Wednesday amid a mounting infection rate, a painful setback in a corner of the country that suffered mightily in the spring but had seemingly beaten back the virus months ago.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageTexas is rushing thousands of additional medical staff to overworked hospitals as the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients statewide accelerates toward 8,000 for the first time since a deadly summer outbreak.In the worsening rural Panhandle, roughly half of the admitted patients in Lubbock’s two main hospitals had COVID-19, and a dozen people with the virus were waiting in the emergency room for beds to open up Tuesday night, said Dr. Ron Cook, the Lubbock County health authority.“We’re in trouble,” Cook said.In the Texas border city of El Paso, overwhelmed morgues have begun paying jail inmates $2 an hour to help transport the bodies of virus victims. The crush of patients is forcing the city to send its non-COVID-19 cases to hospitals elsewhere in the state.More than 5,400 extra medical personnel have been deployed around Texas by the state alone, said Lara Anton, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. And that doesn’t include the help surging into Texas from the military and volunteer organizations.“There are only so many medical personnel to go around. And I think what we’re seeing in places like El Paso is not sustainable in all or a large part of the state,” said Dr. Mark McClellan, a former head of the Food and Drug Administration.Ballad Health system, which is located in the Appalachian mountains and includes the Tennessee hospital where Alison Johnson works, has warned that it and its workers are stretched so thin that without a change in course, its hospitals might have to turn patients away. Ballad reported having just 16 available ICU beds Wednesday and about 250 team members in isolation or quarantine. It is trying to recruit hundreds more nurses.In Idaho, doctors warned that hospitals have almost reached the point where they need to ration care, unable to treat everyone because there aren’t enough beds or staffers to go around.“Never in my career did I think we would even contemplate the idea of rationing care in the United States of America,” said Dr. Jim Souza, chief medical officer for St. Luke’s Health System.In Reno, Nevada, Renown Regional Medical Center began moving some coronavirus patients into its parking garage.Video of the converted garage before it opened to patients showed rows and rows of beds separated by moveable white screens set up on one level of the stark, cavernous garage, each section designated by letters and each bed space marked by a number on the ground. The garage unit currently houses 27 patients but at peak capacity will have enough beds to accommodate more than 1,400, said Dr. Paul Sierzenski, Renown’s chief medical officer for acute care.The garage is heated, pressurized to ensure adequate airflow and set up for patients who don’t require long-term hospital care, Sierzenski said.In Kansas, hospitals are converting spaces such as chapels and cafeterias for use by Covid-19 patients, said Cindy Samuelson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Hospital Association.Stormont Vail Health in Topeka, Kansas, devoted an entire hospital floor to Covid-19 patients as their numbers swelled, hitting 90 on Wednesday. The hospital also converted two surgery waiting rooms for use by non-infected patients, spokesman Matt Lara said.Kansas health chief Dr. Lee Norman said a system that he likened to air traffic control for coronavirus patients is being put in place so nurses from rural hospitals can make a single call to find a larger hospital that can take their sickest patients.In some cases, nurses and doctors in Kansas have been spending up to eight hours looking for a large hospital with an opening.Maryland health officials similarly set up a centralized clearinghouse with information on available ICU beds so that hospitals need only make a single phone call. State authorities also issued an emergency order prohibiting most hospital visitors until further notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tired-to-the-bone-hospitals-in-us-overwhelmed-with-covid-19-cases/story-mldv6OcbFW86pam63gklhJ.html

Cleveland asked residents to stay home, mask mandates were passed in places that had previously resisted them, and New York City’s school district, the largest in the United States, is halting in-person learning from Thursday.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageOver a seven-day average, the United States is reporting 1,176 daily deaths, more than the daily average deaths in India and Brazil combined - the two countries next most affected. The United States has reported a total of about 11.4 million cases since the start of the pandemic and remains the only country to have reported more than 10 million cases. With nearly 158,000 cases per day, it accounts for one in every 26 infections reported worldwide, according to a Reuters tally.The Midwest is currently the hardest-hit region, based on the number of cases per capita.

Nearly £500 million will be spent in the next four years for the development and production of electric vehicle batteries, officials said, adding that the ban on sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 had been agreed with car manufacturers and sellers.Johnson said, “Although this year has taken a very different path to the one we expected, the UK is looking to the future and seizing the opportunity to build back greener. The recovery of our planet and of our economies can and must go hand-in-hand.”The ten-point plan includes making cycling and walking more attractive ways to travel and investing in zero-emission public transport of the future, and producing enough offshore wind to power every home, quadrupling how much the UK produces to 40GW by 2030.It also envisages generating 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 for industry, transport, power and homes, developing the first town powered entirely by hydrogen by the end of the decade.Johnson announced £500 million for the hydrogen-related plan that includes trialling homes using hydrogen for heating and cooking, starting with a “Hydrogen Neighbourhood” in 2023, moving to a “Hydrogen Village” by 2025, with an aim for a “Hydrogen Town” before the end of the decade.Poornima Prabhakaran of Public Health Foundation of India said, “With the spiking pollution levels again choking large tracts of northern India, yet another lesson to emulate for India and the capital city in particular, to deal with its perennial problem of polluting vehicles.“While enhancing public transport and disincentivising private vehicle ownership may work in the interim, a shift to cleaner fuels through a similar policy may just be the right prescription for securing clean air and healthy lungs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ban-on-new-petrol-and-diesel-cars-in-uk-from-2030/story-5bPg0pjmaAynYlos5cJjiI.html
19-11-2020||World||Donald Trump fires top election security official||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired a top election security official from an agency of his own administration that certified the elections as the most secure in US history. Trump has refused to acknowledge he lost to President-elect Joe Biden and has launched legal challenges against the outcome.“The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud - including dead people voting,” tweeted Trump. He added, “Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.”The CISA, as the agency is called, is part of the department of homeland security. Krebs was appointed by Trump.House Democrats nominated Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday as the speaker to lead them into Biden’s presidency, but she’d be guiding a smaller and ideologically divided majority as she tries shepherding his agenda towards enactment.Democrats used a voice vote to make Pelosi their choice to serve two more years in her post. Scattered around the country, it was the party’s first virtual leadership election, a response to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-fires-top-election-security-official/story-rAvzBQuarUk55blLUVzQGO.html
19-11-2020||World||Barack Obama memoir off to record-setting start in sales||Former President Barack Obama’s “A Promised Land” sold nearly 890,000 copies in the US and Canada in its first 24 hours, putting it on track to be the best selling presidential memoir in modern history.The first-day sales, a record for Penguin Random House, includes pre-orders, e-books and audio.“We are thrilled with the first day sales,” said David Drake, publisher of the Penguin Random House imprint Crown. “They reflect the widespread excitement that readers have for President Obama’s highly anticipated and extraordinarily written book.”The only book by a former White House resident to come close to the early pace of “A Promised Land” is the memoir by Obama’s wife, Michelle Obama, whose “Becoming” sold 725,000 copies in North America its first day and has topped 10 million worldwide since its release in 2018. “Becoming” is still so in demand that Crown, which publishes both Obamas and reportedly paid around $60 million for their books, has yet to release a paperback.As of midday Wednesday, “A Promised Land” was No. 1 on Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com. James Daunt, CEO of Barnes & Noble, said that the superstore chain easily sold more than 50,000 copies its first day and hoped to reach half a million within 10 days.“So far it has been neck and neck with Michelle Obama’s book,” he said.Also Read| ‘My fascination with India largely revolved around Mahatma Gandhi’: Barack Obama in his bookBy comparison, Bill Clinton’s “My Life” sold around 400,000 copies in North America its first day and George W. Bush’s “Decision Points” around 220,000, with sales for each memoir currently between 3.5 and 4 million copies. The fastest selling book in memory remains J.K. Rowling’s seventh and final Harry Potter novel, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” which came out in 2007 and sold more than 8 million copies within 24 hours.Obama’s 768-page memoir, which came out Tuesday and has a list price of $45, had unusually risky timing for a book of such importance to the author, to readers and to the publishing industry. It came out just two weeks after Election Day and could have been overshadowed had the race still been in doubt or perhaps unwanted by distressed Obama fans if President Donald Trump had defeated Democratic nominee Joe Biden. But Biden won and his victory likely renews interest in an era when he was Obama’s trusted and popular vice president.Obama himself acknowledges that he didn’t intend for the book, the first of two planned volumes, to arrive so close to a presidential election or to take nearly four years after he left the White House — months longer than for “My Life” and two years longer than “Decision Points.” In the introduction to “A Promised Land,” dated August 2020, Obama writes that “the book kept growing in length and scope” as he found he needed more words than expected to capture a given moment — a bind many authors well understand. He was also working under conditions he “didn’t fully anticipate,” from the pandemic to the Black Lives Matters protests, to, “most troubling of all,” how the country’s “democracy seems to be teetering on the brink of crisis.”Because of the pandemic, Obama will not go on the all-star arena tour Michelle Obama had for “Becoming.” But he benefits from the attention of any memoir by a former president and by the special attention for Obama, who has the rare stature among politicians of writing his own books and for attracting as much or more attention for how he tells a story than for the story itself. Obama has already written two acclaimed, million-selling works, “Dreams from My Father” and “The Audacity of Hope, which came out in 2006. His new book covers some of the same time period as his previous ones, while continuing his story through the first 2 1/2 ears of his presidency and the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden by the Navy SEALS.Publishers Weekly praised the book as “shot through with memorable turns of phrase,” while other reviews were more qualified, calling the book all too reflective of Obama’s thoughtful, even-handed style. The New York Times’ Jennifer Szalai wrote that the “most audacious thing” about “A Promised Land” is “the beaming portrait” of Obama on the cover. The Washington Post’s Carlos Lozada noted that in “domestic policy and foreign affairs, in debates over culture and race, Obama splits differences, clings to the middle ground and trusts in process as much as principle.”Also Read| ‘Spent childhood years listening to Ramayana and Mahabharata’: Barack Obama“It turns out he is not a ‘revolutionary soul’ but a reformist one, ‘conservative in temperament if not in vision.’ Behind those dreams, the audacity and all that promise is a stubborn streak of moderation,” Lozada wrote.Obama’s book is the highlight of publishing’s holiday season and for some independent bookstores, the potential difference between remaining in business or closing. Publishing sales have been surprisingly stable during the pandemic, but much of the benefit has gone to Amazon.com as readers turned increasingly to online purchases. The American Booksellers Association, the independent sellers’ trade group, has warned that hundreds of stores could go out of business if holiday sales fall short.Kris Kleindienst, co-owner of Left Bank Books in St. Louis, anticipates selling around 1,000 copies by the end of the year, a number which makes “a HUGE difference” for annual revenues, she wrote in an email. Sarah McNally, owner of McNally Jackson Books in Manhattan, said she sold around 600 copies in the first 24 hours, a pace exceeded only by the final Harry Potter book.“It’s not hard to be a bright spot this year, a year when we would have gone out of business without federal aid,” McNally said. “But Obama does feel like a savior, as do our customers for buying this from us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-memoir-off-to-record-setting-start-in-sales/story-7lGLZeHVnRXzTpGIqRsIYL.html
19-11-2020||World||CEOs of Twitter, Facebook defend content moderation practices||Republican senators on Tuesday attacked the chief executives of Facebook and Twitter for what they called censorship of President Trump and his allies during the US election while Democrats bemoaned the spread of misinformation on social media. Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook defended their content moderation practices at a congressional hearing scheduled after the platforms decided to block stories from The New York Post that made claims about the son of then Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.Republican lawmakers have consistently accused the companies of anti-conservative bias.In his opening remarks, judiciary committee chairman Lindsey Graham asked, “What I want to try to find out is if you’re not a newspaper at Twitter or Facebook, then why do you have editorial control over The New York Post?” He said he did not think articles on Hunter Biden, refuted by the Biden campaign, needed to be flagged or excluded from distribution.Democrats focused on the spread of misinformation by Trump, a Republican, and his supporters. They pushed the companies to limit the spread of false and misleading content ahead of Georgia elections, where two Republican incumbent senators are facing run-offs against well-funded Democratic opponents - contests that will likely determine which party controls the US Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ceos-of-twitter-facebook-defend-content-moderation-practices/story-dUVmjcYHObNl8B8I3hATMI.html
19-11-2020||World||New York City schools to close again to stop renewed spread of Covid-19||New York City is shuttering schools to try to stop the renewed spread of the coronavirus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday in a painful about-face for one of the first big US school systems to bring students back to classrooms this fall.The nation’s largest public school system will halt in-person learning Thursday, sending more than 1 million children into all-online classes, the mayor said.The Democrat said at an afternoon news conference that plans were being made to bring in-person learning back as quickly as possible if the infection rate drops, though he cautioned that the bar to return would be higher than it was to close down. He added that schools would definitely remain closed through Thanksgiving.“We’re going to fight this back,” de Blasio said. “This is a setback, but it’s a setback we will overcome.”It can’t be overcome soon enough for Darneice Foster. She has four children, ranging in age from 4 to 13, now set to be learning from home.“I don’t know what I’m going to do, except pull my hair out,” she said.The city’s springtime stretch of all-online learning was “really awful” for the family, which shares a one-bedroom apartment in Upper Manhattan, said Foster, a former pharmaceutical advertising worker who left her job some years ago when one of her children had health problems.“Now, I really want my kids to catch up, and I’m one person,” she said. She said she would “look on the sunny side and just bear it for a few weeks,” hoping schools would reopen soon.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe city had said since summer that school buildings would close if 3% of all the coronavirus tests performed citywide over a seven-day period came back positive. As the rate neared that point last week, de Blasio advised parents to prepare for a possible shutdown.The mayor said the rate equaled that mark as of Tuesday.The city’s public school students will now be taught entirely online, as most already are. As of the end of October, only about 25% of students had gone to class in school this fall, far fewer than officials had expected.In-person school resumed Sept. 21 for pre-kindergarteners and some special education students. Elementary schools opened Sept. 29 and high schools Oct. 1.At the time, the seven-day positive test average rate was under 2%.Even as the school system stayed open, nearly 1,500 classrooms went through temporary closures after students or staffers tested positive, and officials began instituting local shutdowns in neighborhoods where coronavirus cases were rising rapidly.As of midweek, more than 2,300 students or staff at public schools had tested positive since the start of the school year.New York City’s school system, like others across the nation, initially halted in-person learning in mid-March as the virus spiked.While many big US school districts later decided to start the fall term with online learning, de Blasio pushed for opening schoolhouse doors. The Democrat argued that students needed services they got in school and that many parents were counting on it in order to get back to work.To keep students spread out, the city offered in-person learning only part-time, with youngsters logging on from home the rest of the time.The reopening date, originally set for Sept. 10, was postponed twice as teachers, principals and some parents said safety precautions and staffing were inadequate, with the teachers’ union at one point threatening to strike.The city agreed to changes, including hiring thousands more teachers and testing 10% to 20% of all students and staffers per month for the virus.When high schools finally opened their doors, de Blasio hailed it as “an absolutely amazing moment” in the city’s recovery.“This is an example of what makes New York City great,” he said at the time. “We did something that other cities around this country could only dream of because we have fought back this pandemic so well for so long.”Also Read: Covid-19 lockdowns test the economic endurance of desperate AmericansThe city’s announcement came just as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has frequently overruled the mayor on major decisions related to the pandemic, was finishing a news conference in which he said the city had the authority to shut things down if it wished to do so.Cuomo predicted a “tremendous spike” in Covid-19 cases after Thanksgiving as he pleaded with people not to be lulled into a false sense of safety over the holiday.“Your family sounds safe, doesn’t it? Your home sounds safe. Your dining room table at Thanksgiving sounds safe,” Cuomo said at a state Capitol briefing. “No, you won’t be safe. It’s an illusion.”Parts of western New York that have been under the least onerous “yellow zone” restrictions are now under more restrictive “orange zone” restrictions, in which schools go remote and “high-risk” businesses such as gyms are closed, Cuomo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-schools-to-close-again-to-stop-renewed-spread-of-covid-19/story-L1iPDl2MBtp2Qe5HUXoK4H.html

The approval comes at a time when the country is fighting a fierce resurgence of infections.“This new testing option is an important diagnostic advancement to address the pandemic and reduce the public burden of disease transmission,” said FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn in the statement.It could also help take some strain off testing labs that are being overwhelmed by demand. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Tuesday that if communities could have carried out widespread testing, it could have helped slow transmission before it took off explosively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-okays-self-testing-kit-for-detecting-covid-19/story-ZkqOs2pALmaQuWazWdR4PO.html

Riot police detained some protesters while firing volleys of water. Demonstrators were fuming about legislation due to be passed by parliament that could allow the government to impose curbs on social contact, rules on mask-wearing, and drinking alcohol in public.Meanwhile, the UK government has released a film based on research that shows ventilation and letting in fresh air into indoor spaces can reduce risk of infection by over 70%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-vaccine-appears-safe-causes-immune-response/story-bj7j47X0oiIuj7ORmJKv4L.html

By January 15, five days before the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the US, the number of American forces in Afghanistan will come down from the current level of 4,500 to 2,500. The number of soldiers in Iraq will also be reduced, from the existing 3,000 to 2,500.The Trump administration’s decision comes as part of the Republican president’s much debated pledge to bring America’s “endless wars” to an end.Citing US casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq - 6,900 killed and 52,000 wounded - acting secretary of defence Christopher Miller told reporters, “I am formally announcing that we will implement President Trump’s orders to continue our repositioning of forces from those two countries.” Miller was not accompanied at the announcement by Mark Milley, the chairman of joint chiefs of staff, who had earlier dismissed reports about troop reductions as speculation. Robert O’Brien, the National Security Adviser, told reporters that Trump hoped “that they will all come home safely - and in their entirety” by May.That was an unusual projection to make as president-elect Biden would be in charge then and it would be his administration’s decision. There was no word from Biden or his team yet on the troop withdrawals.Criticism of the move came swiftly, and from both the parties. Even close Republican allies were outraged. “I think it’s extremely important here in the next couple of months not to have any earthshaking changes with regard to defence and foreign policy,” Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the US Senate, told reporters. “I think a precipitous drawdown in either Afghanistan or Iraq would be a mistake.”Tammy Duckworth, a Democratic senator who has served in Afghanistan and lost both her legs to combat wounds in Iraq, warned of adverse impact of the move on peace efforts. “We all want our troops to be brought home safely, but this announcement is a mistake. At a time when we are finally seeing serious peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, Donald Trump is unilaterally taking one of our best bargaining chips off the table - and getting nothing in return.”Meanwhile, rockets struck Baghdad on Tuesday with four landing inside the Green Zone, killing a child and wounding five people, signalling an end to an informal truce announced by Iran-backed militias in October. One of the rockets struck close to Iraq’s National Security Service, 600m from the US embassy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-decision-to-reduce-troops-in-afghanistan-iraq-draws-ire/story-HLgfX36kIaSFSEjJMMsHYO.html

Canada did though join Britain and the United States in July to accuse Russian-backed hackers of trying to steal Covid-19 vaccine data.China and Russia have repeatedly denied trying to break into critical infrastructure of other nations.CSE said it was very unlikely hackers would intentionally try to disrupt important systems and cause major damage or kill people in the absence of war.But they “may target critical Canadian organizations to ... pre-position for future activities, or as a form of intimidation,” it added.“State-sponsored actors are very likely attempting to develop the additional cyber capabilities required to disrupt the supply of electricity.”In 2019, Russian-associated actors probed the networks of US and Canadian electricity utilities, it added.CSE said the threat of hacking was all the more serious given how many Canadians were relying on digital services amid the coronavirus pandemic.CSE is one of the Canadian agencies probing whether China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd can supply equipment for next-generation 5G networks.The United States and other close Canadian allies have moved to block Huawei on the grounds its 5G gear could contain backdoors allowing access for spies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-names-major-cyber-crime-threats-sees-risk-to-power-supply/story-VKGaEYxqQwIYIUMs2Ta5PK.html

19-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson’s green plan shows just how far UK is from net-zero||Boris Johnson on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping package of measures designed to zero out Britain’s greenhouse gas pollution by mid-century. The announcement shows just how long that road will be.The prime minister’s 10-point plan covers everything from diesel cars to hydrogen and offshore wind power. It’s one of the biggest package of climate measures set out by a British prime minister—and even won measured praise from Greenpeace as the UK seeks to position itself as a global leader on climate change before it co-hosts global talks next year.But experts said the government will have to more than double the 12 billion pounds ($16 billion) it proposed, and come up with a more detailed road map, if it wants to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050. Analysis by the independent UK Climate Change Committee, which monitors the nation’s progress toward its long-term climate goals, showed Britain isn’t even on track to reach its previous goal of cutting emissions by 80% in the next 30 years.“On the basis of details released so far, these measures will not be enough to reach net-zero emissions by 2050,” said Victoria Cuming, an analyst for Bloomberg NEF. In the coming weeks, the CCC will set out its advice on the volume of greenhouse gases the UK can emit from 2033 to 2037 if it wants to get on the pathway to net zero. The government’s response to that advice will be key, said John Gummer, the committee’s chairman. “This is a very big step indeed. But it’s not yet enough,” he said of today’s announcement.The UK’s plans will also be helped by growing global momentum to tackle climate change. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to set a target for the US to be net zero by 2050 which, combined with recent pledges from China and Japan, will mean eight of the 10 biggest economies have carbon-neutral commitments.Contentious policiesMany of the UK’s new targets are in line with what businesses and the CCC have been asking for to decarbonize transport and industry—two of the toughest areas to clean up. That includes a plan for 5 gigawatts of hydrogen capacity by 2030 and a commitment to developing small modular nuclear reactors.Others have been more contentious, including a decision to ban the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars from 2030. The government reached a compromise with the auto industry by delaying the ban on hybrids until 2035. It doesn’t detail how it would ramp up electric car usage over the next decade. Just 8.5% of cars sold in the three months to September in the UK were electric.“While the government has taken a big step for our climate by ruling out new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2030, behind the headline is a gaping hole in the funding needed to put us on track to net zero,’ Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, said in a statement. Johnson’s office also clashed with the Treasury over the plans, according to the Observer newspaper. The proposal was delayed at least twice, and negotiations on its contents were still ongoing just days before it was unveiled. The government also delayed an energy policy paper, hasn’t made a decision on the future of carbon pricing after Brexit, and doesn’t have a robust plan for de-carbonizing heat in people’s homes.“Achieving the government’s net-zero target demands that we move to de-carbonizing all buildings by 2050,” said Darren Jones, chair of parliament’s business and energy committee. “Heat pumps are only part of the solution.”New SpendingSome climate watchers also criticized the lack of new money behind the plans.A UK government spokeswoman said there would be at least 3 billion pounds of new funds, on top of about 9 billion pounds of existing commitments made this year.  The government expects businesses to contribute as much as three times what it’s spending, or 36 billion pounds, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi told Bloomberg Television.The UK’s green stimulus support so far has been dwarfed by those of its neighbors. France’s package was $40 billion together with $13 billion of support with green conditions, according to BloombergNEF, while Germany’s was $33 billion. For example, Johnson’s pledge to spend as much as 500 million pounds on hydrogen is just a fraction of the 9 billion euros ($11 billion) envisaged by Germany’s Recovery Fund to build 15 gigawatts of clean hydrogen capacity.“This is not an oven-ready meal. The government plan recycles previous funding and spreads a thin veneer of ice cream across reheated mashed potato of already pledged money,” said Stuart Haszeldine, a professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh.He said the government’s pledge to capture and store 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030 “is a very welcome new milestone,” but the UK needs to treble that quantity of carbon stored in order to meet the 2050 goal.Green JobsJohnson’s self-styled plan for a green industrial revolution comes at a time when the UK economy has been wounded by the pandemic, and faces added uncertainty over the UK’s future outside the European Union from Jan. 1.On Wednesday, Johnson said the proposal would create 250,000 new jobs, many of them in parts of the former industrial heartlands in the north of England that voted for his Conservative Party for the first time in the December 2019 election.But his initiatives are too fragmented, said Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, which lobbies government for stronger action on climate change on behalf of businesses including Siemens AG, Sky Ltd. and Tesco Plc.“The Prime Minister must embed the net-zero target across all government departments and address the lack of long-term policy commitments that is still holding back progress in some parts of the economy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-green-plan-shows-just-how-far-uk-is-from-net-zero/story-Lj3reVWB2tWG5BIfZ9FUhI.html
19-11-2020||World||Apple lowers app store fees for small developers, critics say move has little impact||Apple Inc said on Wednesday it plans to start a program to lower its App Store commissions for software developers who make $1 million or less in proceeds each year from the store, but some of the company’s critics called the move “window dressing.”Apple takes a 30% cut of most purchases made on the App Store, although the commission drops to 15% for subscriptions that remain active for more than a year.The iPhone maker said developers will automatically get the lower 15% rate if they generate $1 million or less in proceeds - defined as the portion of store purchases that the developer keeps - in a calendar year.Apple’s App Store fees and rules have come under fire from large firms such as Microsoft Corp, Spotify Technology SA, Match Group Inc and Epic Games as well as startups and smaller companies that allege the fees deprive consumers of choices and push up the price of apps.“This would be something to celebrate were it not a calculated move by Apple to divide app creators and preserve their monopoly on stores and payments, again breaking the promise of treating all developers equally,” Epic Games Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said.In reply to its critics, the iPhone maker has previously said its rules apply evenly to developers and that the App Store provides an easy way to reach its huge base of users without having to set up payment systems in the 175 countries where it operates.The move will affect a broad swath of developers, but it was unclear how big the financial impact would be for Apple.Based on the publishers it tracks, analytics firm Sensor Tower said 97.5% of iOS developers generated less than $1 million per year in gross consumer spending. But those same developers contributed only 4.9% of the App Store’s 2019 revenue.However, Gene Munster of Loupe Ventures, a longtime Apple analyst, estimated the small developers covered under the program make up 20% of Apple’s App store revenue. He lowered his estimate for Apple’s store revenue in its next fiscal year to $14.2 billion, a $1.6 billion reduction from his estimate before the policy change and about 0.5% of Apple’s overall revenue.The App Association, a group sponsored by Apple, said in a statement that the “reduced commission for small businesses will allow them to put additional resources towards scaling up and innovating new products and services.”In a statement, Match Group said Apple’s rules still forced developers to use its payment system even when Apple competes against those developers. “And if you manage to grow your revenue over $1 million, they then double their cut – arbitrarily – making it even harder for the startup to continue to grow,” the company said.Spotify, which is pursuing an antitrust complaint against Apple in Europe, said in a statement that it hopes “regulators will ignore Apple’s ‘window dressing’ and act with urgency to protect consumer choice, ensure fair competition, and create a level playing field for all,”Apple said the new program will start on Jan. 1 and it will give more details on which developers qualify next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-lowers-app-store-fees-for-small-developers-critics-say-move-has-little-impact/story-NwTKyCbU0A55yJPM83i9sO.html

He learnt that Zhang Zhan had started a hunger strike on September 2 and detention centre authorities had begun to forcibly feed her. He reported that her health was very poor. Zhang Zhan received another visit from her lawyer Wen Yu on September 28. The lawyer reported afterwards that Zhang seemed very thin and weak,” CHRD said.“Zhang Zhan is being prosecuted purely for reporting on the pandemic in Wuhan. She faces 4-5 years in prison for sharing information from the ground. As we can see by the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese government’s suppression of information affects everyone,” CHRD told HT in a statement.“It should be of global concern that Zhang Zhan faces prison for her reporting on Covid-19,” the statement added.Zhang is not the only Chinese citizen journalist detained for covering the outbreak in Wuhan.Chen Mei and Cai Wei are two other citizen journalists who are in detention for doing Covid-19-related news stories from Wuhan.Citizen journalist Li Zehua who went missing from the first outbreak epicentre Wuhan in February reappeared weeks later, saying that he had been quarantined by security forces in the city for two weeks, and then for more days in his hometown.Two more citizen journalists Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin are still missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/detained-citizen-journalist-in-china-faces-jail-for-reporting-on-covid-19-pandemic-in-wuhan/story-tkXEotMc81z2PBn41PORXN.html

The Indian company is 114 AI Innovation LLP, whose pitch titled “Spacewise” was selected for funding.Its brief was, “Exploitation tool-set to visualise, access and analyse multiple input streams of data for advanced space command and control using cognitive AI. This tool-set enables space operations with allies and commercial partners by allowing visualisation and analysis of multiple different sources of data in real time.”Besides the Indian company, the other nine winners included five from the US, three from UK and one from Australia.The defence ministry said it is the first time two nations anywhere in the world have come together to award defence contracts based around a pitch-style event, and also the first time two nations have awarded joint defence innovation contracts to overseas-based enterprises.Air Vice-Marshal Harvey Smyth, UK director (Space), said, “Congratulations to the winners and all those that took part in the first International Space Pitch Day - it has captured the imagination of innovators and militaries not just across the UK and US, but all over the world.“It has achieved several world firsts and we look forward to building on its success as we seek to fast-track innovation and cutting-edge technology to the front-line quicker than ever before with fresh ways of working with industry to make sure we stay ahead of our shared adversaries and the threats they pose.”The competition was open to innovators and entrepreneurs from all over the world delivered through the UK jointly funded by the UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Royal Air Force and the US Air Force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-ai-company-wins-in-uk-us-military-space-pitch/story-XJxNWqDFPY6y3bzFTPX9lL.html
19-11-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic: Ventilate, open windows to cut risk, advises UK government||The Boris Johnson government on Wednesday released a new film based on research that shows ventilation and letting in fresh air into indoor spaces can reduce risk of infection from the coronavirus by over 70%.England is currently midway into a month-long lockdown until December 2, with concerns that new infections may not allow for relaxation in restrictions before Christmas. As of Tuesday evening, 20,051 new cases and 598 deaths were recorded across the UK.The film produced with scientists at Leeds University illustrates how coronavirus lingers in the air in spaces with no fresh air, increasing the risk of people breathing in infected particles, and how the risk can be reduced significantly by regularly ventilating enclosed areas.Officials said research has shown that being in a room with fresh air can reduce risk of infection from particles by over 70%, as fresh air dilutes the particles. Experts recommend opening windows for short, sharp bursts of 10 to 15 minutes regularly throughout the day and to leave windows slightly open continuously to remove infected particles lingering in the room.They also advised that any household systems that use outdoor air, including kitchen or bathroom extractor fans, are used correctly and regularly as an additional method to remove infected particles.Catherine Noakes from Leeds University, who advised on the film, said, “When a room does not have any fresh air, and where people are generating large amounts of aerosol through activities such as singing and loud speech, that is when transmission of coronavirus is most likely.“Fresh air must come from outdoors – recirculating air just means the aerosols containing the virus move around the same room rather than being extracted outdoors. Ventilation units or any household systems that use outdoor air can be just as effective as opening windows or doors as long as they are limiting the recirculation of the same air.”The coronavirus is spread through the air by droplets and smaller particles - known as aerosols - that are exhaled from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they breathe, speak or cough. They behave in a similar way to smoke, but are invisible.The majority of virus transmissions happen indoors. Being indoors, with no fresh air, the particles can remain suspended in the air for hours and build up over time. The longer people spend time in the same room in the presence of these particles, the more likely they could become infected, the officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-ventilate-open-windows-to-cut-risk-advises-uk-government/story-f749yEGzTyxV7xytHgbfHK.html
