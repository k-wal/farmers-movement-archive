23-11-2020||World||For the first time, can see route out of Covid-19 pandemic: UK PM Boris Johnson||Hailing the University of Oxford’s success on the Covid-19 vaccine as a “wonderful British scientific achievement”, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said that for the first time since the “wretched” coronavirus took hold, people can see a route out of the pandemic.Outlining post-lockdown measures to come into effect from December 3, Johnson, who is in self-isolation in Downing Street, told the House of Commons virtually that developments in vaccines, treatment and testing mean that the “scientific cavalry is now in sight”.He said, “By the spring, these advances should reduce the need for the restrictions we have endured in 2020 and make the whole concept of a Covid lockdown redundant. When that moment comes, it will have been made possible by the sacrifices of millions of people across the UK.“I am acutely conscious that no other peacetime prime minister has asked so much of the British people and just as our country has risen to every previous trial, so it has responded this time… But the hard truth, Mr Speaker, is that we are not there yet. First, we must get through winter without the virus spreading out of control and squandering our hard-won gains.”England’s month-long lockdown will end on December 2, with the other three UK constituents - Wales, Scotland the Northern Ireland - enforcing versions of local lockdowns and curbs. New infections continued to remain at nearly three or four times (15,450) the peak of April-May, but the number of daily deaths is down (206), as of Monday evening, compared to the nearly 1,000 daily deaths earlier this year.Johnson said that from December 3, parts of England will return to the earlier tiered alert system, but each tier will have tougher restrictions. Collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports will be allowed to resume, and shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector will reopen when the lockdown ends.On the issue of allowing families to meet during Christmas, Johnson said, “This will be still a hard winter, Christmas cannot be normal, and there is a long road to spring… Mr Speaker, I can’t say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity, time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none.”“We all want some kind of Christmas, we need it, we certainly feel we deserve it. But what we don’t want is to throw caution to the winds and allow the virus to flare up again, forcing us all back into lockdown in January,” he said.Guidance on allowances and restrictions to be followed during Christmas will be announced later, he said, so that families could come together while at the same time minimising the risk of new Covid-19 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-the-first-time-can-see-route-out-of-covid-19-pandemic-uk-pm-boris-johnson/story-j3qeHhY92TkJR1xx74HVqL.html

The UK government published its plan aimed at suppressing the spread of infection while enabling life to return “closer to normal”.The Johnson government said that the winter plan will minimise damage to the economy and society, jobs and livelihoods. In its winter plan summary, the government stated that lifting national restrictions has become possible because the ongoing restrictions have slowed the spread of the virus and eased the pressure on the National Health Service (NHS).Also Read | Boris Johnson confirms Dec 2 end to lockdown, Covid Winter Plan until March 2021On December 2, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector will reopen regardless of tier. The winter plan also provides for the resumption of collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports. According to the plan, the stay at home requirement will end and travel will be allowed, subject to the guidance in each tier.However, the government cautioned that the novel coronavirus is still present and that’s why a regional, tiered approach will be introduced. While Tier 1 indicates ‘medium alert, Tier 2 and Tier 2 indicate ‘high’ and ‘very high alert’ respectively. Meeting friends and familyOther than single households or support bubbles, a maximum of six people will be allowed to meet indoors or outdoors in Tier 1 region. Tier 2 will mandate no mixing of households indoors, apart from support bubbles, and a maximum of six people will be allowed to meet outdoors. For Tier 3, no mixing of households indoors, or most outdoor places, will be allowed apart from support bubbles.Bars, pubs, and restaurantsFor Tier 1, the government has directed that the venues must be table service only and they must stop taking orders at 10pm and must close by 11pm. In Tier 2 zones, pubs and bars must be closed, unless they are operating as restaurants. Under the plan, hospitality venues will be allowed to only serve alcohol with substantial meals. Hospitality will remain closed in Tier 3, with the exception of sales by takeaway, drive-through or delivery.Wedding and funeralsAs many as 15 guests will be allowed for weddings, civil partnerships and wedding receptions, while 30 people will be permitted for funerals in Tier 1 and Tier 2. The guidance remains the same for Tier 3, but wedding receptions won’t be allowed.Large Events - Elite Sport, Live Performances & BusinessIn Tier 1, large events will be open to the public but limited to 50 per cent capacity or 4,000 people outdoors and 1,000 indoors, whichever is lower. It will remain the same for Tier 2 but the limit on outdoors will go down to 2000. It won’t be allowed for Tier 3 except Drive-in events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-winter-plan-all-you-need-to-know-about-uk-s-3-tier-system-starting-december-2/story-Np4EVx6TQRSbuywIuA8FcO.html
23-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson confirms Dec 2 end to lockdown, Covid Winter Plan until March 2021||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday confirmed that the complete stay-at-home lockdown in England will end on December 2, from when a tough new Covid Winter Plan will kick in to last until at least March 2021.Addressing the House of Commons via videolink from Downing Street in London, where he continues to self-isolate after contact with an MP who later tested positive for Covid-19, Johnson began by praising “the scientific cavalry” which has offered vaccine hopes to eventually make lockdown “redundant”. But he stressed that it is important not to “squander all our gains” from the past few weeks of lockdown with a “free for all”.“From next Wednesday people will be able to leave their homes for any purpose and meet other people in public places, subject to the rule of six,” said Johnson.“I am sorry to say we expect that more regions will fall at least temporarily into higher levels than before,” he said, in reference to a tougher tiered system.From the middle of next week, shops, personal care, gyms and churches can reopen as part of a bolstered three-tiered system. As part of the restrictions, people will be expected to continue to work from home if they live in a Tier 1 region; in Tier 2, alcohol can only be served with a meal; and in Tier 3, all forms of hospitality except takeaways will have to close. The 10pm curfew for bars and restaurants will now change to last orders at 10pm, with closing time at 11pm. Sports will be allowed to resume with spectators in the first two less strict tiers, with capacity limits and social distancing, including a similar approach for theatres and concert halls.Read more | UK foreign policy needs a tilt towards Indo-Pacific: ReportThe parliamentary speech comes as Oxford University announced promising Phase 3 results from its vaccine candidate being developed with AstraZeneca, in reference to which Johnson said: “For the first time since this wretched virus took hold we can see a route out of the pandemic.” As for which specific tiers the different regions would fall under, Johnson said he hopes to be able to confirm by this Thursday, depending on how cases of Covid-19 are falling or rising. These tier allocations will then be reviewed every 14 days, with the wider region-wise approach will last until March next year.While lockdown measures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be decided by the devolved administrations, Johnson said that he would set out plans for “a time limited Christmas dispensation embracing the whole of the UK” in the coming days. He, however, earned that the deadly virus would not “grant a Christmas truce”. “Christmas cannot be normal and there is a long road to spring but we have turned a corner and the escape route is in sight,” he said.He added that the mass testing pilot scheme from the city Liverpool will now be rolled out more widely and those who test negative will be offered the prospect of fewer restrictions.The Opposition Labour Party Leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said they would await the full details of the plans.The UK’s death toll from Covid-19 stands at 55,024, after 398 new victims across all settings over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-confirms-dec-2-end-to-lockdown-covid-winter-plan-until-march-2021/story-vbalriY92fOakkoFziw4eO.html

Shops, gyms, personal care businesses and leisure facilities will be allowed to reopen, and collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports can resume. Fans will also be allowed back into sports stadiums for the first time since March.Johnson said “the scientific cavalry is now in sight,” and breakthroughs in mass testing and vaccines should eliminate the need for lockdowns by the spring. But first, he said, “we must get through winter without the virus spreading out of control and squandering our hard-won gains.”He said England’s lockdown will be replaced with regional measures involving three tiers of restrictions based on the scale of the outbreak in different areas. The measures have been toughened slightly from a similar system that was in place last month because government scientific advisers say those measures weren’t enough to stop the virus spreading.In the top tier, pubs and restaurants will have to close except for takeout and delivery. In other areas they will have to close by 11 p.m.In the lower two tiers, indoor and outdoor spectator sports can resume with capacity limits.The rules apply to England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have their own restrictions.People will have to wait until up-do-date data is released later in the week to learn what tier their local area will be in, but the government says most of the country is likely to be in the two highest levels.In those areas, households will be barred from mixing indoors, but the government is planning to ease the rules over the Christmas period.Johnson said people will be allowed “to see more of their family and friends over Christmas,” though he did not announce details.In common with other European countries, authorities in Britain introduced restrictions on daily life to combat an autumn surge in cases. The UK has had Europe’s deadliest Covid-19 outbreak, with more than 55,000 deaths among people who tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shops-gyms-to-reopen-in-england-under-new-covid-19-plan/story-5anfsC3Nr0wOnBTOn8xlrL.html

23-11-2020||World||EU, UK still have ‘fundamental’ differences on trade talks||With the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in quarantine, trade talks with the United Kingdom continued by videoconference this week, though the optimism expressed last week seemed to have faded.Barnier stressed on Monday that negotiators were running out of time to make a January 1 deadline and that “fundamental divergences still remain.” The talks were shifted to a videoconference last week when an EU official tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing Barnier into a quarantine until at least Thursday. Both sides have indicated that to reach an agreement on key issues the negotiators need to meet in person.On Friday, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen issued one of the most upbeat assessments of the state of post-Brexit trade negotiations in several weeks, saying the EU had seen “in the last days better progress, more movement on important files.” But on Monday, EU Commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie said that “while some progress has been made in drafting legal texts, significant fundamental divergences remain in the three key areas” that negotiations have centered on - the fishing industry, how to check compliance with the deal and the standards the UK must meet to export into the EU.The UK left the EU on January 31 but remains in its trade relations with the EU until the end of this year. Both sides hope to get a trade deal in time to protect hundreds of thousands of jobs that could be affected if the trade agreements lapse with no deal on future ties.Any deal brokered by Barnier and his British counterpart, David Frost, would need to be approved by the individual EU countries and the European Parliament. The legislature is even considering meeting around Christmas - when it is usually enjoying a long recess - to make any deadline.The bloc accuses Britain of wanting to retain access to the EU’s lucrative markets, much like any EU country, without agreeing to follow all its rules. The EU fears Britain will slash social and environmental standards, and pump state money into UK industries, becoming a low-regulation economic rival on the bloc’s doorstep.Britain says the EU is making unreasonable demands and is failing to treat it as an independent, sovereign state, especially when it comes to the control of its fishing waters.If the talks resume in person from Thursday, they would be held in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-uk-still-have-fundamental-differences-on-trade-talks/story-jwaY8mSq7jV0tTwlqah0AJ.html
23-11-2020||World||Covid-19: All you need to know about global QR code proposed by China||Chinese President Xi Jinping is pushing for a Covid-19 tracking system by using QR codes, as a part of “global mechanism” to ease international travel during the coronavirus disease pandemic. During a virtual G20 summit on Saturday, Xi stressed the need to restore the secure and smooth operation of global industrial and supply chains.He proposed a mechanism on the mutual recognition of health certificates in the form of “internationally accepted QR codes”. “We need to further harmonise policies and standards and establish fast tracks to facilitate the orderly flow of personnel,” Xi said at the summit.The Chinese president said that the health certificates will be based on “nucleic acid test results” and expressed hope that more countries will join the mechanism, without further elaborating on the proposal.Also Read | China says it has eliminated poverty from last nine poorest countiesWhat is Covid-19 QR code?Earlier this year, China reportedly mandated the widespread use of QR-based health certificates which stores the travel and health history of an individual. The system has been credited with helping contain the virus in the country, the first epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.The Chinese government issues colour codes based on the big data on health information submitted by the users. While the green colour code allows users to travel freely, an orange or red code suggests that they need to quarantine for up to two weeks.Several countries have used contact tracing apps to monitor and curb the spread of Covid-19. In April, a study by Oxford University found that even if approximately 60 per cent of the population used a contract tracing app, it would have significantly reduced the number of coronavirus cases and related deaths.However, there have been concerns regarding privacy, and executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, cautioned against Xi’s proposal for a global QR code system. “An initial focus on health could easily become a Trojan Horse for broader political monitoring and exclusion, akin to the dangers associated with China’s social-credit system,” tweeted Roth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-all-you-need-to-know-about-global-qr-code-proposed-by-china/story-1DHgYzLmRyr273NpT0TBJJ.html

23-11-2020||World||Snapchat challenges TikTok with curated video feed||Snapchat on Monday unveiled a new curated short-form video feed in a stepped up challenge to social media rivals like TikTok.The new format called Spotlight will allow Snapchatters to see content from influencers and other members of the network popular with young smartphone users.Spotlight is aimed at broadening the connections among Snapchat users by enabling anyone to create a video that gets distributed on the platform.It aims to encourage more users to create short-form video “snaps” which can be embellished with filters and augmented reality effects.“We designed Spotlight to entertain our community while living up to Snapchat values, with our community’s well being as a top priority,” said a statement from Snapchat parent firm Snap Inc. announcing the new service.Spotlight is being launched in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and France, and in other markets later.It marks the latest challenge to the wildly successful TikTok, which is facing pressure from the Trump administration, which wants to ban the app or forces its sale to American investors due to alleged national security concerns about its Chinese connections.Others using similar short-form videos include Facebook-owned Instagram’s Reels and startups like Triller.- New experience -Snap describes Spotlight as a “new consumption experience” for the social platform with an estimated 249 million active users at the end of September.The company said the new offering could enable anyone to have their videos viewed by millions of users, and potentially earn money from them. This opens up the process of becoming an “influencer” eligible for Snapchat’s funding of some $1 million per day.Snap said that all videos on Spotlight will be reviewed by human moderators before being shown on the platform -- in contrast with rivals which use automated systems and in many cases respond to inappropriate content or misinformation after the fact.Another difference will be the lack of public comments on Spotlight, eliminating the need for moderation of abusive or unwelcome content.Spotlight aims to become a “personalized” feed which will be curated by algorithm based on users’ viewing habits -- a move following the lead of TikTok which has seen sizzling growth in recent months.The launch comes amid increasing competition among social networks and rivals copying Snapchat’s disappearing messages.Facebook’s core social network has been losing ground among younger audiences to rivals like Snapchat and TikTok, even as Facebook-owned Instagram continues to grow in that demographic group.A Piper Jaffay survey of US teens last month showed Snapchat is their favorite social media platform, and that TikTok overtook Instagram for second place.Despite its popularity, Snap has yet to turn a profit some two years after its stock market debut. Snapchat gained notoriety for its disappearing “Stories” but has added a variety of media content with partnerships.It lost $200 million in the third quarter, but managed to double revenue from a year ago thanks to changes that have helped boost user engagement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/snapchat-challenges-tiktok-with-curated-video-feed/story-5HsCSk55grvRvuyDhQx85I.html

The Oxford team was identifying hundreds of significant new words and usages as the year unfolded, dozens of which would have been a slam dunk for Word of the Year at any other time”.“It’s both unprecedented and a little ironic - in a year that left us speechless, 2020 has been filled with new words unlike any other.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zoombombing-superspeader-wfh-covid-makes-oxford-dictionary-expand-word-of-year/story-xiwgvVwb6Kj8XFGJh07hIN.html

23-11-2020||World||UK foreign policy needs a tilt towards Indo-Pacific: Report||A key commission led by former prime minister of Canada Stephen Harper wants Britain to tilt towards the Indo-Pacific region as a democratic counterweight to China, complementing India’s vision articulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018 and reiterated by foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla earlier this month.The report from the panel, convened by influential think-tank Policy Exchange, was released on Sunday night.Highlighting the economic and security-based importance of the region, the report titled ‘A Very British Tilt: Towards a New UK Strategy in the Indo-Pacific Region’, said Indo-Pacific affairs will inevitably have a major impact on Britain’s strategy after Brexit. The region is also home to over 1.5 million British citizens, including thousands in India.“As it contemplates its global interests post-Brexit, the UK could and should play a significantly larger role in the Indo-Pacific Region. Specifically, it should aim to foster a community of free and independent nations committed to upholding peace, stability, prosperity, and access in the region,” it said.“By offering a vision of a common strategic future built around shared principles and focused on shared challenges, whether domestic or across borders, Britain can add to existing defence, trade, and political relationships and inspire new approaches. Such an expanded role for the UK represents a hard but realistic task, both from a delivery and from a resources point of view.”The panel’s report is expected to feed into the ongoing major review of the UK’s foreign policy, defence and international development initiated by Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this year. A fundamental tilt towards India and the Indo-Pacific region in post-Brexit UK has been envisaged in recent interactions by diplomats and British politicians.Shringla, who set out India’s vision of the Indo-Pacific in an interaction at Policy Exchange, said India had “mainstreamed” the idea of Indo-Pacific in recent years and encouraged others to perceive the region accordingly. Germany, France and the Netherlands have recently set out their approach to the region.“The UK, we hope and expect, will be next on the list, and too will finalise its Indo-Pacific strategy soon. Given this country’s characteristic wisdom and prodigious institutional memory, we hope too that the UK’s strategy will approximate India’s own and long-standing Indo-Pacific vision”, Shringla said, noting the think-tank’s “not-inconsiderable influence” in London.The report called for enacting an ‘Indo-Pacific Charter’ to anchor a new approach to regional stability and prosperity, and recommended that the Johnson government establish an Indo-Pacific Sub-Committee on the National Security Council chaired by the Prime Minister.Besides, it said Johnson should consider creating a Special Envoy for the Indo-Pacific as a political appointment based in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and promulgating a standalone ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy’ laying out its comprehensive approach to engaging with the region.The panel which prepared the report included 18 current and former political leaders, military planners and others from the UK, Canada, US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. It is endorsed by former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.Abe wrote in the report’s foreword: “A leading global power, Great Britain has a major role to play in the Indo-Pacific. As the world’s sixth largest economy, increased trade between the UK and Indo-Pacific nations will contribute to overall economic growth.” “Britain can also work with countries throughout the region on upholding democratic values and supporting the multinational institutions that have developed in recent years. On the security front, the British military, and the Royal Navy in particular, will be a welcome presence in the seas of the Indo-Pacific.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-foreign-policy-needs-a-tilt-towards-indo-pacific-report/story-nTjm41YyoEtGgk9thuv96J.html

23-11-2020||World||UK regulator begins assessing Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine data||The UK regulator of medicines said on Monday that it has begun assessing the data received from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate trial that showed nearly 95% efficacy, adding that public safety “will always come first”.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said since the UK continues to be a member of the EU until the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31, Covid-19 vaccine candidates can be licensed via the Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency and that authorisation will automatically be valid in the UK.However, if a suitable vaccine candidate, with strong supporting evidence of safety, quality and effectiveness from clinical trials becomes available before the end of the transition period, EU legislation allows for temporary authorisation of supply in the UK, based on public health need.Based on the speed of MHRA’s assessment and approval, the Pfizer vaccine may be rolled out from December.MHRA chief executive June Raine said: “We are pleased to have received further data for the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine candidate. It is our job now to rigorously assess these data and the evidence submitted on the vaccine’s safety, quality and effectiveness”.“As we have received this data through a rolling review, we have already started our analysis and will aim to make a decision in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review”.“We will seek advice from the government’s independent advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines. The Commission will critically assess the data too before advising the UK government on the safety, quality and effectiveness of any potential vaccine”, she added.The MHRA said it will evaluate the data rigorously for quality, safety and effectiveness to reach an independent, scientifically robust opinion. The data must include results from lab and clinical trials in humans; manufacturing and quality controls, product sampling, and testing of the final product. Any Covid-19 vaccine candidate submitted after the transition period ends will not need to go through a European marketing authorisation for use in the UK; it will be assessed directly by the MHRA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-regulator-begins-assessing-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-data/story-nRodmxBB8Rotfje98tJ3jO.html
23-11-2020||World||Oxford English Dictionary couldn’t pick just one ‘word of the year’ for 2020||The year 2020 has truly been “unprecedented” - for the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) which has used in the title of its report to name the “word of the year”. The OED said it has been impossible to name one winner in this “unprecedented” year.“Though what was genuinely unprecedented this year was the hyper-speed at which the English-speaking world amassed a new collective vocabulary relating to the coronavirus, and how quickly it became, in many instances, a core part of the language,” the OED said in its report titled “Words of an Unprecedented Year”.However, it has chosen words that reflect the mood and the preoccupations of 2020.From superspreader to lockdown, words commonly used owing to the pandemic found a place in the list. The report said that usage of the word pandemic increased by 57,000 per cent last year while use of the word “coronavirus” was most frequent in April.Other words which have seen a surge in use this year are terms related to technology as people are adapting to working from home. These include unmute, referring to people making themselves audible during online conferences, and Zoombombing, a variant on photobombing which was first recorded as a word in 2008, and refers to disturbing online calls on Zoom.Also words to describe the social movements witnessed around the globe this year found a place in the list. Black Lives Matter, take a knee, cancel culture and virtue signalling all appeared on the curated list.The list also included neologisms like Blursday, defined as when you have no idea what day of the week it is and covidiot, a person who disobeys guidelines designed to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and the informal term for the virus, rona. Casper Grathwohl, the president of Oxford Dictionaries, told The BBC, “It’s both unprecedented and a little ironic - in a year that left us speechless, 2020 has been filled with new words unlike any other.”In 2019, OED had named “climate emergency” as the word of the year and in 2018, the winner was “toxic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-english-dictionary-couldn-t-pick-just-one-word-of-the-year-for-2020/story-1Y1szWG3uWJ8YkaTeFHFPN.html
23-11-2020||World||‘Highly effective’ Oxford vaccine raises hopes of normal life from April||New data from the University of Oxford’s trial released on Monday showed that its vaccine candidate is ‘highly effective,” sparking a wave of excitement due to its lower cost and logistics and prompting home secretary Matt Hancock to see normal life from Easter 2021.The analysis of its data from the trial in the UK and Brazil said the AZD1222 vaccine is highly effective in preventing Covid-19, with no hospitalisations or severe cases reported in participants receiving the vaccine.It is to be produced on a no-profit basis on a mass scale with biopharma major AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India, among others. The UK regulator also announced on Monday that it has received data from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate for approval. The Oxford vaccine, expected to cost nearly £3, is cheaper than Pfizer’s (around £15) or Moderna’s (£25) vaccines.Speaking to the media after the Oxford results were released, Sarah Gilbert, leading vaccinologist, said: “The announcement today takes us another step closer to the time when we can use vaccines to bring an end to the devastation caused by (the virus).”Andrew Pollard, lead investigator of the Oxford vaccine, added: “We have a vaccine for the world. It prevents severe disease, hospitalisation and intriguingly in the results – although in the headline it is 70% protection – we do have a sub-group where we saw 90% protection.”“The vaccine can be stored at fridge temperature. It can be distributed around the world using the usual immunisation distribution systems. We had a goal to have a vaccine that is accessible everywhere. We have actually managed to do that. This is an incredibly exciting moment for human health,” he said.AstraZeneca said in its statement on the results: “One dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy of 90% when AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart, and another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart.”“The combined analysis from both dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted in an average efficacy of 70%. All results were statistically significant (p<=0.0001). More data will continue to accumulate and additional analysis will be conducted, refining the efficacy reading and establishing the duration of protection.”The company said it is immediately preparing to submit data to authorities around the world that have a framework in place for conditional or early approval, including Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization for speedier availability in low-income countries.The Boris Johnson government has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine and is putting in place the infrastructure for mass vaccination in over 40 centres across the UK from December, subject to the regulator clearing the vaccine.The UK “could get back to normal after Easter”, Hancock said, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and others hailed the announcement.Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford but not involved in the trial, said: “This is very welcome news, we can clearly see the end of tunnel now. There were no Covid hospitalisations or deaths in people who got the Oxford vaccine.”Stephen Griffin, from the University of Leeds, added: “This is yet more excellent news and should be considered tremendously exciting. It has great potential to be delivered across the globe, achieving huge public health benefits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highly-effective-oxford-vaccine-raises-hopes-of-normal-life-from-april/story-jFvlt2UO6avnp0vMvTQ1DI.html
23-11-2020||World||European powers see hope for Iran accord in US transition||The German, French and British foreign ministers were meeting Monday to discuss the future of the international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program amid hopes that the incoming US administration might help breathe new life into the accord, Germany’s Foreign Ministry said.The three European powers have spearheaded efforts to keep alive the agreement, concluded in Vienna in 2015 and officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. Russia and China also remain on board.President-elect Joe Biden has said he hopes to return the US to the accord, in which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the agreement in 2018 and imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran, which responded by publicly abandoning nuclear restrictions in the agreement.Monday’s meeting at a government guest house in Berlin, which wasn’t announced in advance, aimed to discuss “what a further approach involving all signatories to the JCPOA, and perhaps also with a new US administration, could look like,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Andrea Sasse told reporters.“We are confident that a constructive approach by the US toward the Vienna nuclear agreement could contribute significantly to breaking the current negative spiral we are seeing with Iran, and opening new prospects for the preservation of the JCPOA,” she added.Sasse renewed calls for Iran to stop its violations of the agreement and comply with all of its provisions in full. She said Monday’s meeting also would address Iran’s missile program and wider regional role — issues that are not addressed by the nuclear agreement, to the displeasure of its critics.Asked whether the Europeans fear Trump taking further steps against Iran before he leaves office that would undermine their hopes, Sasse replied: “if there are such measures, we will evaluate them if they happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-powers-see-hope-for-iran-accord-in-us-transition/story-HeUu6VJnbFS8kZFPuLE9VP.html

A charity, Save the Children, said in its report that Afghanistan accounts for the greatest number of killing and maiming violations among conflict zones, terming it one of the world’s most dangerous countries for children.As many as 874 children were killed and 2,275 children were maimed in 2019 in Afghanistan, representing 30 per cent of the total number of children killed and maimed across all the conflict situations covered in the report. For four consecutive years, the combined tally has been above 3,000, and in 2019, 72 per cent of the cases were a “result of ground engagements between pro- and anti-government forces or of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in both suicide and non-suicide attacks.”Also Read | Pompeo meets Taliban, Afghan negotiators in DohaIn 2019, Afghanistan reported attacks on 70 schools and 75 hospitals, and six schools and two hospitals were used for military purposes. The report stated that in 2021, there will be critical opportunities for states and parties to conflict to take concrete actions to better protect and support children in conflict.Save the Children called on the international communities to stop the war on children and work with the government of Afghanistan to ensure national laws related to the protection of children are fully resourced and rolled out nationwide. It urged donors to ensure that child protection work in conflict is funded in line with other life-saving interventions. It also suggested UN Security Council members use their power to hold perpetrators of grave violations accountable.“Imagine living with the constant fear that today might be the day that your child is killed in a suicide attack or an airstrike. This is the grim reality for tens of thousands of Afghan parents whose children have been killed or injured,” Chris Nyamandi, Save the Children’s country director in Afghanistan, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-26-000-children-in-afghanistan-killed-or-maimed-since-2005-report/story-FT5TYyDCBWf0wPUiQKiPdP.html
23-11-2020||World||Emissions in 2020 drop a ‘tiny blip’: UN body||Human emissions of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change will fall between 4.2% and 7.5% this year due to the global industrial slowdown caused by coronavirus lockdowns.But carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will continue to go up, albeit at a slightly reduced pace, according to preliminary data by the World Meteorological Organization released on Monday. The short-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic can’t be distinguished from natural variability, the United Nations agency said.“The lockdown-related fall in emissions is just a tiny blip on the long-term graph,” WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas said in a statement. “We need a sustained flattening of the curve.”Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries, and in the ocean for even longer. That means concentrations of the warming gas will continue to rise for years, even if human emissions fall or are brought to a halt. In 2019, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere breached a new threshold of 410 parts per million, from 400 parts per million in 2015, according to the WMO’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin released on Monday.“Such a rate of increase has never been seen in the history of our records,” Taalas said. “The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO₂ was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3°C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now —but there weren’t 7.7 billion inhabitants.”Concentrations of CO₂ in the atmosphere were 48% higher in 2019 than 1750, according to the report. The increase observed from 2018 to 2019 was larger than that observed during the previous one-year period, and larger than the average over the last decade.Methane presence in the atmosphere were up by 160% from pre-industrial times, while nitrous oxide was up 23%..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emissions-in-2020-drop-a-tiny-blip-un-body/story-TH7bNgjjPLt0eOEVQdFnyO.html
23-11-2020||World||China says it has eliminated poverty from last nine poorest counties||China’s remaining nine impoverished counties had eliminated extreme poverty, state media reported on Monday, marking a landmark in the country’s fight towards lifting the poorest above the poverty line.The counties, all in southwest China’s Guizhou province, had eradicated absolute poverty, the provincial government announced.“China has vowed to eradicate absolute poverty by 2020. At the end of 2019, 52 counties in the northwest, southwest and south of the country remained on the poverty list,” official Xinhua news agency said in a report.Fighting poverty has been one of China’s three “critical” battles since 2017, the other two being curbing pollution and mitigating financial risks.Last week, seven counties in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan province were the last group of counties to be removed from the national poverty list.Chinese government statistics say the country has lifted some 850 million out of poverty, contributing over 70% to global poverty reduction, in the last few decades.The country’s rural poor population was slashed from 98.99 million at the end of 2012 to 5.51 million at the end of 2019, with the poverty ratio in rural regions dropping from 10.2% to 0.6%, according to government statistics.In September, Chinese President Xi Jinping, speaking via video link at the general debate of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly, said that the country has every confidence it will meet the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that it will achieve that target 10 years in advance.What are the criteria for a county to be removed from the poverty list?Broadly: “One income, two no-worries and three guarantees” First is income. The national income standard is the constant price per capita annual income of 2,300 yuan for farmers in 2010. According to the price index, the current price was 3,218 yuan at the end of last year, and this year it is about 4,000 yuan, as per state media reports.The two “no worries” are about food and cloths. “Three guarantees” are compulsory education, access to basic medical care, and housing security.Provinces, however, could have differing sets of poverty lines.Chinese government’s own flattering statistics on poverty alleviation, however, have been questioned.The debate over the number of poor in China was reignited last May when Premier Li Keqiang said the monthly income of some 600 million Chinese was 1000 yuan (Rs 10,000).“It’s barely enough to cover monthly rent in a mid-sized Chinese city,” Li said at his annual press conference at the closing of China’s rubber-stamp legislature, the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing.Li’s statement assumed even more significance as it came in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has left the Chinese economy battered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-has-eliminated-poverty-from-last-nine-poorest-counties/story-Hw1eUppE2NhG4NdnxokwyN.html
23-11-2020||World||Pat Quinn, co-creator of viral ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, dies at 37||A co-founder of the social media ALS ice bucket challenge, which has raised more than $200 million worldwide for Lou Gehrig’s disease research, died Sunday at the age of 37, according to the ALS Association.Pat Quinn was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 2013, a month after his 30th birthday, the organization said in a statement announcing his death.“Pat fought ALS with positivity and bravery and inspired all around him,” the association said. “Those of us who knew him are devastated but grateful for all he did to advance the fight against ALS. ... Our thoughts are with the Quinn family and all of his friends and supporters. Pat was loved by many of us within the ALS community and around the world.”In 2014, Quinn saw the ice bucket challenge on the social media feed of professional golfer Chris Kennedy, who first dared his wife’s cousin Jeanette Senerchia to take a bucket of ice water, dump it over her head, post a video on social media and ask others to do the same or to make a donation to charity. Senerchia’s husband had ALS.Quinn and co-founder Pete Frates, along with their teams of supporters, helped popularize the challenge. The ALS Association said Quinn “knew it was the key to raising ALS awareness,” calling it “the greatest social media campaign in history.” Frates, a former Boston College baseball player, died in December 2019 at the age of 34.When the two picked it up, the phenomenon exploded, the organization said. Thousands of people participated in the viral trend, including celebrities, sports stars and politicians — even Donald Trump before his election and cartoon character Homer Simpson. Online videos were viewed millions of times.“It dramatically accelerated the fight against ALS, leading to new research discoveries, expanded care for people living with ALS, and significant investment from the government in ALS research,” the organization’s statement said.Lou Gehrig’s disease, named after the New York Yankees great who suffered from it — is also known as ALS or motor neuron disease. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to paralysis due to the death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. There is no known cure.The organization added that Quinn continued to raise awareness and funds after popularizing the challenge. In 2015, the association honored him, among others, as “ALS Heroes” — an award given to people living with the disease who have had a significant positive impact on the fight against it.On the 5th anniversary of the challenge, Quinn, who was from Yonkers, New York, addressed a crowd in Boston.“Nobody knew the Ice Bucket Challenge would become a worldwide phenomenon, but we united as one because that is what it takes to change a disease like ALS,” he said. “There are warriors all over the world unwilling to accept it as a death sentence. … We will never stop fighting together. I will not leave this Earth until I know the next person diagnosed with ALS has a real plan to live with this disease, not just die from it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pat-quinn-co-creator-of-viral-als-ice-bucket-challenge-dies-at-37/story-niGkFWOhbGXqUWmjF1DpmN.html
23-11-2020||World||China lashes out at US withdrawal from open skies treaty||China on Monday lashed out at Washington over its withdrawal from the “Open Skies Treaty” with Russia, saying the move undermined military trust and transparency and imperiled future attempts at arms control.The treaty, to which China is not a signatory, had allowed each country overflight rights to inspect military facilities.That leaves only one arms-control pact still in force between the former Cold War foes, the New START treaty, which limits the number of nuclear warheads each may have. That treaty will expire in February and the Trump administration had said it wasn’t interested in extending it unless China also joined, something Beijing says it will not do.“This move by the US undermines military mutual trust and transparency among relevant countries, is not conducive to maintaining security and stability in relevant regions and will also have a negative impact on the international arms control and disarmament process,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing Monday.Also Read |  ‘Certainly a weak president’: Chinese government advisor thinks Biden could start warCritics complain that Beijing has urged other major countries to reach arms control agreements while refusing to take part in any such arrangements, including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, that expired last year.Meanwhile, it has taken advantage of limitations set by Russia and the US on each other to keep itself safe and engage in unrestricted development of weapons such as intermediate-range ballistic missiles, bolstering its military’s capabilities in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, the Indian border, the South China Sea and other Asian hotspots, critics say.The INF Treaty “acted as a security guarantee for China: Beijing successfully made use of the mutual limitations imposed by the treaty on Russia and the United States to minimize the military threat to itself,” Russian consultant Andrey Baklitskiy wrote in a commentary for the Carnegie Moscow Center last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lashes-out-at-us-withdrawal-from-open-skies-treaty/story-zd1Afe5vLDWG5cCXKHulgP.html

23-11-2020||World||UK sees AstraZeneca, Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine rollout starting December||Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the U.K. plans to start rolling out two coronavirus vaccines next month before the program gathers pace in the new year, with a return to “normal” possible in the spring.Hancock was responding to trial results announced Monday by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc showing their Covid-19 vaccine prevented a majority of people from getting the disease. It followed positive results this month from a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. Both still need to be assessed by the U.K. health regulator before they can be administered to the public.“If this all goes well in the next couple of weeks, then we are looking at the potential of starting the vaccination program next month for this Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as well as the Pfizer vaccine -- but in all cases the bulk of the rollout will be in the New Year,” Hancock told BBC Radio. “We are looking with high confidence now that after Easter things can really start to get back to normal.”The vaccine data adds to the government’s growing optimism that the U.K. is beginning to reverse the tide of the virus after a new wave of infections forced England into a second lockdown this month. Virus cases “are clearly starting to fall,” Hancock said, and ministers are discussing how to relax rules to allow families to get together at Christmas. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce the new winter strategy in Parliament on Monday.Mass TestingJohnson is also set to announce a massive increase in community coronavirus testing as part of a plan to reintroduce tiered restrictions in place of the England-wide lockdown. Areas under the strictest curbs will have access to regular tests. People who come into contact with someone with the disease will be able to avoid quarantine by taking a test every day for seven days, Johnson’s office said.The program, which will be trialled in Liverpool, northwest England, is due to be announced by the prime minister alongside tougher restrictions for the worst-hit areas, and guidelines for family visits “for a small number of days” over the Christmas holidays.“The increase in new cases is flattening off, but we are not out of the woods yet,” Johnson will tell lawmakers, according to his office. “With the expansion in testing and vaccines edging closer to deployment, the regional tiered system will help get the virus back under control and keep it there.”The prime minister is trying to balance the reopening of the economy in England -- where restaurants, bars and many shops have been closed since Nov. 5 -- with the need to slow the spread of the pandemic, which has killed more than 55,000 people in the U.K., including over 3,000 in the past week.Buying VaccinesVaccines will form a major part of coming out of the pandemic, and the U.K.’s vaccine procurement program has left it well-placed to capitalize on progress being made by the pharmaceuticals industry.Even before the vaccines had been tested, the U.K. had pre-ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca one. It also has bought 5 million doses of a third vaccine being developed by Moderna Inc. that’s also yielded positive results this month.“All three are showing that they are effective, and all three are now going to need to be looked at by the regulator to double, triple-check that they are safe,” Hancock told LBC Radio on Monday, adding that the vaccines have different properties that will be incorporated into the vaccination program.Under Johnson’s new plan, non-essential retailers and gyms will be allowed to reopen, and a curfew on hospitality businesses will be moved to 11pm from 10pm, according to a person familiar with the guidelines. More areas will be placed into the higher tiers of restrictions, with stricter limits on household mixing. Details of exactly where will be announced on Thursday.Rebel ToriesBut the prime minister is facing a rebellion from a group of 70 MPs from his Conservative Party, who warned they’ll not back the return of the tiered structure unless ministers provide a full “cost-benefit” analysis of the plan.Parliament is due to vote on the new rules before they come into force, and if all the signatories to the letter join the opposition parties to vote against Johnson, the government would face defeat.“We cannot support this approach further unless the government demonstrates the restrictions proposed for after Dec. 2 will have an impact on slowing the transmission of Covid, and will save more lives than they cost,” they wrote in a letter to Johnson. “The lockdown cure prescribed runs the very real risk of being worse than the disease.”Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak sought to reassure the potential rebels, saying the cost to livelihoods, particularly in the retail and hospitality sectors, is being taken into account along with wider health impacts.‘Damaging’“Restrictions on businesses’ ability to trade are enormously damaging, not just for them, but for the people that they employ,” Sunak told the BBC on Sunday. “As we’ve learned more, there’s opportunities for us to look and refine things.”The opposition Labour Party said it will “look closely” at the new proposals before deciding whether to support them. There needs to be better financial help for people affected by the restrictions and certainty for businesses, the party said.Under the new program, care workers, employees in food manufacturing, prisons and vaccination centers will be offered weekly swabs. Increased testing will also be used to allow more visits to residents in care homes, Johnson’s office said.Universities have also been offered mass asymptomatic testing to ensure students can safely travel home for Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sees-astra-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-starting-december/story-vctitgysKzC6sl1317VTLO.html
23-11-2020||World||How does Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, with 70% efficacy, stack against Pfizer, Moderna?||The phase 3 interim analysis of Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine candidate showed 70.4 per cent efficacy in preventing the disease, the University of Oxford announced on Monday. In two different dosing regimens, the vaccine, AZD1222, showed the efficacy of 90 per cent and 62 per cent. In the dosing regimen with higher efficacy, AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart. Another dosing regimen showed lower efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 per cent. “Positive high-level results from an interim analysis of clinical trials of AZD1222 in the UK and Brazil showed the vaccine was highly effective in preventing COVID-19, the primary endpoint, and no hospitalisations or severe cases of the disease were reported in participants receiving the vaccine,” AstraZeneca said in a statement.How does it stack against Moderna, Pfizer?While 70 per cent efficacy of AZD1222 would have been considered a huge breakthrough a month back, it is relatively low when compared to 95 per cent efficacy of vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna.

Moderna’s vaccine, mRNA-1273, is expected to remain stable at standard refrigerated conditions of 2°C to 8°C for up to 30 days within the 6-month shelf life. Oxford vaccine also scores better on pricing as it costs a fraction of the price set by Pfizer and Moderna and will be manufactured in multiple countries, including India and Brazil. On Thursday, Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India told Hindustan Times that, in India, Oxford vaccine will be priced at Rs 500-600.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-does-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-with-70-efficacy-stack-against-pfizer-moderna/story-FxucvEthcdCPuAvU5Xp2gL.html
23-11-2020||World||Carlos Ghosn’s repeated arrests were ‘extrajudicial abuse,’ says UN||Carlos Ghosn’s detention for almost 130 days in a Japanese jail was neither necessary nor reasonable and violated the former Nissan Motor Co. chairman’s human rights, a UN panel concluded in a harsh critique of Tokyo prosecutors who led the case against him.The decision to arrest Ghosn four times in a row so as to extend his detention was “fundamentally unfair,” the UN Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said in a report Monday posted on its website. The panel said that it would refer the case to the UN’s rapporteur on torture, cruel and other inhuman or degrading treatment.“The repeated arrest of Mr. Ghosn appears to be an abuse of process intended to ensure that he remained in custody,” the panel said, pointing out that on at least two occasions he was arrested for the same alleged crime, only for a different time period. “This revolving pattern of detention was an extrajudicial abuse of process that can have no legal basis under international law.”Ghosn and former Nissan director Greg Kelly were arrested in Tokyo on Nov. 19, 2018, and accused of underreporting the former chairman’s compensation. Both have denied wrongdoing. Additional charges were filed later accusing Ghosn of using company assets improperly, which he has denied.Ghosn made a daring escape from Japan to Lebanon hidden inside a large box aboard a private jet in late December. It was, Ghosn argued defiantly in Beirut later, the only way for him to avoid what he called trumped-up charges of financial misdeeds concocted with the help of his former Nissan colleagues. His arrest and removal as chairman of Nissan, Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. shook the foundations of the automaking alliance he built and triggered management and operational turmoil.“We welcome a courageous decision from an independent and respected authority, that undeniably establishes Mr. Ghosn’s detention was arbitrary, he was denied his right to impartial justice, and his treatment was unfair and degrading.” his lawyer, Francois Zimeray, said in a statement.A representative for Nissan declined to comment. There was no answer to a call to the Tokyo Public Prosecutor’s Office on Monday, a public holiday in Japan.While Ghosn is unlikely to ever face trial or detention in Japan again, the report could be relevant for several ongoing proceedings related to the former auto executive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/carlos-ghosn-s-jail-time-in-japan-called-abuse-of-process-by-un-panel/story-tnrGrNzEifvAbzz69VZBLP.html
23-11-2020||World||AstraZeneca will have 200 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by this year end||AstraZeneca will have enough of its candidate vaccine for 200 million doses by the end of 2020, with drug substance for 700 million doses by the end of the first quarter of 2021 globally, operations executive Pam Cheng said on Monday.Cheng told a briefing that the company would keep the “active” drug substance in stock while it awaited regulatory approval around the world.She said there would be enough vaccine for 20 million doses in Britain by the end of the year, with enough “active” drug substance for 70 million doses for the UK by the end of Q1 2021.She said she expected that to translate into 4 million finished vaccine doses by the end of 2020, and 40 million finished doses by the end of Q1 next year.Those calculations were based on using two full doses, she said, although trial data suggests higher efficacy when the initial shot is a half dose. “If we go with a half dose you can imagine for the initial dose, we will be able to double the number of vaccinations here,” she said.She said the figures referred to the vaccine doses being manufactured by AstraZeneca, and not those being made by manufacturing partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-will-have-200-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-by-the-end-of-2020/story-BjyvW8P3gUH2XnlaOK3B6O.html
23-11-2020||World||China tests millions after surge in Covid-19 cases in 3 cities||Chinese authorities are testing millions of people, imposing lockdowns and shutting down schools after multiple locally transmitted coronavirus cases were discovered in three cities across the country last week.As temperatures drop, large-scale measures are being enacted in the cities of Tianjin, Shanghai and Manzhouli, despite the low number of new cases compared to the United States and other countries that are seeing new waves of infections.Many experts and government officials have warned that the chance of the virus spreading will be greater during the cold weather. Recent flareups have shown that there is still a risk of the virus returning, despite being largely controlled within China.On Monday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Shanghai over the last 24 hours, bringing the total to seven since Friday.China has recorded 86,442 total cases and 4,634 deaths since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.The two latest cases confirmed in Shanghai were close contacts of another airport worker who was diagnosed with Covid-19 earlier in November.On Sunday night, the city’s Pudong International airport decided to test its workers, collecting 17,719 samples through the early hours of Monday morning. Plans call for testing others in surrounding communities if further cases are detected.Videos on social media purportedly from workers showed what appeared to be chaotic scenes at the airport as they were given last-minute orders to get tested. In the videos, people are seen standing in large groups pushing back and forth against officials in hazmat suits.Shanghai has been more selective with mass testing, targeting people associated with a particular place, such as the airport or the hospital where a confirmed individual had worked, rather than an entire district.In Tianjin, health workers have collected more than 2.2 million samples for testing from residents in the Binhai new district, after five locally transmitted cases were discovered there last week.In Manzhouli, a city of more than 200,000 people, local health authorities are testing all residents after two cases were reported on Saturday. They also shut down all schools and public venues and banned public gatherings such as banquets.China has resorted to its heavy, top-down approach each time new cases of local transmission are found — shutting down schools and hospitals, locking down residential communities and entire neighborhoods, and testing millions.Read more | Indian Army takes a leaf out of Chinese warfare, deploys tunnel defences in LadakhTianjin authorities shut down a kindergarten and moved all the teachers, family and students to a centralized quarantine space. They also sealed the residential compound where the five cases were found.China’s approach to controlling the pandemic has been criticized for being draconian. It locked down the city of Wuhan, where cases were first reported, for more than two months to contain the virus, with the local government shutting down all traffic and confining residents to their homes. Domestically, however, China has called its strategy “clear to zero” and has boasted of its success.“In the entire world, only China has the ability to get to zero. Other countries don’t have this ability,” Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a webinar hosted by Chinese media in September.“It’s not just getting to zero, even for them to control the first wave of the epidemic is hard.” “’Clearing to zero’ is actually the most economically effective way to do epidemic prevention. If you don’t do that, then this problem will get more troublesome,” he said. “Use a heavier hand, and get to zero, then people will feel reassured.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tests-millions-after-surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-3-cities/story-vNxszMopE8mbXI43eRyiUN.html

India was earlier expected to be president of the G20 in 2022, coinciding with the 75th year of its independence. It had sought a swap with Italy, which was set to be the chair in 2022 and agreed to take on the presidency in 2021. A declaration adopted at the end of the G20 Summit on Sunday said, “We look forward to our next meetings in Italy in 2021, Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023 and Brazil in 2024.” Though no official reason was available for the sudden change, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the order of the rotating presidency of the G20 is decided among members on the basis of consultations and mutual convenience. Also read | PM Modi lists India’s progress on climate change targets on G20 sidelines“India looks forward to taking forward the G20 agenda in 2023 after the Italian and Indonesian presidencies,” one of the people cited above said.

Instead of India, Indonesia will now join G20’s “troika” in 2021 along with Saudi Arabia and Italy. The troika is a transitional mechanism that works to ensure that incoming presidents continue the vision of the previous chair.

Gen. Yehia Sarie, a Houthi military spokesman, tweeted that the rebels fired a new Quds-2 cruise missile at the facility. He posted a satellite image online that matched Aramco’s North Jiddah Bulk Plant, where oil products are stored in tanks.That facility is just southeast of Jiddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport, a major airfield that handles incoming Muslim pilgrims en route to nearby Mecca.Online videos appeared to show a tank farm similar to the bulk plant on fire, with wailing sirens heard and police cars alongside a highway by the facility. Details of the videos posted predawn Monday matched the general layout of the bulk plant. However, passers-by could not see damage to the tank farm from the highway running beside the facility later Monday morning.Saudi state-run media did not immediately acknowledge the Houthi claim. Saudi Aramco, the kingdom’s oil giant that now has a sliver of its worth traded publicly on the stock market, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its stock traded down slightly early Monday on Riyadh’s Tadawul stock exchange as crude oil prices remained steady above $40 a barrel.The claimed attack comes just after a visit by outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the kingdom to see Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The kingdom also just hosted the annual G20 summit, which concluded Sunday.A Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iranian-backed Houthis since March 2015, months after the rebels seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa. The war has ground into a stalemate since, with Saudi Arabia facing international criticism for its airstrikes killing civilians.The Houthis have used Quds, or “Jerusalem,” missiles to target Saudi Arabia in the past. The Quds-1 has a copy of a small, Czech-made TJ-100 jet engine, with a range of 700 kilometers (435 miles). United Nations experts have said they don’t believe the missiles are built in Yemen and instead have been sold or traded to them in violation of an arms embargo.Iran uses a copy of TJ-100 engines in its drone program. U.N. experts, Arab countries and the West say Iran supplies arms to the rebels, allegations denied by Tehran.The Quds-1 was used in a missile-and-drone strike on the heart of the kingdom’s oil industry in 2019 that shook global energy markets. The U.S. believes Iran carried out that attack amid a series of escalating incidents last year between Tehran and Washington, something Tehran denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yemen-rebels-claim-attack-on-saudi-oil-facility-in-jiddah/story-raPd6uZg3Y6UCxAt0Nr3PO.html

The measures would be rolled over for periods of two weeks if contagion rates remain above the government’s target level, according to a briefing paper drawn up by the officials and published in German media.“The numbers have slowed, but they are still too high,” Manuela Schwesig, the premier of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, said Monday in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio. “We still need strict rules for the whole of Germany, particularly restrictions on contact.”The 16 state premiers will hold further talks on Monday before final decisions are made in consultation with Chancellor Angela Merkel and the federal government on Wednesday. The plan would ban the sale of fireworks for New Year’s Eve and further restrict the number of people allowed in private gatherings.While the measures are being toughened now, leaders of Europe’s largest economy have said the goal is to allow Germans to celebrate Christmas with their families.The paper also calls for an extension of financial aid for businesses such as shuttered bars and restaurants -- which cost around 15 billion euros ($17.8 billion) this month. Areas with lower infection rates could potentially ease restrictions early.Also Read | Germany may start Covid-19 vaccine programme in December: Health ministerThe number of cases in Germany has tripled since the start of October to more than 900,000, and the amount of people with disease in intensive care is at record levels. The surge in infections prompted officials to impose a partial shutdown that closed bars, restaurants, gyms and cultural venues, while keeping most of the economy running.Merkel has said the seven-day incidence per 100,000 citizens needs to come down to around 50 before the latest curbs can be eased. It was at 141 on Sunday, according to the latest report from the RKI public health institute.“The fact is that we haven’t got as far as we wanted to through the contact restrictions,” Merkel said late Sunday after a video conference with G-20 leaders. “That means we will surely have to do something more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-moves-toward-tightening-partial-lockdown-against-covid-19-until-dec-20/story-ZU53wT7fflrl2E6EeHABrJ.html

All results were statistically significant.The interim analysis was based on 131 infections among participants who received the vaccine and those in a control group who were given an established meningitis shot.The data showing a range of efficacy between 60% and 90% comes after US rivals published interim data in recent weeks showing efficacy of more than 90%.While the efficacy reading from Astra’s viral vector vaccine is lower than its U.S. rivals, the data will boost confidence about the chances of successfully developing a variety of vaccines using different approaches. Public health experts say the world will need many vaccines to meet global demand.On Nov. 16, U.S.-based Moderna Inc said its experimental vaccine proved to be 94.5% effective based on an early data analysis. A week earlier, Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech SE said their vaccine candidate had demonstrated greater than 90% efficacy that rose to 95% with analysis of full trial data.Russia’s Sputnik-V vaccine on Nov. 11 was also shown to be more than 90% effective, though only based on 20 infections. The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee common cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus, which is different than the new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA) deployed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.The company - one of the UK’s most valuable listed companies - will now immediately prepare regulatory submission of the data to authorities around the world that have a framework in place for conditional or early approval.It will also seek an emergency use listing from the World Health Organization to speed up availability in low-income countries. In parallel, the full analysis of the interim results is being submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-can-be-90-effective-results-show/story-tWYN3QoOmXgx9SJTWtFnvJ.html

Francis was a 21-year-old seminarian in the second year of his studies for the priesthood in his native Buenos Aires when an illness that had been mis-diagnosed as influenza worsened and he was hospitalised.“They took about a litre and a half of water out of one lung and I was hanging between life and death,” he said. Several months later doctors removed the upper lobe of his right lung. Today, the 83-year-old pope can be heard breathing heavily after climbing stairs. “(The experience) changed my bearings,” he said. “For months I didn’t know who I was, if I would live or die, even the doctors didn’t know. I remember hugging my mother one day and asking her if I was about to die.”Francis recounts how a nun who worked as nurse helped save his life by secretly doubling the doses of penicillin and streptomycin that a doctor had prescribed.“Thanks to her regular contact with sick people, she knew what patients needed better than the doctor and had the courage to put that experience to work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-says-his-brush-with-death-helps-him-relate-to-covid-19-victims/story-Ndao5xdsKgW1bovQm9r9nK.html

These restrictions will go into effect on Tuesday. Even though the state avoided strict restrictions throughout the fall as Nevada’s economy is based on tourism, Governor Sisolak who recently contracted Covid-19 himself said, “We are on a rapid trajectory that threatens to overwhelm our health care system, our frontline health workers, and your access to care. So it’s time to act.”The restrictions come at a time when health officials reported 2,155 confirmed cases on Sunday increasing the statewide total to 133,888 since the onset of the pandemic. They include mandatory wearing of masks (indoors and outdoors) and reducing occupancy in eating places and public places to 25 per cent but not closing any businesses completely as Sisolak called these restrictions that would be in place for three weeks, “ a statewide pause”.Read more | US Covid-19 death toll rises to 255,076; more than 184,500 fresh casesNevada is not alone in imposing restrictions as California has put a curfew order in effect in the majority of its counties.

Excitingly, we’ve found that one of our dosing regimens may be around 90% effective and if this dosing regime is used, more people could be vaccinated with planned vaccine supply. Today’s announcement is only possible thanks to the many volunteers in our trial, and the hard working and talented team of researchers based around the world,” professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford, said.The vaccine stopped an average of 70% of participants in a study from falling ill, an early analysis of the data show. The findings were reviewed after 131 trial participants contracted Covid-19, and are based on two different dosing regimes. However, none of those 131 patients had to be hospitalised. One dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy of 90% when AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart, and another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted in an average efficacy of 70%.Astrazeneca said the company is making rapid progress in manufacturing with a capacity of up to 3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 on a rolling basis, pending regulatory approval. The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius/ 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered within existing healthcare settings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/70-efficacy-astrazeneca-to-seek-emergency-use-listing-from-who-focus-on-low-income-countries/story-XcL6BxL4YgF5i6MQzyInlN.html
23-11-2020||World||China in final preparations for latest lunar mission||Chinese technicians were making final preparations Monday for a mission to bring back material from the moon’s surface in what would be a major advance for the country’s space program.Chang’e 5 is China’s most ambitious lunar mission yet and marks the first time in four decades that any country has sought to bring rocks and debris from the moon to Earth. That could boost human understanding of the moon, its age and resources, and of the solar system more generally.The four modules of the Chang’e 5 spacecraft are expected be sent into space Tuesday aboard a massive Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang launch center along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan, according to a NASA description of the mission.The secretive Chinese National Space Administration has only said that a launch is scheduled for late November.The mission’s key task is to drill 2 meters (almost 7 feet) beneath the moon’s surface and scoop up about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and other debris to be brought back to Earth, according to NASA. That would the first opportunity scientists have had to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.The mission is “indeed challenging,” but China has already landed twice on the moon with its Chang’e 3 and Chang’e 4 missions, and showed with a 2014 Chang’e 5 test mission that it can navigate back to Earth, re-enter and land a capsule, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. All that’s left is to show it can collect samples and take off again from the moon, McDowell said.“As a result of this, I’m pretty optimistic that China can pull this off,” he said.Such experience is growing in value with more and more countries conducting asteroid sample returns and considering Mars sample returns, McDowell said.After making the three-day trip from Earth, the Chang’e 5 lander’s time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units that China’s current lunar rover, the Chang’e 4, possesses to withstand the moon’s freezing nights.Launched as a single space craft, Chang’e 5 is actually composed of a lander, ascender, service module and return capsule.The lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to the ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule for the trip home to earth.The technical complexity of Chang’e 5, with its four components, makes it “remarkable in many ways,” said Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the U.S. Naval War College.If successful, it could be a blueprint for a Mars sample return or even a crewed lunar mission, Johnson-Freese said.“China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programs, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships,” she said.The mission, named for the Chinese moon goddess Chang’e, is among China’s boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.While many of China’s crewed spaceflight achievements, including building an experimental space station and conducting a space walk, reproduce those of other countries from years past, the CNSA is now moving into new territory.Chang’e 4 —the first soft landing on the moon’s relatively unexplored far side — is providing full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.China in July became one of three countries to have launched a mission to Mars, in China’s case an orbiter and a rover that will search for signs of water on the red planet. The CNSA says the spacecraft Tianwen 1 is on course to arrive at Mars around February.China has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, and the European Space Agency will be providing important ground station information for Chang’e 5.US law however still prevents most collaborations with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to start work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.China’s space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The Long March-5 rocket, nicknamed “Fat 5” because of its bulky shape, failed on a previous launch attempt, but has since performed without a glitch, including launching Chang’e 4.“China works very incrementally, developing building blocks for long-term use for a variety of missions,” Freese-Johnson said. China’s one-party authoritarian system also allows for “prolonged political will that is often difficult in democracies,” she said.While the U.S. has followed China’s successes closely, it’s unlikely to engage China in space amid political suspicions, a sharpening military rivalry and accusations of Chinese theft of technology, experts say.“A change in U.S. policy regarding space cooperation is unlikely to get much government attention in the near future,” Johnson-Freese said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-in-final-preparations-for-latest-lunar-mission/story-NtasFJtnwHIUW0VHITIl7M.html
23-11-2020||World||Anthony Blinken, likely secretary of state, is positive on US-India ties||US President-elect Joe Biden is expected to appoint Anthony Blinken, a long-time national security and foreign policy expert who has been enthusiastic about ties with India and called China a “common challenge”, as his secretary of state, US media reported.Jake Sullivan, a former top state department official in the Obama-Biden administration, is reported to be a frontrunner for the position of National Security Adviser. Michele Flournoy and Lael Brainard are top contenders for secretaries of defence and treasury.Vivek Murthy, the Indian American who was President Barack Obama’s Surgeon General, is in contention for the position of secretary of health and human services. He is currently a co-chair of Biden’s team of advisers tasked with preparing the incoming administration’s Covid-19 plan.Biden’s incoming chief of staff Ron Klain told ABC News on Sunday the president-elect will name some of his cabinet secretaries on Tuesday. But he did not specify how many and which ones. But names began trickling out hours later that, according to a pattern noticed to be true for the incoming administration, have tended to be remarkably on target.Blinken, who served as deputy secretary of state in the Obama-Biden administration, had been a frontrunner for the position of Biden’s top diplomat. He was also Biden campaign’s chief foreign policy official who also determined — among other things — the order in which the president-elect returned congratulatory calls from world leaders. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first leaders of non-treaty allied countries Biden called, along with Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu.In an outreach to the Indian American community in the run-up to the election — on August 15, to commemorate the Indian Independence Day — Blinken described China as a “common challenge”, taking into cognizance China’s “aggression toward India at the line of actual control.Speaking generally of ties with India he had said, “We will be an advocate for India to play a leading role in international institutions and that includes helping India get a seat on a reform. United Nations Security Council. We will work together to strengthen India’s defence.”Blinken had gone on to reiterate long-running US commitment to combating terrorism, making common cause with India. “We have no tolerance for terrorism in South Asia or anywhere else, cross-border, or otherwise,” Blinken had said, recalling meetings he attended with Rich Verma, the former US ambassador to India who moderated the panel discussion with Blinken and Nisha Biswal, the first Indian American to head the state department’s South and Central Asia bureau. “I was in virtually every NSC meeting with both of you in many instances on this issue. We used every tool at our disposal to make sure that our citizens, and the citizens of our partners are safe. And that’s something we will build on in a Biden ministration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-blinken-likely-secretary-of-state-is-positive-on-us-india-ties/story-nG4uOcqG3nyAdlKs9SvwxI.html

That’s below the high bar set by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., but effectiveness rose to 90% for one of two dosing regimes, using half a dose followed by a full one later. The other method showed 62% effectiveness.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We are excited to see 90% efficacy from the half dose-full dose regimen,” an Astra spokesman said. “We see a lot of merit in this regimen and we will now start discussions with regulators into incorporating this dose combination for further clinical investigation.”ALSO WATCH | SII’s Adar Poonawala on side-effects of Oxford’s Covid vaccine at #HTLS2020 The findings were reviewed after 131 trial participants contracted Covid-19. Among those who received the vaccine, there were no severe cases of Covid-19 in the trial and no participants were hospitalized.Two regimesThe differing results of the two regimens may leave questions about the best way to give the AstraZeneca shot. The results also look slightly less promising than data from Moderna, which said its shot stopped 94.5% of trial participants from falling ill, according to early data. Pfizer, which is working with German partner BioNTech SE, said its vaccine candidate prevented 95% of symptomatic infections.Also Read: Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine safe in older adults, induces immune response: LancetDespite the apparently lower efficacy, the British shot has some advantages when it comes to distribution. While the other two vaccines have to be stored frozen, the Astra-Oxford jab can be kept at refrigerator temperature, which would make it easier to transport and store globally, particularly in lower and middle-income countries. It also comes at a potentially lower cost.Analysts at Barclays Plc put consensus expectations for what would be deemed a success from AstraZeneca at 70% to 90%, following conversations with investors in Europe and the U.S.AstraZeneca said it will immediately prepare to submit data to authorities around the world that have a framework in place for early approval. The company said it will seek an emergency use listing from the World Health Organization for an accelerated pathway to vaccine availability in low-income countries.U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News on Monday that British regulators will now need to make sure the vaccine is “effective and safe.”“Should all that go well, the bulk of the rollout will be in the new year,” Hancock said.Rolling reviewsVaccine developers will not know how long any protection lasts for a number of months as they monitor antibody levels to see how quickly or not they fade.

23-11-2020||World||‘Certainly a weak president’: Chinese government advisor thinks Biden could start war||US President-elect Joe Biden is certainly a very weak President and he could start a war with China, a Chienese government advisor has said underlying the need for the China government to mend ties with the US. Zheng Yongnian, the Dean of the Advanced Institute of Global and Contemporary China Studies, a Shenzhen-based think tank, has analysed that if Biden can’t sort out domestic issues, then he could easily do something against China. Trump was not interested in wars, as he was not interested in promoting democracy and freedom, but Biden is.“He is certainly a very weak President, if he can’t sort out domestic issues, then he will do something on the diplomatic front, do something against China. If we say Trump is not interested in promoting democracy and freedom, Biden is. (President Donald) Trump is not interested in war... but a Democratic President could start wars,” Zheng Yongnian said.Zheng said Biden might take advantage of the public resentment towards China after he entered the White House. “American society is torn apart. I don’t think Biden can do anything about it,” he said. And Biden had left enough indications of how his China policy would be during his campaigning, Zheng said reminding China of how Biden called Xi Jinping a “thug”. China’s relationship with the US, which has deteriorated during Trump’s presidency, will not improve automatically under Biden, Zheng Yongnian has noted. Instead, Beijing should be prepared for a tough stance from Washington.“The good old days are over... the cold war hawks in the US have been in a highly mobilised state for several years, and they will not disappear overnight,” Zheng said in an interview on the sidelines of the Understanding China Conference in Guangzhou recently.Zheng, who attended a symposium hosted by President Xi Jinping in August to offer advice on China’s long-term strategy, said there was now a bipartisan consensus in the US on containing China.Over 300 separate Bills targeting China have been drawn up by both Democrats and Republicans in the Congress, and the important ones addressing the catastrophes in Hong Kong and Xinjiang enjoyed full bipartisan support. The most potentially effective law, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which Trump only reluctantly signed, was co-sponsored by Republican Marco Rubio and Kamala Harris, the Democrats’ Vice-President-elect.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/certainly-a-weak-president-chinese-government-advisor-thinks-biden-could-start-war/story-RoLwp8CYS5EOy4USDBsZnO.html

Both Wong and Lam were members of the now-disbanded Demosisto political party.“I am persuaded that neither prison bars, nor election ban, nor any other arbitrary powers would stop us from activism,” Wong said.“What we are doing now is to explain the value of freedom to the world, through our compassion to whom we love, so much that we are willing to sacrifice the freedom of our own. I’m prepared for the thin chance of walking free.”Those found guilty of taking part in an unlawful assembly could face as long as five years in prison depending on the severity of the offense.Wong rose to prominence as a student leader during the 2014 Umbrella Movement pro-democracy protests and is among a growing number of activists being charged for various relatively minor offenses since Beijing in June imposed a sweeping national security law on the territory that has severely restricted political speech.Pro-democracy supporters have said the legal charges are part of a campaign to harass and intimidate them.Lam, who also spoke ahead of the court hearing, said he too was prepared to be jailed.Wong wrote on his Facebook page on Sunday that he and Lam had decided to plead guilty after consulting with their lawyers. The two previously pleaded not guilty to the charges.Another activist, Agnes Chow, has already pleaded guilty to charges of inciting others and taking part in the protest.“If I am sentenced to prison this time, it will be the first time in my life that I have been in jail,” Chow wrote on her Facebook page on Sunday.“Although I am mentally prepared, I still feel a little bit scared. However, compared to many friends, I have suffered very little. When I think of this, I will try my best to face it bravely,” she wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-pro-democracy-activist-joshua-wong-to-plead-guilty-to-protest-charges/story-3xykuNeBniqP5hGkZeDpYP.html
23-11-2020||World||In latest China jab, US drafts list of 89 firms with military ties||The Trump administration is close to declaring that 89 Chinese aerospace and other companies have military ties, restricting them from buying a range of US goods and technology, according to a draft copy of the list seen by Reuters.The list, if published, could further escalate trade tensions with Beijing and hurt US companies that sell civil aviation parts and components to China, among other industries.A spokesman for the US Department of Commerce, which produced the list, declined to comment. The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately response to a request for comment.Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing and Airbus, is on the list, as is Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and 10 of its related entities. The list is included in a draft rule that identifies Chinese and Russian companies the US considers “military end users,” a designation that means U.S. suppliers must seek licenses to sell a broad swath of commercially available items to them. According to the rule, applications for such licenses are more likely to be denied than granted. US President Donald Trump has stepped up his actions in recent months against China. Ten days ago, he unveiled an executive order prohibiting US investments in Chinese companies that Washington says are owned or controlled by the Chinese military. The pending list comes after the Commerce Department expanded the definition of “military end user” in April. The April rule includes not only armed service and national police, but any person or entity that supports or contributes to the maintenance or production of military items -- even if their business is primarily non-military.The export restriction applies to items as disparate as computer software like word processing, scientific equipment like digital oscilloscopes, and aircraft parts and components. In terms of aircraft, the items include everything from brackets for flight control boxes to the engines themselves. News of the list comes at a sensitive time for the US aerospace industry as Boeing seeks Chinese approval of its 737 MAX after it was cleared by US regulators last week. In March 2019, China was the first nation to ground the jet following two fatal crashes and it is already expected to wait months to lift the ban. A spokesman for Boeing declined to comment.Washington trade lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce official, said Commerce had shared the draft rule with a technical advisory committee of industry representatives, and it should have been kept confidential.Wolf said the rule and list still could be modified and that the clock was running out for it to go into effect under the Trump administration since it would need to be cleared and sent to the Federal Register, the official US publication for rules, by mid-December. In the draft rule seen by Reuters, the Commerce Department said being able to control the flow of US technology to the listed companies was “vital for protecting US national security interests”.But a former US official who did not want to be identified, said “merely creating a list and populating it is a provocative act.” An aerospace industry source said it could spur China to retaliate. The inclusion of COMAC would come as a surprise to at least one major US supplier, which had determined the company was not a military end user, the industry source said. A list also would provide European competitors with an opening to promote their manufacturers, by pointing out they do not have to clear such hurdles, even if the US grants the licenses, the industry source said.General Electric Co and Honeywell International, both supply COMAC and have joint ventures with AVIC.A GE spokesperson said its global joint ventures operate in compliance with all laws, and that the company has worked to obtain licenses related to military end users. A Honeywell spokeswoman declined to comment.Besides the 89 Chinese listings, the draft rule also designates 28 Russian entities, including Irkut, which is also aiming to break into Boeing’s market with its MC-21 jetliner development. The 117-company list is “not exhaustive,” the draft rule said, and is considered an “initial tranche.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-latest-china-jab-us-drafts-list-of-89-firms-with-military-ties/story-T3b3F4M7iZVI9kWV9KzGuL.html

23-11-2020||World||Covid-19: UK to unveil a ‘tougher’ 3-tiered system after lockdown||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that a strengthened three-tiered system will be introduced in the country on Monday to curb the spread of coronavirus after the lockdown ends on December 2.While more areas are expected to be placed into higher tiers to keep the virus under control and tiers are to be strengthened to safeguard lockdown progress, the 10pm closing time for pubs and restaurants is going to be relaxed, according to a BBC report. Gyms and non-essential retail are also expected to be allowed to re-open in all areas under the new plans.Also Read: Covid-19: Prepare for economic shock, warns Rishi SunakAccording to the Telegraph, the government will also announce on Monday that self-isolation will no longer be required for those who have come into contact with people who have tested positive for Covid-19.After December 2, some local measures will be the same as those in the previous three-tier system, which was in place until the current lockdown began, but the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to publish research on Monday saying the previous restrictions were not strong enough, the report added.All regions of England will be notified on Thursday which tier they will be put into after the lockdown ends and MPs are expected to vote on the new tier system before it comes into force.Also Read: Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine could get UK approval this week: ReportSince before the pandemic, England has three tiers of restrictions - medium, high, and very high. Tier 1, or medium tier of restrictions means there is a rule of six if meeting indoors or outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm. Tier 2 or high tier of restrictions means no household mixing indoors; rule of six applies outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm. Under the highest tier of restrictions, tier 3, no household mixing indoors or in some outdoor spaces; pubs and bars not serving meals are closed.Talking about a UK-wide approach to restrictions this Christmas, BBC’s deputy political editor Vicki Young said “One option that was discussed in meetings this weekend was that three households could be allowed to meet up for up to five days.” Other announcements regarding arrangements for the Christmas period will be made by PM Johnson on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-to-unveil-a-tougher-3-tiered-system-after-lockdown/story-H3uRKUjNaeqf4DzBjfZkgL.html
23-11-2020||World||US hopes to start virus vaccines in December as pandemic surges||The United States hopes to begin coronavirus vaccinations in early December, a top government health official said Sunday, the latest positive news to emerge even as cases surge across the worst-hit nation and elsewhere around the globe.The beginning of vaccinations could be a crucial shift in the battle against a virus that has claimed more than 1.4 million lives worldwide, including 255,000 just in the US, since emerging from China late last year.Encouraging results from vaccine trials have bolstered hopes for an end to the pandemic, as nations reimpose restrictions and lockdowns that slowed the spread earlier this year but turned lives and economies upside down across the globe.Two leading vaccine candidates -- one by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech and another by US firm Moderna -- have been shown to be 95 percent effective in trials, and Pfizer has already applied for emergency use approval from US health authorities. “Our plan is to be able to ship vaccines to the immunization sites within 24 hours of approval” by the US Food and Drug Administration, Moncef Slaoui, head of the US government virus vaccine effort, told CNN, pointing to possible dates of December 11-12.FDA vaccine advisors will meet December 10 to discuss approval.Slaoui estimated that 20 million people across the US could be vaccinated in December, with 30 million per month after that.But top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci, who said “maybe 20 million people will be able to get vaccinated by the middle to the end of December,” warned the situation could get worse before getting better if people fail to take precautions in the coming holiday season.“We’re in a very difficult situation at all levels,” he told CBS’s “Face the Nation.”- Vaccines for all? -With cases surpassing 12 million in the United States, the highest in the world, many Americans were nonetheless heading to airports to travel for this week’s Thanksgiving holiday, despite health officials’ warnings to stay home.Some US states were imposing new restrictions, including California, where a 10:00 pm to 5:00 am curfew took effect Saturday. New York city has closed schools again.Texas, which earlier this month became the first state to record more than one million coronavirus cases, has called in the National Guard to support the city of El Paso.Mayor Dee Margo announced on Twitter that the National Guard would provide backup to the county’s morgue operations.US drug regulators on Saturday already gave emergency approval to a Covid-19 antibody therapy -- one used by US President Donald Trump -- that could help treat those infected.However, G20 nations were pushing for “equitable” global access to vaccines, with worries poorer nations will be left behind.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done, since no major vaccine agreements had been struck yet for poorer nations.“We will now speak with (global vaccine alliance group) GAVI about when these negotiations will begin because I am somewhat worried that nothing has been done on that yet,” Merkel told reporters on Sunday in Berlin after a virtual G20 summit hosted by Saudi Arabia.There were signs that restrictions being imposed in certain countries were helping slow infections.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, whose country has been badly hit by the pandemic, said Sunday that a strategy to curb infections was working.Spain declared a state of emergency last month, which allowed regional governments to impose virus restrictions such as nighttime curfews.The country has recorded fewer than 400 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the last two weeks, compared to nearly 530 cases at the start of the month, he told a news conference after the G20 summit.- ‘A mockery’ -But the restrictions and mask-wearing rules have led to protests in some countries, particularly the United States, where people -- mainly Trump supporters -- have railed against closures.US media reported that hundreds of protesters gathered in Huntington Beach Saturday night, in defiance of California’s newly implemented curfew.Similar pushback has been seen elsewhere, and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas lashed out Sunday at anti-mask protesters comparing themselves to Nazi victims, accusing them of trivializing the Holocaust and “making a mockery” of the courage shown by resistance fighters.The harsh words came after a young woman took to the stage at a protest against coronavirus restrictions in Hanover Saturday saying she felt “just like Sophie Scholl,” the German student executed by the Nazis in 1943 for her role in the resistance.Government measures introduced to halt the spread of the coronavirus have triggered large protests in Germany, drawing in people from the far-left, conspiracy theorists and right-wing extremists who claim the curbs infringe on their civil rights.While necessary to stop the spread of the virus, restrictions have taken a heavy toll on economies across the world.Another such warning came on Sunday from Britain’s finance minister Rishi Sunak, who said the country’s economy was under “enormous strain and stress.”Britain has suffered more than any other country in Europe from the coronavirus, recording more than 54,000 deaths from 1.4 million cases.In November, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government imposed a four-week lockdown to stop the spread of the disease. That is due to be partially lifted on December 2, giving some relief to businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hopes-to-start-virus-vaccines-in-december-as-pandemic-surges/story-h3C0bfjX8gKEQdQ6LwlzrL.html
23-11-2020||World||Joe Biden to unveil first Cabinet picks on Tuesday, envisions scaled-down inauguration||President-elect Joe Biden will announce the first of his Cabinet appointments on Tuesday and is planning for a scaled-down inauguration due to the coronavirus pandemic, aides said on Sunday, as he lays the foundation for his new administration despite President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede.Since Biden, a Democrat, was declared the winner of the Nov. 3 election two weeks ago, the Republican president has launched a barrage of lawsuits and mounted a pressure campaign to prevent state officials from certifying their vote totals, suffering another emphatic legal setback on Saturday in Pennsylvania.Ron Klain, Biden’s choice as White House chief of staff, again urged that the Trump administration - specifically a federal agency called the General Services Administration (GSA) - formally recognize Biden’s victory to unlock resources for the transition process.“I hope that the administrator of the GSA will do her job,” Klain added, referring to GSA chief Emily Murphy.Biden is due to take office on Jan. 20.Also Read: Joe Biden poised to name cabinet“A record number of Americans rejected the Trump presidency, and since then Donald Trump’s been rejecting democracy,” Klain told ABC’s “This Week” program.Biden received 6 million more votes nationwide than Trump and prevailed 306-232 in the state-by-state Electoral College system that determines the election’s victor.The former vice president, working in his home state of Delaware, has announced a series of selections for White House posts. Klain said that “you’re going to see the first Cabinet picks this Tuesday,” but declined to disclose the choices or the posts to be filled.Biden said on Thursday he had chosen a treasury secretary. Candidates on Biden’s shortlist include former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, current Fed Governor Lael Brainard, Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor, and Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.Biden allies also indicated he could announce his selection for secretary of state as soon as this week, with former national security adviser Susan Rice and veteran diplomat Antony Blinken seen as among the candidates.FAILING IN THE COURTSKlain said there would be “scaled-down versions of the existing traditions” for Biden’s inauguration. Inauguration ceremonies and related events typically draw huge crowds to Washington. Covid-19 cases and deaths are surging in many parts of the country amid a pandemic that has killed more than 256,000 people in the United States.“We know people want to celebrate. There is something here to celebrate,” Klain said. “We just want to try to find a way to do it as safely as possible.”Critics of Trump, including Democrats and some Republicans, have accused him of trying to undermine faith in the American electoral system and delegitimize Biden’s victory by promoting false claims of widespread voter fraud.“Fight hard Republicans,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday morning as he pressed his unsubstantiated narrative of voter fraud before playing golf in Virginia for a second day in a row.Also Read: Trump wants courts to step in, maintain US ‘integrity’ as Biden set to form cabinetAttempts to thwart certification of vote tallies have failed thus far in courts in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona. U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, in dismissing the Pennsylvania lawsuit on Saturday, compared the Trump team’s arguments claiming voter fraud to a “Frankenstein’s Monster” that was “haphazardly stitched together” using meritless legal arguments and speculative accusations.Trump’s campaign issued a statement on Sunday distancing itself from Sidney Powell, a lawyer who made baseless allegations of a vast vote-rigging conspiracy at a campaign news conference on Thursday.“Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own,” Trump campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis said in the statement. “She is not a member of the Trump Legal Team. She is also not a lawyer for the President in his personal capacity.”Both Giuliani and Ellis attended the Thursday news conference alongside Powell. Powell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump’s campaign also said it was appealing Brann’s decision to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Pennsylvania is expected to certify its election results on Monday.Trump’s campaign has filed a petition for another recount in Georgia. A previous laborious hand recount reaffirmed Biden’s victory by a margin of more than 12,000 votes in the Southern state, a longtime Republican bastion in presidential elections.‘NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT’Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans are now breaking ranks, although many, including the most senior ones in Congress, have not.Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has served as a Trump adviser, called the president’s legal team a “national embarrassment.”“They allege fraud outside the courtroom, but when they go inside the courtroom they don’t plead fraud and they don’t argue fraud,” Christie told ABC’s “This Week,” adding that “if you’re unwilling to come forward and present the evidence, it must mean the evidence doesn’t exist.”Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski tweeted on Sunday that “it is time to begin the full and formal transition process,” noting the courts had thus far found Trump’s legal claims without merit and that the pressure campaign on state legislators “is not only unprecedented but inconsistent with our democratic process.”Critics have said Trump’s refusal to facilitate an orderly transition carries serious implications for national security and the fight against Covid-19.Klain said Biden was being denied intelligence briefings to which he is entitled, FBI background checks on potential Cabinet nominees, and access to agency officials to help develop plans including avoiding delays in Covid-19 vaccine rollout.Jen Psaki, a senior adviser to Biden’s transition team, said on “State of the Union” that legal action to compel the GSA to recognize Biden “isn’t our preference.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-unveil-first-cabinet-picks-on-tuesday-envisions-scaled-down-inauguration/story-vv8niOhAA8l0KMcbp9AedN.html

The killings were believed to be linked to drug trafficking.Meantime, in the small town of Argelia in Cauca department, at least five people died and two were wounded in attacks by the same man in a pool hall, a bar and a discotheque.Other recent attacks have also targeted nightspots. Leftist rebels of the National Liberation Army (ELN); dissident members of FARC, the guerrilla group that became a political party with the 2016 peace accord; and narco-traffickers have clashed in the area over revenues from drug trafficking and illegal mining.Cauca lies along a trafficking route linking Central America to the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-13-die-in-two-massacres-in-colombia-officials/story-lwBWDLMCQ48kzwltnPF1xI.html
23-11-2020||World||UNICEF says to ship 2 billion Covid vaccines to poor nations in 2021||Nearly 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines will be shipped and flown to developing countries next year in a “mammoth operation”, the U.N. children’s agency UNICEF said on Monday, as world leaders vowed to ensure the fair distribution of vaccines.UNICEF said it was working with over 350 airlines and freight companies to deliver vaccines and 1 billion syringes to poor countries such as Burundi, Afghanistan and Yemen as part of COVAX, a global Covid-19 vaccine allocation plan with the World Health Organization (WHO).“This invaluable collaboration will go a long way to ensure that enough transport capacity is in place for this historic and mammoth operation,” said Etleva Kadilli, director of UNICEF’s Supply Division, in a statement.COVAX - co-led by GAVI vaccine group, the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations - aims to discourage governments from hoarding Covid-19 vaccines and to focus on first vaccinating the most at risk in every country.At a G20 summit this weekend, leaders of the biggest 20 world economies pledged to ensure the equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, drugs and tests so that poorer countries are not left out.Even before the pandemic hit, access to vaccines was unequal with around 20 million babies not receiving vaccines that could save them from serious diseases, death, disability and ill health, according to the WHO.“We need all hands on deck as we get ready to deliver Covid-19 vaccine doses, syringes and more personal protective equipment to protect frontline workers around the globe,” said UNICEF’S Kadilli, who is working with the Pan American Health Organization and the International Air Transport Association.UNICEF’s role with COVAX stems from its status as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world.It said it procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries.Drugmakers and research centres worldwide are racing to develop COVID-19 vaccines, with large global trials of several of the candidates involving tens of thousands of participants well underway.Pfizer Inc and BioNTech could secure emergency U.S. and European authorisation for their COVID-19 vaccine next month after final trial results showed a 95% success rate and no serious side effects.Moderna Inc last week released preliminary data for its vaccine showing 94.5% effectiveness.The better-than-expected results from the two vaccines, both developed with new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, have raised hopes for an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unicef-says-to-ship-2-billion-covid-vaccines-to-poor-nations-in-2021/story-3YdUD3hvMRzyKgpT3UmOUL.html
23-11-2020||World||Biggest Australian states reopen borders as coronavirus cases ease||Australia’s two most populous states reopened their borders on Monday after more than four months, as Victoria stamped out a second coronavirus wave, raising prospects of a quicker return to normal and speedy economic recovery. New South Wales and Victoria closed their borders in early July, the first time in more than a century, to contain a Covid-19 outbreak in Melbourne, Victoria’s capital city. The borders were last shut in 1919 during the Spanish flu pandemic.Also Read | One man’s ‘lie’ led to harsh lockdown in South AustraliaLifting of the border ban at midnight triggered joyful scenes and celebrations across the border towns with most drivers crossing the border honking their car horns to cheers from border residents, television footages showed. Reopening of the borders should see a surge in air traffic between Melbourne and Sydney, one of the busiest routes in the world before the pandemic, with Sydney airport expecting nearly 4,000 passengers across 26 flights from Victoria on Monday.Besides providing relief to businesses that straddle both sides of the border, lifting of the border ban will also put more people back on jobs in several hard-hit sectors during the pandemic, including airlines. “Today, some people who haven’t worked since March are going to be on aircraft for the first time,” Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce told local broadcaster Seven News.Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state, appeared to have effectively eliminated the virus as it reported no new Covid-19 infections for the 24th straight day on Monday.On Sunday, Victoria, which was the country’s coronavirus epicenter just over a month ago, eased its outdoor mask rules and allowed larger public gatherings, helped by a steady decline in cases.Victoria accounts for about 73% of Australia’s total Covid-19 cases of just over 27,800 and 90% of its 907 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biggest-australian-states-reopen-borders-as-coronavirus-cases-ease/story-9fDQgJ59ahiUNtQm46bkPP.html
23-11-2020||World||Women in finance have to ask for promotions, men don’t: Survey||Far fewer women than men are promoted in the finance industry unless they first ask for seniority, a sign of institutional gender bias, according to a new study in Australia.The survey of 2,000 finance industry professionals showed 76% of men were offered a promotion at least once without requesting it, compared with 57% of women. The study was compiled by lead researchers Ardea Investment Management and Australian National University in conjunction with industry experts.The findings provide “evidence of that culture that things come to men without asking,” said Bronwen Whiting, who worked on the survey and is a senior lecturer in applied statistics at the university. “It can’t all be on women to act differently to fix it.”Australia is among the countries that can claim some success in tackling gender inequality. For example, a report by consultancy Kearney this year showed Australia tops the U.K., U.S. and India for the proportion of female parliamentarians and women board members in its top 100 firms. Yet the latest survey’s results show ongoing gaps, including the fact that male fund managers on average earn more than twice as much as female counterparts.Male quantitative research analysts are paid 43% more than women, and men in compliance roles received an additional 76%, based on 2019 data. Official Australian figures put the overall gender pay gap at 14%. In the U.K., the gap in financial services is well over 20%, according an analysis of government data.The Ardea-Australian National University study found that women asked for pay increases and promotions at the same rate as men, and when they do so, there was no difference between the genders in terms of receiving them. Yet the gap appeared when companies took the initiative with promotions.“One of the arguments put forward as to why women are paid less is that we are too agreeable,” Laura Ryan, head of research at Sydney-based Ardea, said in an interview. “Looks like we are being assertive, but if we are not we definitely miss out. Gender is a strongly significant factor in determining salary.”Glass ceilings and salary disparities due to gender remain persistent problems globally in the finance industry. One of the implications for women is that they end up falling behind in saving for their retirement compared to men, Ryan said.Australian National University’s Whiting said she hoped executives will acknowledge that progress has been slow and “it’s not something that we can talk about once a year on International Women’s Day and then forget about it.”Ryan said many colleagues in the finance industry believe there is no gender gap, adding that “while there is all this unconscious bias training and everyone seems to think that the problem is fixed, the results show that it’s definitely not fixed and we still have quite a way to go.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/women-in-finance-have-to-ask-for-promotions-men-don-t-survey/story-JbOcQkCQiRAdzBpu4N2AYL.html
23-11-2020||World||Ethiopia warns civilians of ‘no mercy’ in Tigray offensive||Ethiopia’s military is warning civilians in the besieged Tigray regional capital that there will be “no mercy” if they don’t “save themselves” before a final offensive to flush out defiant regional leaders — a threat that Human Rights Watch on Sunday said could violate international law.“From now on, the fighting will be a tank battle,” spokesman Col. Dejene Tsegaye said late Saturday, asserting that the army was marching on the Tigray capital, Mekele, and would encircle it with tanks. “Our people in Mekele should be notified that they should protect themselves from heavy artillery.”He accused the Tigray leaders of hiding among the population of the city of roughly a half-million people and warned civilians to “steer away” from them.But “treating a whole city as a military target would not only unlawful, it could also be considered a form of collective punishment,” Human Rights Watch researcher Laetitia Bader tweeted Sunday.“In other words, war crimes,” former US national security adviser Susan Rice tweeted.Ethiopia’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, in a new statement is giving the leaders of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front 72 hours to surrender, saying that “you are at a point of no return.” He accused the TPLF leaders of using religious sites, hotels, schools “and even cemeteries” as hideouts and using Mekele residents as human shields.For days, Abiy’s government has asserted it was marching to Mekele in a final push to end the deadly conflict that erupted on Nov. 4 between the federal government and the heavily armed Tigray regional government. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia’s ruling coalition for a quarter century before Abiy took office and introduced dramatic political reforms and sidelined TPLF leaders.Now, each side regards each other as illegal, complicating international pleas for dialogue amid worries that one of Africa’s most powerful and populous nations could fracture and destabilize the strategic Horn of Africa.With communications and transport to the Tigray region almost completely severed, it’s difficult to verify the warring sides’ claims.And Ethiopia’s government has expelled an analyst with the International Crisis Group, William Davison. The government hasn’t given a formal reason, the organization said, but “ultimately, there is little doubt that the reason for his deportation relates to the current tense situation in the country and the authorities’ increasing sensitivity to points of view that do not hew to its line.”It added: “It is noteworthy that on the same day Mr. Davison was expelled, authorities also issued warning letters to the news agency Reuters’ Ethiopia correspondent and to the BBC and Deutsche Welle stations.”Meanwhile, a vast humanitarian crisis is unfolding, with the United Nations saying about 2 million people in Tigray urgently need help as food, fuel, medical and other supplies run desperately short.Two refugee crises are growing. Over 35,000 Ethiopians have fled into a remote area of Sudan, where local communities and humanitarians have struggled to feed and accommodate them. And inside the Tigray region, the fighting has come close to camps that are home to nearly 100,000 refugees from Eritrea. Some of the Eritreans have now fled a second time, into Sudan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopia-warns-civilians-of-no-mercy-in-tigray-offensive/story-7CloCyWbgq6BhxClSUyngN.html

23-11-2020||World||US Navy admiral makes unannounced visit to Taiwan, sources say||A two-star Navy admiral overseeing US military intelligence in the Asia-Pacific region has made an unannounced visit to Taiwan, two sources told Reuters on Sunday, in a high-level trip that could vex China.The sources, who include a Taiwanese official familiar with the situation, said the official was Rear Admiral Michael Studeman. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.According to the Navy’s website, Studeman is director of the J2, which oversees intelligence, at the US military’s Indo-Pacific Command.The Pentagon declined comment. Taiwan’s foreign ministry confirmed on Sunday that a US official had arrived in Taiwan but declined to provide details, saying the trip had not been made public.China, which claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, reacted with fury when US Health Secretary Alex Azar came to Taipei in August, followed by US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach in September, sending fighter jets near the island each time.The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan, including with new arms sales, alarming China.It was not immediately clear whether Studeman’s visit would be seen as an escalation by Beijing. Still, he could be one of the most high-ranking US military officers known to have visited Taipei in recent years.Douglas Paal, a former head of the US representative office in Taiwan who is now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: “If it is Indopacom J2 Studeman, I know of no precedent for such a visit.”But Randall Schriver, a former assistant secretary of defense for Asia during the Trump administration, said Trump’s Pentagon had been quietly sending one-star flag officers to Taiwan on a routine basis.He noted that the United States and Taiwan had close intelligence exchanges on the threat from China’s military.Bonnie Glaser, a regional security expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said it would not be unprecedented for a US flag officer to visit Taipei.Unmarked aircraftTaiwan’s United Daily News published pictures of an unmarked private jet, which it identified as being a US military aircraft, arriving at Taipei’s downtown Songshan airport, and what appeared to be officials waiting at its VIP terminal.Data on the flight-tracking website planefinder.net showed a private flight arriving from Hawaii - home to the headquarters of the Indo-Pacific Command - into Songshan airport late Sunday afternoon, shortly before the United Daily News published the pictures on its website.In a brief statement, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said there were frequent interactions with the United States and that “we welcome the visit of the US official.”“But as this itinerary has not been made public, based on mutual trust between Taiwan and the United States, the Foreign Ministry has no further explanation or comment,” it added.However, it said in a separate statement that Taiwan media reports that a delegation led by CIA chief Gina Haspel had arrived in Taiwan were untrue, and that Haspel had no plans to come.The de facto US embassy in Taipei declined to comment.The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is the democratic island’s most important international backer and supplier of arms.Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said last week the cabinet-level head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, will visit Taiwan. US media said that trip is likely next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-admiral-makes-unannounced-visit-to-taiwan-sources-say/story-7aopw2ppW0YvhfXLbXquWN.html

23-11-2020||World||G-20 summit ends with support for Covid-19 vaccines for all||Leaders of the world’s most powerful nations wrapped up the Group of 20 summit on Sunday, vowing to spare no effort to protect lives and ensure affordable access to Covid-19 vaccines for all people.The two-day summit of heads of state was held virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed at least 1.38 million people globally, with the world’s highest death tolls recorded in seven of the G-20 countries. The virus has wiped out hundreds of millions of jobs globally and plunged millions into extreme poverty.The virus “revealed vulnerabilities in our preparedness and response and underscored our common challenges,” the G-20 said in a final statement that focused heavily on battling the coronavirus, enhancing environmental protections and supporting the global economy.The group vowed “to spare no effort to protect lives.”The G-20, which includes the US, India, China, the U.K., France, Germany, Japan and others, also stressed the importance of global access to Covid-19 vaccines, drugs and tests.“We will spare no effort to ensure their affordable and equitable access for all people, consistent with members’ commitments to incentivize innovation,” the statement said.The G-20 expressed support for efforts like COVAX, an international initiative to distribute Covid-19 vaccines to countries worldwide. The US, however, has declined to join under President Donald Trump.German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters Sunday in Berlin after the virtual summit that Germany had given financial support to the COVAX initiative, but that more money was needed.The G-20 statement did not directly address an urgent appeal by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who said $28 billion in additional investment is needed for mass manufacturing, procurement and delivery of new Covid-19 vaccines around the world, including $4 billion immediately.There is also concern that countries such as Britain, the US, France and Germany have directly negotiated deals with pharmaceutical companies, meaning that the vast majority of the world’s vaccine supply next year is already reserved.“Fortunately, there’s now hope for vaccines,” Merkel said, adding that “it is important that not only Europe secures vaccines, as the European Union is doing now, but ... that it is important for the entire world” to have access to vaccines.She said it is important that COVAX starts negotiating with the producers of potential vaccines based on the money it already has, but that she was somewhat worried those negotiations had not happened yet.Saudi Arabia’s King Salman rounded out the summit, saying the G-20′s final statement “succeeded in sending out a message of hope and reassurance to our citizens and all people around the world.”“This is what the world has been expecting from us. This achievement today is a culmination of our joint efforts throughout this challenge-fraught year,” the Saudi monarch said.Saudi Arabia presided over the G-20 this year and was host of the virtual summit, which was originally intended to be held in-person in Riyadh before the pandemic. During the Saudi king’s speech, small video squares showed the leaders of Germany, France, the U.K., Canada, South Korea, China, India and South Africa watching the final remarks. Trump participated in the summit with prerecorded speeches, but was not in attendance for the virtual summit’s conclusion.It appeared all G-20 countries agreed to the full content of the final statement, with the exception of Turkey, which was due to give a press conference later Sunday explaining further.Delegates from the G-20 had convened virtually throughout the year to discuss the coronavirus, agreeing to suspend debt payments for the world’s poorest nations until mid-2021 to allow those countries to focus their spending on health care and social support programs. The G-20 called on private lenders to join the effort.Already, 46 countries have requested to benefit from the debt suspension initiative, amounting to $5.7 billion in debt referral. The U.N. secretary general, however, has called on the G-20 to extend debt repayments through the end of 2021 and expand the scope to middle-income countries in need.G-20 countries are allowing low-income countries with unsustainable debts to apply for permanent debt relief on a case-by-case basis.In final remarks at the summit, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte laid out his country’s objectives for the G-20 next year as it assumes the rotating presidency from Saudi Arabia.“The existential threat, represented by climate change, soil degradation and by the decline of global biodiversity, has brought us to a crossroads, which will determine if we are able to save our planet and construct a sustainable future,” Conte said.Conte said the pandemic will continue to be at the top of the group’s agenda and reiterated his support for universal access to vaccines.___Associated Press writers Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin and Frances D’Emilio in Rome contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g-20-summit-ends-with-support-for-covid-19-vaccines-for-all/story-b2uLNWl89rY90eG52PKs3I.html
23-11-2020||World||US formally withdraws from Open Skies Treaty: All you need to know about decades-old treaty||The United States formally withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty on Sunday, six months after President Donald Trump announced the decision. The State Department has declared that the United States is no longer a party to the Treaty on Open Skies, a decades-old treaty that permits member countries to conduct short-notice, unarmed, reconnaissance flights over other countries to collect data on military forces and activities.The treaty was first pitched way back in 1955 by the then US president Dwight Eisenhower, proposing that the United States and the erstwhile Soviet Union would allow reconnaissance flights over each other’s territory. Moscow rejected the proposal, saying the initiative would be used for extensive spying. George H.W. Bush revived the idea in 1989 and negotiations between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact started in February 1990.The treaty was finally signed in 1992 but came into force on January 1, 2002. Currently, 34 states are party to the treaty while Kyrgyzstan has signed but not ratified it. On May 21, 2020, the State Department said that the Trump administration may reconsider the withdrawal if Russia returns to “full compliance with the Treaty.”Also Read | Vladimir Putin says he’s not ready to recognize Joe Biden as US PresidentSecretary of State Mike Pompeo had accused Russia of “flagrantly and continuously” violating the Treaty in various ways for years. The top American diplomat had said in a statement that Russia has been a serial violator of many of its arms control obligations and commitments and the violations are not limited to the Treaty on Open Skies. Pompeo had claimed that instead of using the treaty as a mechanism for improving trust and confidence through military transparency, Russia weaponised the treaty by making it into “a tool of intimidation and threat.” He accused Kremlin of targeting critical infrastructure in the United States and Europe with “precision-guided conventional munitions” by using using the Open Skies imagery.“After careful consideration, including input from Allies and key partners, it has become abundantly clear that it is no longer in America’s interest to remain a party to the Treaty on Open Skies,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-formally-withdraws-from-open-skies-treaty-all-you-need-to-know-about-decades-old-treaty/story-0Lz5VM8PMGz4D0Cotmm9PO.html
