It is also meaningful for the environment, national security, living standards, energy and international cooperation.”China will “implement hydropower exploitation in the downstream of the Yarlung Zangbo river,” Yan said, adding that the plan put forward in the proposals for formulating the country’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) and its long-term goals through 2035 made by the CPC’s Central Committee.According to Yan, the 60 million kWh hydropower exploitation at the downstream of the Yarlung Zangbo river could provide 300 billion kWh of clean, renewable and zero-carbon electricity annually.“The project will play a significant role in realising China’s goal of reaching a carbon emissions peak before 2030 and carbon neutrality in 2060,” Yan said.“Speculations about China planning to build a ‘super hydropower station’ in Medog county, where the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon is located, have circulated for years. Medog, with a population of about 14,000, was China’s last county to be connected to the outside world with a highway,” the Global Times report said.Academics have long pointed out China’s strategic advantage over India in terms of international transboundary rivers.“China has claimed express ownership over Tibet’s waters, making it an upstream controller of seven of South Asia’s mightiest rivers – the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Irrawaddy, Salween, Yangtze, and Mekong. These rivers flow into Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, and form the largest river run-off from any single location…Nearly half that water, 48%, runs directly into India,” a Lowy Institute report said in July this year in the backdrop of the ongoing India-China border friction in eastern Ladakh.India and China have a water data sharing agreement.In 2017, China had stopped sharing data soon after the 73-day long stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops at Doklam near the Sikkim border over Chinese military’s plans to build a road close to India’s Chicken Neck corridor connecting North-Eastern states.In 2018, a MoU was inked between China’s Ministry of Water Resources and India’s Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation on sharing hydrological information of the Brahmaputra river in flood season by China to India.The agreement enables China to provide hydrological data in flood season from May 15 to October 15 every year. It also enables the Chinese side to provide hydrological data if water level exceeds mutually agreed level during non-flood season.Beijing also shares data on rivers flowing into north India. But the apprehension that China could “weaponise” cross-border rivers remains.“For India, the one domain in which China’s status as the “upper riparian” provides an almost insurmountable challenge is in ensuring shared access to transboundary rivers. And as the recent clashes on the Sino-Indian border have made clear, India needs to assess how China might “weaponise” its advantage over those countries downstream. Control over these rivers effectively gives China a chokehold on India’s economy,” the July Lowy report added.The Global Times report quoted an expert saying that dams on cross-border projects cannot be developed without the cooperation between upstream and downstream countries.“Hydropower projects on cross-border rivers cannot be developed without communication and cooperation between upstream and downstream countries,” Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the tabloid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-build-a-super-dam-on-its-part-of-brahmaputra-river/story-i4No1OJ9JuxMEJEwCtNrTO.html

29-11-2020||World||Dr Fauci warns Americans to brace for ‘surge upon surge’ of coronavirus||Americans should brace for a “surge upon a surge” in the coronavirus as millions of travelers return home after the Thanksgiving holiday, US government scientist Anthony Fauci said Sunday.“There almost certainly is going to be an uptick because of what has happened with the travel,” Fauci told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We may see a surge upon a surge” in two or three weeks, he added. “We don’t want to frighten people, but that’s the reality.”This was an ominous trend, Fauci added, with the Christmas holidays and more year-end travel looming, he said.The virus is blamed for more than 266,000 deaths in the US, the hardest-hit country in the world, with cooler weather bringing daily death figures nearing the worst levels of April.- Pre-positioned vaccine -Fauci’s comments came as US news media reported that first shipments of the Pfizer vaccine against Covid-19 -- one of the first to claim high effectiveness, along with a Moderna product -- had arrived in the United States from a Pfizer lab in Belgium.Pfizer was using charter flights to pre-position vaccine for quick distribution once it receives US approval -- expected as early as December 10 -- the Wall Street Journal and other media reported.The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both said to be safe and perhaps 95 percent effective, have introduced a much-needed glimmer of hope after months of gloomy news.“This puts the end to the pandemic. This is the way we get out of the pandemic. The light is at the end of the tunnel,” Admiral Brett Giroir, the US official overseeing coronavirus testing, told CNN.But like Fauci he expressed grave concerns about the months immediately ahead.“Our hospitalizations are peaking right now at about 95,000,” Giroir said. “About 20 percent of all people in the hospital have Covid, so this is a really dangerous time.”Until large numbers of Americans have been vaccinated -- Giroir said half the eligible population might be by March -- much will depend on people taking the recommended precautions, including mask-wearing and distancing, he and Fauci said.Giroir said it might take until the second or third quarter of next year for most Americans to be vaccinated, but that substantial benefits would accrue much sooner.By first vaccinating those at highest risk, he said, “we can absolutely get 80 percent of the benefit of the vaccine by only immunizing a few percent of the population.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-warns-americans-to-brace-for-surge-upon-surge-of-coronavirus/story-DEOqmQUMUVWP9KoB1kARAN.html
29-11-2020||World||‘I wasn’t there’: Man charged in family’s death near Disney||A Connecticut physical therapist charged with killing his wife and three children at their Florida home told his sister in a phone call from jail that he couldn’t have stopped his family from being slain — because he wasn’t around.“I couldn’t stop this because I wasn’t there,” Anthony Todt told his sister Chrissy Caplet in recordings of one of two phone calls obtained by The Day of New London, Connecticut.Authorities allege that Todt, who worked in Connecticut and spent weekends with his family in Florida, killed his wife and three children, as well as the family dog. The decomposing bodies were discovered Jan. 13, a Monday, in the family’s home in Celebration, a planned community near Walt Disney World and developed by the Walt Disney Co.Todt, 45, claimed in a June 19 letter to his father obtained by the Orlando Sentinel that his wife, Megan, had drugged the children and then stabbed and suffocated them. Todt wrote that his wife then drank a bottle of Benadryl and stabbed herself in the abdomen.He made similar claims in the two phone calls to his sister in March and April, suggesting that Megan Todt had tried to kill the children before. “There were multiple attempts, just so you know, multiple attempts in the last ... over a time frame, there’s been attempts,” Todt said.FBI agents found Todt inside the home in Celebration with the bodies of his family when they arrived to arrest him on a warrant stemming from a health care fraud investigation in Connecticut.Investigators with the Osceola County Sheriff’s Office said Todt confessed at the time of his arrest to killing Megan, 42; their children, Alek, 13, Tyler, 11, and Zoe, 4; and the dog, Breezy.Prosecutors have said they intend to seek the death penalty for Todt, who has been indicted on four counts of first-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty.Defense attorneys have not spoken publicly about Todt’s claim that his wife was the real killer. An email seeking comment was sent to Orange-Osceola public defender Robert Wesley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-wasn-t-there-man-charged-in-family-s-death-near-disney/story-tZmCkamub18fH4iKQYgLZJ.html
29-11-2020||World||Muslims in Nepal hold protest demanding justice for China’s Uyghur||Muslims in Nepal on Sunday organised a protest against atrocities on Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang province of China.The protesters raised voice against the demolition of thousands of mosques in Xinjiang and the treatment being meted out to them by the Chinese government.Muslims in Pokhara also joined the international community in expressing their views on the gruesome human rights violations against Uyghur Muslims.The Muslim Kalyankari Samaj held a protest in Pokhara highlighting the severe anxiety and anger among local Muslims against Uyghur in China.The community leaders said that they would keep raising their concern against atrocities on Uyghurs in the future as well.Similar protests were held in Nepal a few days ago.For the last six years, millions of East Turkistan people, mostly of Muslim faith, have been held in concentration camps, prisons, and slave labour camps.According to survivors’ accounts, they are being tortured, killed for their organs, raped, sterilised and executed.Classified documents known as the China Cables, accessed last year by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, threw light on how the Chinese government uses technology to control Uyghur Muslims worldwide.However, China regularly denies such mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training. People in the internment camps have described being subjected to forced political indoctrination, torture, beatings, and denial of food and medicine, and say they have been prohibited from practising their religion or speaking their language.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/muslims-in-nepal-hold-protest-demanding-justice-for-china-s-uyghur/story-1Z21TegnpZYES8KK4DHpSL.html
29-11-2020||World||UK poised to be first to clear Pfizer-BioNTech Covid vaccine||The UK is poised to become the first country to approve Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine, ahead of a long line of countries waiting for protection from the coronavirus.Clearance is possible as soon as early next week, according to a person familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified because the process is confidential.The UK had long signaled it would move fast on any promising vaccine candidate, and British doctors have been put on standby for a possible rollout before Christmas. Russia and China have cleared vaccines for general use, but they’re unlikely to be adopted in the US and Europe.The British government last week invoked a special rule allowing its drug regulator to bypass the European Union counterpart as the country prepares for the Brexit transition period to conclude at the end of this year. And the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has started its own accelerated review.“We hope, subject to the regulatory approvals, to be in a position to be able to have rolled out the vaccine sufficiently by, say, the spring to enable us to have a big change in the way we approach things,” UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show Sunday. Raab said he hoped that vaccine roll-out could begin “before Christmas,” with life returning to something “akin to normal” by spring 2021.Click here for complete coverage of the coronavirus pandemicEarlier this week, the MHRA said it had the data it needed to assess whether the Pfizer vaccine meets required standards and would “make a decision in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review.” The shot was 95% effective in a clinical trial of almost 44,000 people, with no significant safety problems so far.An MHRA spokesperson declined to comment. Pfizer said in a statement that it doesn’t speculate on how long the review process will last or how it will end. A BioNTech representative didn’t immediately have a comment.The first injections could take place from December 7, the Financial Times reported earlier.The news that the UK could approve a vaccine comes as Nadhim Zahawi, a junior minister for the Department of Business, was appointed as minister overseeing the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.The UK has ordered enough doses of the two-shot Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to immunize 20 million people, though that volume almost certainly won’t be available right away. The companies also have deals to supply hundreds of millions of shots to Europe, the US, Japan and elsewhere.The Pfizer-BioNTech shot has raced to the head of the line after delays to trials of a vaccine from AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford, which has also shown some promising signs in preliminary results from broad studies.Another one, from Moderna Inc., has also demonstrated effectiveness in late-stage trials. The UK government has secured another 2 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine, talking its total to 7 million.Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London and a government adviser, said he would be “surprised” if a vaccine becomes available as soon as next week.“I know that the regulators are looking very hard and they’re doing everything they can to scrutinize all the data,” Openshaw told the Marr show. “I wouldn’t be too surprised if an announcement would be made within the next two weeks, possibly even as early as next week, but we’ll have to wait and see.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-poised-to-be-first-to-clear-pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine/story-dT9bvzqliIp8U1TTUFl7ML.html
29-11-2020||World||Indonesian volcano erupts, forcing residents to flee||A volcano in Indonesia’s East Nusa Tenggara province erupted on Sunday, spewing ash and smoke as high as four kilometers into the sky and forcing more than 2,700 residents to seek refuge, the country’s disaster mitigation agency said.Indonesia has nearly 130 active volcanoes, more than any other country, and while many show high levels of activity it can be weeks or even months before an eruption.Raditya Jati, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement that the eruption from the Mt. Ile Lewotolok volcano, about 2,600 kilometers east of Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta, had caused panic among those living nearby.About 2,780 people from 26 villages had sought refuge, although no casualties have so far been reported, Jati said.Muhammad Ilham, a 17-year-old who witnessed the eruption, told Reuters that resident nearby were “panicked and they’re still looking for refuge and in need of money right now”.Indonesia’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center said on its website that the area near the volcano is likely to be inundated with “hot clouds, lava stream, lava avalanche, and poisonous gas”.Kasbani, the head of the center, told Reuters that the status of the volcano was raised to the second-highest level on Indonesia’s four-tier alert system due to “increasing threats”.There are only three other volcanoes with this level, the agency said. These include the Merapi volcano on the island of Java and Sinabung on Sumatra, which erupted this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-volcano-erupts-forcing-residents-to-flee/story-Psl5YnjFr3bYLa3o0LomXN.html
29-11-2020||World||Faith takes the forefront as Georgia Senate runoffs heat up||Bishop Reginald Jackson stepped to the microphone at a drive-in rally outside a church in southwest Atlanta as his voice carried over a loudspeaker and the radio to people gathered in, around and on top of cars that filled the parking lot.“Let’s keep Georgia blue,” Jackson said. “Let’s elect Jon Ossoff, Raphael Warnock to the United States Senate.” The presiding bishop of more than 400 African Methodist Episcopal churches in Georgia added a pastoral flourish as horns honked and supporters cheered: “If I have a witness, somebody say amen!” As Georgia becomes the nation’s political hotspot this winter before twin runoff elections January 5 that will determine control of the Senate, faith-based organizing is heating up.Conservative Christians are rallying behind Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, while Black churches and liberal-leaning Jewish groups are backing Democratic challengers Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. The Democrats’ fates are seen as intertwined in a state that this year turned blue in the presidential election for the first time since 1992 by a razor-thin margin.“These runoffs are critically important,” Jackson said. “We want to make sure there is no decrease in turnout.” Across Georgia, the African Methodist Episcopal Church is implementing a program designed to ensure its members, and Black voters overall, cast ballots in the runoff — focusing on votes by mail and early in-person voting. Pastors at each church remind tens of thousands of congregants every week to apply for an absentee ballot and of early voting dates, Jackson said in an interview. Each local church also follows up with congregants to make sure they have a plan to vote.The New Georgia Project, a nonpartisan voter mobilization group founded by Democrat Stacey Abrams, who ran for governor in 2018, is also preparing to tap the influence of faith communities in stoking turnout.Rev. Billy Honor, director of faith organizing at the group, said the conservative Christian Faith & Freedom Coalition — founded by former Georgia GOP chairman Ralph Reed — has long positioned Georgia “as the home of evangelical fundamentalist types when it comes to the political space.” “But the truth is, for a very long time, there has been an active, effective movement of progressive-minded, justice-centered clergy” who have worked in the state on voting rights, health care and other issues, Honor added. He said Warnock was part of that work before his candidacy. Warnock is senior pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church, the congregation led by the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.Meanwhile, Loeffler and Perdue can expect to benefit from a conservative Christian base that has long boosted the state’s Republicans. Faith & Freedom made Georgia one of its top three spending targets in a USD 50 million get-out-the-vote program during the general election and plans increased organizing for the runoffs.The reach of “the evangelical vote in Georgia is very large and very strong,” Timothy Head, the group’s executive director, said in an interview.Head noted that while President Donald Trump kept a strong hold on white evangelical voters this year, Perdue out-performed Trump in Georgia during the general election. President-elect Joe Biden may have won over some evangelicals by contrasting his character with that of Trump, Head said, but he argued that the same sort of case would be harder for Democrats to make against Loeffler and Perdue.Another faith-focused conservative group, the legislative affiliate of the Family Research Council, is holding trainings and pastor briefings before the runoffs. The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, whose president advised Trump’s reelection campaign on Catholic outreach, has announced a USD 4.1 million plan to boost Loeffler and Perdue through a partner political action committee.Religious issues already have become a campaign flashpoint in the runoff. The GOP has resurfaced excerpts from past Warnock sermons to assail him as insufficiently supportive of the military as well as anti-Israel. The Democrat signed a letter last year comparing Israel’s policy toward Palestinians to “previous oppressive regimes” and criticised it in a 2018 sermon, while also calling for a two-state solution in the region.Warnock pushed back in a recently released television ad, saying the attacks are “trying to scare people by taking things I’ve said out of context from over 25 years of being a pastor.” One group criticizing Warnock as too left-leaning on Israel, the Republican Jewish Coalition, is also mobilizing on behalf of the GOP incumbents.Jewish Democrats in Georgia predicted that the GOP attack on Warnock’s Israel record would fall flat, citing his record of friendship with the Jewish community through his pulpit at Ebenezer.Sherry Frank, president of the Atlanta section of the National Council of Jewish Women, said she sees “no doubt in the Jewish community about (Warnock’s) stance on Israel and anti-Semitism.” Frank’s group is conducting nonpartisan voter turnout work for the runoffs.Georgia’s Jewish Democrats also see, in Ossoff and Warnock, candidates whose joint push for the Senate harkens back to a tradition of Black and Jewish leaders working together during the civil rights movement. Warnock has a bond with a prominent Atlanta rabbi whose predecessor at the synagogue was close with King.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faith-takes-the-forefront-as-georgia-senate-runoffs-heat-up/story-7MiHdvMoEVk3TCC9c7fNzL.html

Later a military convoy will escort Kaavan to Islamabad’s airport from where he will embark on a roughly 10-hour flight to Cambodia in the early hours of Monday morning on a former Russian cargo plane. Kaavan’s handlers are taking more than 200 kilograms of food including bananas and melons for him to munch on during the journey, according to Four Paws.Cher has been filming a documentary with the Smithsonian Channel covering the rescue, which is being facilitated by her animal welfare organisation Free the Wild. “I found out about Kaavan from the people on my Twitter,” said Cher, according to a statement from the Smithsonian Channel. “I thought how can I fix this? How can I save an elephant who’s been shackled to a shed for 17 years and who is a thousand miles away? This is Free The Wild’s first big rescue and I am so proud.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/d-day-for-pakistan-s-lonely-elephant-as-handlers-prepare-airlift-to-cambodia/story-xJvhP3lq5H5IaXMCU3QPBP.html

Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz workers led a rally in Multan and also entered the stadium after it was broken into, the media outlet reported.“The rally will be held in Qila Qasim Bagh (at every cost). Today all the barriers of the police and administration have been broken down. After storming the gates, we have taken control of the stadium,” PPP leader Musa Gilani said.Geo News further reported that the police have registered a case against 70 named and more than 300 unnamed party workers for breaking off locks and forcing their way into the stadium at the Multan’s Lohari Gate police station.The police also filed a case against caterers who had agreed to provide services to the organisers of the November 30 rally.PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari issued a warning to the federal government “to desist from carrying out a crackdown” against PPP workers in Multan “otherwise there will be protests in every nook and corner of the country,” as per a party statement.The PPP chairman further slammed the government saying that the PTI government is initiating a crackdown against party workers to “create hurdles” in the PPP’s Foundation Day and the PDM rally.“Misuse of the state machinery against democratic workers will add fuel to the fire and every responsibility of the situation thereafter would lie on the PTI regime,” read the statement.Bilawal said that the Foundation Day rally will be held “anyhow” and PPP and other PDM parties “won’t be cowed down by the highhandedness of the regime”.Eleven political parties have joined hands to form a new multi-party alliance under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement against the government of Imran Khan.Baffled by protests against his government, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said he would not give permission to the political parties to hold anti-government rallies in Multan and other cities due to spread of Covid-19.The Prime Minister had also criticised the opposition for boycotting a meeting of the parliamentary committee on the country’s worsening COVID-19 situation and threatened to take legal action against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ppp-leader-ali-qasim-gilani-30-others-arrested-ahead-of-pakistan-democratic-movement-s-rally/story-ZbqBewNMMVFtCTmuQ9xaiJ.html

Despite missing several self-imposed deadlines, the negotiations have failed to bridge differences on competition policy and the distribution of fishing rights.But Britain’s transitional EU exit agreement - during which the bloc’s rules continue to apply - expires on Dec. 31, and Britain says it will not seek any extension. A deal would have to be ratified by both sides, leaving little time for new delay.“The bottom line is... in the ordinary course of things we need to get a deal done over the next week or maybe another couple of days beyond that,” Raab told Times Radio in a separate interview.Earlier, he had signalled some progress on the ‘level playing field’ provisions which look to ensure fair competition between Britain and the EU, and said fishing remained the most difficult issue to solve.Despite accounting for 0.1% of the British economy, fishing rights have become a totemic issue for both sides. Britain has so far rejected EU proposals and remains adamant that as an independent nation it must have full control of its waters.“The EU have just got to recognise the point of principle here,” Raab told Times Radio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-expects-very-significant-week-for-brexit-talks-as-clock-ticks-down/story-XGkJHfgQGmpkGXKrOdtozO.html
29-11-2020||World||US Supreme Court weighs Trump bid to bar illegal immigrants from census totals||The Supreme Court on Monday is set to take up President Donald Trump’s unprecedented and contentious effort to exclude illegal immigrants from the population totals used to allocate US House of Representatives districts to states.The challengers to Trump’s July directive include various states led by New York, cities, counties and immigrant rights groups. They have argued that the Republican president’s move could leave several million people uncounted and cause California, Texas and New Jersey to lose House seats, which are based on a state’s population count in the decennial census. The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority including three justices appointed by Trump, is scheduled to hear an 80-minute oral argument by teleconference.Trump lost his bid for re-election on Nov. 3. This case focuses on one of several policy moves his administration is rushing to complete before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.The census in mandated by the US Constitution. The challengers argued that Trump is prohibited by the Constitution’s text from excluding illegal immigrants from the population count. The Constitution requires that the apportionment of House seats be based upon the “whole number of persons in each state.” The challengers said Trump’s plan, undertaken as part of the government’s responsibility to administer the 2020 census, also violates a federal law called the Census Act that outlines how a census must be conducted. They said Trump’s plan would weaken the political power of states with larger numbers of illegal immigrants, including heavily Democratic California, by undercounting their true populations and depriving them of House seats. If California loses House districts, that likely would mean Democrats lose House seats, benefiting Trump’s fellow Republicans. Read more | Donald Trump says he will leave office if Joe Biden’s victory confirmedThere are an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally. Until now, the government’s practice was to count all people regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. “That’s what everyone has always thought,” said Dale Ho, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents immigrant groups in the case. Ho said he is optimistic the court’s conservatives, who often tout the importance of interpreting laws as written, would view this one as a “rather easy case.”Trump’s lawyers argued in court papers that the president acted within his authority and that the challengers lacked the necessary legal standing to bring the case. Trump’s administration “has virtually unfettered discretion as to what data will be used in enumerating individual persons in each state for purposes of the decennial census and apportionment,” Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall wrote.The court is deciding the case on a expedited schedule, with a ruling due before the end of the year. That would make it difficult for the incoming Biden administration to revisit Trump’s plan if it is upheld.Trump’s hardline stance toward immigration has been a hallmark of his presidency.The Supreme Court last year ruled 5-4 against Trump’s effort to add a citizenship question to the census. Critics said the question was intended to frighten immigrants from taking part in the population count and artificially reduce population numbers in heavily Democratic areas, also to benefit Republicans. Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberal justices in that ruling. But the addition of Trump’s third appointee Amy Coney Barrett to the court changes its dynamics, as seen in action by the justices on Wednesday in a case in which they backed Christian and Jewish houses of worship that challenged New York state’s latest restrictions in novel coronavirus hot spots.Roberts dissented along with the court’s three liberals but Barrett’s vote in favor of the religious groups proved decisive.A three-judge panel in New York ruled against the administration in September in the current case and the justices agreed to take up the appeal on Oct. 16. Federal courts in California and Maryland have reached the same conclusion in other cases though one court in Washington ruled for Trump. By statute, the president is due to send Congress a report in early January with the population of each of the states and their entitled number of House districts. Once states are allocated their districts, they themselves draw the boundaries for the districts, which will be used first in the 2022 congressional elections. The number of House seats for each state also determines how many votes that state gets in the Electoral College, the system used to determine the winner of presidential elections. In a close election, one or two electoral votes could swing the outcome.The census itself does not gather data on a person’s citizenship or immigration status. Trump’s administration would base its numbers on data gathered elsewhere. The US Census Bureau, a spokesman said, “will make public the methods used to provide state-level counts once we have them finalized.”Thomas Wolf, a lawyer at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, said it is not yet clear if the administration will even be able to come up with usable numbers.“This is not the way a transparent constitutional democracy is supposed to be run,” Wolf added.Ilya Somin, a professor at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School in Virginia who filed a brief opposing Trump, said although the challengers have a strong case, one wrinkle could be that some conservative justices embrace a broad view of presidential powers.“We can’t be too definitive about what the justices will do with it,” Somin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-weighs-trump-bid-to-bar-illegal-immigrants-from-census-totals/story-tVkA5cycRxKRJsTZ6P0EJO.html

29-11-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson defends tier-based lockdown in letter to rebel colleagues||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged his Conservative Party lawmakers to back the government’s tier-based Covid-19 lockdown in a Parliament vote in a letter stressing that there “a sunset” clause – or expiry date – of February 3 on the latest restrictions.In an attempt to curb a growing rebellion within his own ranks against the new measures which face a House of Commons vote next Tuesday, Johnson wrote on Saturday evening that the tiers will be reviewed every two weeks, and areas can move down the tiers from mid-December.“Regulations have a sunset of 3 February. After the fourth fortnightly review (27 January), Parliament will have another vote on the tiered approach, determining whether the measures stay in place until the end of March,” he wrote.In his attempt to placate angry MPs opposed to further lockdowns, he also committed to publish more data and outline what circumstances need to change for an area to move down a tier, as well analysis of the health, economic and social impacts of the measures taken to suppress coronavirus.Most of England’s population is set to fall under the two toughest tiers when the second national lockdown ends on December 2. Around 32 million people – covering 57.3 per cent of England and including London – will fall into Tier 2 or high alert level which means the rule of six applies with up to six members of different households allowed to meet outdoors.Read more | Covid-19 hit UK immigration, but Indians among top to get visasHospitality venues are allowed to open but operate under these strict rules, with dining indoors restricted to single households and support bubbles and alcohol sale permitted only with a substantial meal.Besides, some 23.3 million people – or 41.5 per cent of the population – are going to be placed in the highest alert level of Tier 3, which prohibits any mixing of households and hospitality venues allowed to open only for takeaways. Only three regions of the Isle of Wight, Cornwall, and the Isles of Scilly will be under the lightest Tier 1 controls where the rule of six applies overall and most venues are allowed to function near normally.The further tough measures after four weeks of a stay-at-home lockdown has triggered a backlash among Johnson’s own Tory MPs and the changes could now face a fight in Parliament after the Opposition Labour Party remains undecided and may abstain in the vote on Tuesday. The Cabinet has been rallying around to try and ensure the latest measures to curb the spread of coronavirus infections clears the Commons hurdle.“There’s a risk of that if we don’t get the balance right,” said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, when asked if the government fears a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said MPs needed to “take responsibility for difficult decisions” because there is a risk of the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) being overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases over the winter months.However, one of the backbench Tory MPs, Tobias Ellwood, pointed out that all seven Nightingale hospitals, the make-shift units built during the first wave of the pandemic, lie “largely empty”, adding that military medical staff could help run them.Meanwhile, Tory MP Steve Baker who is leading the rebellion with the Covid Recovery Group (CRG) of backbenchers said they would be “glad to share in the burden of decision” as long the “information necessary to show the government’s restrictions will do more good than harm” is offered in full.“It is a modest request,” he said.On Saturday, a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total death toll from the virus to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours.Meanwhile, the UK government appointed a new minister to specifically oversee the rollout of any Covid-19 vaccine that becomes available after clearing all regulatory checks. Nadhim Zahawi, a minister in the department for business and industry, will now serve as a joint minister for the Department of Health and Social Care as well.“A big responsibility and a big operational challenge but absolutely committed to making sure we can roll out vaccines quickly – saving lives and livelihoods and helping us build back better,” Zahawi said in a Twitter statement.The government says it has secured a further 2 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine from US firm Moderna, which has shown to be 95 per cent effective in trials. This brings the UK’s Moderna order to seven million – enough for around 3.5 million people. Separately, the UK has placed orders for 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine, which is undergoing further trials, and 40 million doses of the jab from Pfizer and BioNTech, which has also been shown to be 95 per cent effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-defends-tier-based-lockdown-in-letter-to-rebel-colleagues/story-XG0vYe5frnpntWPFf4DdsN.html
29-11-2020||World||Pope, with new cardinals, warns church against mediocrity||Pope Francis, joined by the church’s newest cardinals in Mass on Sunday, warned against mediocrity as well as seeking out “godfathers” to promote one’s own career.Eleven of the 13 new cardinals sat near the central altar of St. Peter’s Basilica, where Francis on Saturday had bestowed upon them the red hats symbolizing they are now so-called princes of the church.Two of the new cardinals couldn’t make it to Rome because of pandemic travel complications. The freshly-minted cardinals who did come to the Vatican wore protective masks and purple vestments, as the Church began the solemn liturgical season of Advent in the run-up to Christmas.In his homily, Francis decried what he called “a dangerous kind of sleep: it is the slumber of mediocrity.” He added that Jesus “above all else detests lukewarm-ness.”Being chosen to head Vatican departments or eventually becoming pope themselves could be in any of these new cardinals’ future. Cardinals often advise popes and pick the next pontiff by conferring among themselves and then meeting in secret conclave to select one of their own to lead the Roman Catholic Church and its roughly 1.3 billion rank-and-file faithful.Francis has often warned against clericalism during his papacy, and he picked up on that theme in Sunday’s homily.“If we are awaited in Heaven, why should we be caught up with earthly concerns? Why should we be anxious about money, fame, success, all of which will fade away?” the pope said.Deviating from his prepared text, he added: “Why look for godfathers for promoting one’s career?”In one of the most shocking illustrations of clericalism’s dangers, earlier this month, an internal Vatican report concluded that bishops, cardinals and even popes across decades dismissed or downplayed reports of sexual misconduct by a U.S. churchman, Theodore McCarrick.McCarrick had risen steadily through the ranks of hierarchy, eventually holding the prestigious post of archbishop of Washington, D.C. McCarrick was stripped of his cardinal’s rank and defrocked in 2019 after an investigation substantiated allegations of sexual abuse against him.While the in-house fact-finding noted the roles of Francis and Benedict XVI, his predecessor in the papacy, in not stopping McCarrick’s abuse of his position, much of the fault was laid on John Paul II, the long-reigning pontiff who was quickly made saint after his death in 2005. John Paul appointed McCarrick to the Washington post and made him cardinal despite having commissioned an inquiry that confirmed the U.S. prelate shared his bed with seminarians.Among those raised to cardinal’s rank on Saturday by Francis was the current archbishop of Washington, Wilton Gregory, the first African-American cardinal.Francis in his homily recommended charity as the way for the Church to stay on mission.“Some people seem to think that being compassionate, helping and serving others is for losers,” Francis said, after decrying indifference.“When the Church worships God and serves our neighbor, it does not live in the night. However weak and weary, she journeys towards the Lord.”Francis also prayed that God “rouse us from the slumber of mediocrity; awaken us from the darkness of indifference.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-with-new-cardinals-warns-church-against-mediocrity/story-22jMAwIxCNnN2kFwg66MjI.html
29-11-2020||World||Iran newspaper: Strike Haifa if Israel killed scientist||An opinion piece published by a hard-line Iranian newspaper on Sunday suggested Iran should attack the Israeli port city of Haifa if Israel carried out the killing of the scientist who founded the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear program in the early 2000s.Though the hard-line Kayhan newspaper has long argued for aggressive retaliation for operations targeting Iran, Sunday’s opinion piece went further, suggesting any assault be carried out in a way that destroys facilities and “also causes heavy human casualties.”Israel, suspected of killing Iranian nuclear scientists over the past decade, has not commented on the brazen slaying of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. A military-style ambush Friday on the outskirts of Tehran reportedly saw a truck bomb explode and gunmen open fire on the scientist, killing him and a bodyguard.US intelligence agencies and UN nuclear inspectors have said the organized military nuclear program that Fakhrizadeh oversaw was disbanded in 2003, but Israeli suspicion of Tehran’s atomic program and his involvement has never ceased.Iranian officials have blamed Israel for Friday’s attack, raising the specter of renewed tensions that could engulf the region, including US troops stationed in the Persian Gulf and beyond during President Donald Trump’s remaining weeks in office.Kayhan published the piece written by Iranian analyst Sadollah Zarei, who argued Iran’s previous responses to suspected Israeli airstrikes that killed Revolutionary Guard forces in Syria did not go far enough to deter Israel. He said an assault on Haifa also needed to be greater than Iran’s ballistic missile attack against American troops in Iraq following the US drone strike in Baghdad that killed a top Iranian general in January.Striking the Israeli city of Haifa and killing a large number of people “will definitely lead to deterrence, because the United States and the Israeli regime and its agents are by no means ready to take part in a war and a military confrontation,” Zarei wrote.While Kayhan is a small circulation newspaper in Iran, its editor-in-chief Hossein Shariatmadari was appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and has been described as an adviser to him in the past.Haifa, on the Mediterranean Sea, has been threatened in the past by both Iran and one of its proxies, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.Such a strike likely would draw an immediate Israeli retaliation and spark a wider conflict across the Mideast. While Iran has never directly targeted an Israeli city militarily, it has conducted attacks targeting Israeli interests abroad in the past over the killing of its scientists, like in the case of the three Iranians recently freed in Thailand in exchange for a detained British-Australian academic.Israel also is widely believed to have its own nuclear weapons, a stockpile it neither confirms nor denies possessing.The Iranian parliament on Sunday held a closed-door hearing about Fakhrizadeh’s killing. Afterward, parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Ghalibaf said Iran’s enemies must be made to regret killing him.“The criminal enemy does not regret it except with a strong reaction,” he said in a broadcast on Iranian state radio.A public session of lawmakers saw them chant: “Death to America! Death to Israel!” They also began the review of a bill that would stop inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The nuclear watchdog has provided an unprecedented, real-time look at Iran’s civilian nuclear program following the country’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.The deal has unraveled after Trump’s unilateral 2018 withdrawal of the US from the accord. Iran’s civilian atomic program has since continued its experiments and now enriches a growing uranium stockpile up to 4.5% purity.That’s still far below weapons-grade levels of 90%, though experts warn Iran now has enough low-enriched uranium to reprocess into fuel for at least two atomic bombs if it chose to pursue them.State television broadcast images of Fakhrizadeh’s casket being flown to Mashhad, a holy Shiite city in Iran’s east home to the shrine of Imam Reza. Iranian media said Sunday that one of the scientist’s bodyguards also had died from wounds he suffered in Friday’s attack.Khamenei has called Fakhrizadeh “the country’s prominent and distinguished nuclear and defensive scientist” and has demanded the “definitive punishment” of those behind the killing, without elaborating.Fakhrizadeh headed Iran’s so-called AMAD program that Israel and the West have alleged was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency says the “structured program” ended in 2003. US intelligence agencies concurred with that assessment in a 2007 report.Israel contends Iran is still intent on developing a nuclear weapon. It argues Iran’s ballistic missile program and other research could help build a bomb if it pursued one — especially as provisions of the 2015 nuclear deal expire. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful and that it has no plans to build an atomic bomb.His killing likely complicates the plans of President-elect Joe Biden, who has said his administration will consider reentering Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. It also raises the risk of an open conflict in Trump’s final weeks in office as any retaliation could provoke an American military response, said Amos Yadlin, a one-time head of Israeli military intelligence who now serves as the director of Tel Aviv University’s Institute for National Security Studies.“I highly recommend to the officials to keep their mouths closed and not leak anything. They’ve already spoke too much,” he said, referring to cryptic remarks by Israel’s prime minister to his supporters that he could not discuss everything he did last week.“Any more evidence that will help the Iranians to decide on retaliation against Israel is a mistake,” Yadlin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-newspaper-strike-haifa-if-israel-killed-scientist/story-6WIjOYUHhKDmwlULohf5eI.html

29-11-2020||World||UK rejects latest EU fisheries offer as talks resume||Years of wrangling over Britain’s future trade relationship with the EU are set to enter what could be their final week, with Boris Johnson’s government saying there remains a significant gap on the issue of how much fish European trawlers should be allowed to catch in British waters.Michel Barnier, the EU’s lead negotiator, has proposed that the EU’s share of the catch be cut by 15% to 18%, an offer that Downing Street dismissed in a statement as “risible.”“The EU side know full well that we would never accept this,” according to a government official. “No agreement is arguably underpriced.”Access to Britain’s fishing waters has been one of three key hurdles to an agreement -- the others being a level competitive playing field, and how any agreement will be enforced. But the absence in Downing Street’s statement of any mention of these two other issues could spur expectations that a deal is within reach.A report in The Times newspaper suggested that the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is putting pressure on Barnier by sending one of her most trusted officials to the talks. Citing two unidentified UK government officials, the report said the parties should agree to the basis of a trade relationship by next weekend.Failure to reach a deal would result in extra costs for millions of consumers and businesses from December 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-rejects-latest-eu-fisheries-offer-as-talks-resume/story-jogagperD5pjy2LxMexXEL.html

Pakistan’s foreign office was the first to tweet, celebrating the customary references to Kashmir as a huge win.“The inclusion of Jammu and Kashmir dispute in the Niamey Declaration – being an important part of the CFM’s (Council of Foreign Ministers) outcome documents - is yet another manifestation of the @OIC_OCI’s consistent support to the Kashmir Cause,” Pakistan’s foreign office tweeted.DRDO ready with anti-drone system for armed forces, PM Modi to have drone killer as part of his security detailForeign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi who has had to face some embarrassing moments at home over OIC’s refusal to discuss Kashmir as a separate item followed up on Sunday morning.There has been no communique from the OIC Secretariat on the resolution passed by the 57-member body yet.Indian officials said New Delhi wouldn’t be surprised if the final OIC resolution does contain customary references to Kashmir claimed by Islamabad but underlined that it was significant that Jammu and Kashmir wasn’t discussed as a separate agenda item, something that the Imran Khan government had made a prestige issue for itself.PM Oli pulls off surprise, draws a red line for ambassador Hou YanqiPakistan has been demanding a special OIC meeting of foreign ministers on Kashmir ever since India abrogated Article 370 that extended special status to Jammu and Kashmir but has been unsuccessful. It was in this desperation to get the OIC to hold the special meeting that prompted foreign minister Qureshi to cross the line in August this year when he threatened to hold a meeting of Muslim countries outside the OIC platform that had angered Saudi Arabia.The Imran Khan government tried to persuade the OIC to let it hold a side event on Kashmir when preparations for the 27-28 November OIC foreign ministers were still underway. But Niger declined, insisting that they had taken a considered decision not to hold any side events. Niger hadn’t taken too well to Pakistan’s effort to use the OIC to settle its domestic agenda, people familiar with New Delhi’s diplomatic counter-offensive told Hindustan Times.Pak has quietly moved 26/11 attacks accused Hafiz Saeed out of jail. He is home: IntelPakistan didn’t give up and deployed Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to try convincing the Saudi leadership to intervene on its behalf.Saudi Arabia, however, miffed with Pakistan’s efforts to create a parallel forum was in no mood to relent. The Saudi leadership went a step further and advised Islamabad not to try to hijack the forum. Qureshi was told that Islamabad should not expect anything more than the customary references to Kashmir.Terrorism was the overarching theme of the two-day conference; OIC secretary-general Dr Yousef Al-Othaimeen called terrorism the most serious threat to the region and the world.Diplomats who were tracking the OIC conference said many OIC countries did indicate their displeasure at Pakistan’s refusal to curb terror and its encouragement to fundamentalists in the country, treatment of minorities and harsh blasphemy laws which the Arab nations have since relinquished. Pakistan did try to target India during the discussion on the fight against violence, extremism, terrorism and Islamophobia, but some countries did indirectly ask Islamabad to speak about allegations that it provided continuous support to the elements that designated as terrorists by the UN sanctions committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oic-cold-shoulders-pakistan-at-big-meet-imran-khan-govt-puts-up-a-brave-face/story-tRCoD1lF2cd2k3BYq1Ow2I.html
29-11-2020||World||Joe Biden’s team eyes environmental justice champion Ali for White House Council||President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team is considering recommending environmental justice champion Mustafa Santiago Ali to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality, as the incoming administration seeks to prioritize the damage pollution takes on poor and minority communities.The deliberations, part of an effort to refocus the obscure White House agency into a hub for promoting environmental justice, was described by two people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named discussing personnel recommendations.Neither Ali nor representatives of the Biden-Harris transition immediately responded to requests for comment Saturday.The CEQ serves as a kind of mission control coordinating environmental policy decisions and reviews across the federal government. It also oversees implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act.Under President Donald Trump, the agency has sought to expedite environmental permitting. But Biden has outlined plans for the agency to address environmental injustice amid a national reckoning on matters of race.In addition to Ali, another environmental justice advocate, Cecilia Martinez, is being considered to lead the agency, Bloomberg Law reported. Martinez now heads Biden’s agency review team focused on CEQ.Also Read | Joe Biden announces 3 more members in Covid-19 task forceEPA VeteranAli’s career has been intertwined with environmental justice. He spent 24 years at the Environmental Protection Agency, and helped found an office there focused on the topic. He resigned as an assistant associate administrator in 2017 as the Trump administration moved to zero out the office’s funding. Ali also served as a senior vice president for the Hip Hop Caucus, a not-for-profit group that promotes political activism among young voters.Biden has pledged to re-establish a White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council and White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council. He’s emphasized that the problems of climate change and pollution are tied to the struggle for racial equality, asserting in June that low-income communities of color can be victimized by being “in spots where the water is not clean, the air you can’t breathe.”Ali has argued that environmental justice considerations should be embedded in federal policy making, and emphasized the need to rebuild and revitalize vulnerable communities that bear the brunt of pollution. Progressive activists have lobbied Biden to nominate Ali as EPA administrator.Unequal Impact“We have some opportunities for some real wins,” Ali said in a conference call on Nov. 24 marking the 50th anniversary of the EPA. “We also have opportunities to really mitigate and minimize the impacts that happen inside the communities that are often unseen and unheard.”Ali said that the Trump administration’s work to ease environmental regulations has had unequal results. “For all these rules that have been rolled back or weakened, there have been these additional impacts that have happened to our most vulnerable communities,” he said.Any new regulations that move forward should be buttressed by a “true and full environmental justice analysis” to ensure “we’re providing the protection that’s needed,” he said.Ali, who is Black, is now a vice president at the National Wildlife Federation. He’s also the founder of Revitalization Strategies, a business focused on helping vulnerable communities thrive, according to his biography on the wildlife group’s website.Also Read | India has practically achieved pre-2020 climate action targets, says Prakash JavadekarPoor people and people of color often face higher exposure to pollutants, according to the American Lung Association.

29-11-2020||World||At least 34 killed in separate suicide bombings: Afghan officials||Afghan officials said Sunday at least 34 people were killed in two separate suicide bombings that targeted a military base and a provincial chief.In eastern Ghazni province, 31 soldiers were killed and 24 others wounded when the attacker drove a military humvee full of explosives onto an army commando base before detonating the car bomb, according to an official in Afghanistan’s national security council, who spoke anonymously because he was not permitted to speak directly to the media.The attack was also confirmed by Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian, though he did not provide details on casualties.In southern Afghanistan, a suicide car bomber targeted the convoy of a provincial council chief in Zubal, killing at least three people and wounding 12 others, including children.The provincial council chief, Attajan Haqbayat, survived the Sunday attack with minor injuries, though one of his bodyguards was among those killed, said provincial police spokesman Hikmatullah Kochai.There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attacks.The bombings come as Afghan government representatives and the Taliban hold face-to-face talks in Qatar for the first time to end the country’s decades-long war.There has been a sharp rise in violence this year and a surge of attacks by the Taliban against Afghanistan’s beleaguered security forces since the start of peace talks in September. There have also been deadly attacks this month claimed by Islamic State militants in Afghanistan, including a horrific attack on Kabul University that killed 22 people, most of them students.The U.S., meanwhile, plans to withdraw another estimated 2,500 troops before the middle of January, leaving about 2,000 soldiers in Afghanistan as part of America’s longest war. Afghan officials, however, have expressed concerns that a rapid reduction in American troops could strengthen the negotiating hand of the Taliban.The United States has been pressing in recent weeks for a reduction in violence, while the Afghan government has been demanding a cease-fire. The Taliban have refused, saying a cease-fire will be part of negotiations, though the group have held to their promise not to attack U.S. and NATO troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-34-killed-in-separate-suicide-bombings-afghan-officials/story-0lH413qXOooFHOq0BBqvfK.html

It follows an embassy report of another “loud noise, possibly an explosion” in the city on Friday, nearly two weeks after the government of neighbouring Ethiopia’s defiant Tigray region confirmed firing missiles at the city during its war with Ethiopian federal forces.The latest explosions came just hours after Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed declared victory in his government’s fighting against forces of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, which runs the northern Tigray region bordering Eritrea. The army said it was in “full control” of the regional capital, Mekele, but the government said TPLF leaders remain on the run.The TPLF leader earlier this month asserted that Eritrean forces were involved in the fighting in Tigray at the invitation of Ethiopia’s government, something Addis Ababa has repeatedly denied. Fears have grown that 96,000 Eritrean refugees in camps just over the border in Ethiopia are at risk.Also Read | UN warns of ‘very critical’ shortages in Ethiopia’s TigrayThe US has accused the TPLF of seeking to “internationalise” the deadly conflict in which humanitarians say several hundred people have been killed, including civilians.The US Embassy statement overnight advises American citizens to exercise caution and be aware “of the ongoing conflict in the Tigray region.” It also advises citizens to “monitor local news” in a country regarded by watchdogs as being highly repressive and having no independent media.The fighting has threatened to destabilise Ethiopia, which has been described as the linchpin of the strategic Horn of Africa, and its neighbours.

Ng-Chan had been mildly ill from the disease and was discharged from hospital after two-and-a-half weeks, the Straits Times said.Ng-Chan and the National University Hospital (NUH), where she gave birth, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The World Health Organisation says it is not yet known whether a pregnant woman with Covid-19 can pass the virus to her foetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the active virus has not been found in samples of fluid around the baby in the womb or in breast milk. Doctors in China have reported the detection and decline over time of Covid-19 antibodies in babies born to women with the coronavirus disease, according to an article published in October in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.Transmission of the new coronavirus from mothers to newborns is rare, doctors from New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center reported in October in JAMA Pediatrics.

29-11-2020||World||Joe Biden announces 3 more members in Covid-19 task force||US President-elect Joe Biden on Saturday said that he is adding three new members in the Coronavirus task force as cases of the Wuhan-originated virus continue to surge in the US.According to The Hill, The transition said in a statement that Jane Hopkins, Jill Jim and David Michaels are joining the team, which is co-chaired by David Kessler, former Indian American Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and Marcella Nunez-Smith. The task force is charged with helping Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.“As Covid-19 surges across the country, I need a team advising me and a transition that offers diverse perspectives and viewpoints. Ms. Hopkins, Dr. Jim, and Dr. Michaels will strengthen the board’s work and help ensure that our Covid-19 planning will address inequities in health outcomes and the workforce,” said President-elect Biden in a statement.According to a statement released by the Biden-Harris Transition website, Hopkins, a Sierra Leonean immigrant, has worked for more than 20 years as a bedside nurse and has a long history in union work, a choice that appears to reflect Biden’s emphasis on appealing to labor groups. She’s also received the Black Lives Matter Award from the SEIU Washington State AFRAM Caucus.Whereas Jim is the executive director at the Navajo Nation Department of Health. “ For 18 years, she has served urban and tribal communities in non-profit, state, federal agencies and most recently tribal government, serving as a cabinet member for the Navajo Nation Nez-Lizer Administration,” the website read.The website stated that Michaels is an epidemiologist and Professor of Environmental and Occupational Health at the Milken Institute School of Public Health, George Washington University.“He served as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health from 2009 to January 2017, the longest-serving administrator in OSHA’s history. During the Clinton Administration, Dr. Michaels served as Assistant Secretary of Energy for Environment, Safety, and Health, charged with protecting the workers, community, and environment around the nation’s nuclear weapons facilities,” the website stated.These announcements of the three new members in the coronavirus task force comes after the US surpassed 13 million Covid-19 cases on Friday, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-announces-3-more-members-in-covid-19-task-force/story-aANlJkZVfHxVDX5zbFQg6N.html
29-11-2020||World||Iran’s supreme leader vows revenge over slain scientist||Iran’s supreme leader on Saturday demanded the “definitive punishment” of those behind the killing of a scientist who led Tehran’s disbanded military nuclear program, as the Islamic Republic blamed Israel for a slaying that has raised fears of reignited tensions across the Middle East.After years of being in the shadows, the image of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh suddenly was to be seen everywhere in Iranian media, as his widow spoke on state television and officials publicly demanded revenge on Israel for the scientist’s slaying.Israel, long suspected of killing Iranian scientists a decade ago amid earlier tensions over Tehran’s nuclear program, has yet to comment on Fakhrizadeh’s killing Friday. However, the attack bore the hallmarks of a carefully planned, military-style ambush, the likes of which Israel has been accused of conducting before.The attack has renewed fears of Iran striking back against the US, Israel’s closest ally in the region, as it did earlier this year when a US drone strike killed a top Iranian general. The US military acknowledged moving an aircraft carrier back into the region, while an Iranian lawmaker suggested throwing out UN nuclear inspectors in response to the killing.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called Fakhrizadeh “the country’s prominent and distinguished nuclear and defensive scientist.” Khamenei, who has the final say on all matters of state, said Iran’s first priority after the killing was the “definitive punishment of the perpetrators and those who ordered it.” He did not elaborate.Speaking earlier Saturday, President Hassan Rouhani blamed Israel for the killing.“We will respond to the assassination of Martyr Fakhrizadeh in a proper time,” Rouhani said. “The Iranian nation is smarter than falling into the trap of the Zionists. They are thinking to create chaos.”The United Nations called for restraint.“Of course we condemn any assassination or extra-judicial killing,” said Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. “We urge restraint and the need to avoid any actions that could lead to an escalation of tensions in the region.”Both Rouhani and Khamenei said Fakhrizadeh’s death would not stop the nuclear program. Iran’s civilian atomic program has continued its experiments and now enriches a growing uranium stockpile up to 4.5% purity in response to the collapse of Iran’s nuclear deal after the US’ 2018 withdrawal from the accord.That’s still far below weapons-grade levels of 90%, though experts warn Iran now has enough low-enriched uranium for at least two atomic bombs if it chose to pursue them.Analysts have compared Fakhrizadeh to being on par with Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who led America’s Manhattan Project in World War II that created the atom bomb.Fakhrizadeh headed Iran’s so-called AMAD program that Israel and the West have alleged was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that “structured program” ended in 2003. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful.Fakhrizadeh’s widow appeared unnamed on state television in a black chador, saying his death would spark a thousand others to take up his work.“He wanted to get martyred and his wish came true,” she said.Hard-line Iranian media has begun circulating memorial images showing Fakhrizadeh standing alongside a machine-gun-cradling likeness of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, whom the U.S. killed in the January drone strike.Soleimani’s death led to Iran retaliating with a ballistic missile barrage that injured dozens of American troops in Iraq. Tehran also has forces at its disposal all around Israel, including troops and proxies in neighboring Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Islamic Jihad — and to a lesser extent Hamas — in the Gaza Strip. The Iranian Guard’s naval forces routinely shadow and have tense encounters with US Navy forces in the Persian Gulf as well.Hours after the attack, the Pentagon announced it had brought the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier back into the Middle East, an unusual move as the carrier already spent months in the region. It cited the drawdown of US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq as the reason for the decision, saying “it was prudent to have additional defensive capabilities in the region to meet any contingency.”Iran has conducted attacks targeting Israeli interests abroad over the killing of its scientists, like in the case of the three Iranians recently freed in Thailand in exchange for a detained British-Australian academic.Iran also could throw out inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who have provided an unprecedented, real-time look at Iran’s nuclear program since the deal. Nasrollah Pezhmanfar, a hard-line lawmaker, said a statement calling to expel the “IAEA’s spy inspections” could be read Sunday, the parliament’s official website quoted him as saying.Friday’s attack happened in Absard, a village just east of the capital that is a retreat for the country’s elite. Iranian state television said an old truck with explosives hidden under a load of wood blew up near a sedan carrying Fakhrizadeh.As Fakhrizadeh’s sedan stopped, at least five gunmen emerged and raked the car with rapid fire, the semiofficial Tasnim news agency said. The precision of the attack led to the suspicion of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service being involved. The CIA separately declined to comment on the attack Saturday.State media has only said the attack killed Fakhrizadeh, though a statement Saturday from the European Union described the incident as killing “an Iranian government official and several civilians.” EU officials did not respond to requests for comment.In Tehran, a small group of hardline protesters burned images of Trump and President-elect Joe Biden, who has said his administration will consider reentering Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. While burning an American and Israeli flag, the hard-liners criticized Iran’s foreign minister who helped negotiate the nuclear deal, showing the challenge ahead of Tehran if officials chose to come back the accord.On Saturday night, the family of Fakhrizadeh gathered at a mosque in central Tehran for his funeral service, a website associated with Iranian state TV reported. The scientist’s body lay in a flag-draped, open coffin, his eyes closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-supreme-leader-vows-revenge-over-slain-scientist/story-p952kZgWiMsthT4E9F7tkO.html
29-11-2020||World||Car bomb kills at least 26 Afghan security personnel: Officials||A suicide car bomber struck an army base in Afghanistan on Sunday killing at least 26 security personnel, officials said, in one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.The attack occurred on the outskirts of Ghazni city, capital of the eastern province of Ghazni, which has seen regular fighting between the Taliban and government forces.It came as the government and Taliban are engaged in peace talks to end the war in the impoverished country that has killed tens of thousands of people in nearly two decades. “We have received 26 bodies and 17 wounded so far. All of them are security personnel,” Baz Mohammad Hemat, director of Ghazni hospital, told AFP.Nasir Ahmad Faqiri, a member of Ghazni provincial council, confirmed the death toll.Interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian a suicide bomber had detonated a vehicle full of explosives.No group has so far claimed the attack.The Ghazni attack comes just days after two bombs killed 14 people in the historic city of Bamiyan, ending years of calm in the isolated town famous for its ancient Buddhist heritage.Sunday’s bombing marked the latest big attack in Afghanistan, where violence has surged since the start of peace talks on September 12 in the Qatari capital of Doha.Brutal attacks have killed more than 50 people in Kabul in recent weeks, including two assaults on educational centres and a rocket attack. The Kabul attacks were claimed by the Islamic State group, but Afghan officials blamed the Taliban -- who denied any involvement.The Taliban have launch daily attacks targeting Afghan forces despite engaging in the peace talks.The talks had been bogged down by disputes on the agenda, the basic framework of discussions and religious interpretations, but agreement has now been reached on all issues, according to sources close to the talks.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for “expedited discussions” during a visit to Doha last week during which he met with both Taliban and Afghan government negotiators.The Pentagon said earlier this month that it would soon pull out some 2,000 troops from Afghanistan, speeding up the timeline of a full withdrawal by May 2021 as agreed with the Taliban in a separate deal signed in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/car-bomb-kills-at-least-26-afghan-security-personnel-officials/story-57mxDsQk2WsC3rgA8PeadL.html
29-11-2020||World||Worse than Covid? Risks to UK economy as Brexit deadline nears||With the UK economy suffering more from the coronavirus than most advanced nations, the stakes couldn’t be higher as Brexit trade negotiations enter their endgame.Gross domestic product will likely be smaller than what it would have been had the UK stayed in the European Union regardless of the outcome. But reaching an accord would help avoid major trade disruptions come Jan. 1.Leaving without a deal, meanwhile, means that Brexit could end up inflicting more lasting damage than the pandemic, according to economists. Both sides say the onus is on the other to make a decisive move before the transition ends in just over a month.The pandemic has put Britain on course for its deepest economic slump since the Great Frost of 1709. By the first quarter of 2025, GDP will be 3.1% lower than anticipated in March, according to estimates by the Office for Budget Responsibility released on Wednesday. The fiscal watchdog deems the loss of output to be permanent.In a separate analysis, the OBR said transitioning into a free-trade agreement with the EU would shave 4% off GDP in the long run. A no-deal scenario -- meaning a shift to World Trade Organization rules -- would mean losing another 1.5%. Dan Hanson of Bloomberg Economics puts the combined cost higher still, at 7% of GDP.Jobs are also on the line. Unemployment is set to peak at 7.5%, or 2.6 million people, next year under the OBR’s central scenario that a trade deal be reached. A no-deal exit pushes the rate up to 8.3%.Financial services and export-reliant manufacturing sectors such as the car industry, food and textile producers stand to be among the hardest hit if trade talks fail.There are concerns that the time and money spent dealing with the pandemic has left many firms ill equipped to cope with the potential costs and disruptions ahead. A Bank of England survey of chief financial officers last month found less than 4% of them were fully prepared for the end of the transition period.Before the pandemic, businesses were already holding back on spending as they awaited greater clarity over Britain’s post-divorce relationship with Europe. Now Covid-19 has added to the difficulties, decimating investment this year and risking their ability to do so in future.No matter what the outcome of the talks, a period of adjustment is likely to make it hard for companies to know how best to invest for the future, but a move to WTO terms risks keeping spending depressed for longer, hitting already weakened productivity.The bigger the economic shortfall, the bigger the persistent budget deficit that Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak needs to fill.Even if a trade deal is struck, balancing day-to-day spending and revenue by the middle of the decade will require 27 billion pounds ($36 billion) of tax increases or spending cuts, according to the OBR. That figure could rise to 34 billion pounds if firms are hit by new tariffs and curbs on trade with the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worse-than-covid-risks-to-uk-economy-as-brexit-deadline-nears/story-Z3O0IOueC1HzjdWN1kjRSP.html

Some experts say the coronavirus can spread more broadly during cold weather when people typically spend more time indoors.KCNA said officials were building firm anti-epidemic measures along border areas to prevent the coronavirus from entering the country. In front-line coastal areas, authorities were working out more stringent rules for venturing out at sea and collecting filthy materials in the waters, according to KCNA.North Korea has maintained no single virus case has been found on its territory, a claim widely questioned by outside experts. Despite its claim, North Korea has swiftly sealed its borders, flew out diplomats and isolated residents with symptoms. A major outbreak in North Korea could have devastating consequences because of its broken health care system and a chronic lack of medicines.North Korea has previously mentioned a restriction on entering the sea. Sunday’s report came after South Korea’s spy service told lawmakers Friday that the North’s anti-virus steps included a ban on fishing and salt production at sea, as well as and the lockdown of the capital, Pyongyang, northern Jagang province and other areas.Also Read | Suspected North Korean hackers targeted Covid vaccine maker AstraZenecaLawmakers who attended the closed-door briefing also cited the National Intelligence Service as saying that North Korea executed an official for breaching regulations restricting the import of goods in August and a money changer for a falling exchange rate in October.Ha Tae-keung, one of the lawmakers, quoted the agency as saying North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is displaying “excessive anger” and taking “irrational measures” over the pandemic and its economic impact.In September, South Korea accused North Korea of fatally shooting a South Korean fishery official found in the North’s waters before burning his body apparently in line with an anti-virus policy that involves shooting anyone illegally crossing the border. North Korea later acknowledged and apologized for the killing, but claimed it only burnt his floating device, not his body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-toughens-rules-of-entry-to-sea-to-fight-covid-19/story-BJ7zylzjgYBZJwA5luNgYO.html

They undermine confidence in the global economy, and that’s not good for the world’s recovery from Covid.”China has imposed anti-dumping duties of up to 212% on Australian wine, the latest in a raft of measures that have affected imports from coal to copper to barley. Tensions between Beijing and Canberra have been rising since 2018, when Australia barred Huawei Technologies from building its 5G network. Relations worsened this year after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19.Also Read |  China denies restricting Indian ship carrying Australian coal from leaving its portAsked if China’s behavior was economic coercion, Birmingham said: “Right around the world people are posing that question, and I understand why.”China is Australia’s largest trading partner and the biggest buyer of Australian wine. Australia has denied it is dumping wine in China, whose duties took effect on Nov 28 and range from 107.1% to 212.1%.Morrison said on Sunday the government will look at assisting exporters hurt by China’s trade measures.“It is a difficult time and there are tensions,” the prime minister said on ABC radio. “We will do everything we can to ensure that we can try and address these trade issues that have come up with China. Obviously we’re very concerned about that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trade-curbs-hurt-global-confidence-says-australia-trade-minister/story-BNp5OLp3FXN06eHmXgxIzI.html

29-11-2020||World||Payrolls in US set to tread higher in pandemic slog: Report||US employers probably continued to beef up their headcounts in November, even though the pace of hiring slowed for a fifth month.Payrolls probably rose by about a half million during the month after a 638,000 gain in October, according to the median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists ahead of government data due on Friday. The jobless rate is seen easing to 6.8% from 6.9%.More payrolls would still leave total employment well below its pre-pandemic peak, when more than 152 million Americans were working. While the state of the job market has brightened as household savings fuel spending and business investment rebounds, the coronavirus continues to impact a swathe of industries, most notably travel and leisure.What Bloomberg Economics Say...“Recently, the labor market has started to show signs of strain, with jobless claims moving higher and virus-related lockdown measures being reinstituted as case counts surge, but these factors will be more fully felt in the December data. As such, the November data may reflect the final heady gains of the second half rebound/reopening. December will reflect sharp downdrafts due to the third wave of Covid-19.”--Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger. Other U.S. economic reports this coming week are projected to show manufacturing expanded at a solid clip in November, while construction spending accelerated a month earlier in conjunction with a robust housing market.Elsewhere in the U.S. economy, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin go head-to-head and President-elect Joe Biden is set to unveil his economic team. Wider afield, the OECD presents its latest forecast and central bankers in India, Australia and Israel meet on interest rates.US and CanadaPowell and Mnuchin face off this week over the Trump administration’s controversial decision to wind down several emergency Fed lending programs. Democrats branded the Nov. 19 move as a crude way of denying fiscal support to Biden’s incoming administration.Powell and Mnuchin testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, and a day later before the House Financial Services Committee, in a quarterly appearance to discuss the CARES Act, under which Congress in March authorized over $2 trillion in pandemic aid.Mnuchin extended four pre-CARES Act facilities for 90 days, but declined Powell’s request to do the same for Fed lending facilities for mid-sized borrowers and cash-strapped municipalities. He also demanded back several hundred billion dollars in unused CARES Act funds, which Powell subsequently agreed to do.In Canada, Justin Trudeau, already one of the world’s most enthusiastic champions of fiscal stimulus, will deliver another dose of spending this week to fuel his country’s economic recovery and respond to a second wave of the pandemic. His government is set to present a fiscal update on Monday. That’s ahead of GDP data on Tuesday that’s likely to show a third-quarter rebound that’s already stalled.AsiaJapan’s production and retail sales data on Monday will offer the latest measure of the recovery’s strength, while capital spending figures on Tuesday will be used to revise third quarter gross domestic product figures. Speeches by Bank of Japan board members will shed light on current thinking at the central bank.Korea’s export statistics on Tuesday will show global trade’s recent pulse.China’s PMI report on Monday will give the first official reading of the economy’s momentum in November, while regional manufacturing gauges the next day will show how well factories are coping as their outlook is threatened by the renewed spread of Covid-19 across much of Europe and the USAustralia’s central bank is expected to have a quiet meeting on Tuesday after unveiling its new quantitative easing program and cutting rates to fresh lows at its November meeting. Governor Philip Lowe will brief a parliamentary committee on how all of that is progressing and on other issues on Wednesday, the same day third-quarter GDP numbers are set to show a recovery from recession has begun.On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India is widely expected to keep benchmark rates unchanged, given a spike in headline inflation, but will reiterate its accommodative policy stance to help the economy recover.Europe, Middle East, AfricaWith the U.K.’s crucial spending review out of the way, attention will be turning to crunch talks with the European Union over Brexit, as both sides race to reach a trade deal before the transition period expires in just over a month.On the data front, euro-area inflation figures on Tuesday will likely cement expectations that the European Central Bank will top up its stimulus program on Dec. 10. ECB President Christine Lagarde is scheduled to speak twice before her institution starts its quiet period on Dec. 3.Denmark and Iceland report GDP growth estimates for the third quarter after posting record contractions in the previous three months.In eastern Europe, Poland’s central bank is expected to keep interest rates on hold. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis will try to persuade other parliamentary parties to curb back planned tax overhaul after lawmakers approved a version that deepens the budget deficit more than he expected.Turkey may report a modest rebound in economic activity on Monday, with analysts forecasting 5% growth in the third quarter after a 9.9% contraction in the second. But inflation data on Thursday will probably show prices rose by about 13% in November, a month that saw the start of sweeping reforms of economic policies following the resignation of Berat Albayrak, the president’s son-in-law, as economy czar.The Bank of Israel, reluctant to take interest rates negative, will probably keep its benchmark at 0.1% on Monday, though it’s struggling to control appreciation of the shekel, now at a 12-year high. Botswana’s central bank, after cutting its benchmark rate to a record low in October, is set to hold on Thursday.Latin AmericaChile’s October retails sales, industrial output and economic activity reports out Monday and Tuesday should be consistent with an economy pulling out of recession even if it’s not yet firing on all cylinders.In Colombia, minutes of the central bank’s Nov. 27 meeting posted Monday may offer guidance on the timing of policy tightening from the current record low 1.75%.In Brazil on Monday, the October budget report from the central bank will show ballooning deficits and mounting public debt, which some forecasts put near 100% of GDP by year-end. Much of the red ink is due to a massive income support program for roughly 30% of the population that’s boosted President Jair Bolsonaro’s popularity and likely has Brazil heading for the shallowest 2020 recession of the region’s six biggest economies. Third-quarter output data published Thursday should feature the highest year-on-year result among the region’s larger economies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/payrolls-in-us-set-to-tread-higher-in-pandemic-slog-report/story-Nl4QQn7Y9KZovydKhxunGL.html

29-11-2020||World||How close is Iran to producing a nuclear bomb?||A 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is being eroded and efforts to revive the pact face a new challenge with the killing of Tehran’s top nuclear scientist.The accord’s restrictions on Iran’s atomic work had one objective: to extend the “breakout time” for Tehran to produce enough fissile material for a bomb, if it decided to make one, to at least a year from about two to three months.Iran maintains that it has never sought nuclear weapons and never would. It says its nuclear work only has civilian aims.Tehran began breaching the deal’s curbs last year in a step-by-step response to President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the deal in May 2018 and the reimposition of US sanctions.Also Read | Iran vows to avenge nuke scientist’s assassinationThis has shortened the breakout time but reports by the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which polices the deal, indicate that Iran is not moving ahead with its nuclear work as fast as it could.European states have sought to save the nuclear deal, pressing Tehran to comply even as Washington has tightened sanctions, and holding out hopes of a change in US policy once President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.Biden was part of the US administration under Barack Obama that negotiated the 2015 deal.What has Iran done till now?ran has contravened many of the deal’s restrictions but is still cooperating with the IAEA and granting inspectors access under one of the most intrusive nuclear verification regimes imposed on any nation.* Enriched uranium - The deal limits Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium to 202.8 kg, a fraction of the more than eight tonnes it possessed before the deal. The limit was breached last year. The IAEA report in November put the stockpile at 2,442.9 kg.* Enrichment level - The deal caps the fissile purity to which Iran can refine uranium at 3.67%, far below the 20% achieved before the deal and below the weapons-grade level of 90%. Iran breached the 3.67% cap in July 2019 and the enrichment level has remained steady at up to 4.5% since then.* Centrifuges - The deal allows Iran to produce enriched uranium using about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at its underground Natanz plant, which was built to house more than 50,000. It can operate small numbers of more advanced models above ground without accumulating enriched uranium. Iran had roughly 19,000 installed centrifuges before the deal.In 2019, the IAEA said Iran had begun enrichment with advanced centrifuges at an above-ground pilot plant at Natanz. Since then, Iran started moving three cascades, or clusters, of advanced centrifuges to the underground plant. In November, the IAEA said Iran had fed uranium hexafluoride gas feedstock into the first of those underground cascades.* Fordow - The deal bans enrichment at Fordow, a site Iran secretly built inside a mountain and that was exposed by Western intelligence services in 2009. Centrifuges are allowed there for other purposes, like producing stable isotopes. Iran now has 1,044 IR-1 centrifuges enriching there.How close is Iran to having a bomb?The breaches lengthened the breakout time but estimates still vary. Many diplomats and nuclear experts say the starting point of one year is conservative and Iran would need longer.David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector who tends to have a hawkish position on Iran, estimated in November that Iran’s breakout time could be “as short as 3.5 months”, although this presumes Iran would use 1,000 advanced centrifuges that were removed under the deal.What more would Iran need to do?If Iran accumulated sufficient fissile material, it would need to assemble a bomb and probably one small enough to be carried by its ballistic missiles. How long that would take exactly is unclear, but stockpiling enough fissile material is widely seen as the biggest hurdle in producing a weapon.US intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran once had a nuclear weapons programme that it halted. There is evidence suggesting Iran obtained a design for a nuclear weapon and carried out various types of work relevant to making one.Tehran continues to grant the IAEA access to its declared nuclear facilities and allow snap inspections elsewhere.Iran and the IAEA resolved a standoff this year that had lasted several months over access to two suspected former sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-close-is-iran-to-producing-a-nuclear-bomb/story-cldqeNAnACYJrwSxJMxIjJ.html
29-11-2020||World||UK, France agree on new plan to curb illegal migration across English Channel||The British government said Saturday that it had struck an agreement with France to double the number of French police patrolling beaches in the country’s north in an attempt to stop people crossing the English Channel in small boats.Britain’s Home Office said Home Secretary Priti Patel and French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin had agreed on the measure as part of efforts to make the route “unviable” for people-smugglers. The agreement also will boost surveillance using “drones, radar equipment, optronic binoculars and fixed cameras,” the U.K. said.It said the two countries had agreed to spend 31.4 million euros ($41 million) on the measures.Migrants have long used northern France as a launching point to reach Britain — usually in trucks or on ferries —and the issue has long strained relations between the two countries.Many migrants appear to have turned to small boats organized by smugglers during the coronavirus pandemic because virus restrictions have reduced traffic between France and Britain. More than 8,000 people have made the dangerous journey so far this year, up from about 1,800 in all of 2019.Last month, a family from Iran, including two parents and their children aged 6 and 9, died when their boat capsized in the Channel. Their 15-month-old son is missing and presumed drowned.Aid and human rights groups say the best way to stop the journeys is to provide safe routes for people to seek asylum in Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-france-agree-on-new-plan-to-curb-illegal-migration-across-english-channel/story-hnQaMCVDekMwoSXCD4zBeO.html
29-11-2020||World||Severe fire danger for Australia as temperatures smash records||Parts of Australia, including Sydney, sweltered through the hottest November night on record with temperatures likely to stay high on Sunday, prompting authorities to issue a total fire ban.Sydney CBD surpassed 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) on Saturday while swathes of western New South Wales, South Australia and northern Victoria baked through even higher temperatures nearing 45 degrees.Temperatures are expected to cross 40 degrees for a second straight day on Sunday while the Bureau of Meteorology has predicted a five or six-day heatwave for parts of northern New South Wales and southeast Queensland.The predictions for soaring temperatures prompted the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) to say demand may exceed supply in New South Wales on Sunday afternoon.Australia has been experiencing hotter and longer summers with last season dubbed “Black Summer” by Prime Minister Scott Morrison due to unusually prolonged and intense bushfires that burned nearly 12 million hectares (30 million acres), killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion animals.The Rural Fire Service issued a total fire ban for most of eastern and northeastern NSW for Sunday, saying there was a “very high to severe fire danger forecast” as hot, gusty winds exacerbate dry conditions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/severe-fire-danger-for-australia-as-temperatures-smash-records/story-ApUBMMQTt7vNrxBZYqsjhM.html
29-11-2020||World||Thousands in Argentina march against new move to legalize abortion||Thousands of anti-abortion protesters, many of them mobilized by Catholic or evangelical groups, demonstrated on Saturday across Argentina against a government-backed new bill to legalize abortion.The largest group congregated in Buenos Aires before the Congress, which is expected in the coming week to begin debating legislation on a matter that has bitterly divided the traditionally Catholic South American nation.Marchers around the country carried signs with slogans like “Save Both Lives!” and “March for the Unborn.” Jorge Gomez, executive director of Aciera, the Christian Alliance of Evangelical Churches of Argentina, called it a “spontaneous outpouring”.Argentines who support women’s right to choose also called for people to take to the streets.The National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe and Free Abortion urged backers to “paint Argentina green in coming weeks” -- to wave green handkerchiefs as a symbol of women’s rights.Gomez, however, said it was inappropriate for the draft legislation to be taken up amid the ongoing pandemic and at a time when “Argentine society needs unity to solve structural problems such as poverty.”This will be the ninth time in majority-Catholic Argentina -- homeland of Pope Francis -- that a bill to legalize abortion has been presented in parliament.On the last occasion, in 2018, it gained approval in the Chamber of Deputies but was rejected in the Senate. This will be the first time such legislation originated in the country’s executive branch via a proposal from President Alberto Fernandez. Fernandez has said the new legislation would guarantee “that all women have access to the right to comprehensive health care.”Under a law first passed in 1920, Argentina permits abortions only in cases of rape or danger to the life of the mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-in-argentina-march-against-new-move-to-legalize-abortion/story-kdNR8zT4DUH5rfrNauJb7J.html
29-11-2020||World||Ex-Trump campaign aide sues over Russia probe surveillance||A former Trump campaign associate who was the target of a secret surveillance warrant during the FBI’s Russia investigation says in a federal lawsuit that he was the victim of “unlawful spying.”The suit from Carter Page alleges a series of omissions and errors made by FBI and Justice Department officials in applications they submitted in 2016 and 2017 to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to eavesdrop on Page on suspicion that he was an agent of Russia.“Since not a single proven fact ever established complicity with Russia involving Dr. Page, there never was probable cause to seek or obtain the FISA Warrants targeting him on this basis,” the lawsuit says, using the acronym for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.Also Read | Trump pardons Michael Flynn, taking direct aim at Russia probePage has received death and kidnapping threats and has suffered economic losses and “irreparable damage to his reputation,” according to the lawsuit, which was filed Friday in federal court in Washington.The lawsuit to some extent echoes the conclusions of a Justice Department inspector general report that found significant problems with the four applications. Former FBI and Justice Department leaders who were involved in signing off on the surveillance have since testified they wouldn’t have done so had they known of the extent of the issues, and the FBI has initiated more than 40 corrective steps aimed at improving the accuracy and thoroughness of applications.In the complaint, Page accuses the FBI of relying excessively for information on Christopher Steele, a former British spy whose research during the 2016 campaign into Donald Trump’s ties to Russia was funded by Democrats. It says the FBI failed to tell the surveillance court that Steele’s primary source had contradicted information that Steele had attributed to him, or that Page had denied to an informant for the FBI having “any involvement with Russia on behalf of the Trump campaign.”The complaint also accuses the FBI of having misled the surveillance court about his relationship with the CIA, for whom Page had been an operational contact between 2008 and 2013. A former FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, pleaded guilty in August to altering an email to say that Page had not been a source for the CIA.The suit names as defendants the FBI and the Justice Department, as well as former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and additional officials who were involved in the Russia investigation.Despite the problems with the warrant applications, the scrutiny of Page, who was never charged with any wrongdoing, accounted for only a narrow portion of the overall investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.The same inspector general report that detailed problems in the applications also concluded that the FBI had a legitimate basis for opening the Russia investigation, and did not find evidence that any of its actions were influenced by political bias.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-trump-campaign-aide-sues-over-russia-probe-surveillance/story-aqGLzIDAQrZAV8zunK4wXL.html

The Democrat gained 257 votes to Trump’s 125.Recounts rarely show more than a small number of vote changes, and the Milwaukee effort was no exception. Biden won the state by over 20,000 votes, an outcome that’s expected to be certified on Tuesday.Results are expected on Sunday from a recount in Wisconsin’s Dane county, which includes the Democratic-leaning state capital of Madison. The Trump campaign paid $3 million to the state of Wisconsin for recounts in the two counties.Silent in courtTrump and his legal team, led by Rudy Giuliani, have made multiple assertions of election fraud on Twitter and while talking to the media. But those allegations haven’t surfaced in court, where evidence must be presented.On Friday, a Trump-appointed judge in Pennsylvania made note of that discrepancy in rejecting the president’s attempt to revive a lawsuit seeking to undo the state’s certification of Biden as the winner.Also Read: Trump, still defiant, says he’ll give up power if electoral college backs Biden“Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof.

Trump echoed that on Saturday, saying “we will appeal!” Another Trump tweet about Pennsylvania was also flagged by Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-vows-to-press-on-in-wisconsin-despite-recount-setback/story-97jaSFITXOEDGPwGHQA5zJ.html
29-11-2020||World||Former head of CIA calls assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist ‘criminal and reckless act’||The former head of the CIA labelled the assassination of a top Iranian nuclear scientist on Friday a “criminal” act that risks inflaming conflict in the region. John Brennan said he did not know who was to blame for the murder of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.“This was a criminal act & highly reckless. It risks lethal retaliation & a new round of regional conflict,” Brennan said in a series of tweets. “I do not know whether a foreign government authorised or carried out the murder of Fakhrizadeh,” he said. “Such an act of state-sponsored terrorism would be a flagrant violation of international law & encourage more governments to carry out lethal attacks against foreign officials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-head-of-cia-calls-assassination-of-iranian-nuclear-scientist-criminal-and-reckless-act/story-IjLx9c663t0NbkIYZXvXjJ.html
29-11-2020||World||Iran vows to avenge nuke scientist’s assassination||Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called for “definitive punishment” of those behind the killing of a scientist linked to Tehran’s disbanded military nuclear programme, according to his official website. He said Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was “the country’s prominent and distinguished nuclear and defensive scientist”.Iran has blamed Israel for the killing. Israel, long suspected of killing scientists a decade ago amid tensions over Tehran’s nuclear programme, has yet to comment on the developments.Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani accused Israel of acting as a “mercenary” for the US, blaming it for the assassination. “Once again, the wicked hands of the global arrogance, with the usurper Zionist regime as the mercenary, were stained with the blood of a son of this nation,” Rouhani said in a statement.The slaying threatens to renew tensions between the US and Iran in the waning days of President Donald Trump’s term.Rouhani said Fakhrizadeh’s death won’t stop its nuclear programme. Iran’s civilian nuclear programme has continued its experiments and enriches uranium up to 4.5% - far below weapons-grade levels of 90%.“We will respond to the assassination of martyr Fakhrizadeh in a proper time,” Rouhani said. The attack happened in Absard, a village east of Tehran that is a retreat for the Iranian elite. State television said a truck with bombs hidden under a load of wood blew up near a sedan carrying Fakhrizadeh.US aircraft carrier USS Nimitz was deployed to the Gulf this week, days before the killing, although the US Navy said on Saturday the deployment was not related to any specific threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-vows-to-avenge-nuke-scientist-s-assassination/story-mEcrgm26dRWCCEEl8cXmgK.html

Los Angeles County, which has been reporting over 4,500 daily infections for five days in a row, will halt all social gatherings for three weeks.While Covid-19 continues to spread across the US, infecting over 13 million people, European countries have decided to start easing some of the curbs keeping in view the festive season. The UK appointed a vaccines minister on Saturday as it prepares to inoculate millions of people against the coronavirus. PM Boris Johnson said Conservative lawmaker Nadhim Zahawi will oversee the country’s biggest vaccine programme in decades.Meanwhile, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) top emergencies expert said on Friday it would be “highly speculative” for the WHO to say the coronavirus did not emerge in China.China is pushing a narrative that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and studies saying it had been circulating in Europe last year.“I think it’s highly speculative for us to say that the disease did not emerge in China,” Mike Ryan said at a virtual briefing in Geneva. “It is clear from a public health perspective that you start your investigations where the human cases first emerged,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-over-200-000-covid-cases-in-one-day/story-KGIFMkZg3qutOPvsvQn9SN.html
29-11-2020||World||Links with slavery? Welsh govt audit puts Mahatma Gandhi on a list of controversial individuals||An audit published by the Welsh government on the historical links of Wales with slavery has included Mahatma Gandhi on a list of controversial individuals whose statues are located across Britain, adding to similar reviews prompted by the Black Lives Matter campaign.The audit was commissioned in July by Labour’s Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, following George Floyd’s controversial death in the US. Several councils and organisations across the UK have since initiated such reviews, at times provoking surprise and anger with the inclusion of names such as former British PM Winston Churchill.There is no suggestion that Gandhi’s statue installed in the Welsh capital of Cardiff in 2017 would be pulled down, but the audit’s objective is to “identify issues for a possible second stage”. The list includes colonial India’s officials with Welsh links such as Robert Clive and Edward Clive.The audit says that Gandhi’s role needs examination after his controversial views were highlighted by campaigners. Besides Gandhi, the list of “international” figures in the audit includes anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela, explorer Christopher Columbus and artiste Paul Robeson.On Gandhi, the audit says his “personal culpability (is) uncertain”, but goes on to add, “The leader of the Indian independence movement (was) famous for his promotion of anti-colonialism, non-violent resistance and satyagraha or the force of truth. After studying law in London he went to practise in South Africa 1893-1914.“He fought anti-Indian discrimination in Africa, but has been accused of complicity in continuing racism against Black South Africans. His comment in a speech in 1896 that whites were degrading Hindus and Muslims ‘to a level of Kaffir’ is taken as suggesting that he believed Indians to be better than Black Africans.”The audit further says, “Historians have taken a range of views of his culpability, saying that it would have been premature to expect equality in turn-of-the-century South Africa or identifying Gandhi as having turned a blind eye to brutality against Africans. Nevertheless, Gandhi’s later leadership in India inspired leaders in Africa, including Nelson Mandela. A statue of Gandhi in Pietermartizburg was unveiled in 1993 by Desmond Tutu.”Gandhi’s life-size statue produced by Ram Sutar and Anil Sutar was installed in Cardiff Bay in 2017 in an event attended by Drakeford and Indian diplomats, among others. It is one of several Gandhi statues across the UK, including two in London.Drakeford said after the audit was published, “While the tragic killing of George Floyd happened almost 4,000 miles away, it sparked global action that shone a light on racial inequality in society today.“That inequality exists in Welsh society too and we must work towards a Wales which is more equal. To help us do this, we need a clear understanding of the legacies of the slave trade and the British Empire. This audit provides important evidence which helps us establish an honest picture of our history.“This is the first stage of a much bigger piece of work which will consider how we move forward with this information as we seek to honour and celebrate our diverse communities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/links-with-slavery-welsh-govt-audit-puts-mahatma-gandhi-on-a-list-of-controversial-individuals/story-2W93B5ZKjCxDZiK9k6Gv3M.html
29-11-2020||World||Mysterious monolith found in US Desert draws wild theories about aliens, UFOs||A mysterious metal obelisk found buried in the remote western United States desert has inflamed the imaginations of UFO spotters, conspiracy theorists and Stanley Kubrick fans around the world.The shiny, triangular pillar -- which protrudes approximately 12 feet from the red rocks of southern Utah -- was spotted last Wednesday by baffled local officials counting bighorn sheep from the air.After landing their helicopter to investigate, Utah Department of Public Safety crew members found “a metal monolith installed in the ground” but “no obvious indication of who might have put the monolith there.”“It is illegal to install structures or art without authorization on federally managed public lands, no matter what planet you’re from,” warned the agency in a tongue-in-cheek press release Monday. News of the discovery quickly went viral online, with many noting the object’s similarity with strange alien monoliths that trigger huge leaps in human progress in Kubrick’s classic sci-fi film “2001: A Space Odyssey.”Others remarked on its discovery during a turbulent year that has seen the world gripped by the Covid-19 pandemic, and optimistically speculated it could have a different function entirely.“This is the ‘reset’ button for 2020. Can someone please press it quickly?” joked one Instagram user.“Up close it reads: ‘Covid vaccine inside’“ wrote another.Although officials have refused to disclose the object’s location out of fear that hordes of curious sightseers would flock to the remote wilderness, a Reddit user said they had managed to geo-locate the obelisk using surrounding rock formations.Sharing the Google Earth location -- where a small structure can be seen, roughly six miles from the nearest road -- the user said the structure was first photographed by Google in 2016.Bret Hutchings, the pilot who happened to fly over the obelisk, speculated that it had been planted by “some new wave artist.”Some observers pointed out the object’s resemblance to the avant-garde work of John McCracken, a US artist who lived for a time in nearby New Mexico, and died in 2011.On Tuesday a spokeswoman for his representative David Zwirner said it was not one of McCracken’s works, but possibly by a fellow artist paying homage.However later in the day Zwirner gave another statement in which he suggested the piece was indeed by McCracken, meaning it had lain undiscovered in the desert for nearly a decade.“The gallery is divided on this,” Zwirner said. “I believe this is definitely by John.”He added: “Who would have known that 2020 had yet another surprise for us. Just when we thought we had seen it all. Let’s go see it.”Either way, Hutchings admitted it was “about the strangest thing I’ve come across out there, in all my years of flying.”“We were kind of joking around that if one of us suddenly disappears, then the rest of us make a run for it,” he told local news channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mysterious-monolith-found-in-us-desert-draws-wild-theories-about-aliens-ufos/story-jwecJebidSVnl9qpVQAsmO.html
