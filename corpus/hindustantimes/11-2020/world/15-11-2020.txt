15-11-2020||World||Covid vaccine would begin to be delivered at the “end of this year, beginning of next year”, says one of the vaccine creators||The new Covid vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech would begin to be delivered at the “end of this year, beginning of next year” if everything continued to go well, one of its creators said on Sunday. Last week, BioNTech and co-developers Pfizer said preliminary analysis showed their vaccine could prevent more than 90 per cent of people from getting Covid-19. About 43,000 people took part in tests.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Prof Ugur Sahin, co-founder and CEO of BioNTech, told the BBC that the goal was to deliver more than 300 million doses worldwide by next April, which “could allow us to only start to make an impact”. He said the bigger impact would happen later, adding: “Summer will help us because the infection rate will go down in the summer and what is absolutely essential is that we get a high vaccination rate until or before autumn/winter next year.” If everything continued to go well, he said, the vaccine would begin to be delivered at the “end of this year, beginning of next year”.Sahin said he was confident the vaccine would reduce transmission between people as well as stop symptoms developing in someone who has had the vaccine.It was possible, he said, the vaccine could halve transmission which would have a big impact.“I’m very confident that transmission between people will be reduced by such a highly effective vaccine - maybe not 90 per cent but maybe per cent - but we should not forget that even that could result in a dramatic reduction of the pandemic spread,” he added.He said this winter would still be hard as the vaccine would not have a big impact on infection numbers.Globally over 54,068,000 confirmed cases have been reported. The highly contagious disease, which emerged first in the central Chinese city of Wuhan has killed more than 1,313,000.The US is the worst-hit nation with more than 10,908,000 confirmed cases and 245,600 deaths, according to latest figures from Johns Hopkins University.The UK is expected to get 10 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered. The jab, which was trialled in six countries, is given in two doses, three weeks apart.Older residents and staff in care homes are likely to be prioritised, followed by health workers and the over-80s. People would then be ranked by age, the BBC report said.Asked if the vaccine was as effective in older people as it is in younger people, he said he expected to have a better idea in the next three weeks.He said it was not yet known how long immunity would last after the second dose of the vaccine is given.However, he said, a booster immunisation “should not be too complicated” if it was found immunity was reduced significantly after one year.Sahin also said the “key side effects” of the vaccine seen so far were a mild to moderate pain in the injection site for a few days, while some participants had a mild to moderate fever over a similar period.“We did not see any other serious side effects which would result in pausing or halting of the study,” he added.His vaccine is one of 11 that are currently in the final stages of testing. “Today is a great day for science and humanity. The first set of results from our Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trial provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent COVID-19,” said Dr Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman and CEO said on November 9. “With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” Bourla said in a statement. “The first interim analysis of our global Phase 3 study provides evidence that a vaccine may effectively prevent Covid-19. This is a victory for innovation, science and a global collaborative effort,” said Sahin last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vaccine-would-begin-to-be-delivered-at-the-end-of-this-year-beginning-of-next-year-says-one-of-the-vaccine-creators/story-k9NiHS9sWMBCLHpSRSk7fI.html
15-11-2020||World||Donald Trump admits Joe Biden ‘won’, but insists US election was ‘rigged’||US President Donald Trump on Sunday acknowledged for the first time that Joe Biden, the president-elect, has “won” the 2020 election, starting a process that could possibly lead to a full-fledged concession.“He won because the Election was Rigged,” Trump wrote in a tweet, and went on to repeat his allegations of election fraud and irregularities that have found no traction outside his support base, have failed to stand up in courts and have been debunked by top election security officials of his own administration.“I concede NOTHING!” Trump added, however. “We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!”Trump has refused to concede the election, which Biden has won by securing 306 electoral college votes, matching Trump’s 2016 winning haul that he had called a “landslide”. Biden, the president-elect, has also beaten the Republican incumbent in popular votes by more than 5 million.Trump has not only refused to concede, he has also blocked Biden and his team from receiving intelligence briefings, cooperation and information from agencies as part of a transition process that has been honored and respected by outgoing Republican and Democratic administrations.Asked if Trump’s tweet was “step one” of a concession, Biden’s chief of staff Ronald Klain said on NBC’s Meet the Press show, “I accept it as a further confirmation of the reality that Joe Biden won the election.”On the same programme, Asa Hutchinson, the Republican governor of Arkansas, a state that Trump won, welcomed the president’s tweet. “It was good actually to see President Trump tweet out that (Biden) won. I think that’s the start of an acknowledgment,” he said.A growing number of Republicans, conservative pundits and media organisations have been calling for Trump to accept defeat, concede gracefully, facilitate a smooth transition of power, and leave office without further tarnishing his legacy with his unfounded allegations.Spurred by Trump’s allegations of election fraud and irregularities, thousands of his supporters - including white nationalists such as “Proud Boys” - rallied in Washington, DC on Saturday, chanting slogans such as “stop the steal”, inspired by his claims that he had won election and that it was stolen from him.The US president’s cavalcade drove past cheering supporters on his way to his golf course in the adjoining state of Virginia. He smiled and waved at them, but did not stop or make remarks as he had said he might.Tensions flared and violence broke out between Trump supporters and counter-protesters. The clashes intensified later in the evening as invectives were exchanged, punches were thrown and water bottles were hurled. At least 20 people were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-admits-joe-biden-won-but-insists-us-election-was-rigged/story-MsAnk0PPWdwCp6XdVClxaN.html
15-11-2020||World||US, Israel worked together to track and kill al-Qaida No. 2||The United States and Israel worked together to track and kill a senior al-Qaida operative in Iran earlier this year, a bold intelligence operation by the two allied nations that came as the Trump administration was ramping up pressure on Tehran.Four current and former US officials said Abu Mohammed al-Masri, al-Qaida’s No. 2, was killed by assassins in the Iranian capital in August. The U.S. provided intelligence to the Israelis on where they could find al-Masri and the alias he was using at the time, while Israeli agents carried out the killing, according to two of the officials. The two other officials confirmed al-Masri’s killing but could not provide specific details.Al-Masri was gunned down in a Tehran alley on Aug. 7, the anniversary of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Al-Masri was widely believed to have participated in the planning of those attacks and was wanted on terrorism charges by the FBI.Al-Masri’s death is a blow to al-Qaida, the terror network that orchestrated the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S, and comes amid rumors in the Middle East about the fate of the group’s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The officials could not confirm those reports but said the U.S. intelligence community was trying to determine their credibility.Two of the officials — one within the intelligence community and with direct knowledge of the operation and another former CIA officer briefed on the matter — said al-Masri was killed by Kidon, a unit within the secretive Israeli spy organization Mossad allegedly responsible for the assassination of high-value targets. In Hebrew, Kidon means bayonet or “tip of the spear.”The official in the intelligence community said al-Masri’s daughter, Maryam, was also a target of the operation. The U.S. believed she was being groomed for a leadership role in al-Qaida and intelligence suggested she was involved in operational planning, according to the official, who like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.Al-Masri’s daughter was the widow of Hamza bin Laden, the son of al-Qaida mastermind Osama bin Laden. He was killed last year in a U.S. counterterrorism operation in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.The news of al-Masri’s death was first reported by The New York Times.Both the CIA and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office, which oversees the Mossad intelligence agency, declined to comment.Israel and Iran are bitter enemies, with the Iranian nuclear program Israel’s top security concern. Israel has welcomed the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the 2015 Iranian nuclear accord and the U.S. pressure campaign on Tehran.At the time of the killings, the Trump administration was in the advanced stages of trying to push through the U.N. Security Council the reinstatement of all international sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the nuclear agreement. None of the other Security Council members went along with the U.S., which has vowed to punish countries that do not enforce the sanctions as part of its “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran.Israeli officials are concerned the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden could return to the nuclear accord. It is likely that if Biden does engage with the Iranians, Israel will press for the accord to be modified to address Iran’s long-range missile program and its military activity across the region, specifically in Syria and its support for groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, and Islamic Jihad.The revelations that Iran was harboring an al-Qaida leader could help Israel bolster its case with the new U.S. administration.Al-Masri had been on a kill or capture list for years. but his presence in Iran, which has a long history of hostility toward al-Qaida, presented significant obstacles to either apprehending or killing him.Iran denied the reports, saying the government is not harboring any al-Qaida leaders and blaming the U.S. and Israel for trying to foment anti-Iranian sentiment. U.S. officials have long believed a number of al-Qaida leaders have been living quietly in Iran for years and publicly released intelligence assessments have made that case.Al-Masri’s death, albeit under an assumed name, was reported in Iranian media on Aug. 8. Reports identified him as a Lebanese history professor potentially affiliated with Lebanon’s Iranian-linked Hezbollah movement and said he had been killed by motorcycle gunmen along with his daughter.Lebanese media, citing Iranian reports, said that those killed were Lebanese citizen Habib Daoud and his daughter Maraym.The deaths of al-Masri and his daughter occurred three days after the catastrophic Aug. 4 explosion at the port of Beirut and did not get much attention. Hezbollah never commented on reports and Lebanese security officials did not report that any citizens were killed in Tehran.A Hezbollah official on Saturday would not comment on al-Masri’s death, saying Iran’s foreign ministry had already denied it.The alleged killings seem to fit a pattern of behavior attributed to Israel in the past.In 1995, the founder of the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad was killed by a gunman on a motorcycle in Malta, in an assassination widely attributed to the Mossad. The Mossad also reportedly carried out a string of similar killings of Iranian nuclear scientists in Iran early last decade. Iran has accused Israel of being behind those killings.Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies and former analyst on Iranian affairs in the prime minister’s office, said it has been known for some time that Iran is hiding top al-Qaeda figures. While he had no direct knowledge of al-Masri’s death, he said a joint operation between the U.S. and Israel would reflect the two nations’ close intelligence cooperation, with the U.S. typically stronger in the technical aspects of intelligence gathering and Israel adept at operating agents behind enemy lines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-israel-worked-together-to-track-and-kill-al-qaida-no-2/story-K7GA1aiBKWRgawxAFWZwcP.html
15-11-2020||World||Brexit: ‘Crucial’ week ahead as negotiations over trade agreement yet to be finalised||Officials from both sides of the Brexit divide may still be far apart on key issues, but they seem united on one thing -- the coming week is crucial.Negotiations over a trade agreement have already passed a number of informal deadlines, but the two sides remain locked in talks.On Sunday, Britain’s chief Brexit negotiator David Frost said on Twitter that he was back in Brussels for more discussions with his European Union counterpart Michel Barnier. There has been “some progress in a positive direction in recent days,” he said, while cautioning that “we may not succeed.”With Britain’s Dec 31 exit fast approaching, both the UK and the bloc “recognize that time is very short,” Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News’ Ridge on Sunday.“This needs to be a week when things move, when we break through some of these difficult issues, and get a resolution, and at least have some sort of headlines of an agreement,” he said. “Otherwise it gets quite difficult and we do start to run out of time to implement it.”Still, he noted “you can always squeeze out extra time if you need to if you are nearly there.”The issues of state aid and fishing remain as sticking point, Eustice said. While both sides can see what a final agreement would look like, Brussels officials insist that reaching one will require the UK prime minister to move first, a stance their British counterparts reject.Also Read |  UK Prime Minister’s top aide Dominic Cummings quits, will leave by year-endSpeaking on the same program, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said negotiators were running out on time, and “this is move week.”The two sides have “got to make big progress this week,” he said.Even so, a deal may not be ratified if the British government reintroduces parts of the internal market bill struck out by the House of Lords, he said.Peers voted last week to remove the most controversial parts of that bill, which gives ministers the power to unilaterally rewrite parts of the Withdrawal Agreement that Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed with the European Union.The departure of top Johnson aide Dominic Cummings will have no impact on negotiations, Eustice said. Frost also tweeted that he “will not be changing” his position in the coming negotiations.The government will overrule Lords to put back those powers, which in any case would be rendered void by a trade agreement, according to Eustice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-crucial-week-ahead-as-negotiations-over-trade-agreement-yet-to-be-finalised/story-S2IBweSJXDi5V8a5sduFgO.html

15-11-2020||World||Israel pushes for East Jerusalem building before Donald Trump exits White House||Israel is pushing forward with controversial plans to develop a Jewish enclave in a strategic area of East Jerusalem, in the waning days of a Trump administration sympathetic to Israeli settlement activity.On Sunday, the Israel Land Authority solicited bids to build 1,257 apartments in the Givat Hamatos area, a project that was originally approved in 2014 but was delayed over international opposition. The new construction would drive a wedge between the West Bank and East Jerusalem, further cutting off Palestinians’ access to the city and dimming their hopes to establish a state capital in its eastern sector.“It’s been a longstanding red line,” said Amy Cohen, a spokeswoman for the Jerusalem based non-profit group Ir Amim, which seeks a negotiated resolution of the city’s status. “We see this very much in correlation to the imminent change in the US administration.”The project could create strains with the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has gone head-to-head with Israel in the past over building in East Jerusalem, seized from Jordan along with the West Bank during the 1967 Middle East war.Under President Donald Trump, the US has pursued policies uniquely favourable to Israel, including moving its embassy to Jerusalem and deeming Jewish settlements not illegal under international law. This week, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo is expected to visit a West Bank settlement during a visit to the region, something predecessors didn’t do to avoid the perception of legitimizing Israeli construction on captured land.Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh denounced the planned visit, saying “this dangerous precedent legalizes settlements.” A spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, called the advancement of the Givat Hamatos project “a continuation of the occupation government’s attempts to kill the internationally supported two-state solution.”Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office had no immediate comment on the project. It could take years to build and because it’s in a preliminary phase can still be stopped.The Givat Hamatos push follows a decision last week to expand another Jewish East Jerusalem enclave called Ramat Shlomo by about 100 new apartments. Building plans for Ramat Shlomo advanced during then-Vice President Biden’s visit to Israel in 2010 caused a diplomatic rift and subsequently led Netanyahu to temporarily and unofficially freeze new construction in East Jerusalem.The Israeli leader says Israel has a right to build anywhere in the city. Its annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war isn’t internationally recognized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-pushes-for-east-jerusalem-building-before-donald-trump-exits-white-house/story-cuNZxOojCHVRJEddQfc2rO.html
15-11-2020||World||Ethiopian rebels target Eritrea: Here’s what’s going on||Saturday’s missile strike by Ethiopia’s Tigray rebels is a sign that a conflict is brewing between the country’s ethnic minority, who once dominated the national government, and the current government of Nobel Peace Prize winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.“We will fight them (Eriteria) on all fronts with whatever means we have,” Debretsion Gebremichael, the leader of the Tigray region, told AP, and asserted that around 16 Eritrean divisions are fighting in what he termed a “full-scale war”.Who is Aiby Ahmed?Aiby Ahmed, the son of a Christian mother and a Muslim father, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his role as a mediator in the conflict with Eritrea, and in the regional conflict between the neighbouring nations of Sudan, South Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya and Somalia. The conflict comes at a time Ahmed is already battling on several fronts: Ethiopia is engaged in a stand-off with Egypt over a hydroelectric dam in the Nile, the country is fighting a debt-laden economy and a raging Covid-19 pandemic, and people of Ahmed’s Oromo tribe are growing dissatisfied with the lack of progress despite his many promises. Why did the federal government launch airstrikes on the Tigray region?Tigray is the northernmost region of Ethiopia, and home to the Tigrayan people, a politically affluent group, who account for only 6% of the country’s total population.The Tigrayans enjoyed unrestricted access to power in the federal government until the current Prime Minister took office. After fighting the military dictatorship that ruled Ethiopia in the 1970s and 1980s, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), emerged as the leader of the coalition, known as the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, that took power in Ethiopia in 1991. The coalition also consisted of four other parties and was divided along ethnic lines. Anti-government protests against the Democratic Font catapulted Aiby, who belongs to the Oromo ethnic group, to the Prime Minister’s office. Soon, Tigrayan officials were excommunicated from positions of power and Aiby pushed for a national integration under the federal government by reducing autonomy of regional players. This became a bone of contention between the two parties. A year ago, the TPLF withdrew from the ruling coalition after Abiy merged it with the nationwide Prosperity Party. The feud intensified after the TPLF decided to hold its own elections in September, defying the government’s orders of postponing polls due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Ethiopian lawmakers voted to cut funding to the region in October, a move that further enraged Tigray leaders.Following this, Tigray leaders announced the “closure” of their airspace, restricted road movement in the region, and declared that soldiers from the Northern Command of the Ethiopian military had defected and sided with the Tigray people, which the federal government has declared to be untrue. The Ethiopian government declared the regional Tigray government unlawful and TPLF retaliated by announcing it does not recognize Aiby’s administration anymore. In the final act which the International Crisis Group termed a “sudden and predictable” descent into conflict, Aiby announced on November 4 that TPLF had forced a military confrontation by attacking a federal military base in Tigray. The TPLF, in response, has called this a “deliberate concoction” by Aiby’s administration to justify their deployment of armed forces to the northern region. Experts fear a full-blown war between the federal forces and the TPLF, many of whom have fought in the Ethiopian-Eritrean war between 1998 and 2000, would cause serious unrest in the fragile Horn of Africa, impacting neighbours Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Sudan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopian-rebels-target-eritrea-here-s-what-s-going-on/story-EMm3zuVkpoGaOhysua4ilL.html

The government in the past couple of years has made its visa policy more flexible, offering longer residencies for certain types of investors, students, and professionals.All holders of doctorate degrees, medical doctors, and also computer, electronics, programming, electrical, and biotechnology engineers are eligible, UAE Vice President and the ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al- Maktoum said in a statementAlso eligible are those with specialised degrees in artificial intelligence, big data, and epidemiology, as well as high school students living in the UAE who rank top in the country and university students with a Grade Point Average(GPA) of 3.8 or higher. After first announcing a long-term visa plan in 2018, the UAE in 2019 started granting 5- and 10-year renewable visas to certain foreign investors, entrepreneurs, chief executives, scientists, and outstanding students.The emirate of Dubai, a Middle East trade and tourism hub, in September said it would grant visas renewable every five years to wealthy foreign retirees.

They would stay in the car, take a picture, wish us and leave,” the newlyweds added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-couple-in-uae-hosts-drive-by-wedding-ceremony-due-to-covid-19/story-YJaUBLncIZKm4vHsvP4OdO.html

While restaurants are closed, schools and shops so far remain open.Data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday that the number of confirmed cases in Germany increased by 16,947 to 790,503. Weekend figures tend to be lower as not all data is reported by local authorities.Altmaier said Germany should be wary of relaxing restrictions too quickly.“If we don’t want days with 50,000 new infections, as was the case in France a few weeks ago, we must see through this and not constantly speculate about which measures can be relaxed again,” he told Bild am Sonntag.“All countries that lifted their restrictions too early have so far paid a high price in terms of human lives lost.”His comments echoed those of other leading German policy makers. Among others, Health Minister Jens Spahn said at an online event of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative party on Saturday that hard weeks, possibly even months, lie ahead.The German chairman of the World Medical Association, Frank Ulrich Montgomery, warned of a possible shortage of beds and staffing problems in German hospitals.“My forecast is that we will have to talk about further restrictions rather than any easing”, he told daily Augsburger Allgemeine.German police fired water cannon during an anti-lockdown rally in Frankfurt on Saturday and eventually broke up the gathering as rules like wearing masks and socially distancing were not observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-economy-minister-warns-of-another-4-5-months-of-severe-covid-19-measures/story-0f6WB6ve9XDuNmdzgVgIJM.html
15-11-2020||World||Palestinians torn as Israel seeks Gulf tourists in Jerusalem||When the United Arab Emirates agreed to normalise relations with Israel, the Palestinians decried the move as a “betrayal” of both Jerusalem, where they hope to establish the capital of their future state, and the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the city’s holiest Muslim site.But with Israel now courting wealthy Gulf tourists and establishing new air links to the major travel hubs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Palestinians in east Jerusalem could soon see a tourism boon after months in which the coronavirus transformed the Holy City into a ghost town.“There will be some benefits for the Palestinian sector of tourism, and this is what I’m hoping for,” said Sami Abu-Dayyeh, a Palestinian businessman in east Jerusalem who owns four hotels and a tourism agency.“Forget about politics, we have to survive.” Palestinian leaders have sharply rejected the recent decisions by the UAE, Bahrain and Sudan to establish ties with Israel because they severely weakened a longstanding Arab consensus that recognition only be extended in return for Palestinian statehood.The Palestinians hope to establish a state including east Jerusalem and the West Bank, territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. Arab support, seen as a key form of leverage in decades of on-again, off-again peace negotiations, now appears to be evaporating, leaving the Palestinians arguably weaker and more isolated than at any point in recent history.In a striking development last week, a delegation of Israeli settlers visited the Emirates to discuss business opportunities. The Palestinians view settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem as the main obstacle to peace, and most of the international community considers them to be illegal.But the prospect of expanded religious tourism could end up benefiting Israelis and Palestinians alike, as wealthy Gulf tourists and Muslim pilgrims from further afield take advantage of new air links and improved relations to visit Al-Aqsa and other holy sites.Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital, and its Jerusalem Municipality is organizing conferences and seminars to help tourism operators market the city to Gulf travellers.Also Read | Israeli military strikes Hamas targets in Gaza after rockets“I’m very excited because I think it opens us up to a new era of Muslim tourism that we never really had,” said Fleur Hassan-Nahoum, the deputy mayor of Jerusalem. “Even though we have peace with Jordan and Egypt, I’ve never really seen any Egyptian tourists or Jordanian tourists because the peace wasn’t a warm peace.” Hassan-Nahoum, who recently visited the Emirates and is a co-founder of the UAE-Israel Business Council, said the municipality is reaching out to local Arab tour operators to ensure the benefits extend to all.“You have mixed feelings,” she said. “Some of them are a little bit suspicious, (but) most of them understand that this is going to be incredibly prosperous for them, because ultimately they’re Arab speaking and so they have, I think, a unique advantage.” Abu-Dayyeh expects up to 28 flights a day arriving in Tel Aviv from Dubai and Abu Dhabi, global travel hubs for long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad, making it easier for travelers from the Far East and South America to reach the Holy Land.He’s confident Palestinian operators will be able to compete. “We’re on the ground here and we’ve been giving this service for many years, for hundreds of years,” he said.Other Palestinians appear to be more skeptical. More than a dozen Palestinian shop owners in Jerusalem’s Old City, which is largely shut down because of the coronavirus, declined to comment on the push for Gulf tourism, saying it was too politically sensitive.There are also concerns that an Israeli push to promote tourism to Al-Aqsa could heighten tensions.The hilltop esplanade in the Old City, home to the Al-Aqsa mosque and the iconic Dome of the Rock shrine, is the third holiest site in Islam. It is also the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the two biblical temples in ancient times.The site is a raw nerve in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and tensions have soared in recent years as religious and nationalist Jews have visited in ever-larger numbers, escorted by the Israeli police.Last month a delegation of Emirati officials visited the site, entering through a gate normally used by Israelis and under an Israeli security escort. A small group of Palestinians heckled them.

The Israeli government says it is committed to the status quo.“Any visitor from outside Palestine must coordinate with the Waqf,” Sabri said. “But any visitor from the side of the occupation, we do not welcome or accept them.” He acknowledged that the visiting Emiratis may have been unaware of the complex arrangement and said the heckling was a “reaction” by individuals to them entering with Israeli security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-torn-as-israel-seeks-gulf-tourists-in-jerusalem/story-2GL1TTEzQZ7dzJqu4SqMUN.html
15-11-2020||World||Philippines hit by worst floods in 45 years, typhoon deaths rise||The number of fatalities from the deadliest cyclone to hit the Philippines this year has climbed to 67, while many areas remained submerged in a northern region hit by the worst flooding in more than four decades, officials said on Sunday. President Rodrigo Duterte flew to Tuguegarao province to assess the situation in Cagayan Valley region, which was heavily flooded after Typhoon Vamco dumped rain over swathes of the main Luzon island, including the capital, metropolitan Manila. Twenty-two fatalities were recorded in Cagayan, 17 in southern Luzon, eight in Metro Manila, and 20 in two other regions, said Mark Timbal, the disaster management agency spokesman.Twelve people were still missing and nearly 26,000 houses were damaged by Vamco, he said.“This is the worst flooding that we had in the last 45 years,” Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba said during a briefing with Duterte. “We see that it is worsening every year.”The accumulated effects of weather disturbances and huge volumes of water from a dam affected thousands of families in Cagayan, some of whom had fled to rooftops to escape two-storey high floods.Six cyclones hit the Philippines in a span of just four weeks, including Vamco and Super Typhoon Goni, the world’s most powerful this year.But Mamba also lamented about denuded forests in Cagayan, prompting Duterte to order him to curb logging operations in the province.“We always talk about illegal logging and mining but nothing has been done about it,” Duterte said.Relief and rescue operations continued in Cagayan even as the nearby Magat Dam was still releasing water, two days after releasing a volume equivalent to two Olympic sized pools per second, based on government data.Vamco, the 21st cyclone to hit the Philippines this year, also caused the worst flooding in years in parts of the capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-hit-by-worst-floods-in-45-years-typhoon-deaths-rise/story-2Tv2cD9kZUKJCJ1G8CgXaI.html
15-11-2020||World||All you need to know about the RCEP trade pact||The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, was signed virtually on Sunday during the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).Fourteen countries under the initiative of China have formally agreed to form the world’s largest free trade bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity. After 8 long years of negotiations the deal was finally sealed as leaders world over are anxious to nudge their pandemic hit economies back on track. What is RCEP?The RCEP is a trade bloc conceptualised in 2012 that includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. India too was a part of the negotiations but withdrew last year.The bloc encompasses 2.1 billion people, with RCEP’s members accounting for around 30 per cent of the global GDP. Its aim is to lower tariffs, open up trade in services, and promote investment to help economies from Asia to Australia be at par with the rest of the world. It also briefly covers intellectual property, but makes no mention of environmental protections and labour rights.The RCEP was born after former US president Barack Obama announced a multinational trade deal - the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) - that would have excluded China. Why is India not a signatory?Indian pharmaceutical companies were all in favour of the RCEP because they wanted to import generic drugs to China, but fears that cheaper products from China would “flood” the market, and a $50 billion trade deficit with China kept the Indian government from joining.Textile, agriculture, and dairy were three industries that were expected to be hit particularly hard if cheaper goods were readily available in the market. Even though doors have been kept open for India, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) secretary (east) Riva Ganguly Das said at the 17th ASEAN-India virtual summit, “Our position is known. As far as India is concerned, we did not join RCEP as it does not address our outstanding issues and concerns.” Why is China pushing for RCEP?TPP, the largest regional trade accord in history, would have set new terms for trade and business investment among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations. It became a cause for discontent in the United States across party lines, and when Donald Trump took office all plans for TPP were shelved. Obama’s successor started an entrenched trade war with China, abandoning all plans of seeking cooperation with the budding economies of Asia, and hit China with high tariffs. Unable to find a market for its goods, China began to look for consumers within Asia and hence RCEP began to gain prominence.China has an annual surplus of almost $1 trillion, i.e. it sells much more than it buys from other countries. Almost half of that surplus is due to its trade with the US. An entrenched trade war with the US threatens China with dire consequences, no other country can buy as much as the US does. In the first half of 2019, after the trade war began, China’s overall exports to the US declined by 8.5% and rose by only 2.1% with the rest of the world. Faced by a production surplus, China was forced to lower its own high tariffs in May last year. Emphasis was put on labour intensive and low tech industries producing goods which its immediate neighbours would be more interested in buying. This current push to seal the deal on the RCEP comes from China’s anxieties about the policies of US President-elect Joe Biden, who has given no indication that Trump’s China policies would be recalled. The European Union too has been opening its eyes to the atrocities committed by the Chinese Communist Parties in the Xinjiang region. Both Trump and the EU’s push to stop doing business with Chinese military-backed tech companies like Hikvision and Huawei amongst others has added to the communist nation’s anxieties, as it continues to push forward with renewed vigour for a comprehensive trade pact to insulate itself from the storm Beijing knows is coming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-rcep-trade-pact/story-goXyovzVYmDb2ExKz7g6CM.html

Instead, large importing economies are generally powerful, partly as their currencies are directly used in settlements of transactions, he said.China’s exports have stayed largely resilient amid the Covid-19 global pandemic, as strong demand for medical supplies and reduced manufacturing capacity elsewhere worked in its favour.Its exports grew at the fastest pace in 19 months in October, while imports also rose but slower than analyst forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-will-import-over-22-trillion-worth-of-goods-over-the-next-decade-xi-jinping/story-OTf5sheM9JLzruwEXCalFJ.html

There is still very less we know about the disease and the researchers are working day and night to gather more and more information about the viral disease and its cure.In a major win against the Covid-19 researchers have identified that an Arthritis drug can help in reducing the mortality rate in elderly people by 71%. As per the findings, a daily pill of baricitinib along with standard care can reduce the deaths by 71% in Covid-19 patients with moderate or severe infection.The drug is marketed under the name Olumiant and is available for rheumatoid arthritis for only three years now.The latest findings can be encouraging for medics as they are hoping the arthritis drug could help save most vulnerable to coronavirus that are elderly people.The research is led by the researchers in Karolinska Institute in Sweden.As many as 53,945,763 people have been infected by the Covid-19 across the world. Most of the fresh cases were reported from the United States and Europe. While 1,311,427 others have succumbed to the disease.Meanwhile, on vaccine front, US-based pharmaceutical company recently announced that the vaccine, it is developing in joint cooperation with Germany’s BioNTech is 90% effective in preventing infections in the ongoing Phase 3 trials.The findings were based on an interim analysis conducted after 94 participants contracted the illness. The trial will continue until 164 cases have occurred. The preliminary results pave the way for the companies to seek an emergency-use authorization from regulators if further research shows the shot is also safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arthritis-drug-can-reduce-mortality-rate-in-covid-19-patients-by-71-study/story-EHoV7dBtUBU0ao1KwGPYKI.html

This trip will be SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft’s first voyage after NASA certified it for regular flights to the ISS as part of its Commercial Crew Program, following a successful initial test flight on May 31 with two astronauts.Besides being the US space agency’s first commercial launch, the Crew-1 mission is also the first NASA-staffed mission licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The regulator is undertaking responsibility for public safety because the flight is to be carried out by a commercial company, Elon Musk’s SpaceX.The crew has named the spacecraft ‘Resilience’. Hopkins will be the Crew Dragon Commander while Glover the pilot. Both Walker and Noguchi are mission specialists.NASA and SpaceX will use the learnings from the August 2 test flight to make this mission better. The company has bolstered parts of the Dragon’s heat shield, strengthened some areas of the capsule so it can hold out against rougher seas, and fine-tuned so that the landing parachutes deploy at a slightly higher altitude. When the crew returns in the spring of 2021 NASA will ensure a larger flotilla of Coast Guard ships is deployed to keep recreational boaters awayThe four astronauts will remain onboard the ISS and join their three teammates who are already docked there.

Hundreds of thousands of pro-Trump protesters marched in the capital city to back the baseless claims of electoral fraud, holding different events like Million MAGA March, the March for Trump and Stop the Steal DC.Small groups of counterprotesters also gathered in different parts of the city to support President-election Joe Biden’s win, leading to clashes with law enforcement and pro-Trump protesters. Taking to Twitter, the US President said that Antifa tried attacking his “innocent” supporters present at the MAGA rally but had to “ran for the hills” because they “aggressively fought back.” “Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM was easily rebuffed today by the big D.C. MAGA Rally crowd, only to return at night, after 99% of the crowd had left, to assault elderly people and families. Police got there, but late. Mayor is not doing her job!” Trump tweeted.Also Read | Pro-Trump march: Who are ‘Proud Boys’ and ‘Three Percenters’?What is Antifa?According to Merriam-Webster, the first known use of the term ‘Antifa’ was during Nazi Germany and is “borrowed from German Antifa, short for antifaschistisch.” It remains a vaguely defined militant political activist movement which identifies itself as anti-fascist. The members of the far-left group describe themselves as revolutionaries with anti-capitalist and anti-government views. Antifa members use a range of tactics to disrupt the events held by alt-right groups which they deem fascists. They dress in black and the most extreme factions of the far-left movement carry pepper spray, knives, bricks and chains. According to an AOL report, Antifa defends the use of violence to combat the “fascist” forces and call it appropriate tactics against Trump’s “unprecedented levels of surveillance, incarceration, deportations, and police brutality and murders against the US Public”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pro-trump-march-what-is-antifa-that-us-president-accused-of-attacking-his-supporters/story-i4hxfL7LIUfpyZqUiVxz3N.html

The research conducted from October 28 to November 4 while interviewing over 1,000 respondents, revealed that half of the Pakistanis blame the federal government for inflation.Geo News reported that only 15 per cent of the respondents said they blamed previous governments for it, a narrative the PTI and Prime Minister Imran Khan have been attempting to establish since day one in power. Forty-nine per cent held the Centre responsible for the crisis, 17 per cent considered provincial governments responsible while only 8 per cent blamed an unknown mafia. The ratio of those considering the federal government responsible for inflation was the highest (59 per cent) in Balochistan, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 58 per cent, 46 per cent in Punjab and 44 per cent in Sindh.The survey also revealed that price hikes have affected a whopping 97 per cent of the respondents. Ipsos asked respondents whether they are worried about increasing prices to which 88 per cent of respondents said they were. According to the survey, 4 in 5 Pakistanis (83 per cent) faced cuts in their income due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-half-of-pakistanis-blame-imran-khan-govt-for-inflation-survey/story-0zMmjoF7UPUItNnoPtS82N.html
15-11-2020||World||Pressure mounts on Peru’s president after 2 die in protests||Pressure mounted on Peru’s interim president to resign Sunday after a night of protests in which two people were killed and the country’s political turmoil deepened. At least nine of Manuel Merino’s Cabinet members quit and the president of Congress scheduled an emergency session to discuss the leader’s resignation.The chaotic events came as thousands marched through the streets of Lima wearing masks and carrying signs that read, “Merino is not my president.” Authorities said two men, ages 24 and 25, died from gunshot wounds during the demonstrations.Merino, a little-known politician and rice farmer, rose to Peru’s highest office Monday after the legislature voted to oust former President Martín Vizcarra. Lawmakers utilized a clause dating back to the 19th century to declare the president of “permanent moral incapacity” based on unproven allegations that he’d accepted bribes while serving as governor years ago.Read more | -70° celsius: Deep-freeze hurdle makes Pfizer’s vaccine one for the richAngry Peruvians have taken to the streets ever since in daily demonstrations accusing Congress of staging a parliamentary coup. Merino, who until recently served as the head of Congress, did not immediately respond to the growing calls for his resignation after Saturday’s protests.Earlier Saturday, the embattled leader denied the protests were against him, telling a local radio station that young people were demonstrating against unemployment and not being able to complete their studies amid the coronavirus pandemic. Peru has the world’s highest per-capita Covid-19 mortality rate and has seen one of the region’s worst economic contractions this year. Prime Minister Ántero Flores-Aráoz told RPP radio early Sunday he’d been trying to get ahold of the president without any luck.The protests are unlike any seen in recent years, fueled largely by young people typically apathetic to the country’s notoriously turbulent politics who view Vizcarra’s ouster as a power grab by lawmakers.Polls show most Peruvians wanted Vizcarra to stay in office. The ex-president is popular for his anti-corruption crusade, which led to frequent clashes with the legislature, where half of the members are themselves under investigation.“I am very sad over the deaths caused by the repression of this illegal and illegitimate government,” Vizcarra wrote on Twitter. “The country won’t let the deaths of these brave youths go unpunished.”International rights organizations have warned that police are using excessive force in trying to quell the protests. Dozens have been injured by rubber bullets and tear gas has been deployed near homes and hospitals.“We are documenting cases of police brutality in downtown Lima,” José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director of Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter. “Everything indicates repression against peaceful protesters is intensifying.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-mounts-on-peru-s-president-after-2-die-in-protests/story-G3b7J0wrMoBnuCuC0C0l3K.html

After completing his term in New York, Giuliani embarked on a career on the speaking circuit, demanding as much as $200,000 per engagement. After this, he launched a failed attempt at the presidency, ending up with just one delegate to his name.Trump campaign and GiulianiTrump’s campaign for the presidency in 2016 offered Giuliani a chance at reinvention and this is where Trump and his friendship began. He also advised the president on the legality of his “Muslim ban” and he helped Trump dig up dirt on the Biden family’s connection to Ukraine during the 2020 campaign.Giuliani’s role nowAs the presidency has slipped away from Trump, Giuliani has taken the role of reinstating Trump in the White House with legal cases and tweets like, “682K mail-in ballots in Philidelphia and Allegheny County were counted WITHOUT observers present. A direct violation of a Court Order. UNCONSTITUTIONAL and irredeemably compromised.” 682K mail-in ballots in Philidelphia and Allegheny County were counted WITHOUT observers present.

15-11-2020||World||Explained: What is presidential pardon and can Trump use it as his presidency nears end?||Donald Trump has faced a glut of legal challenges including lawsuits, fraud allegations and tax evasion allegations during his years as US President. But as his presidency enters its final weeks, Trump is deeply aware that once he formally exits the White House (on January 20 next year), he would not have the extensive legal protections that he hitherto enjoys.In 2018, he tweeted, “As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!” As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!What is a presidential pardon?All US presidents have the constitutional right to pardon or commute the sentence of people who have broken federal laws. The power to pardon cannot be restricted even by the Congress, therefore making it a limitless power that applies only to federal crimes and not state crimes. Thus, the pardons are not questioned and no reason has to be provided for the same.Can Trump pardon himself?Since there is no precedent of a president pardoning himself in US history, the legality of the issue has not been clear. Although Trump has insisted over the years that he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself. But a presidential pardon would not be able to protect Trump completely as pardons can only be given for federal crimes and therefore he may have to face trials in the state crimes. Trump can use this power- like previous presidents- to pardon his friends and family as this happened in 2019 as well when Trump commuted the prison sentence of his long-time ally Roger Stone.Read more | Explained: What new ruling says about DACA and the way ahead for TrumpCan vice president Mike Pence pardon Trump?Experts have been saying that Trump could use the 25th amendment of the US constitution which allows an incapacitated president to temporarily resign and hand over the reins to the vice president, who will act on his behalf until he returns to the office during which Pence could pardon Trump.

The 56-year-old Harris, a senator, former prosecutor and the running mate of President-elect Joe Biden, will notch a slew of firsts when she is sworn in on January 20: as the first US female vice president and the first Black in that position, as well as the first person of South Asian descent. “Together, we showed little girls across the country what’s possible,” she said Friday on Twitter. Together, we showed little girls across the country what’s possible. pic.twitter.com/f6wxtPWOtdIt was the latest echo of a speech Hillary Clinton delivered in 2016 in recognizing her defeat by Donald Trump.“I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling” -- that of the White House -- “but someday someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think,” the defeated Democratic candidate said. Clinton then directed these words of encouragement to the country’s “little girls”: “Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.” Since Clinton pronounced those words four years ago, women have transformed the face of American politics -- both in Congress and, soon, in the White House. “With Kamala Harris, a lot of glass ceilings were shattered in one day,” said Amy Dacey, a former chief executive of the Democratic National Committee now at American University. Ron Klain, whom Biden has named as his chief of staff, has said Harris will play a “significant” role, Dacey noted. “And I think (Biden will) bring in a lot of women at all levels of the administration.”Analysts expect Biden to appoint either progressive senator Elizabeth Warren or Federal Reserve official Lael Brainard, a former Treasury undersecretary, to head the Treasury -- a position never filled by a woman.Read more | US Election 2020: Thousands rally behind Donald Trump, believing he won race he lostThe United States might also see its first woman secretary of defense.

Several women have served Trump as senior advisors or as White House spokesperson. But the Republican billionaire has also frequently sparked controversy with insulting or sexist comments about women. In October, he referred to Harris as a “monster.” There are currently 127 women in Congress, or 23.7 percent of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives and the 100 in the Senate. While that percentage will rise to 26 percent in January, women still have far to go -- they represent half the US population. Democratic women will claim 105 seats in Congress (89 in the House and 16 in the Senate). Republican women, for their part, will occupy 35 seats (27 in the House and eight in the Senate) -- considerably fewer than their Democratic counterparts but still a big increase from the current 22. Women Republican candidates “performed better than expected,” Dittmar said.“They would still be significantly under-represented, but this should send a message about both their electability, and hopefully increase their influence within the party to ensure that more women get elected in the future.” Asked on Friday about the record number of Republican women elected, House speaker Nancy Pelosi -- the first woman to occupy that position -- said she would “congratulate and welcome each and every one of them.”But then the Democratic speaker, rounding the House total upward, quickly emphasized that her party was still doing better by women, casually adding:“Of course, we have 90.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-leads-record-wave-of-elected-women-changing-face-of-us-politics/story-w24toOOFLBN6xmcJhjmsNN.html

The number of confirmed cases spiked by 4,617 to reach 2,91,648, while 43 more deaths were reported, pushing up the total toll to 10,871.According to the outlet Global News, four provinces recorded their highest single-day spikes in cases including the two worst affected ones: Ontario and Quebec.In a statement, Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam warned things could get worse, saying, “Though the cumulative number is high and continues to increase, with many areas experiencing accelerated growth, it is important to remember that the vast majority of Canadians remain susceptible to Covid-19.”Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned that the Christmas season, with celebrations and family gatherings, could be jeopardised if these numbers kept escalating and pleaded with Canadians to be careful. He had also called for virtual celebrations of the Diwali festival in the country, which was echoed by Tam.Tam called for a “a collective effort to support and sustain the public health response”.The provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta reported their worst daily surge in cases since the pandemic began. Even the remote Arctic territory of Nunavut doubled its tally from four to eight. Leaders have signalled that some lockdown measures may have to be reimposed to curb the spread if this trend continues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-sees-onset-of-winter-surge-as-key-provinces-report-record-spikes-in-covid-19-cases/story-yUh8z1hE9X9Z1dgjzZM65O.html
15-11-2020||World||Nobel UN food agency warns 2021 will be worse than 2020||The head of the World Food Program says the Nobel Peace Prize has given the UN agency a spotlight and megaphone to warn world leaders that next year is going to be worse than this year, and without billions of dollars “we are going to have famines of biblical proportions in 2021.”David Beasley said in an interview with The Associated Press that the Norwegian Nobel Committee was looking at the work the agency does every day in conflicts, disasters and refugee camps, often putting staffers’ lives at risk to feed millions of hungry people -- but also to send “a message to the world that it’s getting worse out there ... (and) that our hardest work is yet to come.”“It was so timely because we’ve been fighting to get above the choir,” Beasley said of last month’s award, pointing to the news being dominated by the U.S. elections and the Covid-19 pandemic, and the difficulty of getting global attention focused on “the travesty that we’re facing around the world.”“So this was really a gift from above,” Beasley said, recalling the surprise and delight of WFP’s 20,000 staffers worldwide, and his own shock at being interrupted during a meeting in Niger in Africa’s Sahel region with the news.Beasley recalled his warning to the UN Security Council in April that as the world was dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, it was also “on the brink of a hunger pandemic” that could lead to “multiple famines of biblical proportions” within a few months if immediate action wasn’t taken.“We were able to avert it in 2020 ... because the world leaders responded with money, stimulus packages, deferral of debt,” he said.Now, Beasley said, Covid-19 is surging again, economies are continuing to deteriorate particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and there is another wave of lockdowns and shutdowns.But he said the money that was available in 2020 isn’t going to be available in 2021, so he has been using the Nobel to meet leaders virtually and in person, talk to parliaments, and give speeches to sensitize those with power to “this tragedy that we are facing -- crises that really are going to be extraordinary over the next, who knows, 12 to 18 months.”“Everybody now wants to meet with the Nobel Peace Prize winner,” Beasley said, explaining he now gets 45 minutes instead of 15 minutes with leaders and is able to go into depth and explain how bad things are going to be next year and how leaders are going to have to prioritize programs. “And the response has really been good,” he said.“I’m telling them you’re not going to have enough money to fund all the projects you historically fund,” he said.“Those are important things,” Beasley said, but he likened the upcoming crisis to the Titanic saying “right now, we really need to focus on icebergs, and icebergs are famine, starvation, destabilization and migration.”Beasley said WFP needs $15 billion next year -- $5 billion just to avert famine and $10 billion to carry out the agency’s global programs including for malnourished children and school lunches which are often the only meal youngsters get.“If I could get that coupled with our normal money, then we avert famine around the world” and minimize destabilization as well as migration. he said.In addition to raising extra money from governments, Beasley said, his other “great hope” is that billionaires that have made billions during the Covid-19 pandemic will step up on a one-time basis. He plans to start pushing this message probably in December or January.In April, Beasley said 135 million people faced “crisis levels of hunger or worse.” A WFP analysis then showed that Covid-19 could push an additional 130 million people “to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020.”He said in Wednesday’s virtual interview from Rome, where WFP is based, that while famine was averted this year, the number of people facing crisis levels of hunger is increasing toward 270 million.“There’s about three dozen countries that could possibly enter the famine conditions if we don’t have the money we need,” Beasley said.According to a joint analysis by WFP and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in October, 20 countries “are likely to face potential spikes in high acute food insecurity” in the next three to six months, “and require urgent attention.”Of those, Yemen, South Sudan, northeastern Nigeria and Burkina Faso have some areas that “have reached a critical hunger situation following years of conflict or other shocks,” the UN agencies said, and any further deterioration in coming months “could lead to a risk of famine.”Other countries requiring “urgent attention” are Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Lebanon, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Sierra Leone, Somali, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, they said.Beasley said a Covid-19 vaccine “will create some optimism that hopefully will help jump the economies around the world, particularly the Western economies. But the WFP executive director said there’s already been $17 billion of economic stimulus this year “and we’re not going to have that globally.”“We’re very, very, very concerned” that with deferred debt payments for low- and middle-income countries resuming in January, new lockdowns and the rippling economic impact, “2021’s going to be a very bad year,” Beasley said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-un-food-agency-warns-2021-will-be-worse-than-2020/story-QJCR8cyEZfMNktXtHA8geK.html
15-11-2020||World||Explained: What new ruling says about DACA and the way ahead for Trump||A judge on Saturday rejected the White House’s limitations on the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program which protects 700,000 so-called “Dreamers”, or undocumented migrants, brought to the United States as children. The federal judge in New York ruled that Donald Trump’s acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf was not lawfully serving in his role when he issued the new rules for the DACA program in July. The ruling is another victory for proponents of the Barack Obama-era program after the US supreme court in June rejected Trump’s cancellation of it.Here’s everything you need to know about DACA:What is DACA?The recipients of DACA are young people who have grown up as Americans. As most of these young people had no way to gain legal residency even though they have lived in the US most of their lives, the DREAM Act provided a pathway to US citizenship to certain undocumented youth who go to college and/or serve in the military while maintaining a good record. Therefore, DACA enables certain people who came to the US as children and meet several key guidelines to request consideration for deferred action; allowing non-US citizens who qualify to remain in the country for two years, subject to renewal.What happened in June 2020?On June 18, 2020, the supreme court blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to end DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) in a 5-4 ruling and maintained the program, allowing DACA recipients to renew membership. In 2017, President Trump ordered an end to the DACA program which was issued in an executive order in 2012 by then President Obama. After the Trump administration ordered an end to DACA, several lawsuits were filed against the order. Two federal appellate courts have now ruled against the administration, allowing previous DACA recipients to renew their deferred action, and the supreme court agreed to review the legal challenges. The Supreme Court asked us to resubmit on DACA, nothing was lost or won. They "punted", much like in a football game (where hopefully they would stand for our great American Flag). We will be submitting enhanced papers shortly in order to properly fulfil the Supreme Court’s.....What is the fresh controversy on DACA?Saturday’s ruling said that Chad Wolf, who has not been confirmed in his role by the US senate, issued new restrictions on the program in response to the supreme court ruling. Thus, his restrictions “effectively suspended” DACA and said that new applications would not be accepted as renewals would be limited to one year instead of two. All these restrictions were declared invalid by the supreme court because “the court holds that Mr. Wolf was not lawfully serving as acting secretary of homeland security” when he issued the restrictions.What is the way ahead for the Trump administration?The ruling is the second defeat for the Trump administration after June 2020 as Trump entered office promising to halt almost all immigration and end the DACA program. It is still unclear what steps the Trump administration would take. On the other hand, President-elect Joe Biden, who defeated Trump in the November 3 polls, has pledged to reinstate the DACA program when he takes office on January 20.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-new-ruling-says-about-daca-and-the-way-ahead-for-trump/story-AyIOXIvpNKdjaQCm9rWe0J.html
15-11-2020||World||US Elections 2020: Why poll watcher complaints don’t amount to fraud||President Donald Trump’s legal allies have launched a flurry of lawsuits arguing that widespread fraud could have been committed because its poll watchers didn’t get proper access to the voting process. Most of those lawsuits have been dismissed over lack of evidence of election fraud. There is tremendous evidence of wide spread voter fraud in that there is irrefutable proof that our Republican poll watchers and observers were not allowed to be present in poll counting rooms. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and others. Unconstitutional!Trump has tried to argue that there is a link between some of the complaints of partisan poll watchers and the results of the election. But till now, he has been unable to validate his assertions. Who is a poll watcher?A poll watcher is a partisan appointee who monitors voting or ballot counting to help ensure their party gets a fair shot. They are not supposed to interfere in the electoral process, except to report issues to party officials or polling place authorities, and are typically required to register in advance with the local election office. Poll watchers are designated by a political party or campaign to report any concerns that they may have. Monitoring polling places and election offices is allowed in most states, but rules vary and there are certain limits to avoid any harassment or intimidation.Were Trump’s poll watchers denied access? The Trump campaign said from the beginning that republican poll watchers were being improperly denied access to observe the counting of ballots. But election officials in key battleground states said that rules were being followed and they were committed to transparency. In Pennsylvania, for example, state election officials said poll watchers were certified in every county. Even republican lawyers acknowledged in court that they had observers watching polls and mail-in ballots being processed. In Michigan, a Trump campaign lawsuit included assertions from their observers that poll workers rolled their eyes when viewing votes for Trump, wore masks or clothing supporting the Black Lives Matter movement or appeared to double-count ballots. Other lawsuits claimed poll watchers were temporarily denied access in some locations, but there has been no evidence to back it up. Was there any voter fraud in the elections then?The federal cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency has called the voting and count “the most secure in American history.” But Trump’s legal allies continue to argue without any evidence that their poll workers weren’t on hand and anything could have happened out of their view.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-why-poll-watcher-complaints-don-t-amount-to-fraud/story-Qgbe7iHw3sTdAuTMaHaRPI.html

Pashinyan had come under pressure with thousands of demonstrators protesting since Tuesday and demanding he resign over a ceasefire that secured territorial advances for Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh after six weeks of fighting.The NSS said its former head Artur Vanetsyan, the former head of the Republican Party parliamentary faction Vahram Baghdasaryan and war volunteer Ashot Minasyan were under arrest.“The suspects were planning to illegally usurp power by murdering the prime minister and there were already potential candidates being discussed to replace him,” the NSS said in a statement.Read more | Thousands in Armenia protest Nagorno-Karabakh truce termsPashinyan said earlier this week he had no choice but to sign the agreement to prevent further territorial losses. He said he was taking personal responsibility for the setbacks, but rejected calls to step down.The ceasefire halted military action in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated by ethnic Armenians. Under the agreement, 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are being deployed to the region. Since the early 1990s, ethnic Armenians had held military control over all of Nagorno-Karabakh and substantial swathes of Azeri territory surrounding it. They have now lost much of the enclave itself as well as the surrounding territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenia-says-prevented-assassination-attempt-on-prime-minister/story-w0XzbmI2RuTmnbubeLAPwL.html

Biden’s election has caused some unease in Taiwan.Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan’s representative in Washington and close to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, spoke to Blinken by telephone to convey Taiwan’s congratulations to Biden, Hsiao said on Twitter on Saturday.“Appreciated bipartisan support for US relations with Taiwan and hope to continue close cooperation with the US in coming years,” she added.Read more | Republicans face court setbacks, Donald Trump law firm steps downTsai met Blinken in 2015 at the State Department when he was deputy secretary of state and she was the presidential candidate for Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). On that trip, Tsai also became the first Taiwanese presidential candidate to visit the White House, meeting Evan Medeiros, President Barack Obama’s senior director for Asian Affairs.“It is thus clear that the government of the Democratic Party had a friendly attitude towards Taiwan,” Tsai said in a DPP-issued statement on Wednesday. With his decades of experience on Capitol Hill, at the White House and as the former No. 2 at the State Department, Blinken is widely seen in Washington as a natural fit to be Biden’s national security adviser or a possible pick for secretary of state.Biden, a Democrat, has not discussed what role Blinken will fill in the new administration. Tensions over Taiwan have escalated dramatically since Republican Trump took office four years ago, with China mounting regular military drills near the island, including during visits earlier this year to Taipei by senior US officials.Taiwanese officials are due in Washington this week for trade talks, and the island has expressed confidence these will continue under the new administration, pointing to bipartisan US support for Taiwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-hopes-for-close-us-cooperation-in-call-with-biden-adviser/story-E4mGCNCtI8nUlgDQo1DJmO.html
15-11-2020||World||Mexico reaches 1 million coronavirus cases, nears 100,000 deaths||Mexico on Saturday topped 1 million registered coronavirus cases and nearly 100,000 test-confirmed deaths, though officials agree the number is probably much higher.What is more, officials in Mexico claim science is on their side. Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell says any wider testing would be “a waste of time, effort and money.” Face masks, López-Gatell says, “are an auxiliary measure to prevent spreading the virus. They do not protect us, but they are useful for protecting other people.”President Andres Manuel López Obrador almost never wears a mask, and López-Gatell only occasionally does. Except science does not appear to be on their side. International experts have recommended mass testing, and say face masks protect both the wearer and other people.“They say there is no evidence. No, excuse me, there is evidence,” said former health secretary Dr. José Narro. “In May, we already began to have empirical evidence and well-documented scientific studies began to appear stressing the importance of face masks and the need for testing.”“What I can say is the (government) strategy did not have the necessary flexibility to adjust to the increasing amount of knowledge” about the disease, Narro said. In part that has been a hallmark of López Obrador’s administration: never back down, never change course, and if challenged, double down. His main promise to Mexicans is that there would be enough hospital beds for everyone who needs one, and his government has largely fulfilled that basic promise — even if Mexicans are so afraid of those hospitals they often wait until the last moment to go for treatment, at which point, doctors say, it’s often too late. That fear was not unfounded; early in the pandemic, three-quarters of patients intubated and put on ventilators in Mexico’s largest hospital network died.Read more | Clashes erupt between protest groups as thousands rally for Trump, police step inThat resistance was what Mexico City human resources manager Lorena Salas felt when her 76-year-old father, Jaime Salas Osuna, began to show signs of what could be Covid-19.“The idea was mainly to stay at home, no? Thinking of going to the hospital was not an option, we were terrified that there he would surely be infected,” said Salas. Instead, she sped down to the resort city of Acapulco, where her father lived, and when she arrived, she found him thin, sweating and confused.“At that moment the delivery service arrived with the oxygen meter, and his oxygen saturation was 77,” she recalled. (A normal reading is 93 to 98). “At that moment I felt like a bucket of cold water had fallen on me. We just looked at each other. I said ‘Dad, do you have Covid?”Salas drove him to Mexico City; he didn’t want to be intubated, but doctors explained they had to. He underwent two operations, two intubations and struggled for 13 days before he died on October 20. To its credit, that is one of the few areas where the government’s public message has changed: where officials once urged people with the disease to stay home as long as possible, they now advise those over 60 or with risk factors like diabetes or obesity to seek treatment immediately.But on most other points, the insistence that the rest of the world is wrong and Mexico’s approach is right appears to have taken a toll in lives. Late Saturday, Mexican Director General of Health Promotion Ricardo Cortés Alcalá announced that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had reached 1,003,253, with at least 98,259 deaths from Covid-19. Since the pandemic began, Mexico has managed to administer only about 2.5 million tests to its citizens; only seriously ill people get tested in Mexico. Testing only 1.9% of the population since the pandemic began has made it hard, if not impossible, to effectively trace contacts, catch outbreaks early or identify asymptomatic cases.Even in Mexico City, one of the few places that has paid lip-service to trying to identify cases before they get to a hospital, the efforts have been incredibly weak. To be fair, few countries have managed to do contact tracing well; Mexico, with fewer financial resources and where half the population is poor, self-employed or working off the books, there was little chance of strict control or surveillance.Mexico City has tried an alternative approach, which is to identify neighborhoods where clusters of cases have occurred, and give them special attention. Lurid yellow warning posters reading “Caution! You are entering an area of high infection” now dot the city. Special kiosks are set up in such neighborhoods to provide some tests, and a few health workers have gone door-to-door looking for cases. But that is rare. For doctors on the front lines, the official response has been at times frustrating.Dr. Arturo Galindo, head of the infectious disease program at the National Medical Sciences and Nutrition Institute, one of Mexico’s leading public hospitals, has seen his intensive care unit fill up to 100% capacity in recent weeks as Mexicans relaxed and began holding more get-togethers. The hospital is now sending critical Covid-19 cases to other treatment centers.“I have had arguments on the street when I say “hey, put your face mask on,” and people argue with me, citing the argument ‘well, the president doesn’t,’ and that is their only argument,” Galindo said. “It wouldn’t be bad if he (López Obrador) set an example.”Speaking for himself, not his hospital, Galindo also voices support for more testing, and senses there are signs of a new-found willingness to consider the idea — not the least because of the advent of rapid, cheap new antigen tests. But while he says some things are improving — people are now getting to hospitals sooner, thus improving their chances — some recent developments make him worry.Read more | ‘No more bullying’: Fresh start to US-Mexico relations eyed under BidenExcept for a few states, nobody in Mexico has even attempted to enforce a lockdown, or mask-wearing. The closest thing most local authorities have done has been to force some workplaces to shut down, and fine or close businesses that allow too many customers inside at once. Beyond that — travel, mask wearing, parties, weddings — there is very little enforcement. And as the pandemic stretched into its tenth month, people began to let their guard down.That has led to super-spreader events like an October 3 wedding of a soap opera actor and the daughter of a local businessman in the northern border city of Mexicali. Authorities in Mexico say more than 100 people are believed to have been infected by the coronavirus at the wedding, which about 300 people attended.There have been instances of outright rebellion. On October 25, a couple of hundred young people gathered for an illegal concert in an empty lot on the outskirts of the city of Toluca, just west of Mexico City. On videos of the event, the lead singer of one band can be heard telling asking the crowd, “Honestly, who doesn’t give a damn about the pandemic? Whoever doesn’t give a damn about coronavirus, raise your beer!” Dozens raised their cups.Salas, whose father died and who herself was infected, said people have to abandon conspiracy theories and the strange belief it won’t happen to them.“I see a lot of apathy, a lot of people being irresponsible, not giving a damn or not believing the disease is real. People still think it is something invented by the government.” Salas said. “It is something that people have to realize does exist, it is real.”Galindo said those on the front lines are shocked when they look at social media. “They have this sense of frustration seeing photos of parties, meetings,” Galindo said. “They have been locked up for six months, fighting, going without sleep or without eating, and then they see that, and it’s shocking.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-reaches-1-million-coronavirus-cases-nears-100-000-deaths/story-0eXdpUae0Qi0nPolpZa8FN.html
15-11-2020||World||ASEAN, China, other partners set world’s biggest trade pact||China and 14 other countries have agreed to set up the world’s largest trading bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity, in a deal many in Asia are hoping will help hasten a recovery from the shocks of the pandemic. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, is to be signed virtually on Sunday on the sidelines of the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “After eight years of negotiating with blood, sweat and tears, we have finally come to the moment where we will seal the RCEP Agreement,” Malaysia’s trade minister, Mohamed Azmin Ali, said in a statement.Also Read | We couldn’t take our family photo like every year, says PM Modi at 17th ASEAN-India Summit The deal sends a signal that RCEP countries have chosen “to open our markets instead of resorting to protectionist measures during this difficult time,” he said. The accord will take already low tariffs on trade between member countries still lower, over time, and is less comprehensive than an 11-nation trans-Pacific trade deal that President Donald Trump pulled out of shortly after taking office. It includes the 10 nations belonging to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States. Officials said the accord leaves the door open for India, which dropped out due to fierce domestic opposition to its market-opening requirements, to rejoin the bloc. It is not expected to go as far as the European Union in integrating member economies but does build on existing free trade arrangements.Also Read | PM Modi underlines centrality of Asean in India’s Act East policy The deal has powerful symbolic ramifications, showing that nearly four years after Trump launched his “America First” policy of forging trade deals with individual countries, Asia remains committed to multi-nation efforts toward freer trade that are seen as a formula for future prosperity. Ahead of Sunday’s RCEP “special summit” meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would firmly convey his government’s support for “broadening a free and fair economic zone, including a possibility of India’s future return to the deal, and hope to gain support from the other countries.” The accord is also a coup for China, by far the biggest market in the region with more than 1.3 billion people, allowing Beijing to cast itself as a “champion of globalisation and multilateral cooperation” and giving it greater influence over rules governing regional trade, Gareth Leather, senior Asian economist for Capital Economics, said in a report. Now that Trump’s opponent Joe Biden has been declared president-elect, the region is watching to see how U.S. policy on trade and other issues will evolve. Analysts are skeptical Biden will push hard to rejoin the trans-Pacific trade pact or to roll back many of the U.S. trade sanctions imposed on China by the Trump administration given widespread frustration with Beijing’s trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft. Critics of free trade agreements say they tend to encourage companies to move manufacturing jobs overseas. So, having won over disaffected rust-belt voters in Michigan and western Pennsylvania in the Nov. 3 election, Biden is “not going to squander that by going back into TPP,” Michael Jonathan Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a web seminar. But given concerns over China’s growing influence, Biden is likely to seek much more engagement with Southeast Asia to protect U.S. interests, he said. The fast-growing and increasingly affluent Southeast Asian market of 650 million people has been hit hard by the pandemic and is urgently seeking fresh drivers for growth. RCEP originally would have included about 3.6 billion people and encompassed about a third of world trade and global GDP. Minus India, it still covers more than 2 billion people and close to a third of all trade and business activity. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the retooled version of the North American Free Trade Agreement under Trump, covers slightly less economic activity but less than a tenth of the world’s population. The EU and Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revised version of the deal Trump rejected, also are smaller. RCEP includes six of the 11 remaining CPTPP members. India balked at exposing its farmers and factories to more foreign competition. Among other concerns, Indian dairy farmers are worried about competition from New Zealand and Australian milk and cheese producers. Automakers fear imports from across the region. But overall the biggest fear is over a flood of manufactured goods from China. Trade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the U.S. and China, which have imposed billions of dollars’ worth of punitive tariffs on each other’s exports. The RCEP agreement is loose enough to stretch to fit the disparate needs of member countries as diverse as Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. Unlike the CPTPP and EU, it does not establish unified standards on labor and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies. But it does set rules for trade that will facilitate investment and other business within the region, Jeffrey Wilson, research director at the Perth USAsia Center, said in a report for the Asia Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asean-china-other-partners-set-world-s-biggest-trade-pact/story-YdmFJPfhUzsNr5Z8kkZRdO.html
15-11-2020||World||Afghan forces capture ‘mastermind’ of 2 Kabul attacks||Afghan forces have captured the mastermind of two brutal attacks on education institutes in the country’s capital which killed nearly 50 people, officials said Saturday.Mohammad Adel planned an attack on his alma mater Kabul University on November 2 and a bombing at another education centre in October, officials said.At least 22 people were killed and another 27 wounded when three gunmen rampaged through Kabul University, spraying classrooms with bullets for several hours.The brazen daylight assault came just days after 24 people were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up near the Kawsar-e Danish education centre in the capital, which offered training and higher-education courses.The attacks came amid surging violence across the country that has only worsened in recent months despite the government holding peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar.Afghanistan’s intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security (NDS), said: “NDS special forces have detained Mohammad Adel, the main mastermind of Kabul University and Kawsar education centre, in a targeted operation in Kabul.”It did not say when Adel was captured.Security sources said he was a former student of Kabul University.During his interrogation, Adel told NDS officers that it was he who proposed the university attack as it “would get wide coverage and put pressure on the government”, the NDS said.It did not reveal details on how Adel planned the other attack.Earlier on Saturday, Vice President Amrullah Saleh had also said Adel masterminded the university attack.He said Adel was recruited by the Haqqani network, an affiliate of the Taliban.“The attack was carried out to pressure, defame and make the government look weak in front of the people,” Saleh said.Saleh said that Adel -- who had studied the Islamic sharia law and hailed from the province of Panjshir -- had revealed that he received weapons from the Haqqani network to carry out the attack.The shadowy group has long been accused of carrying out brutal assaults on Western forces and civilians, and has been branded a terrorist group by Washington.Soon after the university attack, Saleh and other top officials had blamed the Taliban.However, both attacks were claimed by the Islamic State group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-forces-capture-mastermind-of-two-kabul-attacks/story-GZMFqgfAdD3WfV9wVgRsWP.html
15-11-2020||World||Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine’s trial success may boost acceptance, says Anthony Fauci||The success of Pfizer Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine trial may help persuade more people to get inoculated amid a surge in new coronavirus cases, according to Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious-disease doctor.Pfizer’s vaccine, developed in collaboration with Germany’s BioNTech SE, has “an extraordinarily high degree of efficacy -- more than 90%, close to 95%,” Fauci said in an interview. That could be a key factor in overcoming reluctance to take pandemic vaccines that have been developed at top speed.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“What I would hope is that even though there’s a degree of skepticism about vaccines in general, that when the general public sees how effective this vaccine is,” said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, “we might see a turnaround of the attitude toward vaccination.”The US may begin offering the vaccine to priority groups at the end of December, Fauci said. It’s hoped to blunt spiking infections that reached a record 190,000 new daily cases this week. The Trump administration has both purchased and funded development of doses from Pfizer and other drugmakers with a goal of making enough supplies for most Americans by year-end.Read more: Trump’s ‘Operation Warp Speed’ Aims to Rush Coronavirus VaccineThe name of the administration’s effort, Operation Warp Speed, may have created an impression that corners are being cut to create a vaccine, undermining public confidence, researchers including Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, have said.Just over half of US adults said in September they would definitely or probably take a vaccine to prevent Covid-19 if it were available, down from 72% in May, a national survey by the Washington-based Pew Research Center showed. A survey in June of people in 19 countries published last month in the journal Science found 71.5% of participants would probably take a Covid-19 vaccine, with acceptance ranging from almost 90% in China to less than 55% in Russia.Results of a late-stage trial of a vaccine candidate from Moderna Inc. that uses the same messenger RNA technology as the Pfizer shot are likely to be available within a week, Fauci said. “And if that is really comparable to what we saw with the Pfizer trial, we’ll now have two highly effective vaccines,” he said.“We’ve got to convince people to take the vaccine, because if you have a highly effective vaccine and only 50% of the people take it, you’re not going to have the impact that you’d need to essentially bring a pandemic down to such a low level that it’s no longer threatening society,” Fauci said. “And that’s the goal of a vaccine.”The vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech SE and Moderna are given in a two-shot regimen. The duration of their protection, or that of any Covid-19 vaccine, isn’t yet known, Fauci said. Coronaviruses generally don’t generate an immune response with decades-long durability, and people are infected with one or more of the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold year after year, he said.If the vaccine’s effect has “one to two years of durability, to me that’s fine, because we just go back and boost people and get the immunity up,” Fauci said.More than 20 Covid vaccines have entered the final stage of patient studies that new pharmaceutical products are usually required to undergo for regulatory approval. Even though the late-stage trials may take only a few months, participants and others who receive experimental vaccines will be followed for as long as two years as part of safety monitoring and surveillance, Fauci said.“You always want to be very careful when it comes to safety when you’re dealing with vaccines that you’re going to be giving to hundreds of millions, if not billions of people,” he said. “And that is something that is on everybody’s front burner. Safety is paramount.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-s-trial-success-may-boost-acceptance-says-anthony-fauci/story-ocXK8GOSTmQFlzahkWG4lO.html

15-11-2020||World||Egypt finds treasure trove of over 100 sarcophagi||Egypt announced Saturday the discovery of an ancient treasure trove of more than a 100 intact sarcophagi, dating back more than 2,500 years ago, the largest such find this year.The sealed wooden coffins, unveiled on site amid much fanfare, belonged to top officials of the Late Period and the Ptolemaic period of ancient Egypt. They were found in three burial shafts at depths of 12 metres (40 feet) in the sweeping Saqqara necropolis south of Cairo.Archaeologists opened one coffin to reveal a mummy wrapped in a burial shroud adorned with brightly coloured hieroglyphic pictorials.Saqqara, home to more than a dozen pyramids, ancient monasteries, and animals burial sites, is a vast necropolis of the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.“Saqqara has yet to reveal all of its contents. It is a treasure,” Antiquities and Tourism Minister Khaled al-Anani said at the unveiling ceremony.“Excavations are still underway. Whenever we empty a burial shaft of sarcophagi, we find an entrance to another.” The latest find came just over a month after archaeologists in the area found 59 other well-preserved and sealed wooden coffins, also dating back more than 2,500 years ago.- ‘Beautiful, wonderful statues’ -More than 40 statues of ancient deities and funerary masks were also discovered, the minister said.Another two wooden statues were found in the tomb belonging to an ancient judge of the 6th dynasty, according to Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities.It was not immediately clear if the statues depicted any of the judge’s family members but one statue is believed to depict an individual, by the name Heteb Ka, who was “venerated by the king”, Waziri said. “The beauty of the statue ... is seen in the intricacy of its eyebrows, moustache, and eyelashes. It is absolutely beautiful and wonderful,” he added.The sarcophagi will be distributed among several museums in Egypt including the yet-to-opened Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) at the Giza plateau.Situated near the famed Giza pyramids, GEM is planned to be inaugurated in 2021 after multiple delays.Anani attributed the flurry of discoveries in Saqqara to extensive excavation works in recent years.Another discovery in the vast Saqqara necropolis is expected to be announced in December or early 2021.Archaeologists also hope to find an ancient workshop for manufacturing wooden coffins for mummies.Waziri explained that ancient Egyptians used to buy their coffins at this workshop.“We expect it to be somewhere close to the coffin’s burial shafts,” Waziri said. Egypt hopes archaeological discoveries will spur tourism, a sector which has suffered multiple shocks ever since a 2011 uprising up until today’s coronavirus pandemic.str-mz/hc||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-finds-treasure-trove-of-over-100-sarcophagi/story-sDeiTQ8yXWSvrlmcicWwVL.html

It was unclear what triggered it, officials said. Seven other people were injured and in a critical condition, including the doctor on call, they said.Prosecutors said they would investigate the cause of the fire.Health Minister Nelu Tataru told reporters six surviving patients would be transferred to a Covid-19 hospital in the eastern Romanian city of Iasi.The injured doctor, who had severe burns on 40% of his body, would be transferred to a hospital in the capital Bucharest, Tataru said.“In future legislation, all public hospitals will be coordinated by the health ministry,” Tataru said without elaborating. Local hospitals are currently run by county councils, making overall supervision of the health system difficult. Tataru said the Piatra Neamt hospital would continue to run an intensive care unit on a separate floor. The fire was the country’s deadliest since 2015, when a night club in the capital Bucharest burned down and 65 people died.That blaze triggered mass protests across Romania at the country’s culture of graft and lack of accountability.Romania, which has one of the European Union’s least developed healthcare infrastructures, has reported 353,185 coronavirus cases and 8,813 deaths. Just under 13,000 people with Covid-19 were in hospital across Romania on Saturday, including 1,172 in intensive care units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-kills-10-at-romanian-covid-19-hospital/story-qxhygwiKJllUOuDhSHvmMJ.html

It was not clear if Putin had a call with Aliyev and then another call with Aliyev and Pashinyan, or if he spoke separately with the Armenian leader.Under the agreement, 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are being deployed to the region. Since the early 1990s, ethnic Armenians had held military control over all of Nagorno-Karabakh and substantial swaths of Azeri territory surrounding it. They have now lost much of the enclave itself as well as the surrounding territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-tells-azerbaijan-to-take-care-of-christian-shrines-in-nagorno-karabakh/story-CjQ272wB9GujEpxbEVSnEM.html
15-11-2020||World||German government ad hails couch potatoes as Covid-19 heroes||The German government has released a tongue-in-cheek ad hailing an unlikely hero in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic: the humble couch potato.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The 90-second video posted online Saturday begins with an elderly man recalling his ‘service’ to the nation back when he was just a young student “in the winter of 2020, when the whole country’s eyes were on us.” “I had just turned 22 and was studying engineering,” he continues, “when the second wave hit.” With violins stirring at viewers’ heart strings, the setting switches to a scene of the narrator as a young man. “Suddenly the fate of this country lay in our hands,” he says. “So we mustered all our courage and did what was expected of us, the only right thing. We did nothing.” “Days and nights we stayed on our backsides at home and fought against the spread of the coronavirus,” the narrator continues. “Our couch was the front line and our patience was our weapon.” The ad ends with a government message that “you too can become a hero by staying at home.” Germany imposed fresh restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19 at the start of November, shutting restaurants, bars and gyms, and setting limits on the number of people who can meet in public and private settings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-government-ad-hails-couch-potatoes-as-covid-19-heroes/story-weQnKhcpIoDmWGWp869NEI.html
15-11-2020||World||Pakistan to seek USD 2.7 bn loan from China for CPEC project||Pakistan has decided to seek USD 2.7 billion loan from China for the construction of package-I of the Mainline-1 project of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).Citing government officials, The Express Tribune has reported that the sixth meeting of the financing committee on ML-1 project, which includes dualisation and upgrading of the 1,872 km railway track from Peshawar to Karachi, decided that Pakistan would initially request China to sanction only USD 2.73 billion in loan out of the total estimated Chinese financing of about USD 6.1 billion.This development comes even as Pakistan’s economy has been teetering on the verge of bankruptcy for some time and the Covid-19 pandemic has made the situation even worse.Also Read | Gilgit-Baltistan: Pakistan plays the role of supplicant to Chinese expansionThe Ministry of Economic Affairs has been directed to formally send the Letter of Intent to China next week as Beijing is expected to finalise its next year’s financing plans by the end of the current month, The Express Tribune reported.“In April this year, Pakistan had shared a term sheet for Chinese loan, seeking 1 per cent interest rate. But China has not yet formally responded to the request. They said that informally Chinese authorities conveyed that the interest rate could be higher than the one mentioned in the term sheet,” the sources told the Pakistan daily.In May Pakistan’s former ambassador to the United States Husain Haqqani wrote in an article in The Diplomat that Pakistan’s desire to maintain strategic relations with China has resulted in the construction of USD 62 billion worth of CPEC, which includes a set of infrastructure projects, being mired in insufficient transparency.“China’s consistent strategic support, including help with Pakistan’s nuclear program, is often held out by Pakistan’s military establishment favorably in contrast with the more conditional Pakistani alliance with the United States. But it seems now that China is not in Pakistan to help its people but rather as a predatory economic actor”, he said.The 278-page report by the “Committee for Power Sector Audit, Circular Debt Reservation, and Future RoadMap” listed malpractices to the tune of 100 billion Pakistani rupees (USD625 million) in the independent power generating sector, with at least a third of it relating to Chinese projects.According to the committee’s report, “excess set-up costs of (Pakistani Rupee) Rs 32.46 billion (approximately USD204 million) was allowed to the two coal-based [Chinese] plants due to misrepresentation by sponsors regarding [deductions for] the ‘Interest During Construction’ (IDC) as well as non-consideration of earlier completion of plants.”The interest deduction was apparently allowed for 48 months whereas the plants were actually completed within 27-29 months leading to the entitlement of an excess Return on Equity (RoE) of USD27.4 million annually over the entire project life of 30 years in the case of the Sahiwal plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-seek-usd-2-7-bn-loan-from-china-for-cpec-project/story-4LRPBY3a0yT0Kd8y9gDKYK.html
