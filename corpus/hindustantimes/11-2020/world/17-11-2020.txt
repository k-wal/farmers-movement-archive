17-11-2020||World||Volunteers still needed to test variety of coronavirus vaccines||Two Covid-19 vaccines might be nearing the finish line, but scientists caution it’s critical that enough people volunteer to help finish studying other candidates in the US and around the world.Moderna Inc and competitor Pfizer Inc recently announced preliminary results showing their vaccines appear more than 90% effective, at least for short-term protection against Covid-19.If those early results hold up and US regulators agree the shots are safe, emergency use of small, rationed supplies could start in late December. Other countries with contracts for early doses would undertake their own reviews.But multiple vaccines will be needed to meet global demand and help end the pandemic, raising concern that studies that still need to sign up thousands of volunteers could run short if people wait for an already OK’d option instead.“We don’t want to see that happen,” said Dr James Cutrell, an infectious disease expert at UT Southwestern Medical Centre in Dallas.Supplies aside, other Covid-19 vaccines under development may work differently in different populations and “we likely will benefit from having a menu of vaccine options,” Cutrell said.“We still need volunteers,” stressed National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, urging Americans to sign up.Additionally, participants in the Moderna and Pfizer studies who originally got dummy shots would almost certainly be offered the real vaccine if the US Food and Drug Administration allows emergency use. But no one knows how long protection would last, meaning those studies also must continue to track recipients somehow.Also Read| Covid-19 in US: States plead for more federal help as virus outbreak worsens“It’s one thing to be effective two months after your last vaccination and another thing to be effective a year” later, said Dr Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former director of the FDA’s vaccine division. “It’s going to be really important to complete these clinical trials and the trials of the other vaccines so we can make comparisons.” The promising Moderna and Pfizer news bodes well for some of their competitors, said Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert whose team at NIH helped develop the Moderna candidate.Those shots target the “spike” protein that studs the surface of the coronavirus, and the early results prove that’s enough to generate “a protective response”, Fauci said. “Conceptually this looks good” for other spike-focused vaccines made in different ways.Here’s a scorecard of the frontrunners in the global vaccine race: GENETIC CODE VACCINES The Moderna-NIH vaccine and the candidate developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech aren’t made with the coronavirus itself, meaning there’s no chance anyone could catch it from the shots.Instead, the vaccines are made with a brand-new technology that injects a piece of genetic code for the spike protein. That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, enough to prime the immune system to react if it later encounters the real virus.There are no licensed mRNA vaccines for people, so scientists had no idea if or how well the Covid-19 candidates might work.Both manufacturers are working to scale up production in factories in the US and Europe. They can’t simply partner with other vaccine companies to take on some of the work because the technology is so different than the way most of today’s shots are made.“It is not a very easy or quick swap,” said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel.TROJAN HORSE VACCINES A different way to target the spike protein: Use another, harmless virus to carry the spike gene into the body. Once again, the body produces some spike protein and primes the immune system.Britain’s Oxford University and AstraZeneca are making their version of this “viral vector” vaccine with a cold virus, or adenovirus, that normally infects chimpanzees. Studies of tens of thousands of people are underway in the UK, US and several other countries.Johnson & Johnson is using a human adenovirus for its version, and is the only option in advanced US testing aiming to show if a single dose rather than two would be enough.Also Read: Joe Biden fears more people may die from Covid-19 as Donald Trump delays smooth transitionChina’s government authorised emergency use of CanSino Biologics’ adenovirus shots in the military ahead of any final testing. Russia likewise began offering an adenovirus vaccine ahead of late-stage tests.PROTEIN VACCINES Novavax makes its vaccine candidate by growing harmless copies of the coronavirus spike protein in the laboratory and packaging them into virus-sized nanoparticles.There are protein-based vaccines against other diseases, so it’s not as novel a technology as some of its competitors. Novavax has begun a large final-stage study in Britain, and is set soon to begin another in the US.“KILLED” VACCINES Spike-focused vaccines aren’t the only option. Making vaccines by growing a disease-causing virus and then killing it is a tried-and-true approach — it’s the way Jonas Salk’s famed polio shots were made.China has three so-called “inactivated” Covid-19 vaccine candidates in final testing in several countries, and has allowed emergency use in some people ahead of the results. An Indian company is testing its own inactivated candidate.Safely brewing and then killing the virus takes longer than newer technologies. But inactivated vaccines give the body a sneak peek at the germ itself rather than just that single spike protein.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/volunteers-still-needed-to-test-variety-of-coronavirus-vaccines/story-bPMdnikrGZbNfARm18xe7M.html

Hahn said all FDA drug and biological product centers intend, “to the extent appropriate and permitted by law”, to share information about scientific review documents supporting the issuance, revision or revocation of EUAs.Countries around the world are racing to develop Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, and the rapid pace of development has had doctors and experts concerned about transparency and regulatory reviews. The FDA said it recognizes disclosing such information would also contribute to the public’s confidence in the agency’s rigorous review of scientific data.“We will also continue to follow the science and ensure that science remains the driver of the agency’s regulatory decision-making in our fight against Covid-19 and beyond on behalf of public health,” Hahn said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-to-make-emergency-use-authorization-data-public-for-covid-19-vaccines/story-XNvJb9BSV4wc7NlTcX8jrO.html
17-11-2020||World||Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey defends decision to not remove Trump’s tweet falsely claiming victory||Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Tuesday defended the decision of the micro-blogging platform to not remove US President Donald Trump’s tweets related to election results. During a Congressional hearing over the company’s content moderation policy, Senator Dianne Feinstein mentioned a Trump’s tweet in which he had claimed a win in the presidential elections while media networks had not called the election in anyone’s favour.Feinstein, a Democrat and ranking member of Senate Judiciary Committee, said that Trump and his allies tweeted hundreds of false claims about 2020 elections. She highlighted that the US President even falsely claimed victory and alleged widespread voter fraud. The 87-year-old Senator quoted Trump tweet from November 7, which reads “I won this election by a lot”.Also Read | Facebook, Twitter CEOs facing questions on poll measuresTwitter applied a warning label to the tweet, saying “Official sources may not have called the race when this was tweeted”. Feinstein asked Dorsey whether he believes a label goes “far enough to prevent the tweet’s harms” when the tweet is still visible and not accurate. “I do, because it’s not the just surface-level label. It points to a collection of news articles of information and conversation that gives you an expansion on what’s happening with the election,” replied Dorsey.Seemingly unconvinced by the answer, the Senator reiterated the question, stressing that these tweets “arouse people”. She said that the entity running such an operation ought to have an understanding that the tweets can play a major role on stirring people up to unacceptable levels.“I believe it’s really important that we show people a broader context. And that is the intention of the label. It is not just text below a tweet, it is a link to connect to a much larger conversation and news articles across the spectrum,” said Dorsey, without providing proper justification for keeping the tweets on the platform. During the hearing, the Twitter chief also testified that the platform has removed some 300,000 election-related tweets between October 27 and November 11, representing 0.2 per cent of all election-related tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-defends-decision-to-not-remove-trump-s-tweet-falsely-claiming-victory/story-RoDlJkAkdgj3qbQYrct6oJ.html
17-11-2020||World||Joe Biden fears more people may die from Covid-19 as Donald Trump delays smooth transition||US President-elect Joe Biden on Monday said more Americans “may die” because of President Donald Trump’s failure to allow his administration to cooperate and coordinate its response to the Covid-19 pandemic with members of the incoming team - part of his broader refusal to accept the outcome of the election.Biden had run on the promise of according top priority to the battle against Covid-19 if elected, and in his first significant step since the election, he set up an advisory team to start planning his administration’s approach after his inauguration on January 20. It has received no cooperation from Trump’s team yet.“More people may die if we don’t coordinate,” Biden told reporters when asked about the consequences of Trump’s refusal to cooperate with the new administration. “The vaccine is important. But it’s of no use until you’re vaccinated.”He said it would take a massive effort to get all Americans vaccinated - “a huge, huge, huge undertaking” - and pressed for the need to read into the Trump administration’s plan for development, procurement and distribution of vaccine under Operation Warp Speed, saying, “If we have to wait until January 20 to start that planning, it puts us behind.”The deadly coronavirus has killed more than 247,000 Americans and infected over 11.2 million. Cases have been surging in recent days with 166,045 new infections reported in the last 24 hours and 995 fatalities, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.“We’re going into a very dark winter. Things are going to get much tougher before they get easier,” Biden said. “That requires sparing no effort to fight Covid, so that we can open our businesses safely, resume our lives and put this pandemic behind us. It’s going to be difficult, but it can be done.”On Trump’s refusal to allow the transition process, Biden said, “I find this more embarrassing for the country than debilitating for my ability to get started.” Trump has refused to publicly acknowledge that Biden beat him in the election, and has launched a flurry of lawsuits challenging the outcome. Also, he has barred his administration from getting started with the routine transition process, denying the president-elect intelligence briefings, among other things, that he should be getting.Trump has lately appeared to have tuned out of the pandemic. He last attended a meeting of his coronavirus team five months ago and has barely acknowledged the crisis in his tweets, which are mostly about allegations of election fraud and claims that he won the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-fears-more-people-may-die-from-covid-19-as-donald-trump-delays-smooth-transition/story-PhPkqUqPLKQkQIOWW7ZndN.html

In a series of tweets, Bharat Ramamurti, a Democrat, argued that cancelling student loan debt has positive income effects. Sharing the data on student loans and other education debts, Ramamurti highlighted that a median borrower’s typical monthly payment is between $200 and $299 per month. He said that cancelling debt could reduce or eliminate those payments, which could be equivalent to sending them a check every month.Ramamurti, who acted as top economic adviser of Senator Elizabeth Warren during her presidential campaign, said that student debt contributes to the reason behind declining home ownership. He stressed that cancelling the debt would lead to more jobs and growth. Citing a study on macroeconomic effects of student debt cancellation, Ramamurti said that cancelling all debt would have a big stimulative effect.“The impact would be less if less debt were canceled, but debt cancellation one of the relatively few ways to really stimulate the economy without Congress,” he tweeted.Also Read | Know the top contenders for Secretary of State in Biden AdministrationAccording to the latest data and research by the Roosevelt Institute, student debt is also a racial issue. Ramamurti said that the median White borrower, twenty years after graduating, has paid off 94 per cent of their student loan balance, while the median Black borrower still owes 95 per cent.Ramamurti noted that debt cancellation has the highest approval among people earning under $50,000 per year and among people who don’t have a college degree. He concluded that broad debt cancellation via executive order is “popular, economically potent, and life-changing for millions of Americans struggling through this crisis.” During Warren’s presidential pitch, Ramamurti helped develop a number of proposals, including the much-debated wealth tax and student loan debt cancellation plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-attorney-explains-how-student-loan-debt-cancellation-via-executive-order-is-good-economics/story-5clWfT3NzDfAWCLfYXMPeJ.html
17-11-2020||World||US, Europe plan vaccination schemes as second virus wave builds||Plans for vaccination programmes began taking shape in Europe and the United States following recent breakthroughs, as surging coronavirus caseloads prompted gruelling new restrictions, with Austria taking the unpopular step Tuesday of closing schools and shops.Global hopes of vanquishing the coronavirus pandemic were high after US biotech firm Moderna said its vaccine candidate was nearly 95 percent effective in a trial, a week after similar results announced by pharma giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.Top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci hailed the results, telling AFP that the data exceeded expectations. “The idea that we have a 94.5 percent effective vaccine is stunningly impressive,” he said.Moderna, whose clinical trial involved more than 30,000 participants, expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the United States by year-end -- with elderly and at-risk people to be first in line for jabs.The US Food and Drug Agency may approve both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines early next month, according to Moncef Slaoui, head of the government’s “Operation Warp Speed” vaccine quest.He said that from January, 25 million people would be vaccinated per month.France too said it was “getting on the starting blocks” for a vaccination programme to launch in January pending French and EU regulatory approval, budgeting 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) for the rollout in 2021, according to spokesman Gabriel Attal.Fauci, who heads the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, warned it would be crucial to convince people to take the vaccine, particularly in the US, where anti-vaccine sentiment runs high.“A vaccine with a high degree of efficacy is of no use if nobody gets vaccinated,” he said.Yet with widespread availability of any vaccine still far off, restrictions on free movement, gatherings and business were inevitable as the second wave of the coronavirus continued to build.In the hardest-hit United States, President-elect Joe Biden expressed frustration over Donald Trump’s refusal to cooperate on the White House transition process, saying “more people may die” of Covid-19 without immediate coordination on fighting the pandemic.Globally, infections have surpassed 55 million with more than 1.3 million deaths, and experts caution the months ahead will still be difficult and dangerous.- ‘Total loss of control’ -Curbs have returned in Europe -- often in the face of protests -- from Greece to Britain, where Covid-19 survivor Prime Minister Boris Johnson was self-isolating after coming into contact with an MP who later tested positive for the virus.Sweden, which has drawn attention for a softer approach to combating the virus, decided to ban gatherings of more than eight people for the first time. Tightened restrictions took effect Tuesday in Austria, with schools and shops shut until December 6.Chancellor Sebastian Kurz drew a sharp backlash for the new measures, which Pamela Rendi-Wagner, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, said reflected a “total loss of control”.“Austria has gone from being a model country to being the bottom of the table in terms of infections,” said Rendi-Wagner, herself a doctor and former health minister.The number of daily infections in the Alpine nation of 8.8 million people grew from 1,000 in early October to 5,984 on Tuesday.Italy meanwhile said Tuesday it had inspected over 230 retirement and nursing homes and identified 37 with violations, shutting down four of them outright.The virus tore through the country’s care homes during the first wave of the pandemic, with many residents dying before they could be hospitalised and without having been tested.Italy, which is currently reporting over 500 deaths a day from the virus, has seen a spike in the number of contagions in such structures since the start of November.In Greece, tensions were high on the anniversary of a 1973 student uprising against a military junta after police banned public gatherings -- including the traditional march recalling the crackdown that killed 24 people, a bloodbath considered to have speeded the restoration of democracy.Some left-wing groups have called on supporters to defy the ban and stage an afternoon demonstration in central Athens, with nearly 6,000 police officers standing by, media reports said.And in Germany, which began a new round of shutdowns earlier in the month, Chancellor Angela Merkel was pushing for tighter measures such as masks in all schools and smaller class sizes.- US reeling -While new cases were plateauing in Germany, officials said daily numbers were still too high.Bucking the trend in Europe, Russia has not imposed a new nationwide lockdown, even as it reported a record high 442 new coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday.Infections in the United States, meanwhile, show no sign of relenting after one million new cases in less than a week pushed the total number to 11,206,054 with 247,229 deaths.The spikes have prompted new curbs in various states, while experts warn families against large gatherings for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.A stay-at-home advisory came into force Monday in the country’s third-biggest city, Chicago; while New York, an earlier outbreak epicentre, was also trying to flatten a second curve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-europe-plan-vaccination-schemes-as-second-virus-wave-builds/story-5CmvIZuUCwlzxGq8tU2leM.html

We are prepared to have cooperation with South Africa and India as well,” Xi said while addressing the 12th BRICS summit via video link.The virtual summit, hosted by Russia President Vladimir Putin, was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.“China has joined the COVAX facility and will actively consider providing vaccines to BRICS countries where there is a need,” Xi said.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said nine candidate vaccines, including two from China, are currently being evaluated for inclusion in the COVAX Facility. The COVAX is co-led by Gavi, an international vaccine alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the (WHO). Its aim is to accelerate the development and manufacture of vaccines.So far the coronavirus has infected more than 54 million people around the world and killed more than 1.3 million people even as governments implemented strict lockdowns and restrictions to slow the spread of the virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.“To support the development of BRICS Vaccine R&D centre, China has designated its own national centre. I propose we convene a BRICS symposium on traditional medicine to explore its role in coronavirus prevention and treatment,” Xi said.He also said that China will open the BRICS partnership on a new industrial revolution innovation centre in the Chinese city of Xiamen. “We welcome the active participation of fellow BRICS countries”, he said.Xi said the BRICS countries need to “overcome divisions with unity and pool the maximum global synergy to beat the virus.” In his speech, Xi focussed on the need for the BRICS countries to support multilateralism, globalisation which faced headwinds from growing nationalism in the US and other developed countries and advanced five proposals for the five-member bloc.He said BRICS countries should uphold multilateralism and safeguarding world peace and stability, deepen solidarity and cooperation in jointly coping with the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, uphold openness and innovation to boost global economic recovery, prioritising people’s livelihood and promoting sustainable development across the world and promote green and low-carbon development and advancing the harmonious co-existence of man and nature.“History teaches us that multilateralism, equity and justice can keep war and conflict at bay. While unilateralism and power politics will inflate dispute and confrontation. We BRICS countries must hold high the banner of multilateralism. We must endeavour to safeguard the UN centred internationals system and international order underpinned by international law,” he said.“It is impossible to reverse the trends of world multi-polarity and economic globalisation,” he said.“The practice of using the pandemic to pursue de-globalisation will end up hurting one’s own interests,” he said.The BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) is known as an influential bloc that represents over 3.6 billion people, or half of the world’s population. The BRICS countries have a combined GDP of USD 16.6 trillion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-offers-to-cooperate-with-india-brics-countries-to-develop-covid-19-vaccine/story-tEfeFMUxfgXD7aYHH3GZPL.html

It dismissed the appeal.The committee upheld the findings of the commissioner that Ahmed breached the code of conduct by failing to act on his personal honour in the discharge of his parliamentary activities, and recommended his expulsion from the House, instead of a lengthy suspension.It said that Ahmed had breached the code “by agreeing to use his position as a member of the House to help a member of the public, but then, sexually assaulting the complainant, lying to the complainant about his intentions to help her with a complaint to the Metropolitan Police regarding exploitation by a faith healer, exploiting the complainant emotionally and sexually despite knowing she was vulnerable.”The committee said it considered the sanction of suspension, but concluded, “The abuse of the privileged position of membership for a member’s own gain or gratification, at the expense of the vulnerable or less privileged, involves a fundamental breach of trust and merits the gravest sanction.”“Even though it is possible to think of even more serious breaches, the case in all its circumstances which we have set out crosses the threshold calling for immediate and definitive expulsion,” the nine-member committee added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-origin-lord-retires-from-uk-house-faced-expulsion/story-HbEFhYr4DA7lJ9yxl2OiyH.html

The sides are allies in a U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition fighting against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels since 2015.At least 47 fighters were killed and around 90 others were wounded in the clashes centered in Zinjibar, the Abyan provincial capital, and the officials described it as the fiercest in the recent months.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to brief the media.The fighting between Yemen’s internationally recognized government and the separatists’ Southern Transitional Council started in August 2019. Last fall, the two sides signed a power-sharing deal in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, but the agreement was never implemented.The secessionist council, an umbrella group of militias backed by the United Arab Emirates, hopes to restore an independent southern Yemen, which existed from 1967 until unification in 1990.The clashes had reopened a new front inside the larger civil war, complicating international efforts to broker a broader peace agreement to end Yemen’s conflict.The war in the Arab world’s poorest country erupted in 2014, when the Houthis seized the capital and much of the country’s north. A Saudi-led coalition, determined to restore President Abed Rabu Mansour Hadi’s government, launched a military intervention months later.The fighting in Yemen has spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, leaving millions suffering from food and medical shortages. It has killed over 112,000 people, including fighters and civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yemen-clashes-between-government-separatists-kill-about-50/story-N0iJfDdAhGs0o1rwZPVedK.html

However, the recent defeat in US elections has ensured that Trump will be stripped of his privileges soon, leaving him vulnerable to civil and criminal proceedings.Tax fraudManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has been looking into the finances of the Trump Organization and real estate business of Trump’s family for a criminal investigation. Vance, a Democrat, had sought Trump’s tax returns for the investigation. US District Judge Victor Marrero allowed the enforcement of the ‘dragnet’ subpoena, forcing Trump to disclose eight years of business and personal tax returns from his longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA.Trump has been seeking absolute immunity from criminal probe while he remains in the White House. The US President urged the federal court of appeals to block the enforcement of the subpoena, arguing that it amounts to political harassment, but the court disagreed. Trump is now expected to appeal in Supreme Court against Vance’s attempt to obtain his tax returns. The tax returns could provide Vance with ample ammunition to move forward with his investigation into alleged tax and bank fraud.Also Read | Michele Flournoy: All about former US govt official likely to become first woman Pentagon chiefHush-money allegationsIn 2018, Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actress Stormy Daniels spoke out about their sexual relationships with Trump and alleged that they received payments to remain quiet.

17-11-2020||World||Climate change bigger threat than Covid: Red Cross||The world should react with the same urgency to climate change as to the coronavirus crisis, the Red Cross said Tuesday, warning that global warming poses a greater threat than Covid-19.Even as the pandemic rages, climate change is not taking a break from wreaking havoc, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies (IFRC) said in a new report.In the report, on global catastrophes since the 1960s, the Geneva-based organisation pointed out that the world had been hit by more than 100 disasters -- many of them climate related -- since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic in March. More than 50 million people had been affected, it said.“Of course, the Covid is there, it’s in front of us, it is affecting our families, our friends, our relatives,” IFRC Secretary-General Jagan Chapagain told a virtual press conference.“It’s a very, very serious crisis the world is facing currently,” he said of the pandemic, which has already claimed more than 1.3 million lives. But he warned that the IFRC expects “climate change will have a more significant medium and long term impact on the human life and on Earth.”And while it looked increasingly likely that one or several vaccines would soon become available against Covid-19, Chapagain stressed that “unfortunately there is no vaccine for climate change”.‘No vaccine for climate change’When it comes to global warming, he warned, “it will require a much more sustained action and investment to really protect the human life on this Earth.”The frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate-related events had already increased considerably in recent decades, said the IFRC. In 2019 alone, the world was hit by 308 natural disasters -- 77 percent of them climate or weather-related -- killing some 24,400 people. The number of climate and weather-related disasters has been steadily climbing since the 1960s, and has surged by nearly 35 percent since the 1990s, IFRC said.Read more | Jeff Bezos announces USD 791 million in grants to 16 groups fighting climate change: ReportThis is a deadly development. Weather and climate-related disasters have killed more than 410,000 people over the past decade, most of them in poorer countries, with heatwaves and storms proving the most deadly, the report said. Faced with this threat, which “literally threatens our long-term survival”, IFRC called on the international community to act with the urgency required.Protect most vulnerable communities’ It estimated that around $50 billion would be needed annually over the next decade to help the 50 developing countries to adapt to the changing climate. IFRC stressed that that amount was “dwarfed by the global response to the economic impact of Covid-19,” which has already passed $10 trillion. It also lamented that much of the money invested so far in climate change prevention and mitigation was not going to the developing countries most at risk.“Our first responsibility is to protect communities that are most exposed and vulnerable to climate risks,” Chapagain said, warning though that “our research demonstrates that the world is collectively failing to do this.”“There is a clear disconnection between where the climate risk is greatest and where climate adaptation funding goes,” he said.“This disconnection could very well cost lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-bigger-threat-than-covid-red-cross/story-rtkRRhfZ2vgDQk15WPrkoK.html

According to the researchers, including Australian paediatrician Kim Mulholland, Chair of the World Health Organization’s SAGE Working Group on measles and rubella vaccines, many children across the world have missed out on measles vaccination this year, making future measles outbreaks inevitable.The scientists called for urgent international action to prevent potentially devastating measles epidemics in the coming years. While 2020 had been a quiet year for measles, in part due to travel reductions and national Covid-19 control measures, they said the economic impacts may lead to many cases of childhood malnutrition.The researchers said malnutrition worsens the severity of measles, leading to poorer outcomes and more deaths, especially in low- and middle-income countries. “Children who die from measles are often malnourished, but acute measles pushes many surviving children into malnutrition,” Mulholland said. “Malnutrition, along with measles-associated immune suppression, leads to delayed mortality, while co-existing vitamin A deficiency can also lead to measles-associated blindness,” he added.The scientists believe the coming months may likely see increasing numbers of unimmunised children who are susceptible to measles. “Many live in poor, remote communities where health systems are less resilient, and malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency are already increasing,” they said. According to Mulholland, the Covid-19 pandemic has also had a profound effect on the control of vaccine preventable diseases, with vaccination campaigns paused in the early months of 2020 and routine immunisation services greatly disrupted in many countries. The WHO estimated that by the end of October, 2020, delayed vaccination campaigns in 26 countries have led to 94 million children missing scheduled measles vaccine doses. “All these factors create the environment for severe measles outbreaks in 2021, accompanied by increased death rates and the serious consequences of measles that were common decades ago,” Mulholland said. “Without concerted efforts now, it is likely that the coming years will see an increase in measles and its severe, frequently fatal, complications,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/measles-outbreaks-likely-in-wake-of-covid-19-pandemic-say-scientists/story-d0YyzgUMaj3Vvk6hjbCAqL.html

But despite its singular status, the lonely male doesn’t have a name.The white giraffe now stands alone after a female and her calf were killed by poachers in March, the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy said in a statement Tuesday.A rare genetic trait called leucism causes the white color, and it makes the one surviving giraffe stand out dangerously for poachers in the arid savannah near the Somalia border.Now the GPS tracking device, attached to one of the giraffe’s horns, will ping every hour to alert wildlife rangers to its location.The conservancy has thanked the Kenya Wildlife Service along with the Northern Rangelands Trust and Save Giraffes Now for the help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-s-last-known-white-giraffe-gets-gps-tracking-device/story-ff5i0k2wL8VNc1tF6v0FmL.html

These accusations are frequently used against critics and activists in China.According to the prosecution document, the indictment sheet on Monday claimed that Zhang had sent formal information through text, video and other media through the Internet media such as WeChat, Twitter and Youtube.“She also accepted interviews from overseas media Free Radio Asia and Epoch Times and maliciously speculated on Wuhan’s Covid-19 epidemic,” it said.The Guardian reported that the NGO Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) had stated that Zhang’s reports included ‘the detentions of other independent reporters and harassment of families of victims seeking accountability from the epicentre via her WeChat, Twitter and YouTube accounts’.The CHRD further mentioned that she was also previously detained on similar accusations by Chinese authorities in 2018 and in the following year for voicing support for Hong Kong activists.Zhang is among the several journalists who have been arrested this year after travelling to Wuhan to report on the virus outbreak and response, reported The Guardian.Several journalists have been arrested in China after the national security law was implemented in Hong Kong this year.The draconian law is aimed at crushing dissent in the erstwhile British colony which saw massive pro-democracy protests last year. The legislation, which came into effect on July 1, punishes what Beijing terms secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference with up to life in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-up-to-5-years-imprisonment-to-journalist-who-reported-on-covid-19-outbreak/story-b3rDKhQL9dft08JWID2A3L.html

We have been in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and no NATO ally wants to stay any longer than necessary. But at the same time, the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high,” Stoltenberg said in a statement.He said the conflict-ravaged country “risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organize attacks on our homelands. And ISIS (Islamic State) could rebuild in Afghanistan the terror caliphate it lost in Syria and Iraq.”The US decision comes just days after Trump installed a new slate of loyalists in top Pentagon positions who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. The expected plans would leave 2,500 troops in Afghanistan after mid-January.US officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawal and that an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders.NATO took charge of the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003, two years after a U.S-led coalition ousted the Taliban for harboring former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. In 2014, it began to train and advise Afghan security forces, but has gradually pulled troops out in line with a US-brokered peace deal.NATO relies heavily on the US armed forces to operate in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-chief-warns-of-high-price-if-troops-leave-afghanistan/story-1WJxTxktosajnG3xmBXRSJ.html
17-11-2020||World||Tokyo talks move to bolster defense ties with Australia amid China’s rise||The leaders of Australia and Japan held in-person talks on Tuesday to bolster defense ties between the two US allies to counter China’s growing assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region amid the transition in American leadership.The two countries are close to concluding a Reciprocal Access Agreement, a legal framework to allow their troops to visit each other’s countries to conduct training and joint operations.During the talks in Tokyo, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his Japanese counterpart, Yoshihide Suga, were expected to further discuss the deal, though it was not immediately clear whether it would be finalized. They were also expected to discuss the coronavirus and the economy, Japanese officials said.If signed, the deal would be Japan’s first such pact since the 1960 status of forces agreement with the United States, which set bases for about 50,000 American troops to operate in and around Japan under the Japan-US security pact.Japan is committed to maintaining and deepening its 60-year-old alliance with the US as the cornerstone of its diplomacy and security, but has in recent years sought to complement its regional defense by stepping up cooperation with others, especially Australia, amid China’s growing maritime activity that has spread from the East and South China seas and beyond.Japan still sticks to self-defense and bans first strikes under its postwar pacifist constitution, but bolstered its defense role and spending under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Abe pushed Japan’s military cooperation and weapons compatibility with the US as its forces increasingly work alongside US troops. He also bolstered purchases of costly American stealth fighters and other arsenals.Suga, who took office in mid-September after Abe resigned due to ill health problems, is carrying on his predecessor’s diplomatic and security policies.Japan considers Australia as a semi-ally and the two countries signed a defense cooperation agreement in 2007, a first for Japan with a country other than the US. The two nations agreed on the sharing of military supplies in 2013, expanding the deal in 2017 to include munitions after Japan eased restrictions on arms equipment transfers.Japan has initiated a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” vision of economic and security cooperation as a counter to China’s influence, and recently hosted foreign ministerial talks among the countries known as the Quad that also include the US, Australia and India.Those four nations are now seeking to bring in more countries, from Southeast Asia and beyond, that share concerns about China’s increasing assertiveness in the region.China defends its actions in the regional seas as peaceful and denies violating international rules. It has criticized the Quad as a NATO in Asia to counter China.Despite its pacifist constitution, Japan’s defense spending ranks among the world’s top 10, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Australia ranks among the top 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-talks-move-to-bolster-defense-ties-with-australia-amid-china-s-rise/story-XxrWduCxBLWp3qLVOfRfoJ.html
17-11-2020||World||‘Warning to US’: Former PLA colonel claims China’s missiles hit moving target in sea||In the month of August, China fired two of its most capable conventional missiles - a DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) and DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) - into the South China Sea from bases in the mainland.There was no official information so far about the reason or whether they hit any target on the day of the launch on August 26. But now, a former senior colonel of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has claimed that these missiles hit a moving ship target near the Paracel Islands.Wang Xiangsui’s claim was made in the wake of the US military flowing a U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane near a Chinese naval live-fire drill in the Bohai Sea off China’s northeast coast in August. China had declared a no-fly zone in international airspace above the Bohai Sea, meaning its declaration had no legal merit.“So several days later [after the aircraft carrier manoeuvres], we launched the DF-21 and DF-26, and the missiles hit a vessel sailing south of the Paracel Islands,” said Wang, who is now a professor at Beihang University in Beijing.“Shortly after that, an American military attache in Geneva complained and said it would lead to severe consequences if the missiles hit an American aircraft carrier. They see this as a show of force, but we are doing this because of their provocation,” Wang said at a closed-door meeting of the Moganshan Forum in Zhejiang.Though the meeting was held in October, the transcripts of Wang’s comments were made public on Tuesday.Read more | Malabar exercise that upsets China is a tectonic shift in power balance | Analysis“This is a warning to the US, asking it not to take any military risks. Such actions mark the bottom line of Sino-US confrontation,” he had said.The US had said that the flight was “within the accepted international rules and regulations governing aircraft flights”, and that the air force would “continue to fly and operate anywhere international law allows, at the time and tempo of our choosing”.In previous months, the US Navy had sailed two aircraft carrier strike groups (USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan) in the South China Sea “in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific”.Out of the two missiles fired by China on August 26, the DF-26 was launched from Qinghai Province in northwest China (approximately 2,500 km away from the Bohai Sea), and the DF-21D from eastern China in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province (a distance of 1,600 km).Read more | Russia to consider India’s request for speedy delivery of S-400 air defence systemsThe DF-21D “carrier killer” has a range of approximately 1,800 kilometre. The DF-26 IRBM, on the other hand, has a 4,000-km range and it can carry either a nuclear or conventional warhead.The DF-21D and DF-26 are in categories banned under the Russia-US Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which the US withdrew from in 2019. China was never a signatory, and Washington cited China’s possession of such weapon categories as one justification for its INF withdrawal.August 2020 was not the first time China fired ballistic missiles into the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warning-to-us-former-pla-colonel-claims-china-s-missiles-hit-moving-target-in-sea/story-96AadmRtIQCBITDlSJiEmJ.html

While 20% remained neutral, 73% held either a moderately negative or very negative view of China. Significantly, 79% see China as posing a serious or moderate threat to Canada, far outpacing other traditional foes such as Russia or Iran.Relations between Canada and China remain at a low with two Canadians, including a diplomat, in Chinese jails in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has described as “hostage diplomacy” being practised by Beijing after a senior Huawei executive was arrested in Vancouver in a case related to defrauding a bank to evade sanctions on Iran.“This study confirms yet again how out of sync the government of Canada is with public opinion on China’s emerging threat to Canadian sovereignty and national security,” noted MLI senior fellow Charles Burton in a statement released with the report. “As a consequence, the credibility of Canada’s claim of principled commitment to the international rules-based order rings hollower and hollower as the years go by.”Views of other Asian nations, including that for Taiwan, remain far more positive, though with as many as 51% remaining neutral. As far as India is concerned, 19% are either highly or moderately positive about it, while 34% veer in the other direction, with a large 48% opting for neutrality.“Canadians held a more positive view of most developed democracies. Overall, countries like Australia, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, South Korea and Taiwan are given high net-positive scores by Canadians. However, Taiwan also has high neutral scores, alongside Israel, Ukraine, Latvia and India. This indicates that these countries have opportunities to improve Canadians’ views,” the statement noted.Among democracies, the United States under the Donald Trump administration remains an outlier, with 63% negatively inclined against just 20% positive towards Canada’s neighbour and ally. “Modern American populism is facilitating Canadian anti-American sentiments, despite the fact that this strategic relationship provides the bedrock for Canada’s national security and economy,” noted MLI Munk senior fellow Shuvaloy Majumdar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/only-7-of-canadians-hold-a-positive-view-of-china-says-new-survey/story-Z6GhChwxc39rrrD4K9T9cP.html

That will determine the panel’s recommendations to the CDC on how to prioritize shots.State officials are expected to follow the CDC’s guidance as they distribute the first vaccines.Vaccine supplies will be limited at first. There won’t be enough to protect everyone, yet getting the shots to the right people could change the course of the pandemic.Many other questions about distribution remain unanswered, Sgaier noted, such as whether to distribute shots equally across the country, or to focus on areas that are hot spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-limited-covid-19-vaccine-supplies-who-will-be-the-first-to-get-it/story-HZHkDEFstK5HJSMEP6nz3K.html

These people are also more likely to feel negatively towards local ethnic diversity, the study also showed.After the research findings, Institute founder Ed Kessler called on ministers to create new opportunities for friendships under public policies to improve community relations. As more and more people continue to work from home in the wake of Covid-19, they risk going “back into isolated silos,” Kessler also said.Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases worldwide soared to 54,826,773 as the virus continues to infect thousands of people across the world. While the number of people succumbing to the disease stood at 1,323,093.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-term-work-from-home-may-lead-to-increase-in-racism-study/story-HxFTwZh13P6uujrTjdVFCK.html
17-11-2020||World||Angela Merkel sees German recovery accelerating once coronavirus is tamed||German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed optimism that a recovery in Europe’s biggest economy will gather pace once the coronavirus pandemic is brought back under control.Merkel said that while the situation remains “very serious,” officials are better equipped now to fight the disease than at the start of the outbreak in the spring. She cited recent progress in developing vaccines as another positive sign.“We must bring the numbers down and keep them at a low level,” Merkel said Tuesday at a Sueddeutsche Zeitung conference. “And if that succeeds -- we saw this in the third quarter of this year -- then the economic recovery will significantly accelerate.”Germany’s economy bounced back strongly after a collapse in activity in the spring, but new curbs introduced after a fresh wave of infections are likely to lead to stagnation at best in the final quarter. That’s despite financial aid for the hardest-hit sectors like hospitality and entertainment.Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, speaking immediately after Merkel, said the government is making some 14 billion euros ($16.6 billion) available this month to ease the blow, up from the original allocation of 10 billion euros.While the latest restrictions are less severe and more focused on hospitality and leisure activities, Germany’s critical export sector is suffering from a resurgence of the virus across Europe, the Bundesbank said Monday. On balance, it expects the hit to the economy to be smaller than after the lockdown in March and April.Merkel on Monday failed to push through a range of tougher contact restrictions, thwarted by resistance from the country’s 16 state premiers. She had proposed requiring face masks for all school students and limiting playmates to one other child.After a five-hour video conference with the regional leaders, she urged citizens to further limit public and private gatherings, while postponing decisions on a road map for the coming months to next week.Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, indicated that the government would make another attempt to tighten curbs when the chancellor holds the next round of talks with state premiers on Nov. 25 -- days before current measures are due to expire.“Restrictions are never easy to decide on and have to be well thought through,” Braun said Tuesday in an interview with ZDF television. “We’re not making a secret of the fact that the chancellor and the government would like to have acted sooner.”The dispute shows the fine line Merkel’s government is treading in trying to slow the pandemic without stoking social, political and economic tensions.Two weeks into a partial shutdown -- which closed bars and restaurants but kept schools and most shops open -- Germany’s contagion rates are still almost three times the level authorities have determined to be manageable.On Monday, incidence over the previous seven days was at 143 per 100,000 citizens, according to the RKI public health institute, and the government has said it must come down to around 50 to allow effective contact tracing.There were 14,580 new infections in the 24 hours through Tuesday morning, taking the total to 817,526, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That compares with more than 2 million cases in France, 1.5 million in Spain and 1.2 million in Italy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-sees-german-recovery-accelerating-once-coronavirus-is-tamed/story-teJU0EiBzyv5rTpf9g5hCJ.html

So we have to reduce contacts, reduce contacts, reduce contacts,” Merkel said.France regaining controlFrance’s health minister Olivier Veran said on Tuesday the country was regaining control over the coronavirus but was not ready to ease the second national lockdown.After curfew measures applied in major French cities in mid-October failed to produce the results the government had hoped for, it enforced a one-month lockdown on Oct. 30, though it was less strict than the one that ran from March 17 to May 11.“If we let up our efforts too early, if we are less compliant with the lockdown, we might be subject to a new epidemic surge that would undo all the hard work done by the French people for several weeks,” Veran told BFM TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-updates-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-right-now/story-dojqgQzRuqJviO60nRftdN.html
17-11-2020||World||Henry Kissinger warns Joe Biden of US-China catastrophe on scale of World War I||Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said the incoming Biden administration should move quickly to restore lines of communication with China that frayed during the Trump years or risk a crisis that could escalate into military conflict.“Unless there is some basis for some cooperative action, the world will slide into a catastrophe comparable to World War I,” Kissinger said during the opening session of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. He said military technologies available today would make such a crisis “even more difficult to control” than those of earlier eras.“America and China are now drifting increasingly toward confrontation, and they’re conducting their diplomacy in a confrontational way,” the 97-year-old Kissinger said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. “The danger is that some crisis will occur that will go beyond rhetoric into actual military conflict.”The diplomat who paved the way for President Richard Nixon’s historic 1972 trip to China said he hoped that the shared threat of the Covid-19 pandemic would provide an opening for political discussions between the two countries when Biden takes office on Jan. 20.“If you can look at Covid as a warning, in the sense that in practice it is dealt with by each country largely autonomously, but its long-term solution has to be on some global basis,” Kissinger said, “it should be dealt with as a lesson.”US-China relations are at their lowest in decades, despite the two sides reaching a “phase one” trade deal at the start of the year. Since then, the virus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, has gone global, killing more than 1.3 million people and crushing economies around the world.As President Donald Trump stepped up his criticism of China, blaming it for the spread of the virus and the death toll in the US, each side also has ramped up moves the other sees as hostile.Last week, China’s crackdown on Hong Kong’s autonomy continued, as officials there disqualified lawmakers viewed as insufficiently loyal to Beijing. US officials have decried the death of the “one country, two systems” policy that has helped Beijing navigate its ties with the West for a generation.The US followed up on its criticism by imposing new sanctions, banning investments in 31 Chinese firms it says are controlled by the country’s People’s Liberation Army.“Trump has a more confrontational method of negotiation than you can apply indefinitely,” Kissinger said. Early in Trump’s term, “it was important for him to emphasize the deep concerns Americans have about the evolution of the world economy that is not balanced. I think that was important to emphasize. But since then, I would have preferred a more differentiated approach.”The swift erosion in ties this year means China and the US are edging toward a new Cold War, Kissinger said, adding that the two sides should “agree that whatever other conflict they have, they will not resort to military conflict.”To achieve that, the US and China should jointly create “an institutional system by which some leader that our president trusts and some Chinese leader that President Xi trusts are designated to remain in contact with each other on behalf of their presidents,” he said.Relations with China may dominate the foreign policy agenda of President-elect Joe Biden’s administration. He’s expected to seek ways to defuse tensions in areas including the future of 5G technology, China’s expansionism in the South China Sea and Hong Kong’s fading autonomy.While Biden has decades of experience in dealing with China, his tone took a harsher turn during the presidential primaries. He frequently criticized China’s assertive policies in its region as well as Beijing’s human rights record, even branding President Xi Jinping a “thug” during a debate in February.“Of course, there are differences on the issue of human rights,” Kissinger said when asked what more China could do to improve relations. “It is important for each side to understand the sensitivities of the other, and not necessarily to solve the problem, but to alleviate it to a point where further progress is possible.”Xi used a speech last week to call for countries to strengthen cooperation and avoid conflict, even as his policies set China on a collision course with the US And China last week congratulated Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on their election victory.“The United States and China have never faced countries of a magnitude that is roughly equal with the other,” Kissinger said. “This is the first experience. And we must avoid its turning into conflict, and hopefully lead to some cooperative endeavors.”Reviewing some of Biden’s proposals for addressing China, Kissinger urged caution when asked about the idea of building a coalition of democracies to take on Beijing.History of Crisis“I think democracies should cooperate wherever their convictions allow it or dictate it,” he added. “I think a coalition aimed at a particular country is unwise, but a coalition to prevent dangers is necessary where the occasion requires.”Ultimately, Kissinger said, the two nations’ leaders need to recognize that they see the same issues very differently, and that colors their approach to talks.“Americans have had a history of relatively uninterrupted success,” he said. “The Chinese have had a very long history of repeated crises. America has had the good fortune of being free of immediate dangers. Chinese have usually been surrounded by countries that have had designs on their unity.”Europe will increasingly find itself caught in a tug-of-war between the US and Eurasia, Kissinger added.“Europe has been an anchor of American foreign policy in the entire post-World War II period,” he said. “The question for them now is whether, in the evolution of relations with other parts of the world, they will attempt to play a totally autonomous role.”The New Economy Forum is being organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. Other guests include Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, Stephen Schwarzman, chairman, co-founder and chief executive officer of Blackstone Group Inc., and Chris Kempczinski, president and CEO of McDonald’s Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/henry-kissinger-warns-joe-biden-of-us-china-catastrophe-on-scale-of-world-war-i/story-Lf4Dk9TUv7B9hMJINJZZeK.html

Interim data from a late-stage trial indicated Moderna’s vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19.“We have today secured an initial agreement for 5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine,” Hancock said at a news conference.Britain had previously secured supply deals for a total of 350 million vaccine doses from six different suppliers, including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), whose vaccine was found to be more than 90% effective, and 100 million doses of an AstraZeneca/Oxford (AZN.L) candidate expected to report late-stage results in coming weeks. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the government had prioritised deals with vaccine developers who could provide early supply to Britain and have advanced manufacturing supply chains in place.Asked if he regretted not being able to buy more of the Moderna vaccine, Hancock said Britain expected to have other vaccines sooner.“The Moderna vaccine doesn’t come on stream until the spring,” Hancock said. “I’m just really pleased that we’ve got those early vaccines that will be available early, and we’ve already got the orders of those in.”Britain expects to take delivery of the Pfizer vaccine before the Moderna shot becomes available, as well as AstraZeneca’s candidate if it proves to be effective.Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van Tam said data from late-stage trials of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine had not been reviewed, so it was still unknown if it works.But he added that trial results from both the Pfizer and partner BioNTech (22UAy.F) vaccine and Moderna’s augured well for other candidates that target the coronavirus’ spike protein. “This really does begin to show us that the spike protein is a completely plausible and effective target for vaccines to be working against,” Van Tam said.“We’re feeling in a happier place than we were.

While the CIA team continued to work on identifying the Pacer, I asked Tom Donilon and John Brennan to explore what a raid would look like,” Obama writes in his memoir.The need for secrecy added to the challenge; if even the slightest hint of our lead on bin Laden leaked, we knew our opportunity would be lost. As a result, only a handful of people across the entire federal government were read into the planning phase of the operation, he said.“We had one other constraint: Whatever option we chose could not involve the Pakistanis,” he wrote.“Although Pakistan’s government cooperated with us on a host of counterterrorism operations and provided a vital supply path for our forces in Afghanistan, it was an open secret that certain elements inside the country’s military, and especially its intelligence services, maintained links to the Taliban and perhaps even al-Qaeda, sometimes using them as strategic assets to ensure that the Afghan government remained weak and unable to align itself with Pakistan’s number one rival, India,” Obama revealed.“The fact that the Abbottabad compound was just a few miles from the Pakistan military’s equivalent of West Point only heightened the possibility that anything we told the Pakistanis could end up tipping off our target. “Whatever we chose to do in Abbottabad, then, would involve violating the territory of a putative ally in the most egregious way possible, short of war— raising both the diplomatic stakes and the operational complexities,” he wrote.In the final stages they were discussing two options. The first was to demolish it with an air strike. The second option was to authorise a special ops mission, in which a select team would covertly fly into Pakistan via helicopter, raid the compound, and get out before the Pakistani police or military had time to react. Despite all the risks involved, Obama and his national security team opted for the second option, but not before multiple rounds of discussions and intensive planning.The day before he gave the final approval for the raid, at a Situation Room meeting, Hillary Clinton, the then Secretary of State, said that it was a 51-49 call. “Gates recommended against a raid, although he was open to considering the strike option,” he said.“Joe (Biden) also weighed in against the raid, arguing that given the enormous consequences of failure, I should defer any decision until the intelligence community was more certain that bin Laden was in the compound. “As had been true in every major decision I’d made as president, I appreciated Joe’s willingness to buck the prevailing mood and ask tough questions, often in the interest of giving me the space I needed for my own internal deliberations,” Obama wrote.After the successful Abbottabad raid, Obama made a number of calls domestically and internationally, the toughest of which he expected to be that with the then Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, he wrote.“I expected my most difficult call to be with Pakistan’s beleaguered president, Asif Ali Zardari, who would surely face a backlash at home over our violation of Pakistani sovereignty. When I reached him, however, he expressed congratulations and support. ‘Whatever the fallout,’ he said, ‘it’s very good news.” He showed genuine emotion, recalling how his wife, Benazir Bhutto, had been killed by extremists with reported ties to al-Qaeda,” Obama wrote.“Mike Mullen had put a call in to Pakistan’s army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and while the conversation had been polite, Kayani had requested that we come clean on the raid and its target as quickly as possible in order to help his people manage the reaction of the Pakistani public,” he said. Laden, the world’s most wanted terrorist, was the chief of al-Qaeda that carried out the 9/11 attacks on twin towers in New York, killing nearly 3,000 people. He was killed in a covert raid by a US Navy SEAL team at his Abbottabad compound in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/certain-elements-inside-pak-military-had-links-to-al-qaeda-obama-on-raid-that-killed-osama/story-tqCmflEPqSqXiId3eSbbHK.html

17-11-2020||World||24 hours in the ICU: Fighting for an open bed in Covid-19 hit French town||Four more calls to go, each with careful words, painful silences.It’s 2 p.m. in the intensive care ward of Marseille’s La Timone hospital, and Dr. Julien Carvelli is phoning families hit by the second wave of the coronavirus with news about their children, husbands, wives. With intensive care wards at over 95% capacity in France for over 10 days, Carvelli makes at least eight of these difficult calls a day.In Marseille, this wave is bringing even more people to the ICU than the first one in the spring, many in more severe condition. Carvelli warns one father that his son may need to be put into a coma.“For the moment, he’s holding on. But it’s true that — I don’t know what you’ve been told already — his respiratory state is worrying,” Carvelli acknowledges. There’s a long pause on the other end.Also Read: What a surge in coronavirus cases in California means“Listen, do your best,” comes the strained reply at last.France is two weeks into its second coronavirus lockdown, known as “le confinement.” Associated Press journalists spent 24 hours with the intensive care team at La Timone, southern France’s largest hospital, as they struggled to keep even one bed open for the influx of patients to come.The doctors and nurses tell themselves and each other that they just have to hold on a little longer. Government tallies show infections may have reached their second-wave high point, and hospitalizations dropped last weekend for the first time since September.But the medical workers are also frustrated that France did not prepare more in the months after the first wave. And while doctors and nurses were seen as heroes back then, this time is different.“Before, they applauded every night. Now they tell us it’s just doing our job,” says Chloe Gascon, a 23-year-old nurse who has spent half her 18-month career under the shadow of coronavirus. Her voice carries more than a trace of bitterness.Marseille has been submerged with coronavirus cases since September. The port city, on France’s Mediterranean coast, was spared the worst of the virus last spring only to be hit with a vengeance as the summer vacation wound down. Bars and restaurants closed across the city on Sept. 27, more than a month before they shut down nationwide. It wasn’t enough.A decade of budget cuts left France with half the number of intensive care beds this year, when it needed them most. By the time the first confinement ended on May 11, more than 26,000 people had died in France. The government pledged to take advantage of the expected summer lull to add beds and train reinforcements.That was the time to act, when new infections were at their low point, said Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds.Also Read: Coronavirus curbs return across United States“It was always bubbling away under the surface,” he said.But it was only in early fall that work started on refashioning an acute care wing at La Timone, which opened less than two weeks ago and still has exposed wiring and a fiberboard barricade with duct tape. The promised reinforcements have been slow in coming as well, and any training they get is in the moment, as Pauline Reynier is learning during her first week as an ICU nurse.Compared to the emergency room, the ICU is a relatively calm place, with moments of urgency when a patient needs more oxygen or an intervention. The quiet is punctuated by the constant soundtrack of machines beeping. There is no good news here; the best news is that a patient is stable enough to be moved elsewhere.When the 12-hour nursing shift starts at 7 a.m., all 16 beds are filled with COVID-19 patients, and five are conscious. For those in artificial comas, it takes about an hour and at least two people to wash and then carefully rotate each one in their beds, keeping the wires and plastic tubing in place.This is Reynier’s first task.She helped in a regular coronavirus ward during the first wave and offered to retrain over the summer for intensive care. Instead, the 26-year-old was sent back to cardiology, which was filling with patients who had postponed heart surgeries. It was just a week into the second lockdown that the call came to report to the ICU on November 11, a lightly staffed national holiday.It is only Reynier’s second shift as an ICU reinforcement. Her new colleagues barely know her name and have little time to teach. The daughter of a nurse who also works at La Timone, she largely learns by watching.It takes months to train as an intensive care nurse, years to become experienced in the gruelling specialty of holding death at bay.This virus is even more demanding than the usual urgent challenges. Caregivers risk nearly as much as the patient, and dress accordingly, each time they enter a room. And so going to the bedside means planning multiple tasks at once: washing, toothbrushing, checking vitals, changing IV drips and, finally, turning the patient over to help improve breathing.Reynier pulls on a long-sleeved apron over the scrubs with a quick twist of the wrist to knot the neck. Then a pair of gloves. Punch a thumbhole through the bottom of the sleeve to secure the gloves, then pull on a second pair of gloves. Head covering, goggles and, finally, a second apron in plastic. X-ray technicians wear a third set of gloves to handle the plates. Doctors performing an intubation or other major procedure wear a plastic face shield over the goggles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/24-hours-in-the-icu-fighting-for-an-open-bed-in-covid-19-hit-french-town/story-jbf3tsjdpLnVU7lXg77CoO.html
17-11-2020||World||What a surge in coronavirus cases in California means||California has become the second US state after Texas to have a million known cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), while the US has surpassed 10 million infections, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. California recorded 10,968 fresh cases on Monday which takes the total cases to 1,019,345 since the pandemic began.There have been 18,253 Covid-19 deaths reported in the state. The seven-day positivity rate is now 4.8% and the 14-day positivity rate is 4.4%.As California is the United State’s most populous state - with 40 million residents - the surge in the cases has been very worrying. Eleven counties in California had to reimpose limits this week.What do the experts say?ABC news reported that the virus has struck poor Californians and Latinos especially hard as Latinos make up 39 per cent of the population but account for more than 60 per cent of infections. NYT reported that the expected mortality rate is lower and has dropped by nearly a third since April due to advances in therapeutic treatments.How has California managed the pandemic so far?California had some of the earliest known cases in America in February among travellers from China, where the outbreak began. The February 6 death of a San Jose woman is the first known coronavirus fatality in the US. In February, California recorded the first US case not related to travel and the infection spread within the community. On March 19, Governor Gavin Newsom issued the nation’s first state-wide stay-at-home order, shutting businesses and schools to try to prevent hospitals from overcrowding. The spread slowed, but California faced the same challenges as other states: providing enough protective gear for health workers, doing enough testing and providing timely results, tracking infections and those potentially exposed.Read more | Moderna Covid-19 vaccine progress lifts stock marketsAs the state tried to balance public health and the economy, cases rose as it relaxed business restrictions.What about the other states in the US?West Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland have been reporting record rises in the coronavirus cases for the past one week.

17-11-2020||World||Pak’s ‘dossier’ on India is a gamble. 4 reasons why Imran Khan took the risk | Analysis||Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government attempted to change the narrative around Pakistan’s support to terrorism last weekend but the effort to build a case against India has continued for more than a year. The release of the bunch of documents that Islamabad has described as a dossier came after its repeated attempts to implicate Indians for terrorism did not succeed. The last one was in September when the United Nations Security Council rejected a proposal by Imran Khan, backed by President Xi Jinping’s China, to designate two Indians as terrorists under the 1267 sanctions committee process. A few months earlier, the UNSC had already blocked proposals to designate four other Indians.It is in this context that Moeed W Yusuf, Imran Khan’s special assistant on National Security Division and Strategic Policy Planning, switched gears and started building the ground for a public campaign in October when he accused India of perpetrating terrorism in Pakistan. An academic believed to have had links with the Pakistan Army when he was still in the United States, Moeed Yusuf has been big on building narratives after joining the government. Yusuf did complain not so long ago how Pakistan had not been able to set the narrative on Kashmir, a remark that was then seen as an indictment of the foreign office led by Shah Mahmood Qureshi. Last month, he told a news conference that the media should play a role to change the country’s narrative. “Pakistan’s narrative is of economic security and the world has not seen that,” he lamented, claiming Islamabad stood for regional peace. At the same briefing, Yusuf complained about India’s “one-sided narrative” against Pakistan and hinted that Islamabad would launch a counter-narrative.The ‘dossier’ unveiled at a Press conference by foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and he military spokesperson Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar in Islamabad was Moeed Yusuf’s first step to make an attempt to change the narrative.By all indications, a Pakistan watcher in New Delhi said, the “dummy dossier”, which regurgitated old allegations, was a rush job. It had got spellings of Indian intelligence chiefs accused of fomenting trouble in Pakistan wrong. Some basics too.“The entire dossier is full of such howlers,” he said. “From the estimates of economic costs of terrorism ($126 billion) to reports of terror training camps in India and Afghanistan, from allegations of a special cell to sabotage China Pakistan Economic Corridor to Indian embassies (high commission) and consulates along Pakistan’s border serving as operations centre, the dossier is full of half-baked, fatuous, and asinine assertions which the Imran Khan government believes constitute ‘irrefutable evidence’,” he said.It also repeats Moeed Yusuf’s recent charge that attempts to link India to the 2014 terrorist assault on an army school in Peshawar, an attack for which the Taliban had claimed responsibility. The Pakistan army had then claimed to have arrested the main executors of the dastardly attack that killed 141 people including 131 children. In August 2015, then Pakistan Army chief Raheel Sharif had confirmed the death sentence given by military courts to seven members of Tehrik-e-Taliban and Tawhid-wal-Jihad group for supporting and collecting funds for the school attack.To be sure, this isn’t Pakistan’s first effort to tarnish India’s reputation and acquiring some sort of parity with New Delhi by levelling charges of sponsoring terrorism. Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in 2017, did make the effort when she called India the mother of terrorism in south India and accused New Delhi of “indulging in an orgy of slander against Pakistan”. But that campaign sank without a trace. Indian counter-terror officials said there were four possible explanations why the Imran Khan government decided to amp up its pitch against India at this time.A counter-terror official said the attempt to put the spotlight on India comes at a time Imran Khan is under tremendous pressure from a resurgent opposition, and economic distress, continuing drift in governance and an economy drowning in debt. Desperate to get the opposition to call off their anti-regime programme, the government has resorted to the time-tested India bogey. Moeed Yusuf did tacitly admit that the government wants the opposition to understand the sensitivity of the matter and not politicise things to a point that India can take advantage.Secondly, officials said, this was a ploy to divert attention from the rigging that was planned in the Pakistan-occupied Gilgit Baltistan. The India threat could help both shift focus as well as be used as a bogey to contain any fallout of the rigging. Pakistan Peoples Party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has already accused Imran Khan’s party of carrying out “open and naked rigging” in Gilgit-Baltistan’s elections.Thirdly, the dossier coincides with the election of the Joe Biden administration in the United States. An official said Pakistan timed the dossier to persuade the in-coming administration that it needs to play a more even-handed role in the region and force India to desist from taking any aggressive action against Pakistani adventurism and export of terrorism.Fourthly, it would help target and tarnish opposition leaders such as Nawaz Sharif who have been accused of being soft on India and wanting to normalise relations with India.The dossier is aimed as much at the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’ constituency back home as the international community, a national security planner in New Delhi said. It is a gamble but could backfire on Imran Khan if the campaign collapses like the last one. Because then he will have to explain why he couldn’t sell its narrative to the people and the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-dossier-on-india-is-a-gamble-it-could-backfire-on-imran-khan-analysis/story-bxFNR488ZtmqiRTPK5GWUN.html

The Dragon capsule pulled up and docked late Monday night, following a 27-hour, completely automated flight from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. The linkup occurred 262 miles (422 kilometers) above Idaho.“Oh, what a good voice to hear,” space station astronaut Kate Rubins called out when the Dragon’s commander, Mike Hopkins, first made radio contact.“We can’t wait to have you on board,” she added after the two spacecraft were latched together.This is the second astronaut mission for SpaceX.

17-11-2020||World||‘My fascination with India largely revolved around Mahatma Gandhi’: Barack Obama in his book||Former US President Barack Obama has said that his fascination with India largely revolved around Mahatma Gandhi, whose “successful non-violent campaign against the British rule became a beacon for other dispossessed, marginalised groups”. However, the 44th US president, in his latest book, rues that the Indian icon was unable to successfully address the caste system or prevent the partition of the country based on religion. In his book “A Promised Land”, Obama writes on his journey from the 2008 election campaign to the end of his first term with the daring Abbottabad (Pakistan) raid that killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. “A Promised Land” is the first of two planned volumes. The first part hit bookstores globally on Tuesday. “More than anything, though, my fascination with India had to do with Mahatma Gandhi. Along with (Abraham) Lincoln, (Martin Luther) King, and (Nelson) Mandela, Gandhi had profoundly influenced my thinking,” writes Obama, who had visited India twice as president. “As a young man, I’d studied his writings and found him giving voice to some of my deepest instincts,” the former US president said. “His notion of ‘satyagraha’, or devotion to truth, and the power of non-violent resistance to stir the conscience; his insistence on our common humanity and the essential oneness of all religions; and his belief in every society’s obligation, through its political, economic, and social arrangements, to recognise the equal worth and dignity of all people -- each of these ideas resonated with me. Gandhi’s actions had stirred me even more than his words; he’d put his beliefs to the test by risking his life, going to prison, and throwing himself fully into the struggles of his people,” Obama writes. Gandhi’s non-violent campaign for Indian independence from Britain, which began in 1915 and continued for more than 30 years, hadn’t just helped overcome an empire and liberate much of the subcontinent, it had set off a moral charge that pulsed around the globe, he writes. “It became a beacon for other dispossessed, marginalised groups — including Black Americans in the Jim Crow South — intent on securing their freedom,” says Obama. Recollecting his first visit to India in November 2010, Obama said he and then First Lady, Michelle, had visited Mani Bhavan, the modest two-story building tucked into a quiet Mumbai neighbourhood that had been Gandhi’s home for many years. “Before the start of our tour, our guide, a gracious woman in a blue sari, showed us the guestbook Dr King had signed in 1959, when he’d travelled to India to draw international attention to the struggle for racial justice in the United States and pay homage to the man whose teachings had inspired him,” he writes. “The guide then invited us upstairs to see Gandhi’s private quarters. Taking off our shoes, we entered a simple room with a floor of smooth, patterned tile, its terrace doors open to admit a slight breeze and a pale, hazy light,” he said. “I stared at the spartan floor bed and pillow, the collection of spinning wheels, the old-fashioned phone and low wooden writing desk, trying to imagine Gandhi present in the room, a slight, brown-skinned man in a plain cotton dhoti, his legs folded under him, composing a letter to the British viceroy or charting the next phase of the Salt March,” he said. “And in that moment, I had the strongest wish to sit beside him and talk. To ask him where he’d found the strength and imagination to do so much with so very little. To ask how he’d recovered from disappointment,” he wrote. Obama said Gandhi had had more than his share of struggle. “For all his extraordinary gifts, Gandhi hadn’t been able to heal the subcontinent’s deep religious schisms or prevent its partitioning into a predominantly Hindu India and an overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan, a seismic event in which untold numbers died in sectarian violence and millions of families were forced to pack up what they could carry and migrate across newly established borders,” he said. “Despite his labours, he hadn’t undone India’s stifling caste system. Somehow, though, he’d marched, fasted, and preached well into his seventies — until that final day in 1948, when on his way to prayer, he was shot at point-blank range by a young Hindu extremist who viewed his ecumenism as a betrayal of the faith,” Obama writes.

Pfizer’s vaccine, which was shown to be more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 based on initial data, must be shipped and stored at -70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46°F).“We are hopeful that results from this vaccine delivery pilot will serve as the model for other U.S. states and international governments, as they prepare to implement effective Covid-19 vaccine programs,” Pfizer said in a statement on Monday.It picked Rhode Island, Texas, New Mexico, and Tennessee for the program after taking into account their differences in overall size, diversity of populations, immunization infrastructure, and need to reach individuals in varied urban and rural settings. The four states will not receive vaccine doses earlier than other states by virtue of the pilot, nor will they receive any differential consideration, Pfizer said.Read more | Covid-19 vaccine update: Bharat Biotech begins phase 3 trials, Moderna says its candidate nearly 95% effectiveThe company expects to have enough safety data on the vaccine from the ongoing large scale late-stage trials by the third week of November before proceeding to apply for emergency use authorization (EUA). Pfizer and its partner BioNTech have a $1.95 billion deal to supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to the US government, which has an option to acquire up to an additional 500 million doses.Earlier on Monday, rival Moderna Inc said its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19 based on interim data from a late-stage trial, boosting hopes that vaccines against the disease may be ready for use soon.

The summit will bring together PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping for the second time in seven days, amid the ongoing Indo-China standoff in Ladakh, after last week’s Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.Also Read | BRICS Summit: Narendra Modi, Xi Jinping to share platform againThe 12th BRICS summit is being held on the theme of “Global stability, shared security and innovative growth.”Here’s all you need to know about the 5-member bloc ‘BRICS’1.The acronym ’BRICS’ stands for the five member states of the bloc: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Initially, the group was only called ‘BRIC’ as South Africa was not among its original members and only joined in December 2010 at China’s invitation. The name of the group was hence modified to ‘BRICS.’2. Goldman Sachs’ Jim O’Neill is credited with coining the term ‘BRIC’ in his 2001 publication titled ‘Building Better Global Economic BRICs.’ Neill coined this term to indicate the emerging powers he believed would be, along with the United States, the world’s five largest economies in the 21st century.3. In 2006, the foreign ministers of the original four member states met in New York City on the sidelines of the General Debate of the United Nations Assembly. Subsequently, in 2009, Russia’s Yekaterinburg hosted a full-scale diplomatic meeting of the group.4. The Russian city also hosted the first formal BRIC summit on 16 June 2009. Lula da Silva (then-Brazilian President), Dmitry Medvedev (then-Russian President), Manmohan Singh (then-Indian Prime Minister) and Hu Jintao (then-Chinese President) were the participants of the first BRIC summit.5. A total of 10 BRICS summits have taken place since then. These were held in Brazil (2010), China (2011), India (2012), South Africa (2013), Brazil (2014), Russia (2015), India (2016), China (2017), South Africa (2018) and Brazil (2019).6. South Africa’s first summit as a full member was in 2011 in China’s Sanya. The current summit is the first BRICS summit that will take place virtually though Russia retains its status of the host nation. India, meanwhile, is scheduled to host its third BRICS summit, the group’s 13th, in 2021. 7. Of the five member states, four are among the world’s 10 most populous countries: China (1), India (2), Brazil (6) and Russia (9). South Africa, meanwhile, is the 24th most populous nation in the world.8. In terms of area, once again, four are among top 10: Russia (1), China (3), Brazil (5) and India (7). Here, too, South Africa comes at 24.9. BRICS has a total of five official languages: Portuguese (Brazil), Russian (Russia), Hindi (India), Mandarin (China) and English (South Africa). The group is headquartered at Shanghai, China.10. The group also comprises two financial institutions: the New Development Bank (NDB; also called BRICS Development Bank) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA). Both were created at the 6th summit in 2014, held in Brazil’s Fortaleza, and became active in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-to-attend-brics-summit-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-5-nation-bloc/story-JsPlRlukEsuftQDCboGFYP.html
17-11-2020||World||Moderna vaccine results ‘stunningly impressive,’ says Anthony Fauci||The United States’ top infectious disease scientist on Monday hailed early results from Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine trial as “stunningly impressive,” calling the findings an emphatic validation of experimental mRNA technology that some had doubted.“I must admit that I would have been satisfied with 70 or at the most 75 percent efficacy,” he told AFP.“The idea that we have a 94.5 percent effective vaccine is stunningly impressive. It is really a spectacular result that I don’t think anybody had anticipated would be this good.”Also Read: Covid-19: Pfizer, Moderna to supply 50 million, 20 million of vaccine dosesFauci leads the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which began co-developing the vaccine with the US biotech company in January, shortly after China shared the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus.The vaccine is based on a relatively new technology that uses a synthetic version of a molecule called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.No vaccine based on this platform has ever been approved.“There were many people who had reservations about using something that had not been tried and true over the years; in fact, some people even criticized us for that,” said Fauci.On Monday, Moderna and NIAID announced their preliminary results based on 95 of the 30,000 volunteers they had recruited who fell ill with Covid-19.Of the 95, 90 had been in the trial’s placebo group, and five in the group that received the drug, called mRNA-1273, translating to an efficacy rate of 94.5 percent.Fauci recalled that some had questioned whether the vaccine would prevent severe forms of Covid-19, not just mild or moderate cases -- and this too had been resoundingly answered.“There were 11 severe events, none in the vaccine group -- 11 in the placebo group, so that settles the question of whether it prevents severe disease, which it definitely does.”‘The data speak for themselves’ It follows a similarly impressive result from American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech last week, which reported an efficacy of 90 percent for their vaccine.Asked whether it was too early to say if mRNA technology had now been proven, Fauci -- who is usually known for his cautious statements -- said the jury was definitely in.“I think when you have two vaccines like this, that have proven to be greater than 90 percent effective, I think that mRNA is here, it’s established itself, it doesn’t need to prove anything anymore.“The data speak for themselves; it isn’t me, it isn’t my opinion -- look at the data,” he said.Also Read: Covid-19: India records more daily recoveries than new cases for 6 successive weeksTraditional virus vaccines use actual viruses that have to be grown in chicken eggs or fetal cell lines and then weakened so they don’t harm people -- a process that can take many months. By contrast, the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines deliver the genetic information needed to create a protein that lies on the surface of the virus -- called the spike protein -- directly to cells in the human body, which then grow it.This primes the immune system to make antibodies to the actual virus, and has the major advantage of shortening vaccine development time to a matter of weeks, once scientists have the genetic sequence of the protein they want to create.While Moderna has basked in the spotlight, Fauci was keen to highlight the work of NIAID, which he said was responsible for developing a precise way to orient the spike protein molecule such that it elicited the strongest immune response.But there are still some unanswered questions, including how long the immunity lasts. Fauci said he was “certain” it would endure to some extent, as immune system cells called “memory B cells” remained on standby to generate new antibodies to the virus.But for how long was unclear. “We don’t know whether it’s going to be a year, two years, three years, five years, we don’t know,” he said.Looking forward, Fauci said he was worried about anti-vaccine sentiment in the United States, the country that has been the worst-hit by the pandemic. “You’ve got to overcome that and convince people to get vaccinated, because a vaccine with a high degree of efficacy is of no use if nobody gets vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-results-stunningly-impressive-says-anthony-fauci/story-Lzd1JoP9QY5dD0fmQhhsSL.html
17-11-2020||World||Hurricane Iota makes landfall on Nicaragua coast||Powerful Hurricane Iota made landfall on Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast late Monday, threatening catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by equally strong Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago. Iota had intensified into an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm early in the day, but the US National Hurricane Center said it weakened slightly to Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kph). Its center made landfall about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi.Iota already had been hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds. Iota came ashore just 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of where Hurricane Eta made landfall Nov. 3, also as a Category 4 storm. Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil in the region, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.In Bilwi, business owner Adán Artola Schultz braced himself in the doorway of his house as strong gusts of wind and rain drover water in torrents down the street. He watched in amazement as wind ripped away the metal roof structure from a substantial two-story home and blew it away like paper.“It is like bullets,” he said of the sound of metal structures banging and buckling in the wind. “This is double destruction,” he said, referring to the damages wrought by Eta just 12 days earlier.“This is coming in with fury,” said Artola Schultz.Storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt in Bilwi’s seaside El Muelle neighborhood.“The situation doesn’t look good at all,” Wriedt said earlier in the day. “We woke up without electricity, with rain and the surf is getting really high.”Read more | Trump aide promises ‘very professional transition’ to BidenWriedt, who works for a small-scale fishing organization called Piquinera, said the roof of her house was blown off in Eta less than two weeks ago.“We repaired it as best we could. Now I think the wind will take it again because they say (Iota) is even stronger,” she said, the sound of hammering echoing around her as neighbors boarded windows and reinforced roofs.During Eta, the surf came up to just behind her house, where she lives with eight other members of her family. “Today I’m afraid again about losing my house and I’m frightened for all of us who live in this neighborhood,” she said. Wriedt said some neighbors went to stay with relatives elsewhere, but most have stayed. “We’re almost all here,” she said. “Neither the army nor the government came to move us.”Cairo Jarquin, Nicaragua emergency response project manager for Catholic Relief Services, had just visited Bilwi and smaller coastal communities Friday. In Wawa Bar, Jarquin said he found “total destruction” from Eta. People had been working furiously to put roofs back over their families’ heads, but now Iota threatened to take what was left. “The little that remained standing could be razed,” Jarquin said. There were other communities farther inland that he was not even able to reach due to the condition of roads. He said he heard that Wawa bar was evacuated again Saturday.Read more | Wealthy, corporations will ‘pay their fair share’: BidenEvacuations were conducted from low-lying areas in Nicaragua and Honduras near their shared border through the weekend. Nicaraguan Vice President Rosario Murillo, who is also the first lady, said that the government had done everything necessary to protect lives, including the evacuation of thousands. She added that Taiwan had donated 800 tons of rice to help those affected by the storms. Limborth Bucardo, of the Miskito Indigenous ethnic group, said many people had moved to churches in Bilwi. He rode out Eta with his wife and two children at home, but this time decided to move in with relatives in a safer neighborhood.“We hadn’t finished repairing our houses and settling in when another hurricane comes,” Bucardo said. “The shelters in Bilwi are already full, packed with people from (surrounding) communities.”Iota is the record 30th named storm of this year’s extraordinarily busy Atlantic hurricane season. It’s also the ninth storm to rapidly intensify this season, a dangerous phenomenon that is happening increasingly more often. Such activity has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms. Iota is stronger, based on central pressure, than 2005′s Hurricane Katrina and is the first storm with a Greek alphabet name to hit Category 5, Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said. It also sets the record for the latest Category 5 hurricane on record, beating the record set by the Nov. 8, 1932, Cuba Hurricane. Eta had hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, killing more than 130 people as torrential rains caused flash floods and mudslides in parts of Central America and Mexico. Then it meandered across Cuba, the Florida Keys and around the Gulf of Mexico before slogging ashore again near Cedar Key, Florida, and dashing across Florida and the Carolinas.Iota was forecast to drop 10 to 20 inches (250-500 millimeters) of rain in northern Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and southern Belize, with as much as 30 inches (750 millimeters) in isolated spots. Costa Rica and Panama could also experience heavy rain and possible flooding, the hurricane center said.The prospect of more rain was raising the anxiety of those still homeless after Eta.On Monday, Carmen Isabel Rodríguez Ortez was still living inside a government shelter with more than 250 people in La Lima, Honduras, just outside San Pedro Sula. Devastated by Eta’s destruction, she quickly broke into sobs as she contemplated the torrential rains of another storm.“We’re living a real nightmare,” Rodríguez said. The Chamelecon river flooded her Reformada neighborhood as Eta passed, submerging their homes. “Now they announce more rain and we don’t know what’s going to happen, because our homes are completely flooded.”Eta was this year’s 28th named storm, tying the 2005 record. Over the past couple of decades, meteorologists have been more worried about storms like Iota that power up much faster than normal. They created an official threshold for this rapid intensification — a storm gaining 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in just 24 hours. Iota doubled it. Earlier this year, Hannah, Laura, Sally, Teddy, Gamma, Delta, Zeta and Iota all rapidly intensified. Laura and Delta tied or set records for rapid intensification.The official end of the hurricane season is Nov. 30.Watch: Trump claims credit after Moderna claims its vaccine is 94.5% effective||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-iota-makes-landfall-on-nicaragua-coast/story-r3nO0DvIR9guUnY4VR5AqK.html

After Pfizer, US biotech company Moderna said on Monday that its candidate for Covid-19 vaccine is nearly 95% effective in preventing the viral disease and as per the company current projections, it will produce 20 million of Covid-19 vaccines doses by the end of this year. Pfizer, meanwhile, is expecting to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020.As both of the vaccines are two-dose regimen, the companies claim they will be able to vaccinate 25 million and 10 million people around the world, respectively.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBy the next year, Pfizer will expand their production and increase to producing 1.3 billion units. Moderna is planning to increase production between 500 million and one billion.The news could be a start for the future win against the Covid-19, however, the supply will be restricted to countries that already have deal with the manufacturers. Among them is the United States which has a deal with both Pfizer and Moderna for Covid-19 vaccine supply.Also Read | 43% of children have antibodies for Covid-19: StudyThe Indian government is in dialogue with both domestic and international vaccine manufacturers for purchase of Covid-19. “Not only with Moderna, the government is also in communication with Pfizer, Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila for their Covid-19 vaccine candidate in terms of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy,” news agency PTI reported quoting a senior government official.Europe also has a deal with Pfizer and Moderna for 200 million doses.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pfizer-moderna-to-supply-50-million-20-million-of-vaccine-doses/story-xMgvc7ue8C0N2X3DxlMClM.html
17-11-2020||World||Moderna says its Covid-19 vaccine stable at refrigerator temperatures for 30 days||Moderna Inc. said its Covid-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in a preliminary analysis of a large late-stage clinical trial, another sign that a fast-paced hunt by scientists and pharmaceutical companies is paying off with potent new tools that could help control a worsening pandemic.The highly positive readout comes just a week after a similar shot developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE was found to be more than 90% effective in an interim analysis. Both shots rely on a technology called messenger RNA that has never been used to build an approved vaccine. Soon, millions of people around the world could be spared from illness by the breakthroughs.Also Read: Bharat Biotech begins phase 3 trials, Moderna says its candidate nearly 95% effectiveA first analysis of data from more than 30,000 volunteers showed Moderna’s vaccine prevented virtually all symptomatic cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, the company said in a statement on Monday.Moderna shares rose as much as 15% in New York. The rally in global shares following the news represented about $567 billion in market value added to the MSCI All Country World Index.Only five participants who received two doses of the vaccine became sick, compared with 90 coronavirus cases in participants who received a placebo, according to a review by an independent data safety monitoring board appointed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.The vaccine also appeared to be effective in preventing the most serious Covid-19 infections. There were no severe cases among people who got the vaccine, compared with 11 in volunteers who received placebo shots, according to Moderna’s statement.“The thing that got me the most excited today was the severe disease,” Moderna Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel said in an interview. “That for me is a game-changer.”The results arrive at a moment when the pandemic’s grip is tightening. The U.S. surpassed 11 million coronavirus cases Sunday as Florida reported the most new infections since July and new cases in California hit a three-month high. Deaths and hospitalizations are also rising. Europe has also seen cases soar as much of the world braces for what is expected to be a dire winter.While the results are preliminary, both Moderna and Pfizer are expected to seek emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration if further study shows their vaccines are safe. In its statement, Moderna said it could seek a go-ahead from regulators in the coming weeks.“The results of this trial are truly striking,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on a conference call with reporters. The efficacy against severe disease “is really quite impressive.”What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Moderna’s vaccine mRNA-1273 showing an impressive 94.5% effectiveness in preventing Covid-19 cases gives it an equal footing vs. Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine BNT162b2, in our view. Further, the less-rigorous distribution and shipping requirements provide mRNA-1273 an edge over its rival, though both will be used given the production constraints, while their long-term protection is still unknown.”The company said it would expect an emergency authorization to be based on a final analysis containing 151 cases, along with two months of safety follow-up data that U.S. regulators want to see. That final data is expected later this month.Also Read: Indian govt in talks with Moderna for its Covid-19 vaccine candidateCambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna received $955 million from the U.S. Operation Warp Speed program to develop its vaccine, and the country has agreed to pay up to $1.53 billion to purchase supply of the shot. Pfizer has said it didn’t receive any federal funding to develop its vaccine, though it has a supply agreement with the U.S. worth nearly $2 billion.Moderna expects to manufacture 20 million doses of its vaccine by year-end, enough to vaccinate 10 million people. This initial batch will go to the U.S.Government officials today said on the conference call they also expect to have at least 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, sufficient for another 10 million recipients, available in the U.S. by year-end. Pfizer has said it expects to produce as many as 50 million doses of its vaccine by the end of 2020.Shot StabilityOnce a vaccine is cleared, distribution is expected to be a significant challenge. Handling some of the shots that are being studied is complicated: For example, Pfizer’s must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures until a few days before it’s used, a requirement that adds logistical hurdles for states that will be in charge of overseeing the inoculation effort.Moderna said on Monday that new data showed its vaccine is stable at refrigerator temperatures for 30 days, much longer than previous estimate of seven days. For longer-term storage, it can be kept in freezers, though it doesn’t need the special facilities required for the Pfizer vaccine.“Every pharmacy, doctor’s office, hospital” has the capability to store a vaccine in a regular refrigerator, Bancel said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Monday. The vaccine’s stability at such temperatures will have “a huge impact” in the ability to distribute it widely.Both Moderna’s and Pfizer’s vaccines are based on mRNA technology designed to transform the body’s own cells into vaccine-making factories. Once injected, the vaccines instruct cells to make copies of the coronavirus’s spike protein, stimulating the creation of protective antibodies.The analysis of Moderna’s data found no significant safety concerns, the company said. It said some participants had severe fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain and headaches after getting the vaccine, though the side effects were generally short-lived.Bancel said the data safety monitoring board met at 10 a.m. on Sunday. The CEO said he anxiously checked his email every five minutes until he heard in the early afternoon they had results, and got on a video call to hear them.The result “is a big milestone” for messenger RNA technology, Bancel said. “It shows that mRNA can be a drug.”Surging CasesIn vaccine trials, a certain number of volunteers -- a percentage of whom get a placebo -- have to get infected in order to determine if the vaccine works. That’s easier to accomplish with the pandemic in the U.S. surging. The country has recorded more than 100,000 new infections every day since Nov. 5, according to Johns Hopkins University data compiled by Bloomberg.The same explosion of Covid-19 cases that helped Pfizer get results for its vaccine trial on Nov. 9 helped speed along Moderna’s trial. Moderna on Nov. 11 said its study had accumulated more than 53 infections, allowing a preliminary analysis to begin.Infections were accumulating so fast in the trial that Moderna’s analysis ended up being based on 95 cases, the company said.Bancel said at the rate cases are piling up Moderna should get the final 151 cases by the end of the month, allowing it to complete a final analysis and file for emergency use authorization.Moderna’s final-stage trial started on the same day as Pfizer’s in late July. The company was slightly behind Pfizer largely due to structural differences in the studies. The two doses of Moderna’s vaccine are given four weeks apart; Pfizer’s two doses are given over three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-stable-at-refrigerator-temperatures-for-30-days/story-jbtcMaAWmQ1GmNvKzIVG9K.html

17-11-2020||World||In absence of coordination with Trump, there is risk of many more dying: Joe Biden||US President-elect Joe Biden has said many more Americans are at the risk of dying from coronavirus, if he and incumbent President Donald Trump do not coordinate on tackling the virus outbreak. According to media projections, Democrat Biden has won the November 3 presidential election. However, Trump, a Republican, has alleged election fraud and mounted legal fights in a number of battleground states. “More people may die if we don’t coordinate,” Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, responding to a question on President Donald Trump refusing to concede the election and the outgoing administration not co-operating in the transition process. “A vaccine is important. It’s of little use until you’re vaccinated. So, how do we get the vaccine, how do we get over 300 million Americans vaccinated? What’s the game plan? It’s a huge, huge, huge undertaking to get it done, prioritise those greatest in need and working our way through, and also cooperate with the World Health Organization and the rest of the world in dealing with this,” he said. “So they (Trump administration) say they have this ‘Warp Speed’ program that not only dealt with getting vaccines, but also how to distribute this. If we have to wait until January 20th (day of Presidential inauguration) to start that planning, it puts us behind over a month, month-and-a-half. And so, it’s important that it be done, that there be coordination now, now or as rapidly as we can get that done,” Biden said. As of now, Biden said his action plan is to deal with every individual, organisation in the country from business to labour, Republicans and Democrats, to try to pull together a serious and consistent plan so that he is ready on day one with everything from staffing to ultimately naming cabinet members to moving along on coordinating with business and labour, the Covid-19 outbreak. “And so, it would make it a lot easier if the president were to participate. We have a number of Republicans suggesting that--the good news here is my colleague is still on the Intelligence Committee so she gets the intelligence briefings. I don’t anymore. But there’s a number of Republicans calling for that,” he said. “My message is I will work with you. I understand a lot of your reluctance because of the way the president operates, but I’ve been in contact with and will be in contact with more of them as we move along. And if it has to wait until January 20th to get--to actually become operational, that’s a shame but it may be that’s the only way to get it done,” he said. Biden was also asked about his thoughts on Trump’s tweet over the weekend where he first seemed to acknowledge that Biden had won the election. However, soon after Trump said he would not concede, and that he had won. “I interpret that as Trumping-ism, no change in his modus operandi. And I think the pressure will continue to build,” he said. The President-elect said that he is having a lot of meetings with world leaders on the telephone and he can get into negotiating with them about things that are going to be done. They are calling with some degree of enthusiasm everyone from a holy father to prime ministers across the globe. “So we are moving along knowing what the outcome will be and … but I find this more embarrassing for the country than debilitating for my ability to get started,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-absence-of-coordination-with-trump-there-is-risk-of-many-more-dying-joe-biden/story-heLKGzDIhym26FqHTSsoEK.html
17-11-2020||World||‘In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story,’ says Barack Obama||Former US President Barack Obama has said that modern day India can be counted as a success story in many respects, despite bitter feuds within political parties, various armed separatist movements, and corruption scandals. The 44th US president, in his latest book, says the transition to a more market-based economy in the 1990s unleashed the extraordinary entrepreneurial talents of Indians, leading to soaring growth rates, a thriving technology sector, and a steadily expanding middle class. In his book “A Promised Land”, Obama writes on his journey from the 2008 election campaign to the end of his first term with the daring Abbottabad (Pakistan) raid that killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. “A Promised Land” is the first of two planned volumes. The first part hit bookstores globally on Tuesday.Also Read: ‘A Promised Land’: First volume of Barack Obama’s memoir to hit stands on November 17 “In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story, having survived repeated changeovers in government, bitter feuds within political parties, various armed separatist movements, and all manner of corruption scandals,” Obama writes. As the chief architect of India’s economic transformation, (former) Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seemed like a fitting emblem of this progress: a member of the tiny, often persecuted Sikh religious minority who had risen to the highest office in the land, and a self-effacing technocrat who had won people’s trust not by appealing to their passions but by bringing about higher living standards and maintaining a well-earned reputation for not being corrupt, says Obama, who had visited India twice as president in 2010 and 2015. Referring to his November 2010 India visit, Obama says he and Manmohan Singh had developed a warm and productive relationship. “While he could be cautious in foreign policy, unwilling to get out too far ahead of an Indian bureaucracy that was historically suspicious of US intentions, our time together confirmed my initial impression of him as a man of uncommon wisdom and decency; and during my visit to the capital city of New Delhi, we reached agreements to strengthen US cooperation on counterterrorism, global health, nuclear security, and trade,” Obama writes. “What I couldn’t tell was whether Singh’s rise to power represented the future of India’s democracy or merely an aberration,” he said. Obama writes that Singh at the time was worried about India’s economy, cross border terrorism and the rise of anti-Muslim sentiments.Also Read: ‘How much does he know about this nation?’: Sanjay Raut in response to Obama’s memoir During a conversation without aides and note takers, Singh told him: “In uncertain times, Mr President, the call of religious and ethnic solidarity can be intoxicating. And it’s not so hard for politicians to exploit that, in India or anywhere else.” “I nodded, recalling the conversation I’d had with Václav Havel (Former President of Czechoslovakia) during my visit to Prague and his warning about the rising tide of illiberalism in Europe. If globalisation and a historic economic crisis were fueling these trends in relatively wealthy nations—if I was seeing it even in the United States with the Tea Party —how could India be immune?” he said. Across the country, millions continued to live in squalor, trapped in sunbaked villages or labyrinthine slums, even as the titans of Indian industry enjoyed lifestyles that the rajas and moguls of old would have envied, Obama writes. “Expressing hostility toward Pakistan was still the quickest route to national unity, with many Indians taking great pride in the knowledge that their country had developed a nuclear weapons program to match Pakistan’s, untroubled by the fact that a single miscalculation by either side could risk regional annihilation,” he says. Obama writes Manmohan Singh’s elevation as prime minister, sometimes heralded as a hallmark of the country’s progress in overcoming sectarian divides, was somewhat deceiving. He hadn’t originally become prime minister as a result of his own popularity. “In fact, he owed his position to Sonia Gandhi — the Italian-born widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and the head of the Congress Party, who’d declined to take the job herself after leading her party coalition to victory and had instead anointed Singh. More than one political observer believed that she’d chosen Singh precisely because as an elderly Sikh with no national political base, he posed no threat to her forty-year-old son, Rahul, whom she was grooming to take over the Congress Party,” he said.Also Read: Obama urges media to rebuild social trust; ‘the country is divided’ In his book, Obama, referring to his meeting with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi at the dinner table, said that the Congress president listened more than she spoke, careful to defer to Singh when policy matters came up, and often steered the conversation toward her son. “It became clear to me, though, that her power was attributable to a shrewd and forceful intelligence. As for Rahul, he seemed smart and earnest, his good looks resembling his mother’s. He offered up his thoughts on the future of progressive politics, occasionally pausing to probe me on the details of my 2008 campaign,” he wrote. “But there was a nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject,” Obama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-many-respects-modern-day-india-is-counted-as-a-success-story-says-barack-obama/story-lEzrN1PFSnesxSWEhzJ0ZJ.html
17-11-2020||World||Coronavirus curbs return across United States||Michigan and Washington state on Sunday imposed new restrictions on gatherings, including halting indoor restaurant service, to slow the spread of the coronavirus as total US infections crossed the 11 million mark.Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered a ban on in-person high school and college classes as well as indoor dining service for three weeks starting on Wednesday as increasingly cold weather drives people indoors where the virus can spread more easily.Washington state governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, announced a one-month ban on indoor services at restaurants and gyms, and a reduction of in-store retail capacity to 25%.The new restrictions come as daily new infections in recent days have more than doubled from single-day highs reported during the previous US peak in mid-July.

17-11-2020||World||Hurricane Iota nearing Nicaragua as catastrophic Category 5||Tremendously powerful Category 5 Hurricane Iota was just off Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast Monday evening and was likely to bring catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by a powerful Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.The US National Hurricane Center said the storm had maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph). It was centered about 35 miles (55 kilometers) east-southeast of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi, and moving westward at 9 mph (15 kph). Iota was hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds while the western edge began battering the Nicaraguan coast.Also Read: Hurricane Iota heads for already battered Central AmericaAuthorities warned that Iota would probably come ashore over areas where Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.That storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt on Monday in Bilwi’s El Muelle neighborhood, sitting tight against the sea.“The situation doesn’t look good at all,” Wriedt said. “We woke up without electricity, with rain and the surf is getting really high.”Wriedt, who works for a small-scale fishing organization called Piquinera, said that the roof of her house was blown off in Eta less than two weeks ago. “We repaired it as best we could, now I think the wind will take it again because they say (Iota) is even stronger,” Wriedt said, the sound of hammering echoing around her as neighbors boarded windows and reinforced roofs.During Eta the surf came up to just behind her house, where she lives with eight other members of her family. “Today I’m afraid again about losing my house and I’m frightened for all of us who live in this neighborhood.”Wriedt said some neighbors went to stay with relatives elsewhere, but most have stayed. “We’re almost all here,” she said. “Neither the army nor the government came to move us.”Cairo Jarquin, Nicaragua emergency response project manager for Catholic Relief Services, had just visited Bilwi and smaller coastal communities Friday.In Wawa Bar, Jarquin said he found “total destruction.” People had been working furiously to put roofs back over their families’ heads, but now Iota threatened to take what was left.“The little that remained standing could be razed,” Jarquin said. There were other communities farther inland that he was not even able to reach due to the condition of roads. He said he heard that Wawa bar was evacuated again Saturday.Also Read: ‘On steroids’: Hurricanes are becoming turbocharged and harder to predictEvacuations were being conducted from low-lying areas in Nicaragua and Honduras near their shared border through the weekend.Nicaraguan Vice President Rosario Murillo, who is also the first lady, said Monday the government had done everything necessary to protect lives, including the evacuation of thousands. She added that Taiwan had donated 800 tons of rice to help those affected by the storms.Limborth Bucardo, of the Miskito Indigenous ethnic group, said many people had moved to churches in Bilwi. He rode out Eta with his wife and two children at home, but this time decided to move in with relatives in a safer neighborhood.“We hadn’t finished repairing our houses and settling in when another hurricane comes,” Bucardo said. “The shelters in Bilwi are already full, packed with people from (surrounding) communities.”Iota is the record 30th named storm of this year’s extraordinarily busy Atlantic hurricane season. It’s also the ninth storm to rapidly intensify this season, a dangerous phenomenon that is happening increasingly more often. Such activity has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.Iota is stronger, based on central pressure, than 2005′s Hurricane Katrina and is the first storm with a Greek alphabet name to hit Category 5, Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said. It also sets the record for the latest Category 5 hurricane on record, beating the record set by the Nov. 8, 1932, Cuba Hurricane.Eta had hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, killing more than 130 people as torrential rains caused flash floods and mudslides in parts of Central America and Mexico. Then it meandered across Cuba, the Florida Keys and around the Gulf of Mexico before slogging ashore again near Cedar Key, Florida, and dashing across Florida and the Carolinas.Iota was forecast to drop 10 to 20 inches (250-500 millimeters) of rain in northern Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and southern Belize, with as much as 30 inches (750 millimeters) in isolated spots. Costa Rica and Panama could also experience heavy rain and possible flooding, the hurricane center said.The prospect of more rain was raising the anxiety of those still homeless after Eta.On Monday, Carmen Isabel Rodríguez Ortez, 48, was still living inside a government shelter with more than 250 people in La Lima, Honduras, just outside San Pedro Sula. Devastated by Eta’s destruction, she quickly broke into sobs as she contemplated the torrential rains of another storm.“We’re living a real nightmare,” Rodríguez said. The Chamelecon river flooded her Reformada neighborhood as Eta passed, submerging their homes. “Now they announce more rain and we don’t know what’s going to happen, because our homes are completely flooded.”Eta was this year’s 28th named storm, tying the 2005 record. Remnants of Theta, the 29th, dissipated Sunday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.Over the past couple of decades, meteorologists have been more worried about storms like Iota that power up much faster than normal. They created an official threshold for this rapid intensification -- a storm gaining 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in just 24 hours. Iota doubled it.Earlier this year, Hannah, Laura, Sally, Teddy, Gamma, Delta, Zeta and Iota all rapidly intensified. Laura and Delta tied or set records for rapid intensification.The official end of the hurricane season is Nov. 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-iota-nearing-nicaragua-as-catastrophic-category-5/story-XxNNelqna9BYTN2tRlymfO.html

Biden said he had told leaders the United States would approach trade by insisting that Washington would “invest in American workers and make them more competitive,” make sure that labor and environmental interests were represented in any new trade negotiations and stop “poking our finger in the eyes of our friends.”Asked why he would not comment on plans for trade agreements when he has said he would rejoin the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accords, Biden said: “You’re asking me about whether I’d join a specific proposal, the details of which are now only being negotiated among those nations. It would require a negotiation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allies-need-to-set-global-trade-rules-to-counter-china-s-influence-joe-biden/story-P7YJxmb529BbJABiKGGcxK.html

We are at the precipice and we need to take some action.”Also Read: ‘On my watch!’: Trump boasts about Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine efficacySome of the states that saw the sharpest percentage increases in infections last week, such as Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey and New York, were places that appeared to have had the virus under control over the summer. More than 69,000 people were hospitalized as of Nov. 15, according to data from The Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. About 10% of Covid-19 tests came back positive, the data showed. To put it another way, one out of every 315 Americans tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the past week.Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota all had positive test rates over 50%. The World Health Organization considers rates above 5% concerning because it suggests there are more cases in the community that have not yet been uncovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-logs-one-million-new-covid-19-cases-last-week-deaths-up-12/story-zROtwLXZDgBdjzpB6xIDqN.html

17-11-2020||World||Campaign underway in UK against rising rape cases in India||A newly-formed campaign group on Monday put up billboards in stations on the London Underground to raise awareness of rapes in India and put pressure on authorities to deal with the issue by putting in place a robust system to help victims.Called RapeFreeIndia UK, the group said its members are non-political and include women of Indian origin, including professionals working in the civil service, IT and medicine. It raised over £2000 from a crowd-sourced online platform for the campaign.The billboards campaign, it said, will run from November 16 to December 13 with support from campaign group White Ribbon UK, which works to end male violence against women.London-based Roohi Ghouse, a medic and member of the organisation, said: “Seeing the issue highlighted on international platforms may put pressure on India to tackle rape crimes, review strategies and put in place a robust system that helps victims get their cases processed quickly, beginning from the medical examination, all the way up to the judiciary, and provide protection to the families when under threat.”The billboards have been put up in Regent’s Park, Chalk Farm and Kennington stations.Leena, an IT professional and part of the campaign, said: “We are deeply disturbed by the increasing incidents of rape, and gruesome rape in India. We are not happy for India to be seen as an unsafe country for women or a rape capital. India has so much to offer and we do not want to end up with this title”.Over 150 people in UK and abroad contributed to the campaign with funds and support, including anti-rape campaigners such as Sohaila Abdulali and Tara Kaushal, according to Rekha Sharma, a civil servant, who said the campaign remains distinctly apolitical to ensure that the focus on women’s safety is not lost.“In 2019, with 3200+ cases ‘reported’ rape cases in India and with only 28% conviction rate, women’s safety in the country is far from ideal. We believe it should be the norm and not a privilege. We want India to be attain gender equality and mutual respect in a true sense”, IT professional Anita Rajan, another campaigner, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/campaign-underway-in-uk-against-rape-incidents-in-india/story-xcmFukGWr7VGadaNxL9TPI.html
