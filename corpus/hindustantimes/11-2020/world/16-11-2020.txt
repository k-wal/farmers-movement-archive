US pharmaceutical company Pfizer and German BioNtech announced last week that their candidate vaccine tested 90% effective. “This is a pivotal moment in the development of our Covid-19 vaccine candidate,” said Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, in a statement. “We look forward to the next milestones of submitting for an EUA (emergency use authorisation) in the US, and regulatory filings in countries around the world.”Bancel told The Washington Post the company planned to apply for EUA shortly before November 26, and that he hoped to make it available to those at high risk in the second half of December.It could not be immediately ascertained if and when Moderna would be able to make the vaccine available in India. Pfizer has said it is in talks to sell its vaccine in India.More than 1.3 million people have died from Covid-19 around the world and more than 54 million have been infected. The pandemic has begun surging again with experts warning of a grim winter. The US and India are the two worst-hit countries, with 11 million and 8 million infections and 246,000 and 130,000 fatalities respectively, according to the Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker.The US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is headed by leading epidemiologist Anthony Fauci and which co-developed the drug, said the “data suggests that the vaccine is safe and effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in adults… The findings are statistically significant, meaning they are likely not due to chance”.US President Donald Trump, who has been more focused in recent days on seeking to overturn his defeat in the election, welcomed Moderna’s announcement with a swipe at his critics. “Another vaccine just announced. This time by Moderna, 95% effective. For those great ‘historians’, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China plague, all took place on my watch!”Moderna received substantial funding from the US government as part of Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, a project launched to expedite the search for a Covid-19 vaccine. As mentioned, Fauci’s NIAID collaborated with it. Pfizer and BioNtech developed their vaccine candidate independently, without any government funding, though the Trump administration sought to claim credit for it as well.The Moderna vaccine candidate was being tested on 30,000 volunteers, half of whom received two doses of it and the rest were on placebo. Among the 95 people who tested positive for Covid-19 two weeks after the second dose, 90 were those who were in the placebo group, as were the 11 who developed severe symptoms.The 95 Covid-19 cases included 15 older adults (ages over 65) and 20 who identified themselves as belonging to diverse communities (including 12 Hispanic or Latinx, four Black or African-Americans, three Asian-Americans and one multiracial), Moderna said in the press announcement.Moderna added that it expected to apply for EUA with the US drug regulator FDA in the coming weeks, with an unspecified time-frame for other counties. A response was awaited to a request for plans for India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-nearly-95-effective/story-pGxbAKcScADu7GvQ4xWEBL.html
16-11-2020||World||Brazilian voters ignore Jair Bolsonaro’s city election endorsements||Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has suffered a setback as most of the dozens of candidates he backed for municipal elections failed to secure victories or spots in run-offs.In more than 5,500 cities, Brazilians voted for mayors and city councillors on Sunday. The wave of political renewal that two years ago catapulted Bolsonaro to the presidency appeared to ebb in the face of well-known candidates and traditional parties, which scored the most votes in the two most populous cities. Of the nearly 60 candidates whom the leader backed, only nine advanced, according to a tally by newspaper Estado de S.Paulo.Bolsonaro, who is currently not affiliated with any political party, had said he would not get involved in the election campaign, but in recent weeks he turned to social media to promote a dozen candidates for mayor as well as councillor candidates.Bruno Carazza, a professor of economic law at Brazil’s Ibmec business school, said Bolsonaro had not made a concerted effort to rally supporters in the municipal elections and had lost an opportunity to “prepare the ground for the 2022 elections.″The president deleted a social media post with a list of the candidates he had supported and sought to distance himself from their poor performances. Only two mayors backed by the president secured a spot in the second round.“My help to a few mayoral candidates was summed up by 4 live broadcasts on social media over a total of 3 hours,” he wrote.An adviser to the president, Filipe Martins, was more forthcoming with his disappointment, writing on Twitter that the opposition had scored significant advances.“Either we do the necessary self-criticism, or our errors will be paid for at an even higher price in the future,” Martins wrote.One of Bolsonaro’s biggest frustrations came in Sao Paulo, where his chosen candidate — the television presenter and federal lawmaker Celso Russomanno (Republicanos) — came in fourth place. The incumbent Mayor Bruno Covas (PSDB party) didn’t garner enough votes to avoid a runoff against opponent Guilherme Boulos (PSOL party), a Bolsonaro critic.In Rio de Janeiro, the former mayor Eduardo Paes (DEM party) tallied a wide lead over current Mayor Marcelo Crivella (Republicanos party) —one of two mayoral candidates who Bolsonaro supported. The two will also face one another in a runoff.“The vote wasn’t an evaluation of the presidential administration, but rather a political thermometer of the country,” said Mauricio Santoro, a political science professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. “The voter was more cautious, trending toward more experienced and moderate politicians than the anti-system election of 2018.”About 148 million people were eligible to vote across the country, and voting is compulsory for Brazilians between 18 and 70 years old.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-voters-ignore-jair-bolsonaro-s-city-election-endorsements/story-NWmq22W1ABTTNRtZQkuUkM.html
16-11-2020||World||Trial starts over foiled Paris train attack that inspired Clint Eastwood movie||A Moroccan man and three alleged accomplices went on trial in France Monday for an attempted terror attack on an Amsterdam-Paris train five years ago that was foiled by passengers whose heroic actions were turned into a Hollywood film.Director Clint Eastwood, 90, is on the witness list for the trial in Paris, scheduled to last until December 17. It is believed his 2018 film “The 15:17 to Paris” will serve as a reconstruction of the events of August 21, 2015.Asked by the judge whether he admitted to the facts detailed in the indictment where he is charged with seeking to carry out the attack, Ayoub El Khazzani, 31, replied: “Yes, to all of them.”Khazzani was tackled by passengers shortly after emerging bare-chested and heavily armed from a toilet on a Thalys high-speed train.There were some 150 passengers in the carriage with Khazzani, who had an AK47 slung over his back, and a bag of nearly 300 rounds of ammunition.One of them, Franco-American professor Mark Moogalian, grabbed Khazzani’s assault rifle as he emerged.The attacker took a pistol out of his belt, shot and wounded Moogalian, and reclaimed the AK47 only to be tackled afresh and disarmed by two US soldiers -- Spencer Stone and Alek Skarlatos -- who heard the commotion from a neighbouring carriage.The soldiers were aided by their friend Anthony Sadler, with whom they were backpacking through Europe.- ‘Mass attack’ avoided -Stone was slashed in the neck and on an eyebrow and almost had his thumb sliced off with a box-cutter wielded by Khazzani.“He had 270 rounds of ammunition on him, enough to kill 300 people,” according to Thibault de Montbrial, the lawyer for the three Americans.The lawyer argues there was no doubt his clients had prevented a “mass attack”.Khazzani, who joined the Islamic State group in Syria in May 2015, is charged with “attempted terrorist murder”. The 31-year-old appeared in court dressed in a blue denim shirt, his black hair tied back. He detailed his childhood in Morocco and how the family had moved to Spain, where he was arrested several times and turned to religion.He was joined in the dock by three men facing charges for aiding and abetting the crime: Bilal Chatra, Redouane Sebbar and Mohamed Bakkali.Also present in court to face his attacker was Moogalian, accompanied by his wife.- Link to Paris attacks -The train assault happened in the same year as the December 15 massacre of staff at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine, the killing of a policewoman, and a deadly hostage siege at a Jewish supermarket -- three days of violence that left 17 dead.In November the same year, jihadists armed with assault rifles and explosives struck simultaneously outside the national stadium, Paris cafés and the Bataclan concert hall, killing 130 people and wounding more than 350 in France’s deadliest peace-time attack.Co-accused Chatra is charged with having acted as an advance scout for Khazzani to get into Europe via the migrant trail from Syria. The other two are accused of having helped Khazzani and Belgian Abdelhamid Abaaoud -- believed to have been one of the masterminds behind the Thalys and November 13 attacks -- to enter Europe and set up a jihadist cell.Police killed Abaaoud after he shot indiscriminately at packed café terraces in Paris on the night of the coordinated attacks, for which Bakkali is also accused of having acted as logistics coordinator.The former American soldiers, who along with Moogalian played themselves in Eastwood’s film, would attend the trial on Thursday and Friday this week, days set aside for witness testimony from train passengers, the court heard.The trial comes at a time of heightened security alert in France following three attacks blamed on jihadists in a month -- a knife attack outside Charlie Hebdo’s former offices, the beheading of a history teacher, and a deadly stabbing spree at a church in Nice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trial-starts-over-foiled-paris-train-attack-that-inspired-clint-eastwood-movie/story-TzWkPHWZ9i2t8X6vIFZFAM.html
16-11-2020||World||President Donald Trump drops key claim in Pennsylvania lawsuit over US election result||US President Donald Trump’s campaign has dropped a significant portion of its lawsuit in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state that gave the White House 2020 race to Joe Biden, once again reflecting the weak legal case he has made to overturn the outcome of the election.The campaign had in an earlier lawsuit sought to block the state from certifying its election result and asked for setting aside 682,479 ballots that it alleged had been counted “illegally, in secret” as its poll watchers were not allowed to observe the counting.An amended lawsuit filed on Sunday in a federal court still aimed at blocking the certification, but dropped the demand for setting aside those nearly 700,000 ballots.President Trump and the campaign pushed back aggressively in tweets and statements on Monday. “We are still arguing that 682,479 ballots were counted illegally, in secret,” said Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director. “Our poll watchers were denied meaningful access to watch the vote counting and we still incorporate that claim in our complaint.”Rudy Giuliani, personal attorney to the president who is not the point person for the legal challenges, said, “It’s routine for attorneys to file amended complaints to tighten the claims. We simplified the suit, so it is more focused and narrowed. This is part of the process.”The case is up for hearing on Tuesday.The Trump campaign and the president’s allies in the Republican Party have filed multiple lawsuits - 18, according to one count - seeking to challenge the outcome in key states that were won by Biden: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia and Nevada.But they mostly haven’t had real impact. And, in fact, judges dealing with them have responded with mounting frustration. “At what point does this get ridiculous?” Andrew Gordon, a judge in Nevada, had asked Republican lawyers who challenged the counting saying their observers were not able to hear everything ballot counters were saying.Trump’s legal challenges faced a severe setback last week when a law firm representing him in a lawsuit in Pennsylvania withdrew saying it did not represent the campaign any longer.Trump’s allegations of fraud have been debunked by election security officials of his own administration who said last week that the November 3 voting and the counting of votes has been the “most secure in American history”.Trump has continued to press his case undeterred. Though he acknowledged on Sunday that Biden has “won” the election, he has still not conceded it.On Monday, Trump tweeted, saying, “I won the election.” The post was summarily flagged by Twitter and a warning was placed under it.President-elect Biden has sought to move on seemingly undistracted by Trump’s efforts to challenge the election outcome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-donald-trump-drops-key-claim-in-pennsylvania-lawsuit-over-us-election-result/story-bZwiH08FMCZVTLG3tLLJSI.html

16-11-2020||World||65 coronavirus cases, with 1 cluster, in WHO Geneva staff||The World Health Organization has recorded 65 cases of the coronavirus among staff based at its headquarters, including at least one cluster of infections, an internal email obtained by The Associated Press shows, despite the agency’s past assertions that there has been no transmission at the Geneva site.The revelation comes amid a surge of cases in Europe, host country Switzerland, and the city of Geneva, in particular, and the email said about half of the infections were in people who had been working from home. But 32 were in staff who had been working on premises at the headquarters building, indicating that the health agency’s strict hygiene, screening and other prevention measures were not sufficient to spare it from the pandemic.Farah Dakhlallah, a WHO spokeswoman, confirmed the accuracy of the information about the case count in an email to the AP and that officials were still investigating.“We have not yet established whether transmission occurred on campus, but are looking into the matter,” Dakhlallah said.Raul Thomas, who heads business operations at WHO, emailed staff on Friday noting that five people — four on the same team and one who had contact with them— had tested positive for Covid-19. While the email did not use the term “cluster,” one is generally defined as two or more cases in the same area, and the five cases indicate basic infection control and social distancing procedures were likely being broken.A previous email he sent on October 16 indicated that no clusters had been found at the site.“As per standard protocols, these colleagues are receiving the necessary medical attention and are recovering at home,” the email Friday said. “These last five cases bring the total reported number of affected members of the Geneva based workforce to 65 since the beginning of the pandemic.”The email did not specify who was infected, but a WHO staffer with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to the press said the cluster included a member of the WHO director-general’s leadership team who is also an infection control specialist.Thomas’ email was sent after other WHO officials raised concerns that people who had been in contact with the cluster were still working in the Geneva building and potentially exposing others to Covid-19, the staffer said.The senior manager reportedly held several in-person meetings at WHO in early November before testing positive last week. The person, contacted by the AP, referred all comments to the WHO media office.WHO has faced repeated criticism of its handling of the pandemic. US President Donald Trump accused the U.N. agency of “colluding” with China to hide the extent of the initial outbreak. In June, the AP found WHO publicly lauded China for its speed and transparency, even though private meetings showed WHO officials frustrated that the country sat on releasing critical outbreak information.According to Thomas’ email, 49 of the overall cases had occurred in the last eight weeks, “thus very much in line with the situation being reported in Geneva and the surrounding areas.” He added that “a higher number of cases among those who telework might have gone unreported.”Enhanced measures to “reduce our risk profile” were being considered, the email said.“Finally, members of the workforce are reminded that physical meetings, including gatherings in common areas or in the cafeteria, are strongly discouraged and should only take place where absolutely necessary,” it added.Elsewhere in Geneva, restaurants are among many public venues that have been closed to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Last month, Thomas told WHO staffers the agency was restricting access to its Geneva headquarters to critical staffers, including senior directors, their assistants and management officers. “All members for the workforce are reminded to always keep proper hand hygiene, respect physical distancing standards (at least one meter) and wear masks, when distancing is not possible,” he wrote.In normal times, an estimated 2,400 people regularly work at WHO’s seven-story headquarters overlooking Geneva. As the pandemic has swelled in the area, staffers have been encouraged to work from home when possible. Non-staff visitors have been required to wear masks, and access to the building has been curtailed.And ahead of WHO’s weeklong meeting of its member states last week — which was mostly virtual — staffers were told in an internal email to take extra precautions, including mask-wearing in public places.On Monday, from a vast meeting room at the headquarters, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and other officials were participating in a session of the agency’s latest executive board meeting, which was largely conducted by video conference. He was returning from a two-week self-quarantine at home after coming into contact with a person who tested positive. Because Tedros did not show any symptoms himself, he was not tested for Covid-19 but stayed at home out of an abundance of caution.On Nov. 2, WHO’s technical lead for the Covid-19 response, Maria Van Kerkhove, told reporters there had been no transmission or clusters at headquarters, before adding: “But it is something that we’re monitoring every day.”The WHO press office did not respond to two emails from the AP — on Nov. 2 and Nov. 10 — asking how many staffers based at WHO headquarters had tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/65-coronavirus-cases-with-1-cluster-in-who-geneva-staff/story-Fi4mfdra4ChqW2F3omaiWJ.html

Polling on one seat was postponed after the death of one of the contestants.Unofficial results compiled by the various media outlets showed that PTI won at least 8 seats and was ahead in one, but it was still well short of majority to form the government. However, it was in a position to form the government as 6-7 independent candidates also won.Geo TV reported that PTI won 8 seats, independent candidates 7, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) 3, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) 2, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JIU-F) and Majlis Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) 1 seat each.The official results were still not known as election authorities may take some time to announce the final outcome.Both the Opposition parties PPP and PML-N have alleged poll rigging by the ruling PTI.Commenting on the unofficial results, PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari alleged that the “election was stolen”.“Our candidates were asked to leave PPP and join PTI,” Bilawal said while addressing a protest rally at Gilgit’s DC Chowk against the alleged “rigging” in the elections.“The people of this region will not allow you to steal their votes,” he said.PML-N also rejected the election results, saying the party would protest against them.“The people are being robbed of their rights,” PML-N’s secretary-general Ahsan Iqbal said, adding that independent candidates won against PTI candidates. “ “The success of the independent candidates means that the people have rejected the PTI,” he added.As many as 330 candidates, including four women contested the election.Out of 1,141 polling stations, 577 have been declared sensitive and 297 highly sensitive. Over 15,000 security personnel from Gilgit-Baltistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan were deployed at the polling stations.It is the third election for the current legislative assembly after political reform introduced in 2010.Traditionally, the party ruling in Islamabad have won the Gilgit-Baltistan polls. The first election was won by PPP when it got 15 seats, followed by the PML-N, the then ruling party, in 2015 when it won 16 seats.The voters kept the tradition but with a difference as PTI failed to get an outright majority. PML-N emerged as the biggest loser as it ruled from 2015-2020 and was popular in the region.PPP Secretary General Nayyar Bukhari on Sunday demanded disqualification of ruling PTI candidates from the election.It is expected that some changes in the status of the region would be announced after the new government was formed in the region.In a ruling earlier this year, the Pakistan Supreme Court allowed Islamabad to amend a 2018 administrative order to conduct general elections in the region. The Gilgit-Baltistan Order of 2018 provided for administrative changes, including authorising the prime minister of Pakistan to legislate on an array of subjects.Following the verdict, India issued a demarche to a senior Pakistani diplomat in New Delhi and lodged a strong protest over the apex court ruling.India also clearly conveyed to Pakistan that the entire Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of the country.The polls in Gilgit-Baltistan were to be held on August 18, but Pakistan’s election commission on July 11 postponed them due to the coronavirus pandemic.The five-year term of the previous assembly had ended on June 24, bringing an end to the five-year rule of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).

16-11-2020||World||‘A Promised Land’: First volume of Barack Obama’s memoir to hit stands on November 17||The first volume of former US president Barack Obama’s memoir, which has created a buzz over his candid remarks on Indian politicians, is coming out on November 17. The book, titled ‘A Promised Land’, mentions former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and party president Sonia Gandhi. While the memoir is currently not available in stores, the New York Times provided a glimpse of the content in its book review. Obama says Rahul Gandhi has “a nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject,” according to The NYT review.Also Read | Obama urges media to rebuild social trust; ‘the country is divided’Former PM Manmohan Singh also finds mention in Obama’s memoir as he recalls Singh as “having a kind of impassive integrity.” The book has been able to draw India’s attention due to the remarks made by Obama on the country’s political leaders. On Sunday, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said that he has got hold of an advance copy of ‘A Promised Land’, in which the former US President has praised Singh, describing him as “wise, thoughtful, and scrupulously honest”.In a series of tweets, the 64-year-old parliamentarian said that Obama has called Singh as a “man of uncommon wisdom and decency” with whom he enjoyed “a warm and productive relationship”. Tharoor added that the memoir offers a “foretaste of what the second volume is likely to tell us about India” in a post-Manmohan Singh era. The 768-page memoir, the first of a two-part memoir, will hit the stands tomorrow, after which more details regarding Obama’s view on Indian leaders are expected to emerge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-promised-land-first-volume-of-barack-obama-s-memoir-to-hit-stands-on-november-17/story-lo8GUt4lkoqyjFIkfDo1MJ.html

Calling Covid-19 vaccine development as “great discoveries”, the US President said the “great historians” should remember that it happened on his watch. “Another Vaccine just announced. This time by Moderna, 95% effective. For those great ‘historians’, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!” Trump tweeted.Earlier today, the US biotech firm said the trial has met the statistical criteria, adding that the preliminary analysis suggests a broadly consistent safety across all evaluated subgroups. Moderna confirmed that it intends to submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks.Also Read | Moderna says its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19After the announcement, President-elect Joe Biden said that the news regarding the second vaccine is further reason to feel hopeful, but warned that the availability is still months away.

16-11-2020||World||Questions over Al-Qaeda future after leaders’ reported deaths||The reported deaths of Al-Qaeda’s top two leaders in recent months have raised questions about the future strategy and strength of the terror network, already a shadow of the global force it was two decades ago.The New York Times reported last week that Al-Qaeda’s deputy leader Abdullah Ahmad Abdullah, who went by the nom-de-guerre Abu Muhammad al-Masri, was secretly killed in Tehran in August by two Israeli operatives at Washington’s behest.Meanwhile, prominent experts on Al-Qaeda have quoted sources as saying that Ayman al-Zawahiri, who succeeded Osama Bin Laden as the chief of the group behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, is also dead.Iran has strongly denied the report over the killing of Abdullah, while Al-Qaeda has not issued any confirmation of the purported death of al-Zawahiri through its usual media channels.Yet the reports have come as questions grow over Al-Qaeda’s future intentions, with the network radically different from the franchise that spread fear around the world under the leadership of the charismatic Bin Laden.- ‘Very typical of AQ’ -The killing of the Saudi in a US operation in Pakistan in 2011 left the group in the hands of al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian veteran of jihad and the key Al-Qaeda ideologue, but without Bin Laden’s ability to rally radicals around the world.Hassan Hassan, director of the US-based Center for Global Policy (CGP), said at the weekend that al-Zawahiri had died a month ago of natural causes.And Rita Katz, director of the jihadist media monitor SITE, said unconfirmed reports were circulating that al-Zawahiri had died.“It is very typical of AQ to not publish news about the death of its leaders in a timely manner,” she said. Nonetheless, this is not the first time there have been reports of al-Zawahiri’s death, only for him to re-emerge on several occasions.“Intelligence agencies believe he is very sick,” said Barak Mendelsohn, associate professor at Haverford College and author of several books on Al-Qaeda and jihadism.“Ultimately, if it did not happen now, it will happen soon,” he told AFP.- ‘Board of advisors’ -If either or both men are dead, the group they have left behind can in no way be compared to the network which planned and carried out the September 11 attacks, analysts say.Its ideology has spawned several franchises across the world that bear its name, including in Africa’s Sahel region, in Pakistan as well as in Somalia, Egypt and Yemen.But it does not control their actions or the alliances that they may forge on a local level.Mendelsohn said he expected Al-Qaeda’s leadership to act more along the lines of a “board of advisors” in the future.“People will listen to AQ central leadership if they want to, not because they think they are bound to obey its view,” he said.No longer the supreme jihadist group, Al-Qaeda has seen other outfits grow and has sometimes clashed with them on the ground.It has been overshadowed by the Islamic State (IS) group which sought to carve out a caliphate in Iraq and Syria and coordinated attacks in Europe.- Who’s next? -The key challenge of a new leader would be to retain the group’s potency within this context.Many analysts point to one key candidate -- Saif al-Adel, a former lieutenant-colonel in the Egyptian armed forces who joined the Egyptian jihadist movement in the 1980s.He was arrested and then released, ending up in Afghanistan which was the base for Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, and joining Al-Qaeda.According to the US-based Counter Extremism Project (CEP) think tank, he was arrested in Iran in 2003 and freed in 2015 in a prisoner exchange. He was still believed to be in Iran in 2018 as one of al-Zawahiri’s key deputies.“Adel played a crucial role in building Al-Qaeda’s operational capabilities and quickly ascended the hierarchy,” the CEP said.Mendelsohn said Adel was a “big name” in the movement and “should be the next in line”.But he stressed that Adel, along with Abdullah, spent several years hiding in Iran, thus possibly staying away from Al-Qaeda’s new generation of leaders.“I’m not sure how strong his position is within Al-Qaeda, especially now that the old generation, basically all the old guard, is dead.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/questions-over-al-qaeda-future-after-leaders-reported-deaths/story-DZBWbfOWvufzLHVSJvae6L.html
16-11-2020||World||Moderna, Pfizer shots look strong. Here’s how they stack up||The first two Covid-19 vaccines out of the gate have now delivered positive news in the quest to end the pandemic. The encouraging late-stage trial results from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. set a high bar for rivals such as AstraZeneca Plc that are expected to follow soon with their own pivotal reports.The data will likely increase confidence that more vaccines will work and that the world may soon find a way to get the coronavirus under control. Here’s what we know about the two shots.How do the results compare?Moderna said Monday its vaccine was 94.5% effective in a preliminary analysis. That compares favorably with the lofty level achieved a week earlier by Pfizer and its partner, BioNTech SE. The shot created by the US and German companies was found to be more than 90% effective. Moderna data showed that side effects were generally short-lived and there were no significant safety concerns, while no serious Covid cases developed among trial participants who got the vaccine. US regulators earlier this year released guidance that said any shot should be at least 50% effective.What do the two vaccines have in common?Both shots rely on a technology called messenger RNA that has never been used before to develop an approved vaccine. The approach is designed to transform the body’s own cells into vaccine-making factories. The vaccines instruct cells to make copies of the spike protein of the coronavirus, stimulating the creation of protective antibodies.How are they different?Moderna received $955 million from the US Operation Warp Speed program. Pfizer has said it didn’t receive any federal funding to develop its vaccine, though BioNTech got as much as 375 million euros ($444 million) in German government assistance. Still, Pfizer has struck a supply agreement with the U.S. worth nearly $2 billion. The U.S. has agreed to pay up to $1.53 billion to purchase supply of the Moderna shot.What are the storage and distribution challenges?After vaccines are approved, the effort to immunize hundreds of millions of people will need to overcome a series of other hurdles. Storage and distribution for some of the products is complex. Pfizer’s vaccine must be stored ultra-cold until a few days before it is used, but can be kept at refrigerator temperatures for as much as five days. Moderna, meanwhile, pointed to new data showing its vaccine is stable at refrigerator temperatures for 30 days, much longer than a previously estimated seven days. It can be kept in freezers over the longer term and doesn’t need the special facilities required for the Pfizer vaccine.Where Will Vaccines Go First?Global demand for vaccines initially is expected to far exceed supplies despite significant efforts to ramp up production ahead of time. Moderna has already reached agreements to supply 100 million doses to the US and 80 million to the European Union, among others. The UK said Monday that it’s negotiating with the company but any doses wouldn’t become available in the country until next spring, at the earliest. Pfizer and BioNTech have their own deals for hundreds of millions of shots.When could they be ready to deploy?The results are preliminary, but both Moderna and Pfizer are expected to seek emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration if further review demonstrates their vaccines are safe. Moderna said it could seek clearance from regulators in the coming weeks. Pfizer expects to get two months of safety follow-up data in the third week in November. If all goes well, Pfizer could apply for an authorization in the U.S. this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-pfizer-shots-look-strong-here-s-how-they-stack-up/story-vpLQOdxMIgmdgTkgYmjhgN.html
16-11-2020||World||Covid-19: How does Moderna’s vaccine candidate compare to Pfizer’s?||The global Covid-19 vaccine race received a major boost as the US biotech firm Moderna Inc. revealed impressive early trial results, days after similar results released by Pfizer. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), appointed by NIH for the Phase 3 trials, reportedly informed the company that the trial has met the statistical criteria, with a vaccine efficacy of 94.5 per cent.“Preliminary analysis suggests a broadly consistent safety and efficacy profile across all evaluated subgroups,” the biotech firm said in a statement.Moderna said that it intends to submit for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the coming weeks. The company added that it also plans to submit applications for authorizations to global regulatory agencies. It uses the same messenger RNA technology as the Pfizer vaccine candidate.Also Read | Moderna says its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19According to the preliminary data, Moderna’s vaccine has shown a slightly better efficacy rate as compared to the vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech SE, which was found to be more than 90 per cent effective in preventing COVID-19 in participants. However, the final numbers could change since the trials are still underway. Moderna’s vaccine, mRNA-1273, appears to be easier to store as it is expected to remain stable at standard refrigerated conditions of 2°C to 8°C for up to 30 days within the 6-month shelf life. It allows for storage at most pharmacies, hospitals, or physicians’ offices. The vaccine can be kept at room temperature conditions for up to 12 hours once it is removed from the refrigerator for administration. On the other hand, Pfizer’s vaccine candidate needs ultra-cold storage at around minus 75°C and can be kept in the fridge for five days.“The ability to store our vaccine for up to 6 months at -20° C including up to 30 days at normal refrigerator conditions after thawing is an important development and would enable simpler distribution and more flexibility to facilitate wider-scale vaccination in the United States and other parts of the world,” Juan Andres, Moderna CTO and Quality Officer, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-how-does-moderna-s-vaccine-candidate-compare-to-pfizer-s/story-1kWqY2g0PYeEeH8YpXiqEN.html
16-11-2020||World||WHO registers one-day record in new Covid-19 cases||The World Health Organization’s coronavirus dashboard on Sunday showed a record daily number of new Covid-19 cases over the weekend.The WHO’s figures for Saturday showed that 660,905 coronavirus cases were reported to the UN health agency, setting a new high watermark.That number, and the 645,410 registered on Friday, surpassed the previous daily record high of 614,013 recorded on November 7. Within Saturday’s new case numbers, the WHO’s Americas region registered a one-day record high of 269,225 new confirmed cases.Within each week, the pattern of cases being reported to the WHO tends to peak towards Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and dip around Tuesday and Wednesday.According to the WHO’s figures, there have been more than 53.7 million confirmed cases of the disease in total since the start of the pandemic, while over 1.3 million people have lost their lives. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned Friday that there was “a long way to go” in getting the virus under control globally.The 9,928 deaths reported to the WHO on Thursday, 9,567 on Friday and 9,924 on Saturday marked the first time that more than 9,500 deaths have been registered on three consecutive days.Thursday’s toll was the highest since the 10,012 registered on August 15, and the third-highest one-day toll in the entire pandemic -- though those previous higher figures were seemingly due to unusual reporting spikes.“No country can say it was well-enough prepared for Covid-19, or that it has no lessons to learn,” Tedros said Friday as he closed the WHO’s annual assembly, at which member states approved a resolution on strengthening preparedness for health emergencies.As he welcomed the rapid progress towards a safe and effective vaccine, Tedros nonetheless warned that “we have a long way to go”, and insisted that the virus could be contained even without a vaccine breakthrough.“The world cannot put all its eggs in one basket and neglect the many other tools at our disposal that... are effective for bringing this virus under control,” he said.“The virus itself has not changed significantly, and nor have the measures needed to stop it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-registers-one-day-record-in-new-covid-19-cases/story-dcRsyp4fbR1NKB86fA782K.html
16-11-2020||World||Playing video games is good for well-being, shows Oxford research||Many have mixed views about video games and time spent playing them, but new research released by the University of Oxford on Monday says that the time spent playing such games is positively associated with well-being.The Covid-19 pandemic has seen more people hunkered down in homes playing video games and connecting with others through social media. Described as a first-of-its-kind study, researchers used industry data on actual play time for popular video games.The study concluded that the actual amount of time spent playing was a small but significant positive factor in people’s well-being; and that a player’s subjective experiences during play might be a bigger factor for well-being than mere play time.Players experiencing genuine enjoyment from the games experience more positive well-being, it said, adding that the study’s findings align with past research suggesting people whose psychological needs were not being met in the “real world” might report negative well-being from play.The study used data on actual play time for popular video games Plants vs Zombies: Battle for Neighborville and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and suggests that experiences of competence and social connection with others through play may contribute to people’s well-being.Andrew Przybylski, director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute, and lead author of the study, said, “Previous research has relied mainly on self-report surveys to study the relationship between play and well-being. Without objective data from games companies, those proposing advice to parents or policymakers have done so without the benefit of a robust evidence base.“Our findings show video games aren’t necessarily bad for your health; there are other psychological factors which have a significant effect on a persons’ well-being. In fact, play can be an activity that relates positively to people’s mental health - and regulating video games could withhold those benefits from players.”The researchers worked with Electronic Arts and Nintendo of America to combine academic and industry expertise.“Through access to data on peoples’ playing time, for the first time we’ve been able to investigate the relation between actual game play behaviour and subjective well-being, enabling us to deliver a template for crafting high-quality evidence to support health policymakers,” Przybylski added.The study explored the association between objective game time and well-being, examining the link between directly measured behaviour and subjective mental health. It also explored the roles of player experiences, specifically how feelings of autonomy, relatedness, competence, enjoyment and feeling pressured to play related to well-being.More than 3,270 players were asked to complete a survey designed by the researchers to measure well-being, self-reported play, and motivational experiences during play. The survey findings were combined with objective behavioural data for the survey participants, collected by the video game companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/playing-video-games-is-good-for-well-being-shows-oxford-research/story-FIHxOPZZ5KGK0noTcUzwDI.html
16-11-2020||World||Vaccine will not be enough to stop coronavirus pandemic: WHO chief||The head of the World Health Organization said Monday that a vaccine would not by itself stop the coronavirus pandemic.The pandemic is raging months after it broke out, with infections soaring past 54 million and claiming more than 1.3 million lives.“A vaccine will complement the other tools we have, not replace them,” director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “A vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic.”The WHO’s figures for Saturday showed that 660,905 coronavirus cases were reported to the UN health agency, setting a new high water mark.That number, and the 645,410 registered on Friday, surpassed the previous daily record high of 614,013 recorded on November 7.Tedros said that supplies of the vaccine would initially be restricted, with “health workers, older people and other at-risk populations (to) be prioritised. That will hopefully reduce the number of deaths and enable the health systems to cope.”But he warned: “That will still leave the virus with a lot of room to move. Surveillance will need to continue, people will still need to be tested, isolated and cared for, contacts will still need to be traced... and individuals will still need to be cared for.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-will-not-be-enough-to-stop-coronavirus-pandemic-who-chief/story-t2iguhXshONFOg8Yt4kYnL.html
16-11-2020||World||RCEP deal that India didn’t join stands signed now. What’s next?||The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, was signed virtually on Sunday during the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).The signing of the pact was an unusual ceremony since all the member countries were connected by video.The trade ministers of each country took turns to sign separate copies of the pact and later held it up for the cameras, accompanied by their respective head of the state. 14 countries under the tutelage of China have formally agreed to form the world’s largest free trade bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity. After 8 long years of negotiations, the deal was finally sealed as leaders world over are keen to nudge their pandemic-hit economies back on track.Why did India not take part?India was part of the negotiations up until last year but withdrew from talks after severe domestic protests. The Indian pharmaceutical industry was all in favour of the RCEP because they wanted to import generic drugs to China, but textile, agriculture, and dairy sectors were worried about cheap imports flooding the domestic market. The dairy sector in particular was worried about products from New Zealand and Australia inundating the domestic market. China also rebuffed India’s demands for a more ambitious pact that would have gone further in tying together the region’s economies and would have included trade in services as well as trade in goods. India already faces a mammoth trade deficit with China, and sought power to increase tariffs if imports surged. It also wanted to be able to reduce tariffs for low-end, labour-intensive industrial goods, all points which China refused to include in the pact. “As far as India is concerned, we did not join R.C.E.P. as it does not address the outstanding issues and concerns of India,” Riva Ganguly Das, the secretary for Eastern relations at India’s Ministry of External Affairs, said at a news briefing on Thursday.What changes after the pact comes into force?The most crucial aspect of the pact, for now, is that it opens up trade liaisons between Japan and South Korea. Earlier, Japan due to its controversial role in the wartime occupation of the Korean peninsula was not able to establish friendly relations with South Korea. Last year, at the face of an escalating diplomatic dispute, removed South Korea from its ‘white list’ of trusted trade partners, a move South Korea criticized as a violation of the “spirit” of RCEP. Now, under a comprehensive multilateral trade pact, the two countries are expected to develop better trade relations which they were unable to foster bilaterally.The RCEP also has a rules of origin clause, which will set common standards for how much of a product must be produced within a particular region for the final it to qualify as duty-free. These rules could make it simpler for companies to set up supply chains across several countries. It does not cover environmental protection laws, intellectual property, and labour protection laws, all three laws have been a particular contention for China from time to time with the United States and Europe. It does not put restrictions on state-subsidy of business either, something which the Trans-Pacific Partnership(TPP) brought about by the Obama administration to counter China’s influence in Asia, explicitly dealt with. Experts opine that RCEP is the formalisation of bilateral trade agreements that already existed within different countries into a uniform multilateral trade deal, it does not attempt to remake. China has been taking the lead on RCEP for 8 years now since the Obama administration made plans for a TPP excluding China. When Donald Trump took office he withdrew US from the TPP, choosing to put “America First”, but since last year even Trump has been trying to counter China’s influence, with Joe Biden giving no indication of easing up on China the Communist Parties anxieties are well placed. With the UK’s criticism of its activities in Hong Kong, European Union coming down on China’s Ughyur repression, and America banning Chinese government linked technology companies China is doing its best to hold fort against the global storm that is coming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rcep-deal-that-india-didn-t-join-stands-signed-now-what-s-next/story-fl7bwVJxnVvVXLuTNsH12O.html
16-11-2020||World||After congratulating Joe Biden, France’s Macron sees Donald Trump’s envoy||French President Emmanuel Macron has met Monday with US President Donald Trump’s top diplomat behind closed doors in a potentially uncomfortable encounter only nine days after having congratulated President-elect Joe Biden on his election victory.Macron’s office said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo first met with French Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian at the Elysee presidential palace, then met with Macron himself.Neither side said much in advance about Pompeo’s low-profile visit to Paris, the starting point of a seven-country tour of Europe and the Middle East.The purposes of Pompeo’s three-day visit to Paris in the midst of the pandemic appeared unclear. Macron’s office described Pompeo’s planned stop Monday at the presidential Elysee Palace as a “courtesy” visit.No press conference was scheduled, seemingly ruling out the likelihood of journalists getting to ask Pompeo or Macron about their conflicting visions of the US election outcome.Officials in Pompeo’s team said French authorities told them that no press access was possible due to concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic. Paris is under a partial lockdown aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.Pompeo has not accepted Trump’s election defeat. Macron has spoken by phone last week with Biden to congratulate him.Pompeo’s trip is aimed at shoring up the priorities of Trump’s outgoing administration.In an arrival tweet Saturday in France, he laid out the standard diplomatic groundwork for his Paris talks, noting that France is the “oldest friend and Ally” of the United States. “The strong relationship between our countries cannot be overestimated,” he tweeted.From Paris, Pompeo was expected to travel to Turkey.No meeting with Turkish officials were scheduled during the brief visit to Istanbul, a senior State Department official who was not authorized to speak publicly about Pompeo’s agenda said last week.The stop in Turkey will focus on promoting religious freedom and fighting religious persecution, which is a key priority for the U.S. administration, the official said.Pompeo will discuss religious issues with the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew I, considered the “first among equals” in the Orthodox world, and with the apostolic nuncio to Turkey, Archbishop Paul Russell.The trip will also include visits to Israeli settlements in the West Bank that have been avoided by previous secretaries of state.Before the scheduled meetings with Macron and his foreign minister, Pompeo laid a bouquet of red, white and blue flowers at a memorial to victims of terrorism at a Paris landmark, the Hotel des Invalides.The ceremony lasted about a minute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-congratulating-joe-biden-france-s-macron-sees-donald-trump-s-envoy/story-jVybQLmeifwEG0R8Qrp6dJ.html
16-11-2020||World||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson self-isolates after MP he met tests positive for Covid-19||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday he is “bursting with antibodies” after going into self-isolation for coming in contact with a Conservative lawmaker last week who later tested positive for Covid-19.Later it the day, it was learnt that four more Conservative MPs were self-isolating after having PM Johnson: South Ribble MP Katherine Fletcher, Warrington South MP Andy Carter, Great Grimsby MP Lia Nici and Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith.The developments came as UK health officials announced two new “mega-labs” with 600,000 more daily coronavirus testing capacity and faster results.New daily Covid-19 cases in the UK continued to rise, with another five-fold increase compared to the previous peaks in April and May. As of Sunday evening, 24,962 new cases were recorded, besides 168 deaths and 1,922 patients admitted to hospitals in the last 24 hours.Johnson, who had a bout of Covid-19 in March-April, went into self-isolation for 14 days after being informed that MP Lee Anderson whom he met had tested positive for the virus. The prime minister’s spokesman said he did not have any symptoms of the disease and will continue to work.Johnson said in a video message on Monday, “It doesn’t matter that we were all doing social distancing, it doesn’t matter that I’m fit as a butcher’s dog, feel great - so many people do in my circumstances.“And actually it doesn’t matter that I’ve had the disease and I’m bursting with antibodies. We’ve got to interrupt the spread of the disease, and one of the ways we can do that now is by self-isolating for 14 days when contacted by test and trace.”British health officials said two new “very high throughput” laboratories will open in early 2021 in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, and in Scotland, adding capacity to test for Covid-19 and also in future for other illnesses, including cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. They will use cutting-edge technology, including automation, robotics and consumables.The UK’s health secretary Matt Hancock said, “The radical expansion of testing has been one of the successes of this pandemic… We didn’t go into this crisis with a significant diagnostics industry, but we have built one, and these two mega-labs are another step forward.”Since the start of the pandemic, testing capacity in the UK has grown from 100,000 tests per day at the end of April to over 500,000 tests per day at the end of October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-prime-minister-boris-johnson-self-isolates-after-mp-he-met-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-pC9MJ00QVbiR6n7sNVb99N.html
16-11-2020||World||Islamabad under partial seige over anti-France protest by extremists||Hundreds of protestors of an extremist religious group on Monday laid partial siege to the national capital to denounce the publication of blasphemous cartoons in a French magazine and force the government to expel the French ambassador.Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) of controversial cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi organised the protest march on the Murree Road of the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Sunday.Riot police had to resort to teargas shelling against the stone-pelting TLP protesters who successfully reached the Faizabad interchange connecting Rawalpindi and Islamabad, where they launched their sit-in.Though Rizvi did not join them at the sit-in but his representatives were leading the protestors who refused to move away until the basic demand to send back the French envoy was fulfilled.The TLP first came to limelight in 2017 when it protested against some changes in the oath of elected representatives and organised about a three-week long sit-in at Faizabad, paralyzing life in Islamabad.The TLP lifted the siege when then Pakistan Muslim League(N) government led by Nawaz Sharif fired its law minister.The then opposition leader Imran Khan had supported the TLP demand as he was trying to topple the PML-N government. However, now he faces a similar dilemma, showing that extremists are a threat to everyone, sources saidLike it has done in the past, the Islamabad administration reacted by sealing the Red Zone, having important offices, and blocked all roads leading to the diplomatic enclave, housing foreign missions.So far none of the government representatives tried to broker a deal with the protestors.Last night, police and protesters clashed for hours, leaving several people injured. Police claimed to have arrested about 200 protestors.Mobile service remained suspended in Rawalpindi region and Islamabad while the internet was slow, making communication difficult, local print and electronic continued to ignore the protest.Rizvi is considered a controversial cleric and was arrested for asking army troops to rebel against the army chief. He spent several months in jail before being released in May 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamabad-under-partial-seige-over-anti-france-protest-by-extremists/story-56VWgTveHSCGNMF2kl7svM.html
16-11-2020||World||Japan’s foreign minister says Tokyo looks to deepen US ties||Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said Monday that Japan hopes to deepen its alliance with the United States under President-elect Joe Biden and do more to get its ally continuously committed to regional security and other key international issues.Motegi, discussing Japanese diplomacy at the Japan National Press Club, said his country hopes to pursue cooperation with the Biden administration to achieve the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” or FOIP, vision of economic and security cooperation in the face of China’s growing assertiveness.With the US increasingly focusing on how to rebuild its social divide and economy, Japan will have to take more of a share of the Japan-US security alliance, Motegi said.This would involve not just more spending for hosting the 50,000-plus American troops in Japan under the countries’ bilateral pact, but would also mean an increase of Japan’s own military capability and spending, experts say.At a time when the United States is largely focusing on internal politics, “How to secure the US commitment to international security, climate change and the Free and Open Indo-Pacific vision is a major diplomatic challenge for Japan,” Motegi said.Japan has been pursuing the FOIP with the US and they have formed a four-way cooperation that also includes Australia and India. They are trying to bring in other countries in Southeast Asia and beyond that share concerns about China’s increasing assertiveness in the region.Japan is opposed to any Chinese attempts to “unilaterally change the status quo” by force in the East and South China Seas and has promoted the FOIP concept with the United States to counter China’s growing influence. Japan has its own territorial disputes with China over Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea that Beijing also claims.With the US-China row expected to continue under the Biden administration, Japan, as a key economic partner and neighbor of China, also hopes to play a role in encouraging Beijing to play by international rules and act responsibly as a global giant, Motegi said.Japan’s new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, is carrying on the policy and is trying to get more countries to join.Japan has also been setting up strategic defense partnerships with other Asia-Pacific nations such as Australia, as well as Europe.Suga is to hold talks with visiting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday to discuss stepping up bilateral defense cooperation and other regional issues at a time of the US leadership transition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-foreign-minister-says-tokyo-looks-to-deepen-us-ties/story-poxlsSJtyTocNHop28oPnI.html
16-11-2020||World||Moderna says its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19||Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) said on Monday its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19 based on interim data from a late-stage clinical trial, becoming the second U.S. company in a week to report results that far exceed expectations.Together with Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) vaccine, also shown to be more than 90% effective, and pending more safety data and regulatory review, the United States could have two vaccines authorized for emergency use in December with as many as 60 million doses of vaccine available by the year’s end.Next year, the U.S. government could have access to more than 1 billion doses just from the two vaccine makers, more than needed for the country’s 330 million residents.The vaccines, both built using new technology known as messenger RNA or mRNA, represent powerful new tools to fight a pandemic that has infected 54 million people worldwide and killed 1.3 million. The news also comes at time when Covid-19 cases are soaring, hitting new records in the United States and pushing some European countries back into lockdowns.“We are going to have a vaccine that can stop Covid-19,” Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in a telephone interview.Moderna’s interim analysis was based on 95 infections among trial participants who received either a placebo or the vaccine. Of those, only five infections occurred in those who received the vaccine, which is administered in two shots 28 days apart.A key advantage of Moderna’s vaccine is that it does not need ultra-cold storage like Pfizer’s, making it easier to distribute. Moderna expects it to be stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F) for 30 days and it can be stored for up to 6 months at -20 degrees Celsius.Pfizer’s vaccine must be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, the sort of temperature typical of an Antarctic winter. At standard refrigerator temperatures, it can be stored for up to five days.The data from Moderna’s 30,000 participant-strong trial also showed the vaccine prevented cases of severe Covid-19, a question that still remains with the Pfizer vaccine. Of the 95 cases in Moderna’s trial, 11 were severe and all 11 occurred among volunteers who got the placebo.Moderna, part of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program, expects to produce around 20 million doses of the vaccine for the United States this year, millions of which the company has already made, and is ready to ship if it receives FDA authorization.“Assuming we get an emergency use authorization, we’ll be ready to ship through Warp Speed almost in hours,” Hoge said. “So it could start being distributed instantly.”  DATA DETAILS The 95 cases of Covid-19 included several key groups who are at increased risk for severe disease, including 15 cases in adults aged 65 and older and 20 in participants from racially diverse groups.Most side effects were mild to moderate. A significant proportion of volunteers, however, experienced more severe aches and pains after taking the second dose, including about 10% who had fatigue severe enough to interfere with daily activities while another 9% had severe body aches. Most of these complaints were generally short-lived, the company said.Moderna’s data provide further validation of the promising but previously unproven mRNA platform, which turns the human body into a vaccine factory by coaxing cells to make certain virus proteins that the immune system sees as a threat and mounts a response against.Moderna expects to have enough safety data required for U.S. authorization in the next week or so and the company expects to file for emergency use authorization in the coming weeks.The United States has the world’s highest known number of Covid-19 cases and deaths with more than 11 million infections and nearly 250,000 deaths.The Trump Administration has primarily relied on development of vaccines and treatments as its response to the pandemic. Moderna has received nearly $1 billion in research and development funding from the U.S. government and has a $1.5 billion deal for 100 million doses. The U.S. government also has an option for another 400 million doses.The company hopes to have between 500 million and 1 billion doses in 2021, split between its U.S. and international manufacturing sites and dependent in part on demand.The U.S. government has said Covid-19 vaccines will be provided free to Americans, whether they have health insurance, are uninsured or are covered by government health programs such as Medicare.Moderna also said it will use its data to seek authorization in Europe and other regions.Other countries such as China and Russia have already begun vaccinations. Russia licensed its “Sputnik-V” Covid-19 vaccine for domestic use in August before it released data from large-scale trials. It said on Nov. 11 that its vaccine was 92% effective based on 20 infections in its large trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-says-its-vaccine-is-94-5-effective-in-preventing-covid-19/story-TjF3qAJZxNUn9D7YIhCO3K.html
16-11-2020||World||Donald Trump tweets words ‘he won’; says vote rigged, not conceding||President Donald Trump worked to take back an apparent acknowledgement that Joe Biden won the White House and was making clear he would keep trying to overturn the election result.Trump’s earlier comments Sunday had given some critics and supporters hope that the White House was ready to begin working on a transition with Biden’s team. Not so fast, Trump soon assured.Trump, without using Biden’s name, said that “He won” as part of a tweet that made baseless claims about a “rigged” election. But as the Republican president saw how his comments were being interpreted as his first public acknowledgment of a Biden victory, he quickly reversed course.“He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA,” Trump subsequently tweeted. “I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!”There was no widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties stated publicly that the election went well, and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities. Trump’s campaign has tried to mount legal challenges across the country, but many of the lawsuits have been thrown out and none has included any evidence that the outcome might be reversed.Biden, a Democrat, defeated Trump by winning back a trio of battleground states: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and topped the 270 electoral vote threshold to clinch the presidency. Biden so far has 78.8 million votes, the most ever by a winning candidate, to Trump’s 73.1 million.“If the president’s prepared to begin to recognize that reality, that’s positive,” Biden’s incoming chief of staff, Ron Klain, told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Still, Klain said, “Donald Trump’s Twitter feed doesn’t make Joe Biden president or not president. The American people did that.”A Republican governor, Arkansas’ Asa Hutchinson, said “it was good, actually” to see Trump’s tweet that Biden won. “I think that’s the start of an acknowledgment. ... We want to make sure that there is a smooth transition,” Hutchinson said on NBC.Nearly two weeks after Election Day, Trump has neither called Biden nor made a formal concession, and White House officials have insisted that they are preparing for a second term.Former President Barack Obama, in an interview conducted and aired Sunday on CBS’ “60 Minutes,” said he would remind Trump that, as president, he is a public servant and a temporary occupant of the office.“And when your time is up then it is your job to put the country first and think beyond your own ego, and your own interests, and your own disappointments,” Obama said. “My advice to President Trump is, if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody who put country first, it’s time for you to do the same thing.”Obama also criticized those Republicans going along with Trump’s false claims of widespread voter fraud.“I’m more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, are humoring him in this fashion. It is one more step in delegitimizing not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally. And that’s a dangerous path,” he said.In recent days, Trump appeared to be inching closer to acknowledging the reality of his loss. In comments Friday in the Rose Garden about a coronavirus vaccine, Trump said his administration would “not be going to a lockdown” to slow the spread of COVID-19, and added that “whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be? I guess time will tell.”Trump on Sunday renewed his groundless attacks on an election technology firm, Dominion Voting Systems, without evidence of any serious irregularities. Dominion has said it “denies claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems.”The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, a federal agency that oversees U.S. election security, said in a statement last week that the “November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.” The agency said, ”There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser, said it was important for Republican Party leaders to explain to voters that Trump did lose and that his claims of election fraud are baseless. Bolton left the administration last year. He says he resigned; Trump says he fired Bolton.“I think as every day goes by, it’s clearer and clearer there isn’t any evidence. But if the Republican voters are only hearing Donald Trump’s misrepresentations, it’s not surprising that they believe it,” Bolton said on ABC’s “This Week.” “It’s critical for other Republican leaders to stand up and explain what actually happened. Donald Trump lost what by any evidence we have so far was a free and fair election.”Having none of that was Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney who is helping lead Trump’s national legal front on the election challenge. In a television appearance that Trump previewed on Twitter after his morning tweets, Giuliani denied Trump was conceding — “No, no, no, far from it.”“I guess,’‘ Giuliani told Fox News Channel’s ”Sunday Morning Futures,” “you would call it sarcastic.”___Associated Press writers Will Weissert in Wilmington, Delaware, and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-tweets-words-he-won-says-vote-rigged-not-conceding/story-bDnvXNI3KsxmwP21iN1iCK.html
16-11-2020||World||Women struggle to access abortion as coronavirus pandemic adds to hurdles in Europe||Helplines across Europe have reported higher demand for their services as the coronavirus pandemic adds to the hurdles many women face to access abortion.While abortion is legal in most of Europe, some women have struggled to get appointments in public health systems overwhelmed by the pandemic. Others could not escape abusive partners because of lockdowns, non-governmental organisations and some women who chose to have an abortion told Reuters.In countries where abortion is highly restricted, such as Poland, women found themselves unable to travel abroad to terminate an unwanted pregnancy as the pandemic grounded flights and closed borders. “In some cases it made abortion catastrophically more complicated,” said Mara Clarke, head of the UK-based Abortion Support Network (ASN), which helps women get abortions abroad.Sending abortion pills by post, a common practice for organisations helping women in places where it is not widely available, became difficult because packages were taking weeks to be delivered.When she found out she was pregnant in April, mother-of-two Ania, from Warsaw in Poland, said she had experienced two miscarriages and decided it was not the right time to have another baby.“It was intense ... really hard,” she said. “If it wasn’t for the pandemic I would have gone to another country - to Slovakia or the Czech Republic.”Ania, who declined to give her surname for fear of stigma, eventually managed to terminate her pregnancy with help from Women on Web, an NGO which supports women in her situation.She is one of thousands of people now protesting in Poland against a court ruling last month that could amount to a near-total ban on abortion in the staunchly Roman Catholic country.“Dangerous”Abortion Without Borders, a helpline in Poland that launched in December 2019, has received nearly 2,300 calls this year, with a jump in requests for help since a lockdown was announced. Women in the island-nation of Malta, the only country in Europe where abortion is banned, and where the airport was shut for months due to Covid-19, were the worst hit, Clarke said.Calls from Malta to an ASN helpline almost doubled, from 44 in 2019 to 83 this year. In Romania, where abortion is legal within a 14-week limit, some women struggled to access services as the government deemed it a “non-essential procedure” as its healthcare system battled the coronavirus, women’s rights groups said. Romania-based FILIA said in April only 11 per cent of 112 state hospitals surveyed were providing abortions, and none in the capital Bucharest. Experts fear restrictions to tackle a second wave of the coronavirus in Europe will create further challenges, especially in countries where healthcare systems are under-resourced.Marie Stopes International, a non-profit organisation providing contraception and abortion services, has estimated an additional 2.7 million unsafe abortions will take place worldwide as a result of health service disruptions.“The pandemic had an impact on reproductive health as a whole - because it was not considered a priority,” said one of Portugal’s top obstetricians Teresa Bombas.Rebecca Gomperts, founder of Women on Web, said remote working and lockdowns also created problems for some women with controlling partners as they were unable to leave home.Requests to Women on Web have been higher this year than the group expected based on previous years, particularly in Portugal - where the procedure is provided mostly in a hospital setting - with 34 demands, and in Northern Ireland - where abortion was decriminalised in 2019 - with 97.Some governments have taken steps to tackle the issue. In Britain, where abortion is legal in England, Scotland and Wales within a 24-week limit, women can now take abortion pills at home instead of going to hospital and some consultations have moved online.“We have seen such colossal advantages,” said Jonathan Lord, Marie Stopes UK’s medical director, who hopes the measure will become permanent. But rights groups say many more will face a struggle in the coming months because of the economic damage caused by the pandemic.“Half of all pregnancies are unplanned and people will look at the economic forecast right now and decide not to do it,” Clarke said. “We are in for a very hard 2021.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/women-struggle-to-access-abortion-as-coronavirus-pandemic-adds-to-hurdles-in-europe/story-92wN8VkvFTRA1gUuuDxKxJ.html
16-11-2020||World||Donald Trump rushes environmental regulations that could handcuff Joe Biden||The Trump administration is rushing to issue permits, finalize major environmental regulations and even sell the rights to drill for oil in Alaskan wilderness before Inauguration Day in a push that could complicate Joe Biden’s climate and conservation agenda.The 11th-hour regulatory race underscores the extent to which federal agencies are anticipating Biden’s swearing-in as US president on January 20 even as President Donald Trump refuses to concede the election. It also reveals a widespread effort by Trump officials to leave their imprint on federal policy and -- at least temporarily -- tie the hands of their successors.“Everyone has to be vigilant over the next 60-odd days because the administration can create more work for the people coming in,” said David Hayes, a former deputy Interior secretary who leads New York University’s State Energy and Environmental Impact Center. “They can take additional actions here that will put sand in the gears of the early Biden administration.”Already, the Trump administration is poised as soon as Monday to advance plans for selling drilling rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, despite Biden’s vow to protect that Alaskan wilderness. And officials are reviewing measures that would lift criminal penalties for accidentally killing migratory birds, lock in existing air pollution limits and make it harder to impose new environmental safeguards.Altogether, the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs that is in charge of reviewing proposed rules is looking at 23 measures submitted just since Election Day, foreshadowing the coming deluge.While Biden officials can unwind many Trump rules, that will consume time and resources, even as the incoming administration intends to write new measures regarding pollution, energy efficiency and drilling regulations.And the Biden administration probably won’t have help from Congress immediately on overturning rules under the Congressional Review Act, since Republicans are likely to maintain control of the Senate. The law makes it easier to repeal last-minute regulations enacted by an outgoing administration.“They have to clean up this huge mess that’s been deliberately left behind before they can even start advancing their affirmative agenda,” said James Goodwin, an analyst with the Center for Progressive Reform.“The story for the last four years is how can we tear down these agencies and make them as useless as possible,” Goodwin said. “The next few weeks is going to be dedicated to that, and they will not miss a trick when it comes to making the Biden administration’s life a misery.”For instance, the White House just began scrutinizing a final rule to end criminal penalties for oil explorers, homebuilders and other companies that accidentally kill migratory birds, setting the stage for the Interior Department to finalize the measure within weeks. And on Thursday, the White House started reviewing a rule defining the “habitat” that gets protection under the Endangered Species Act, just four weeks after the deadline for public comments on the proposed measure.The Energy Department is trying to finish regulations weakening energy efficiency standards for furnaces and other appliances. That includes a rule greenlighting high-flow shower heads with multiple nozzles -- a measure that drew momentum after Trump complained that with more efficient models “you can’t wash your beautiful hair properly.”EPA RegulationsThe Environmental Protection Agency is rushing to codify decisions to retain existing air quality limits on ozone and particulate matter, rebuffing public health advocates’ calls to tighten the pollution standards.The administration also is propelling regulations that go to the heart of federal agencies’ power.For instance, Trump’s EPA is close to finalizing two measures that could make it harder to impose pollution curbs. One would block the agency from relying on scientific research that isn’t or can’t be made public. Another would limit how the agency calculates the costs and benefits of future regulations.It’s customary for administrations to finalize a spate of rules during their final months in office, with a final spurt of so-called midnight regulations.“One big difference from the recent past is that because Trump is only a one-term president, there is more for EPA to rush to finalize then when we’ve had two-term presidents,” observed Amit Narang, a regulatory policy expert with the watchdog group Public Citizen. “But there is a real risk that anything EPA rushes out the door in sloppy fashion will get struck down in court, just like so many of EPA’s rollbacks under Trump have been.”Though Inauguration Day is still nine weeks away, the regulatory clock may run out sooner. The enforcement of any final rules that haven’t become binding by Jan. 20 can be postponed by a new administration, buying time for a rewrite. Because there is a 60-day waiting period for major rules to come into force, the Trump administration actually needs to get those measures published in the Federal Register by Nov. 21.Federal RegisterThe EPA already is trying to beat that clock with an air permitting regulation teed up for publication in the Federal Register on Nov. 19, just two days before the cutoff.The push goes beyond well-telegraphed rules to permitting decisions and project approvals that may be harder to undo.For example, the Interior Department is fast-tracking a proposal to conduct seismic surveys in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- an industrial operation designed to help pinpoint possible oil reserves that environmentalists say risks scarring the tundra and trampling polar bears in snow-covered dens.Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League said he’s deeply concerned the Interior Department is trying “to jam this massive seismic program through in the final minutes of the Trump administration,” without enough environmental review and against the wishes of the American people. “It’s Defcon one on the level of concern list,” Kolton added.Last-Minute PushWhile regulations can be undone, the Biden administration could not repair damage if heavy seismic vehicles roll into to the refuge and begin work, Kolton said. “If you want to throw a hand grenade in the middle of the Interior Department transition team, this would be the way to do it,” he said.The Trump administration is also advancing plans to sell drilling rights in the refuge before Jan. 20. It’s not clear that the Interior Department would have time to formally issue any leases sold in the final weeks before Inauguration Day, but every step advancing Arctic oil development could complicate a Biden administration retreat.Oil companies also can expect a few more chances to buy up drilling rights in other parts of the US, including during a Trump administration sale of coveted New Mexico territory Jan. 14.The last-minute push is essential, said Tom Pyle, the president of the American Energy Alliance, a free-market advocacy group that has cheered much of Trump’s deregulatory agenda.“Even as President Trump and his legal team continue to explore their options, it is critical that his agencies to put a full-court press on getting the remainder of his agenda across the finish line as an insurance policy,” Pyle said. “Joe Biden did not receive a mandate from voters to upend all the gains that President Trump made with respect to our energy independence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-rushes-environmental-regulations-that-could-handcuff-joe-biden/story-Dfjr1GODPrHKcP9sQzr8QP.html
16-11-2020||World||UN-led Libya talks end without naming interim government||Libya’s rival sides wrapped up a week of UN-brokered talks without agreeing on a transitional government that would lead the county to an election in December next year, the top UN official for Libya said Monday.The political forum, which concluded late Sunday in Tunisia, was the latest effort to end the chaos that engulfed the oil-rich North African nation after the 2011 overthrow and killing of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.The main goal of the gathering was to draw a roadmap for presidential and parliamentary elections. The participants agreed to hold the vote on Dec. 24, 2021, but failed to name a transitional administration to lead the war-torn country.UN acting envoy for Libya Stephanie Williams told reporters in Tunisia that the 75-member forum did not discuss names during their week-long talks. The Libyan rivals would meet again, online and within a week, to agree on a mechanism to name the next government, she said.The UN had selected 75 delegates from Libya to take part in the week-long forum at a luxury hotel in the Mediterranean town of Gammarth, just outside the capital of Tunis. Williams said on Sunday night that she was “very pleased with the outcome” of the gathering.The talks took place amid heavy international pressure after the warring sides agreed to a UN-brokered cease-fire agreement last month in Geneva.Libya is split between a UN-supported government in the capital, Tripoli, and rival authorities based in the east. The two sides are backed by an array of local militias, as well as regional and foreign powers.Eastern Libya forces, led by commander Khalifa Hifter, launched an offensive in April 2019 to try and capture Tripoli. His campaign collapsed in June, when the Tripoli-allied militias, with heavy Turkish support, pushed Hifter’s forces away from Tripoli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-led-libya-talks-end-without-naming-interim-government/story-lsSwaCbuPWXfWeEoIvSodO.html
16-11-2020||World||Peru left without president as Merino resigns after protest deaths||Peru was without a president Monday after Congress failed to agree on a successor to interim leader Manuel Merino, who resigned following days of street protests against him.Merino announced he was stepping down Sunday, following an ultimatum from Congress for him to quit or face censure after a police crackdown on protesters left at least two dead and scores injured.“I want to let the whole country know that I’m resigning,” said Merino, 59, in a televised address, sparking celebrations in the capital Lima following street protests against the ousting of his popular predecessor.Congress now has to name Merino’s successor to become the country’s third president in a week.Merino only assumed office on Tuesday, a day after the assembly impeached predecessor Martin Vizcarra on corruption charges. As speaker of Congress, he was next in line as the post of vice president was vacant.A crisis session of Congress failed to agree on a new president Sunday night. Leftist legislator and former human rights activist Rocio Silva Santisteban, supposedly a consensus candidate, needed 60 votes but she only got 42, with 52 against and 25 abstentions.“Congress had in its hands the solution to this political crisis that they generated. However, today they have turned their backs on the country,” former economy minister Vizcarra Maria Antonieta Alva tweeted.Party whips then held a closed-door meeting as thousands of protesters remained peacefully on the streets, undisturbed by police.Thousands have taken to the streets in days of protests against Merino, who had launched the first, unsuccessful, impeachment proceedings against Vizcarra in September.Elections are scheduled for April 2021 and Merino was due to leave office in July, when Vizcarra’s mandate was to end.The Congress ultimatum came after the health ministry said two protesters were killed on Saturday during a massive march in Lima, which was repressed by police firing shotgun pellets and tear gas.Merino said that to avoid a “power vacuum” the 18 ministers he swore in on Thursday would temporarily remain in their posts, though almost all had resigned in the wake of Saturday’s crackdown on protests.His resignation was greeted by noisy celebrations in Lima, with demonstrators sounding horns and banging pots.“We succeeded. Do you realize what we are capable of doing?” Peru national soccer team midfielder Renato Tapia wrote on social media.Some lawmakers questioned the wisdom of removing Vizcarra in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and a crippling recession.The pandemic has hit Peru hard, with the politically fragile country having the world’s highest per capita death rate -- with nearly 35,000 fatalities -- and GDP plunging over 30 percent in the second quarter.- Police criticized -Vizcarra, 57, welcomed his rival’s resignation, having questioned the legality of his dismissal last week.“A dictatorship has left the palace,” he told reporters outside his home in Lima, adding that Merino “was breaking our democracy.”The popular former president did not rule out a return to his mandate and urged an early ruling on a constitutional challenge to his November 9 dismissal.“It is essential that the Constitutional Court make a statement urgently and say whether what the congressmen did on the 9th is legal,” said Vizcarra.Thousands of mostly young protesters took to the streets Saturday to oppose what they called a parliamentary coup against Vizcarra.A crackdown by police left at least two dead and 94 injured, according to health ministry officials. But the National Human Rights Coordinator said 112 were injured and warned that a dozen had also “disappeared” during the protests.The violent repression of the protests eroded whatever political support Merino had and the head of Congress called for his immediate resignation.The police tactics have been criticized by the UN and rights organizations such as Amnesty International since the protests began on Tuesday.The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights regretted the deaths of the two protesters and demanded “an immediate investigation of the facts and to establish responsibility.”Vizcarra had broad support since succeeding Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, the former Wall Street banker who was forced to resign under threat of impeachment over corruption allegations in 2018.Congress impeached and dismissed Vizcarra on Monday over allegations he took kickbacks from developers when he was governor of the Moquegua region in 2014, charges he denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/peru-left-without-president-as-merino-resigns-after-protest-deaths/story-L5VBfVz3NvgCKdCtcP2XQK.html
16-11-2020||World||Americans across party lines, regions embrace marijuana||Bill Stocker could be considered the archetype of a conservative voter: He’s a retired Marine and former police officer who voted for President Donald Trump. But he’s also among the majority of South Dakota voters who broadly legalized marijuana this month.Stocker, 61, said enforcing marijuana laws gets in the way of pursuing other drug crimes and called warnings about the ills of marijuana “a bunch of baloney” that even people in a Republican stronghold like South Dakota no longer believe.South Dakota’s values of “personal responsibility and freedom” won out, said Stocker, who lives in Sioux Falls.Also Read: Donald Trump admits Joe Biden ‘won’, but insists US election was ‘rigged’The 2020 election helped prove how broadly accepted marijuana has become throughout the United States, with measures to legalize recreational pot also breezing to victory in progressive New Jersey, moderate Arizona and conservative Montana. Fifteen states have now broadly legalized it, while 36 states allow medical marijuana.Voters in Mississippi overwhelmingly approved medical marijuana this month, giving the drug another foothold in the South.A Gallup Poll released Nov. 9 indicated that 68% of Americans favor legalizing marijuana — double the approval rate in 2003. That wide margin was evident in the election, with marijuana measures passing with strong bipartisan support.In South Dakota and Montana — where Republicans swept to victory in the key races — recreational marijuana passed with at least 16 percentage points more support than Democratic President-elect Joe Biden received. South Dakota also approved medical pot, which outpolled Biden by 34 percentage points.“We’ve waged a war against this plant for a century and by any reasonable metric, that war has been an abject failure,” said Matthew Schweich, deputy director of the Marijuana Policy Project, which favors legalization. “All it’s done is incarcerate millions of Americans, it has perpetuated racism in this country, and perhaps the worst injustice of all is that it’s deprived us of medical marijuana research.”Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, hurting veterans who can’t be prescribed medical pot at Veterans Affairs clinics, he said.They “come home with chronic pain and we’re pushing them to opioids,” Schweich said. “That’s crazy. That’s unpatriotic and it’s a disgrace.”Support for legalization was around 25% in 1992 when then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton tried to avoid answering questions about whether he had used marijuana before finally saying in a television interview that he had experimented with the drug, didn’t like it and “didn’t inhale.”In early 2019, Kamala Harris — now the vice president-elect — was asked about her prior marijuana use during a radio interview and acknowledged: “I did inhale.”Brendan Johnson, a former U.S. attorney in South Dakota who supported the state’s marijuana initiatives, said the campaign focused on the fact that in recent years 10% of arrests in the state were for marijuana, and most were small amounts.“We have a real problem here where we have criminalized an entire generation of South Dakotans, and we’re paying a price,” Johnson said.The owner of a chain of medical marijuana dispensaries in Billings, Montana, credited passage of the recreational marijuana initiative to a yearslong campaign by medical marijuana supporters to educate the public about the benefits of cannabis.“There has been a considerable change in the political demographic because people are educated, because they know Aunt Margaret tried it for her cancer and she can eat,” said Richard Abromeit, owner of Montana Advanced Caregivers.Advocates’ next goal is to get marijuana removed from a federal list of illegal drugs with no accepted medical use and high potential for abuse. The listing prevents labs from researching potential medical remedies using marijuana.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told lawmakers last week that he would hold a vote in December on a bill that would decriminalize cannabis, create a process to expunge nonviolent pot convictions and remove the drug from the Controlled Substances Act. It’s not clear if the bill could pass both chambers.Also Read: Cases filed by people show ‘unconstitutionality’ of election: Donald TrumpThe outcome of two runoff elections in Georgia could determine how the issue might fare in the Senate, where Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has impeded its progress.Other states are expected to consider marijuana legislation next year, which could put more pressure on Congress to act.Supporters argue that the industry creates jobs and raises tax money to help prop up governments that are hurting because of business closures tied to the Covid-19 pandemic.But some oppose broad legalization.Republican Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota argued that marijuana leads people to use other, more-addictive drugs, while law enforcement officers and prosecutors in Montana asserted that legal pot would lead to more drugged driving and other crimes, while exacerbating mental health issues.The Gallup Poll says just under half of Republicans, people who identify as politically conservative and those who attend church on a weekly basis say they think marijuana should be legal.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, widely known as the Mormon church, strongly opposed Arizona’s broad legalization measure despite supporting medical marijuana in Utah.Chris Nylen, 50, of Flagstaff, Arizona, is a Trump supporter who voted to legalize recreational marijuana. She said her feelings evolved after a CBD pill, made from hemp and prescribed by a veterinarian, eased her dog’s anxiety and arthritis.“I’m so old school,” she said. “I personally don’t have a desire for it, but (I’m) seeing the benefits for my dog.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-across-party-lines-regions-embrace-marijuana/story-tWkhII9xeFGVuIvIG178bK.html

This democracy doesn’t work if we don’t have an informed citizenry. This democracy doesn’t work if we don’t have responsible elected officials at other levels who are willing to call the president when he’s not doing something right, call him on it”, Obama said.Obama said that not just politicians, even the voters are divided now as the priority is to “beat the other guy” rather than discussing issues, facts and policies, and the current media environment adds to that greatly.He added, “It’s not just the politicians now. The voters are divided. It has now become a contest where issues, facts, policies per se don’t matter as much as identity and wanting to beat the other guy.

16-11-2020||World||India will miss the bus to economic development by not joining RCEP: Chinese state media||India has committed a “strategic blunder” and “missed the bus” to long-term growth, Chinese state media has said about New Delhi’s decision not to join the China-led 15-country Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), signed on Sunday at an online ceremony hosted by this year’s ASEAN chair, Vietnam.The 15 countries that signed the deal span the Asia-Pacific region including China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, along with the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).Signed after eight years of negotiations, the RCEP has created the world’s largest trading bloc, aiming to boost the member nations’ economic growth that has been hit by the Covid-19-pandemic.Together, they account for around 30% of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) and population.Also Watch l Explained: RCEP world’s largest trade deal, India’s rejection, China’s dominance “The RCEP agreement covers a market of 2.2 billion people, or almost 30% of the world’s population, with a combined GDP of $26.2 trillion or about 30% of global GDP,” official news agency Xinhua reported.It hailed the deal as “…not only a monumental achievement in East Asian regional cooperation, but more important, a victory of multilateralism and free trade”.Two major economies - the US and India - are not part of the deal. India, which had initially taken part in the negotiations, pulled out of the trade bloc last year. There are “significant outstanding issues, which remain unresolved”, New Delhi said last year before pulling out of the RCEP.New Delhi’s list of concerns includes the possibility of opening up its markets to cheap, China-made goods, with which it already has a huge bilateral trade deficit.Chinese South Asia experts were quick to criticise India for not joining the trade bloc, calling it a mistake, and blaming “interest groups” for the decision.“The Indian government argues that as China has an advantageous position in the deal, and India has a ballooning trade deficit with China, such a context would leave India in an unfair position, were it to join,” Liu Zongyi from the Centre for China-South Asia Cooperation at Shanghai Institutes for International Studies wrote in the Chinese state media.“However, most international observers believe that it’s the work of some interest groups in India, trying hard to obstruct India’s participation for their own interests, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party made concessions in order to win their support,” Liu wrote.Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, argued that New Delhi has missed the bus to the fast lane of economic recovery.“With the world’s second largest number of novel coronavirus infections so far, India may miss a new round of regional industrial reconstruction and the fast lane of economic recovery,” Qian wrote in the nationalistic tabloid, Global Times.“The Indian economy has been hit hard by Covid-19 and recorded a record contraction during the April-June quarter of 23.9%. According to an IMF estimate, it may shrink 10.3% in 2020. Though the RCEP may still leave a chance for India, it will be hard for the nation to reset its direction unless New Delhi clearly realises that its core interest has been hindered by its skewed strategy,” Qian added.A joint statement issued in November 2019 in Thailand at the end of RCEP negotiations had acknowledged India’s concerns.“India has significant outstanding issues, which remain unresolved. All RCEP participating countries will work together to resolve these outstanding issues in a mutually satisfactory way. India’s final decision will depend on satisfactory resolution of these issues,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-will-miss-the-bus-to-economic-development-by-not-joining-rcep-chinese-state-media/story-LTv6pnvOHhJ8ZOigHtyXbJ.html

It said there were reports of “similar” attacks, and of people fleeing the violence, in other parts of the region.“The latest attack is a grim addition to the human cost which we bear collectively,” Daniel Bekele, commission head, said in a statement.He urged regional and federal authorities to work together on a strategy for Benishangul-Gumuz due to the “unrelenting pace” of attacks there. Armed militia men killed at least 45 people in the same region in September, according to the Ethiopian government.The violence comes amid a 12-day-old war between the Ethiopian government and the restive Tigray region in the country’s north. Experts say that conflict could encourage other ethnic groups to exploit the chaos to push for more autonomy, while the redeployment of forces to Tigray could leave other regions exposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-in-western-ethiopia-kill-at-least-34-people-in-bus-attack/story-jhSHBuqORWLRW7w279jJNL.html

Also Read: Kim Jong Un breaks down in rare apology to North KoreansThe meeting discussed an unspecified “serious crime” committed by party officials at the Pyongyang University of Medicine. Other officials at the Central Committee and other government agencies “shielded, connived and fostered the crime” by failing to tighten oversight over the university, KCNA said, but did not specify if the crime was related to the coronavirus. North Korea had tested over 12,000 people and reported no confirmed cases of the coronavirus, as of early November, according to the World Health Organization.A total of 6,173 people, eight of whom were foreigners, were detected as suspected cases and 174 people were quarantined in the last week of October, the WHO said.More than 54 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 1,312,334​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.Also Read: From ‘love’ to ‘thug’: Joe Biden win to change US-North Korea dynamicKim had called on his country to embark on an 80-day campaign to attain its goals in every sector before a congress in January to decide a new five-year plan.North Korea’s premier, Kim Tok Hun, visited a heavy machine complex and a notebook factory to the southeast of Pyongyang to discuss efforts to reach those goals, KCNA reported on Monday.“At the Taean Heavy Machine Complex, he gave pep-talks to its workers working hard to produce custom-built equipment ahead of schedule amid the intensive 80-day campaign,” KCNA reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-kim-orders-tightening-of-anti-coronavirus-measures-report/story-bpoD1Flzoyn1f5o4RXeLII.html
16-11-2020||World||J&J starts two-dose trial of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate in the UK||Johnson & Johnson launched a new late-stage trial in Britain on Monday to test a two-dose regimen of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine among thousands of volunteers, as the U.S. drugmaker expands its trials by geography and type.The UK arm of the study is aiming to recruit 6,000 participants among a total of 30,000 people globally, scientists leading the UK trial said. Volunteers will be recruited at 17 sites across the UK.Also Read: Covid vaccine would begin to be delivered at the “end of this year, beginning of next year”, says one of the vaccine creatorsThey will be given a first dose of either a placebo or the experimental shot, currently called Ad26COV2, followed by a second dose or placebo 57 days later, said Saul Faust, a professor of paediatric immunology and infectious diseases who is co-leading the trial at University Hospital Southampton.J&J signed an agreement for the two-dose global Phase III clinical trial with the British government in August, to run in parallel with a 60,000-person trial of a single shot of the experimental vaccine which was launched in September.Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine updates: Over 250 register for Covaxin trial, Sputnik-V to reach Kanpur trialIf the results of the single-shot trial are positive, the company said it could simplify distribution of millions of doses compared with leading rivals requiring two doses. The efficacy of a double-dose vaccine could be affected if people fail to return to get their a second shot.Rival drugmakers Pfizer and BioNtech said last week that their potential Covid-19 shot showed more than 90% efficacy in interim data from a late-stage trial, boosting hopes that vaccines against the pandemic disease may be ready for use soon.While the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine uses a new technology known as messenger RNA, J&J’s uses a cold virus to deliver genetic material from the coronavirus into the body to prompt an immune response.The platform, called AdVac, is also used in an Ebola vaccine that was approved earlier this year.“It’s really important that we pursue trials of many different vaccines from many different manufacturers and be able then to ensure the supply both to the UK and global population,” Faust told reporters at a briefing.Scientists leading the UK trial did not give details of the other countries that would be involved in this two-dose trial, but said Britain is the first location to start it. Recruitment into the study will complete in March 2021 and the trial will last for 12 months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/j-j-starts-2-dose-trial-of-its-covid-19-candidate-vaccine-in-the-uk/story-9OaNw9IcwfbUkH7piooVLL.html

Such activity has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.The hurricane center said Iota had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) early Sunday evening. It was centered about 110 miles (175 kilometers) east of Isla de Providencia, Colombia, and was moving westward at 9 mph (15 kph). Forecasters said Iota was expected to pass or cross over Providencia late Sunday or early Monday and then approach the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras on Monday night.By Sunday evening, Nicaraguan officials said about 1.500 people had, nearly half of them children, been evacuated from low-lying areas in the country’s northeast, including all the inhabitants of Cayo Misquitos. Authorities said 83.000 people in that region were in danger.Also Read: Eta expected to be hurricane and strike Florida KeysIota threatened to wreak more havoc in a region where people are still grappling with the aftermath of Eta. That system hit Nicaragua just over a week ago as a Category 4 hurricane, killing at least 120 people as torrential rains caused flash floods and mudslides in parts of Central America and Mexico. Then it meandered across Cuba, the Florida Keys and around the Gulf of Mexico before slogging ashore again near Cedar Key, Florida, and dashing across Florida and the Carolinas.Iota was forecast to bring up to 30 inches (750 millimeters) of rain from northeast Nicaragua into northern Honduras, while Costa Rica, Panama and El Salvador could also experience heavy rain and possible flooding, the hurricane center said. That raised fears of more landslides and flooding.Eta was the 28th named storm of this year’s hurricane season, tying the 2005 record for named storms. Theta, the 29th, was far out in the eastern Atlantic Ocean, and became a remnant low Sunday.The official end of hurricane season is Nov. 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-iota-heads-for-already-battered-central-america/story-PJNABqxJYHEidif3oyMtiJ.html
16-11-2020||World||SpaceX launches 4 astronauts to space, kicking off regular crew flights from the US||SpaceX launched four astronauts to the International Space Station on Sunday on the first full-fledged taxi flight for NASA by a private company.The Falcon rocket thundered into the night from Kennedy Space Center with three Americans and one Japanese, the second crew to be launched by SpaceX. The Dragon capsule on top — named Resilience by its crew in light of this year’s many challenges, most notably Covid-19 — was due to reach the space station late Monday and remain there until spring.Also Read: Resilience: Nasa, SpaceX send four astronauts to International Space Station aboard Falcon 9Sidelined by the virus himself, SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk was forced to monitor the action from afar. He tweeted that he “most likely” had a moderate case of Covid-19. NASA policy at Kennedy Space Center requires anyone testing positive for coronavirus to quarantine and remain isolated.Sunday’s launch follows by just a few months SpaceX’s two-pilot test flight. It kicks off what NASA hopes will be a long series of crew rotations between the US and the space station, after years of delay. More people means more science research at the orbiting lab, according to officials.“This is another historic moment,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said Friday. But he noted: “Make no mistake: Vigilance is always required on every flight.”The flight to the space station — 27 1/2 hours door to door — should be entirely automated, although the crew can take control if needed.With Covid-19 still surging, NASA continued the safety precautions put in place for SpaceX’s crew launch in May. The astronauts went into quarantine with their families in October. All launch personnel wore masks, and the number of guests at Kennedy was limited. Even the two astronauts on the first SpaceX crew flight stayed behind at Johnson Space Center in Houston.Vice President Mike Pence, chairman of the National Space Council, traveled from Washington to watch the launch.Outside the space center gates, officials anticipated hundreds of thousands of spectators to jam nearby beaches and towns.NASA worried a weekend liftoff — coupled with a dramatic nighttime launch — could lead to a superspreader event. They urged the crowds to wear masks and maintain safe distances. Similar pleas for SpaceX’s first crew launch on May 30 went unheeded.The three-men, one-woman crew led by Commander Mike Hopkins, an Air Force colonel, named their capsule Resilience in a nod not only to the pandemic, but also racial injustice and contentious politics. It’s about as diverse as space crews come, including physicist Shannon Walker, Navy Cmdr. Victor Glover, the first Black astronaut on a long-term space station mission, and Japan’s Soichi Noguchi, who became the first person in almost 40 years to launch on three types of spacecraft.They rode out to the launch pad in Teslas — another Musk company — after exchanging high-fives and hand embraces with their children and spouses, who huddled at the open car windows. Musk was replaced by SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell in bidding the astronauts farewell.Also Read: SpaceX Dragon reaches orbit in milestone NASA commercial flightBesides its sleek design and high-tech features, the Dragon capsule is quite spacious — it can carry up to seven people. Previous space capsules have launched with no more than three. The extra room in the capsule was used for science experiments and supplies.The four astronauts will be joining two Russians and one American who flew to the space station last month from Kazakhstan.The first-stage booster — aiming for an ocean platform several minutes after liftoff — is expected to be recycled by SpaceX for the next crew launch. That’s currently targeted for the end of March, which would set up the newly launched astronauts for a return to Earth in April. SpaceX would launch yet another crew in late summer or early fall.SpaceX and NASA wanted the booster recovered so badly that they delayed the launch attempt by a day, to give the floating platform time to reach its position in the Atlantic over the weekend following rough seas.Boeing, NASA’s other contracted crew transporter, is trailing by a year. A repeat of last December’s software-plagued test flight without a crew is off until sometime early next year, with the first astronaut flight of the Starliner capsule not expected before summer.NASA turned to private companies to haul cargo and crew to the space station, after the shuttle fleet retired in 2011. SpaceX qualified for both. With Kennedy back in astronaut-launching action, NASA can stop buying seats on Russian Soyuz rockets. The last one cost $90 million.The commander of SpaceX’s first crew, Doug Hurley, noted it’s not just about saving money or easing the training burdens for crews.“Bottom line: I think it’s just better for us to be flying from the United States if we can do that,” he told The Associated Press last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-launches-four-astronauts-to-space-kicking-off-regular-crew-flights-from-the-us/story-laCX0E226D6nztXmgBOguM.html

Weekend newspapers were full of reports of bitter rows between rival factions in Downing Street that painted a picture of a government in chaos.Also Read: Boris Johnson seeks green jobs for UK as unemployment surgesIn an attempt to show he was not letting the upheaval distract him, his office said Johnson would make a string of “critical announcements” over the next two weeks on issues from green policy to a return to regional Covid-19 rules from Dec. 2.Johnson has come under pressure from within his party not to extend the economically damaging, four-week coronavirus lockdown that he ordered for England this month.Downing Street said the prime minister would remain firm in the finale of talks with the European Union over a post-Brexit trade deal and reiterated that he was ready to end Britain’s transition period on Dec. 31 without a trade deal if necessary.Johnson will agree a one-year public spending plan with his finance minister, Rishi Sunak - to be announced on Nov. 25 - and he will publish this week a plan setting out steps for a “green industrial revolution” to boost green jobs as Britain aims for net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-boris-johnson-self-isolates-after-covid-19-contact/story-BQuhFbmOO8oMq2CL4OI97L.html
16-11-2020||World||SpaceX Dragon reaches orbit in milestone NASA commercial flight||Four astronauts reached orbit on a SpaceX rocket after lifting off at 7:27 p.m. from Florida, in the company’s first regular NASA mission to the International Space Station.The Sunday launch appeared to go as planned as the Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. The rocket’s first stage successfully landed on a drone ship about nine minutes after lift off. The Dragon will ferry the astronauts to the space station on SpaceX’s first operational trip following a test flight with a two-person crew that returned from the orbiting lab three months ago. The latest launch, known as the Crew-1 mission, comes 18 years after Elon Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp. with the ultimate goal of populating other planets.The Crew-1 mission marks a crucial milestone in the development of a space industry in which private-sector companies provide business and tourism services in low-earth orbit. Following the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, NASA awarded SpaceX and Boeing Co. nearly $7 billion in contracts to build new transport systems to the space station as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew program.The launch was originally slated for Saturday, but was scrubbed due to bad weather.In the Crew-1 mission, Commander Michael Hopkins, 51, an Air Force colonel and test pilot, will make his second trip to the space station, seven years after his first. He’ll be joined by three others on the mission:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-dragon-reaches-orbit-in-milestone-nasa-commercial-flight/story-P76GVRneZCs2ZM4I4qbP8M.html

BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said he was “very confident that transmission between people will be reduced by such a highly effective vaccine, maybe not 90%, but maybe 50%”. It’s essential that all immunisation programmes are finished before the autumn, he said on Sunday on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.North Dakota earlier became the 35th US state to require face coverings be worn in public, as governors across the country are grappling with a surge in coronavirus infections. North Dakota joined 38 other states this month in reporting record daily jumps in new cases.New cases nationwide rose on Friday to a daily record of over 177,000, the fourth straight day an all-time high was set, according to a Reuters tally of figures from US public health agencies.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended mask wearing, and a widely cited model estimated that a nationwide mandate could save 68,000 lives by next spring. In France, the number of confirmed new cases and deaths rose sharply in the last 24 hours. France registered 32,095 new cases and deaths in hospitals from Covid-19 rose by 359.Ten people died on Saturday in a fire at a Romanian hospital treating coronavirus patients, the country’s agency for emergency situations said.
