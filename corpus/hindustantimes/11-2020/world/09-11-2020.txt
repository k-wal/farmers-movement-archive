It is co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) David Kessler and Yale School of Medicine’s Marcella Nunez-Smith.Biden’s transition team was informed of Pfizer’s vaccine, which the company said has proven to be 90% effective, just hours later. “Last night, my public health advisors were informed of this excellent news,” he said on Monday. “I congratulate the brilliant women and men who helped produce this breakthrough and to give us such cause for hope.”But he cautioned that the end of the battle against Covid-19 was “still months away”. It will be “many more months” before a vaccine is widely available. This is why, he said, citing Centers for Disease Prevention Director Robert Redfield, “for the foreseeable future, a mask remains a more potent weapon against the virus than the vaccine”.“Today’s news does not change this urgent reality. Americans will have to rely on masking, distancing, contact tracing, hand washing, and other measures to keep themselves safe well into next year. Today’s news is great news, but it doesn’t change that fact.”Biden had withstood ridicule for his use of masks and strict adherence to social distancing norms during the campaign. President Trump, who has not conceded the election and is challenging the outcome, welcomed the announcement in a tweet in all-caps: “STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS!”Vice-President Mike Pence, who leads the White House task force on Covid, was equally effusive. “Thanks to the public-private partnership forged by President @realDonaldTrump, @Pfizer announced its Coronavirus Vaccine trial is EFFECTIVE, preventing infection in 90% of its volunteers,” he tweeted.American drugmaker Pfizer, which developed the vaccine with German company BioNTech, announced that their two-dose vaccine had proven to be 90% effective against coronavirus. “I think we can see light at the end of the tunnel,” Pfizer Chairman and CEO Dr Albert Bourla told CNBC’. “I believe this is likely the most significant medical advance in the last 100 years, if you count the impact this will have in public health, global economy.”They plan to apply for approval by the Food and Drug Administration late November.Even if approved, it will be months before the drug will be available for widespread use, as the president-elect noted in the statement.More than 237,000 Americans have died so far and 10 million have been infected. Cases have been surging again, with 105,000 reported in the last 24 hours, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.“The COVID-19 Advisory Board will help guide the Biden-Harris Transition in planning for the President-elect’s robust federal response,” the transition team said in the statement about the advisory team. Members of the 13-member team will works with state and local officials to determine the public health and economic steps that needed to bring the virus under control, the statement added to being “immediate relief to working families, to address ongoing racial and ethnic disparities, and to reopen our schools and businesses safely and effectively”.Members include another Indian-descent health expert, apart from co-chair Murthy.Atul Gawande, professor of surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and at Harvard Medical School, had previously advised the department of health and human services in the Clinton Administration. Also on the team was Ric Bright, director of the government’s key vaccine agency the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), who was pushed out by the Trump administration after he went public alleging red-flags raised by him about Covid-19 had been ignored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/keep-your-masks-on-biden-says-after-pfizer-announces-vaccine-success/story-XpbV2s0VmFJ6nDPAuVsMkJ.html
09-11-2020||World||Kulbhushan Jadhav: Pak court gives more time, next hearing in Dec||The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday gave more time to the lawyer from the Indian High Commission to get instructions from Kulbhushan Jadhav, the former Indian Navy officer on death row in Pakistan over espionage charges. The new date for hearing has been set for December 1 as the court observed that proceedings can only take place if the Indian side cooperates. India had maintained that Pakistan should address the core issues pertaining to the case.“We have said on a number of occasions that Pakistan has failed to respond on core issues pertaining to this case, and the core issues are provision of all documents related to the case and providing unimpeded, unconditional and unhindered consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said last month.“These core issues need to be addressed if we have to have an effective review and reconsideration as ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). I think Pakistan must show its intention to deliver on these core issues,” he said.Attorney General of Pakistan Khalid Jawed Khan told the court on Monday that the government was “taking all measures” to ensure implementation of the decision of ICJ but that India deliberately “did not want to be part of the court proceedings.”The government had offered counsellor access to India through its high commission to Jadhav for the third time, he added.The attorney general said the Indian High Commission had approached the court in another case pertaining to its prisoners, but it was not cooperating with the court in the Jadhav case. The other petition of the High Commission was fixed for hearing on the same day, he informed the court, and said India could become a party in the Jadhav case through its counsel.IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah observed that the cooperation of the Indian government was necessary for implementation of the ICJ decision, adding that it could approach the court if it had reservations.Indian High Commission’s lawyer Shahnawaz Noon appeared before the court in another case pertaining to prisoner Jaspal and told the court that he had been instructed to get some documents from the attorney general’s office but he had been refused. To this, the IHC chief justice said the lawyer should have approached the court if he could not get documents.On the query of the bench pertaining to Kulbhushan Jadhav case and consular access, the Indian High Commission’s lawyer said he would inform the court after taking instructions from his client. He requested the court to grant one-week time which was accepted by the bench.The bench adjourned the hearing in the case till December 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kulbhushan-jadhav-pak-court-gives-more-time-next-hearing-in-dec/story-fvQPgt0LgleWfq6LCIywsI.html
09-11-2020||World||President-elect Joe Biden warns country of ‘dark winter’ ahead with Covid-19 surge||President-elect Joe Biden warned on Monday that the U.S. was facing a “dark winter” and many more deaths as the coronavirus continues to spread unabated.“There’s a need for bold action to fight this pandemic. We’re still facing a very dark winter,” he said in somber remarks after meeting with his newly appointed coronavirus task force.He called on all Americans to wear masks consistently as the best way to fight infection.“It doesn’t matter your party. It doesn’t matter who you voted for,” he said. “We can save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask.”His remarks came as Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, a physician, tested positive for Covid-19.His transition team is seeking to fulfill a campaign promise to develop a dramatically different approach than President Donald Trump’s to contain the pandemic.The 13-member task force is composed largely of doctors and public health experts, who will work with Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and the transition team to map out the public health and economic policies needed to curtail the virus.The task force was announced only hours before positive preliminary test results were released of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE indicating it prevented more than 90% of infections. The study involved tens of thousands of volunteers.Eight months into the worst pandemic in a century, the preliminary results pave the way for the companies to seek an emergency-use authorization from regulators if further research shows the shot is also safe.Biden, in a statement issued Monday, congratulated “the brilliant women and men who helped produce this breakthrough,” but warned that “the end of the battle against Covid-19 is still months away.”Even if “some Americans are vaccinated later this year, it will be many more months before there is widespread vaccination in this country,” Biden said. “Today’s news does not change this urgent reality. Americans will have to rely on masking, distancing, contact tracing, hand washing, and other measures to keep themselves safe well into next year.”From the onset of the pandemic, Biden said it was critical to listen to scientists and medical experts in charting a path out of the pandemic. He staked much of his presidential campaign on striking a contrast with Trump, who repeatedly downplayed the dangers of the virus even after being hospitalized when he contracted it.The team will be led by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler, and Marcella Nunez-Smith, a professor of public health at Yale University. It will include about a dozen people, many of whom were already advising Biden and his staff throughout the campaign. Kessler and Murthy, in particular, were deeply involved in shaping the Biden campaign’s plans for responding to the virus, and they both regularly briefed the president-elect.The transition and the task force face the difficult task of figuring out how to implement the policies Biden has proposed, including identifying supply chain issues for vaccine distribution and increased testing.The announcement of the task force is the first step Biden and his team are taking to demonstrate the high value they will place in having experts and doctors guide their response.“Dealing with the coronavirus pandemic is one of the most important battles our administration will face, and I will be informed by science and by experts,” Biden said in a statement. “The advisory board will help shape my approach to managing the surge in reported infections; ensuring vaccines are safe, effective, and distributed efficiently, equitably, and free; and protecting at-risk populations.”The task force will also include Atul Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Michael Osterlohm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, Celine Gounder, a professor of Medicine and Infectious Diseases at New York University and Ezekiel Emanuel, a former Obama administration health adviser.Other members are Luciana Borio, vice president at In-Q-Tel, Rick Bright, the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Julie Morita, the executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Loyce Pace, president of Global Health Council, Robert Rodriguez, a professor of emergency medicine at the UCSF School of Medicine, and Eric Goosby, an expert on infectious diseases and professor of medicine at the UCSF School of Medicine.The coronavirus has infected nearly 10 million people in the U.S. and killed more than 237,000 as daily case counts continue to rise and set records. Biden campaigned on shepherding an aggressive federal effort to contain the virus and renewed that promise on Saturday night.While the task force and the transition team will be laying the groundwork for a muscular federal approach, the president-elect cannot officially implement policy changes until he’s in office.During the campaign, Biden released a plan to combat the coronavirus that said his response would aim to restore trust in the government, create a cohesive national strategy, make treatments affordable, provide economic relief to those impacted by the virus and work with other countries to stop the virus’ spread.His plans also call for a national masking mandate, though Biden has acknowledged that would be difficult to enforce outside federal property, as well as expanded access to testing and the development of a vaccine that would be provided for free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-elect-joe-biden-warns-country-of-dark-winter-ahead-with-covid-19-surge/story-f3qvZdyc7Sk62qtOwuHAqN.html
09-11-2020||World||Will take Covid-19 vaccine first to ease out safety concerns: Pfizer CEO||Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla on Monday said that he would like to take the Covid-19 vaccine, in development by the US pharmaceutical giant, first to ease any public concerns about its safety. This comes after the company announced that its vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 for those who had no evidence of previously being infected.Speaking during an interview with a US channel, Bourla said, “I would very much like to be among the first to get the vaccine but we need to see some ethical considerations. ““If we have a limited number of doses, I’m not sure if the government would recommend people of my age ... or work capacity to be among the first to get a vaccine. So, I want to respect that,” he added.“Covid-19 vaccine is likely the biggest medical breakthrough in 100 years when you account for the impact on health and global economy,” Bourla also said.Earlier in the day, Pfizer announced that early results from its coronavirus vaccine suggest the shots may be a surprisingly robust 90% effective at preventing Covid-19, putting the company on track to apply later this month for emergency-use approval from the Food and Drug Administration.Also Read | ‘Made me smile from ear to ear’: Leaders hail Pfizer announcement in Covid-19 vaccine developmentMeanwhile, Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top-infectious disease expert, hailed the vaccine findings as extraordinary and said, “Not many people expected it would be as high as that.”“It’s going to have a major impact on everything we do with respect to Covid,” Fauci said.Based on supply projections, the companies are expecting to supply 50 million vaccine doses globally by the end of this year. Up to 1.3 billion doses will be supplied in 2021.Since its outbreak last year, the coronavirus disease has wreaked havoc in the world and the global cases exceeded 50 million in a grim milestone on Monday.

The latest development in Covid-19 race came as a big victory in the race against the virus which infected millions and killed more across the world.US President Donald Trump hailed the results as “Such great news!” “Stock market up big, vaccine coming soon. Report 90% effective. Such great news!” tweeted Trump after equities and oil price soared.President-elect Joe Biden also welcomed the latest development and said it gives “hope” but cautioned that a long battle is still ahead. It “did not change the fact that face masks, social distancing and other health measures would be needed well into next year,” Biden said in a statement. “I congratulate the brilliant women and men who helped produce this breakthrough and to give us such cause for hope,” Biden also said.“This news made me smile from ear to ear.

09-11-2020||World||UK: 4 life-terms for Indian-origin man on stabbing spree||Carlos Vinodchandra Racitalal, who went on a stabbing spree in the east Midlands town of Leicester in January, has been given four life sentences to run concurrently, the local police said following a nine-day trial.Racitalal, 33, stabbed a 10-year-old boy, a woman in her 30s and a man in his 70s. In another incident, a five-year-old girl was hit with a car, the Leicester Crown Court was told. He was also found guilty of three counts of possession of a bladed article.He will spend a minimum term of 22 years and six months in jail, the court said in its sentencing order last week. The victims survived the attacks after hospital treatment, including the boy who suffered a slash wound to his neck and underwent surgery.Justice Linden said: “What has struck me about this case: had there not been such a thorough and prompt police investigation, particularly regarding the work done in relation to the CCTV, the defendant would most likely still be at large – as his victims were unable to identify their attacker.”Detective inspector Tim Lindley said: “Racitalal is an extremely dangerous man who had no concern, regard or remorse for any of his victims, who ranged from young children to an elderly man. Racitalal carried out his attacks with weapons including knives and a car, before then running away or driving off from the scene.”“My thoughts and thanks are with the victims of these attacks, for their bravery, patience and co-operation during an extremely traumatic time. I hope this court result helps in some small way as they continue to move forward in their lives,” he added.The family of the boy said in a statement: “Seeing our young child being attacked on that horrific day was like living a nightmare for us. It is something which no-one should ever have to go through.”“Life will simply never be the same for us. We do not wish for anyone to ever go through what we have been through since that day. All of the attacks which were carried out by the defendant were terrible and horrific for all the victims involved and for their families”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-4-life-terms-for-indian-origin-man-on-stabbing-spree/story-TbZPsHHq5OxN0GUuVbLoIL.html
09-11-2020||World||Biden’s win complicates Brexit matters for UK PM Johnson||Weeks before the UK finally leaves the EU on December 31, the election of Joe Biden raises two linked issues before Boris Johnson, the British prime minister the US president-elect has never met in person.Biden has met and worked with all British prime ministers since Margaret Thatcher, but has not exactly had laudatory views of the current incumbent in Downing Street, who he described in December as “a physical and emotional clone of Trump”.Proud of his Irish origins, Biden has made known his opposition to the UK leaving the EU. During the election campaign, Biden warned that he would not accept any deal that imperilled the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and peace in Northern Ireland; a position reiterated by his team soon after his election was apparent.The agreement, which is credited with ending most of the violence in the trouble-torn constituent of the UK, is considered to be at risk after the Johnson government piloted the controversial Internal Markets Bill in parliament, which, if it becomes law, would enable London to violate parts of the withdrawal agreement reached with Brussels.The bill has been passed in the House of Commons and is due to be debated in the House of Lords on Monday. Johnson and his ministers have insisted that the bill’s provisions are necessary as a safety valve in post-Brexit dealings with the EU.The second issue Biden’s win raises is a future free trade agreement with the US, one of the UK’s largest export markets. Biden was the vice-president when President Barack Obama came to London in 2016 and said Brexit would put the UK “back of queue” for trade talks.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Monday that Johnson should see the writing on the wall that he would not get the trade deal with the US if the Good Friday Agreement is imperilled through the provisions of the Internal Market Bill.The UK and US have what is long categorised as a “special relationship”, with close ties in areas of defence, intelligence and counter-terrorism. For the US, the UK also had a special role due its membership of the EU, but Brexit means it will no longer be able to leverage it to the US’ benefit.Johnson and other British leaders congratulated Biden and vice-president-elect Kamala Harris, with the prime minister tweeting: “The US is our important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-win-complicates-brexit-matters-for-uk-pm-johnson/story-ZoGDoHLecWetZudB7RytDN.html

The Pakistan foreign office statement on Monday came days after India’s protest against Islamabad’s decision to hand over management of Durbar Sahib Gurdwara in Kartarpur to a body without any Sikh representatives.Last week, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Aftab Hassan Khan, chargé d’affaires at the Pakistan high commission, was “summoned and our strong protest was conveyed”.“It was also conveyed to him that this unilateral decision by Pakistan is highly condemnable and runs against the spirit of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor as also the religious sentiments of the Sikh community at large,” he said.According to a notification issued on November 3, Pakistan’s religious affairs ministry handed over management of the gurdwara to a “project management unit” under the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), a government department that oversees shrines of the country’s minorities.The gurdwara was earlier under the management of the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (PSGPC). There are no Sikhs among the officials and staff appointed by the ETPB for Darbar Sahib Gurdwara.The Kartarpur corridor was temporarily closed on 16 March due to the Covid-19. “As the religious places started gradually opening up around the world, Pakistan also reopened the Corridor on 29 June 2020 with Covid related necessary health safety protocols. India has yet to reopen the Corridor from its side and allow the Sikh pilgrims to visit Kartarpur Sahib,” the Pakistan foreign ministry statement said.The Corridor, inaugurated on 9 November 2019 by Prime Minister Imran Khan on the eve of the 550th Birth Anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak, fulfilled the long-awaited desire of the Sikh community from all over the world, it noted. Kartarpur has a special significance in the Sikh religion, as the first Guru of Sikhism, Baba Guru Nanak Saheb, had spent the last years of his life in Kartarpur, the statement noted. It said that the Kartarpur Corridor, also known as the “Peace Corridor”, is a true symbol of inter-faith harmony and religious unity. The Sikh as well as the international community, including the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who while visiting Kartarpur described it as “Corridor of Hope”, has immensely appreciated this landmark initiative of Pakistan, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-kartarpur-anniversary-pak-says-india-yet-to-reopen-its-side-of-corridor/story-lsnYuN1aZojDLxvfNmjZ3J.html
09-11-2020||World||China declines to congratulate Joe Biden, state media cautious about victory||China on Monday held off on acknowledging Joe Biden as the winner of the US presidential election, saying the outcome of the vote was still to be determined and it would follow custom in responding.The Democratic Party’s Biden won enough seats to win the tightly fought election but incumbent President Donald Trump has not yet accepted defeat and has filed lawsuits against the outcome.“We noticed that Mr Biden has declared election victory,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a daily media briefing.“We understand that the US presidential election result will be determined following US law and procedures,” he said.The Reuters news agency pointed out in a report that in 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping had sent congratulations to Donald Trump soon after his election.Hu Xijin, editor of the nationalist state-run tabloid, Global Times, said in a tweet: “China hasn’t congratulated Biden on his victory as quickly as Western countries did.”“I think it’s because China needs to keep larger distance from the US presidential election to avoid getting entangled in its controversy. This actually shows that China respects the US as a whole,” he added.Relations between China and the US are at their worst in decades over disputes ranging from technology and trade to Hong Kong, Taiwan, human rights in Xinjiang and the coronavirus.“We always believe that China and the United States should enhance communication and dialogue, manage differences on the basis of mutual respect, expand cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit and promote sound and stable development of bilateral relations,” Wang said.Chinese state media, however, has struck a cautious note of optimism ahead of his presidency, saying fraught bilateral ties have a chance to revert to a state of predictability. Separate editorials in leading state-run dailies indicated that trade would be an important focus in improving bilateral ties under Biden while acknowledging that Washington was unlikely to ease pressure on Beijing on issues like human rights.The state-run China Daily, in an editorial headlined “Relations can be reset for the better”, said that there is to be “…a resetting of relations, the trade deal is clearly the point to start from.”“Despite the popular assumption that trade no longer functions as the ‘ballast’ for China-US relations as it has over the past decades, it is one of the last threads linking the two sides,” the editorial said, adding: “It is notable that neither Beijing nor Washington has ventured to scrap the hard-earned so-called phase one deal they negotiated.”The Global Times said the US was unlikely to ease pressure on China on issues such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong but added that Beijing should work to communicate with the Biden team as thoroughly as it can. The Trump administration had deliberately created tensions in China-U.S. relations, especially after adopting a campaign strategy of pressuring China, which led to “bubbles” occurring in U.S.-China policy, it said.“We believe it is possible to pop those bubbles. Beijing should undertake to communicate with the Biden team as thoroughly as it can, making greater joint efforts to recover China-US relations to a state of great predictability.” In terms of the economy and trade, Biden is highly likely to continue Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, but probably not with reckless gambling-style moves, the Global Times editorial said.“In the past few years, the US has adopted some clumsy measures that have hurt both itself and others…A change in administration might bring some pragmatic attempts of adjustment in this regard based on realities,” it said.Meanwhile, US politics and election continued to trend on Weibo over the weekend with related topics racking up hundreds of millions of views on China’s Twitter-like social media platform.“American politics is flavour of the day on Chinese social media since voting began in person Tuesday. By Nov. 5 the hashtag “U.S. presidential election” racked up 7 billion views on Weibo. Also popular are “Top online search in America on polling day is how to move to Canada” and “Trump and Biden supporters clash outside the White House” with combined views numbering around 200 million,” the news and business website, Caixin.com reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-declines-to-congratulate-joe-biden-state-media-cautious-about-victory/story-BA4Tgbnd3qbfwehd6Np5sK.html
09-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson pays tribute to British Indian Army of World War-II||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has paid a special tribute to the British Indian Army, the largest volunteer force in history that was put together to fight on the frontiers of the Second World War, for their immense contribution to the victory of the Allied Forces against Nazi Germany. In a message for the Remember Together campaign, set up to honour the millions of Commonwealth troops who joined the war effort as part of the then British Empire, Johnson said it was important to “remember their sacrifice and celebrate their achievement”.“In every theatre of the Second World War, volunteers from India, Africa and the Caribbean made an immense contribution to victory,” said Johnson, in a statement to coincide with the annual Armistice Day commemoration this week for war martyrs.“The British Indian Army mobilised 2.5 million personnel and became the largest volunteer force in history,” Johnson said.“When Britain embarked on the liberation of South-East Asia, assembling nearly a million troops in the 14th Army, the great majority of the soldiers in this magnificent unit came from India and Africa. Volunteers from as far away as Sierra Leone and Nigeria helped to release Myanmar from Japanese occupation,” the UK prime minister noted.“All of these courageous people chose to fight for freedom under the British flag. Their service helped to defeat a terrible evil and allow millions to live in peace and prosperity,” he said.The Remember Together campaign, a joint initiative by the Royal British Legion and British Future as part of the Together Coalition, has been campaigning for greater efforts to commemorate, teach and document the service of soldiers from Commonwealth nations in the Second World War.The Remember Together initiative seeks to address that imbalance, ensuring that the service and sacrifice of all those who fought are commemorated and helping to make remembrance feel relevant and inclusive to people of all creeds and colours in Britain today,” the campaign said in a statement.The Opposition Labour Party Leader, Sir Keir Starmer, also commended the bravery of the Indian troops ahead of Armistice Day, which is commemorated annually on November 11 – the date in 1918 which marked the end of the First World War.“We will never forget the bravery of the 1.5 million Indian soldiers that fought in the British Army in the trenches of World War I, or the allies we stood shoulder to shoulder with in the face of fascism in World War II. When we remember, we remember those of every creed and colour who gave their today in order that we could all have tomorrow,” he said.“While this year’s remembrance may look different, Britain will still honour all those who have fought for our country – from every village, every town and every city. But, thanks to the efforts of Remember Together, we will also remember that we have never stood alone,” he said.As part of the transformed commemorations this year, the UK-based Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is also calling on Indians to join a global virtual Remembrance ceremony to honour soldiers killed in the World Wars by naming a star in remembrance of someone and looking up into the night sky at 7 pm on November 11 to remember Indian servicemen and women.Through a virtual experience on the CWGC website, making use of the Commission’s existing extensive records and search facility, the worldwide public will be able to name stars after any one of the 1.7 million Commonwealth war dead in the CWGC’s care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-pays-tribute-to-british-indian-army-of-world-war-ii/story-pEGWKaRcsN7FKDXpEZ8azJ.html

The findings are based on an interim analysis conducted after 94 participants contracted the illness. The trial will continue until 164 cases have occurred. The preliminary results pave the way for the companies to seek an emergency-use authorization from regulators if further research shows the shot is also safe.Based on supply projections, the companies are expecting to supply 50 million vaccine doses globally by the end of this year. Up to 1.3 billion doses will be supplied in 2021.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump hailed the announcement as “such great news”. “Stock market up big, vaccine coming soon. Report 90% effective. Such great news!” Trump tweeted.Since its outbreak last year, the coronavirus disease has wreaked havoc in the world and the global cases exceeded 50 million in a grim milestone on Monday.

The assailants in four vehicles attacked the post in the capital’s southwestern district of Al-Radhwaniya using grenades and automatic weapons, the sources said. The Iraqi military said in a statement that a “terrorist group” of four elements attacked a post of a government-backed Sunni militiamen, killing four people and wounding three. The army and police forces have started an operation in search of the attackers, police sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-kill-at-least-11-in-attack-on-iraqi-army-post-in-baghdad-sources/story-TnxSTO0Mbn1tB8PzbHfiMO.html
09-11-2020||World||China set to oust Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers in fresh purge: Report||China intends to oust at least four pro-democracy lawmakers from Hong Kong’s elected legislature, HK01 reported, escalating its crackdown against the city’s beleaguered opposition.China’s top legislative body, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, was expected to consider during a two-day meeting that starts Tuesday whether the lawmaker’s actions violated their oaths, HK01 reported Monday, citing people it didn’t identify. The meetings were likely to result in the disqualification of Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki, Kenneth Leung and Alvin Yeung, the news site said, leaving the 70-seat Legislative Council with just 16 opposition lawmakers.China has taken a series of unprecedented steps to intervene in the affairs of the former British colony since a wave of historically large and sometimes violent democracy protests gripped the city last year. Since June, the Chinese government has imposed a sweeping national security law and extended the terms of sitting lawmakers to allow the local government to delay local elections for a year.Any move to disqualify elected lawmakers would underscore international concerns about Hong Kong’s autonomy just as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on a promise to defend democratic values around the world. The Trump administration earlier this year leveled sanctions against 10 officials over their roles in curbing Hong Kong’s autonomy.While the HK01 report didn’t specify the grounds for disqualification, the four lawmakers have been criticized by authorities for using delay tactics common in democratic legislatures around the world. All four had been previously barred from seeking re-election to the chamber, another tactic the government has increasingly used to silence its critics.‘Not Suitable’Hong Kong’s sole delegate to the NPC Standing Committee, Tam Yiu-chung, warned that lawmakers who engage in such delay tactics “are not suitable” for public office, the South China Morning Post newspaper reported separately Monday. “It isn’t good to use various means to disrupt LegCo’s normal operation,” Tam said.Such disqualifications raise new questions about the future of Hong Kong’s opposition, which has used the legislature as a platform to challenge Beijing’s agenda since the city’s return to Chinese rule in 1997. After several radical “localist” activists were among a record 29 opposition lawmakers elected in 2016, China handed down a ruling that led to the disqualification of a half dozen lawmakers.Two opposition lawmakers resigned their seats in September in protest against China’s decision to extend the legislature’s term by a year without an election. Several remaining lawmakers are also facing criminal charges related to various protests against the government, including seven charged in recent months with participating in a May scuffle at the Legislative Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-set-to-oust-hong-kong-pro-democracy-lawmakers-in-fresh-purge-report/story-DzPQl6MclMpGmBIeWA5XII.html

The farmers knew this (being kept at private police places) for the last three days and it has been confirmed by the Saturday returnees as well,” Malk Zulfiqar Awan, president of one wing of Pakistan Kissan Ittehad (PKI), was quoted as saying.He further said, “We will return to roads shortly. We are observing qul of the martyred leader Malik Ashfaq on Sunday (today). After that, we plan to call the meeting of the district presidents of the PKI and announce next round of protest. It is a fight for our rights and will be fought to the end.”Condemning the police for resorting to baton charge on the protesters, Ch Muhammad Anwer, chairman of the PKI, said, “We were simply demonstrating for our rights. All those who came to negotiate on behalf of the government expressed sympathy to our cause and agreed to our demand being perfectly justified revision of wheat support price to Rs 2,000 per 40 kg.”“We were demanding just a meeting either with Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar or Prime Minister Imran Khan to persuade them on the rationality of our demand. We still have not been able to comprehend why police were unleashed and unleashed with such ferocity. Both Punjab and federal governments must remember that movements for rights cannot be controlled or killed with the police force. The PKI is going to convene meetings of all district presidents to chalk out next phase of protest,” he added.Following the incident, farmers’ bodies in the province and civil society organisation have decided to support PKI in their protest.“The government has killed a farmer but still it’s not listening to farmers. I have been to three districts today, attending farmers’ meeting and have seen a very high level of anger among them. The soon government take notice of all four issues - pricing of wheat, killing of a farmers’ leader, quick release of those still missing and factors behind police atrocity - the better it would be. Otherwise, the farmers may return to roads with more determination and anger,” said Farooq Tariq, general secretary of Kissan Rabita Committee.

09-11-2020||World||India welcomes normalisation of ties between Sudan and Israel||India on Monday welcomed the removal of Sudan from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism and the country’s normalisation of relations with Israel. The external affairs ministry said in a statement that India’s relations with Sudan are “historic and special, and forged on the basis of shared values and close people-to-people contacts”. Last month, Sudan became the third Arab state to normalise relations with Israel, after the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The move came days after the outgoing Trump administration removed Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, in which the country was included in 1993. “We welcome the removal of Sudan from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and Sudan’s normalisation of relations with Israel,” the external affairs ministry’s statement said. Also Read: Sudan to normalise ties with Israel, announces President Donald Trump days before US elections“We congratulate the transitional government and the people of Sudan on the signing of the Juba Peace Agreement, and hope that these positive developments will usher in democratic changes and contribute to enhancing Sudan’s development, peace, security and stability,” it added. President Donald Trump had announced that Sudan was being removed from the terror list in exchange for the payment of $335 million as compensation for the victims of terror attacks on US embassies in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam in 1998 and on the warship USS Cole in 2000. However, the delisting requires the approval of the US Congress. The US, Sudan and Israel also released a joint statement announcing the normalisation of relations. The agreement for normalising relations with Israel also needs to be approved by Sudan’s yet-to-be formed legislative council. This council needs to be created under a power-sharing deal between military officers and civilians who have been running Sudan since the overthrow of dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. The US administration’s push for normalising ties between Israel and Arab states was part of a strategy to ensure the re-election of Trump. However, Trump has been defeated in the presidential election by Democratic candidate Joe Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-welcomes-normalisation-of-ties-between-sudan-and-israel/story-izGS7eyaOm1rW0FSVonegP.html
09-11-2020||World||For Biden, how to help mangled economy is next obstacle||Joe Biden will inherit a mangled US economy — one that never fully healed from the coronavirus and could suffer again as new infections are climbing. The once robust recovery has shown signs of gasping after federal aid lapsed. Ten million remain jobless and more layoffs are becoming permanent. The Federal Reserve says factory output dropped. Parents cannot return to work as childcare centers have shuttered. Restaurants and local retailers are draining whatever cash reserves are left--with many owners wondering if the next week might be their last. One in six restaurants was already closed in September, according to an industry survey.Biden will also be facing an American public with decidedly different views about their own financial well-being, with higher income families weathering the pandemic reasonably well and those earning far less in increasing economic peril. It will in some ways be a reprise of when Biden became vice president at the depths of the financial crisis in 2008-09, with possibly fewer tools and less political leverage to press an agenda to both corral the virus and stoke economic growth.He is expected to somehow inject enough aid to sustain workers, businesses and state and local governments, without necessarily having enough congressional partners who share his concerns. All of this could be the difference between a successful presidency and a floundering one. It’s unclear whether his victory was enough to tip the Senate to the Democrats — with two Senate seat runoffs in Georgia — and provide a clearer pathway for the money. This means that any efforts to secure another round of aid may depend on Republicans who were already voicing concerns about a rising budget deficit before the election.Senate Majority Leader McConnell of Kentucky previously said a measure should be passed before year-end, but it’s unknown in the aftermath of the election what a compromise would look like or whether President Donald Trump would back it. The longer that aid gets delayed, the greater the threat for the economy.“The risk is that the recovery goes into reverse,” said Gregory Daco, an economist for the consultancy Oxford Economics.AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 110,000 voters, found that the recession’s harm has mostly struck lower-income households, though most people were shielded in large part by initial rounds of aid that nearly totaled $3 trillion. Twenty-nine percent of voters in households earning less than $50,000 annually said they’re falling behind financially. Their misfortune is a sharp contrast to what’s happening for those with incomes above $100,000. Not only are higher-earners less likely to be struggling, but 26% said their finances are improving.Biden received more support than Trump from households earning less than $50,000. Voters in higher income households were more closely split between the two candidates. Among Biden voters, 89% said it was more important to contain the pandemic than limit any ongoing damage to the economy. This is likely because they see no trade-off: the economy will never safely recover so long as the threat of the coronavirus exists.“To get the economy under control, you need to get the virus under control,” said Amanda Fischer, policy director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank. “It’s the K-shaped recovery—we see a divide between the wealthiest and everyone else.” The economy was objectively hurting as ballots were cast, even if it has improved since April. The unemployment rate was 6.9%, compared to 4.7% when Trump took office. Retail sales slipped 0.8% since the start of 2020, with a collapse at restaurants, clothiers and furniture stores.“The labor market still has a long way to go to recover to where it was before the pandemic,” said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the job posting firm Indeed. “Employment is down in almost all industries, dramatically down in industries that depend on travel and large gatherings.” The nation’s top public health officials are warning that the virus is likely escalating — record numbers of cases have been reported this week — and are beseeching Americans to wear masks, maintain social distance, and avoid large groups, especially indoors. The worsening disease could force more businesses to close.Still, 43% of voters believed the economy was excellent or good. This includes about three-quarters of voters backing Trump, who campaigned on the idea that the economy was booming and would continue to do if he remained president. With Biden in the White House, these once-optimistic voters may suddenly switch and say the economy is troubled.“That’s what we saw in 2016 — a reversal by party in economic confidence,” Kolko said. “It was dramatic and very quick after the election. I wouldn’t be surprised if we saw the same.” Alec Phillips, an economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note Wednesday that control of the Senate will determine how much additional aid gets approved. He anticipates Republican control means a stimulus package under $1 trillion, but a Senate Democratic majority with Biden in the White House would push that up to $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-biden-how-to-help-mangled-economy-is-next-obstacle/story-P785rZEAwRqC4TbqxU4JXI.html

The U.S. mission in Geneva last week urged WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to invite Chinese-claimed but democratically ruled Taiwan to the WHO’s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA).Late on Sunday, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said the island had yet to get an invite to the virtual meeting of 194 member states. “The Foreign Ministry expresses strong regret and dissatisfaction at China’s obstruction of Taiwan participating in the WHO and the WHO’s continuing to neglect the health and human rights of Taiwan’s 23.5 million people,” it added.The WHO’s refusal to invite Taiwan based on political considerations makes a mockery of the body’s “health for all” claim, the ministry said. Taiwan is locked out of most global organisations such as the WHO due to the objections of China, which considers the island one of its provinces with no right to the trappings of a sovereign state.The WHO says it is up to member states whether to invite Taiwan, which has been praised internationally for quickly containing the coronavirus, to observe the WHA meeting. Backed by the United States, Taiwan has stepped up lobbying this year to take part, angering China.China’s mission to the United Nations in Geneva on Friday denounced the “distorted” US remarks on Taiwan, saying the island can only take part if it admits to being part of China, something Taipei’s government has refused to do. The WHO says it cooperates with Taiwan on various health matters including on aspects of the pandemic and that the island has been provided with the help it needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-says-not-invited-to-who-meeting-after-china-s-obstruction/story-HTewrLvLjxZl5Ya2QC3hCP.html

The country’s death toll currently stands at 49,044, after 156 new deaths were registered on Sunday.

According to Johns Hopkins University, Texas is one of the 31 states that has hit a record number of coronavirus cases this week. In Harris County, there are more than 167,000 cases and more than 2,300 deaths with the numbers climbing.“We have to remember we’re still in the middle of a public health crisis. Now, it’s starting to creep back up into the 8 per cent range and that starts to concern us,” said Dr. Umair Shah, the executive director of Harris County Public Health.The US is currently the world’s worst-hit nation from the pandemic and has had more than 9.8 million cases and over 237,000 deaths from the virus since the pandemic started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year.Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker reported more than 50.2 million Covid-19 cases globally as of Sunday.There have been more than 1.2 million deaths from the disease worldwide since the pandemic started. President-elect Biden in his victory speech assured Americans that his first task is to get the raging coronavirus pandemic under control with a definite plan that will be “built on bedrock science.” He also announced that on Monday he will form a group of leading scientists and experts to bring the pandemic under control.Indian-American physician Dr Vivek Murthy is expected to co-chair the coronavirus task force. Outgoing President Donald Trump has been accused of not listening to his own health experts on now to combat the deadly disease, allowing it to spread across the nation. Biden on Sunday on his transition website posted about his plans to fight the coronavirus. His initial plan calls for doubling the number of testing sites, investing in rapid at-home tests, creating a nationwide pandemic dashboard and mobilizing 100,000 Americans for contact tracing.His plan also calls for all governors to issue a mask mandate. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has already issued a mask mandate over the summer. It requires people to wear a face covering in public in counties with more than 20 confirmed positive cases.Dr David Persse, the city of Houston’s health authority, said, “We still have opportunities to get this under control and drive those numbers down, but that’s going to be left up to the individual, it’s nothing the mayor, county judge, [or] governor can do.” Persse said, “It’s painful when you have to have the governor lock things down. That hurts the economy, so let’s not get there. Let’s keep this under control with what we can do right now.” PTI SHK PMS PMS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-becomes-first-us-state-to-surpass-one-million-coronavirus-cases/story-Bq7e4AIH116UNvSfYNLY6M.html

The Phase 2 study will also evaluate how pre-existing antibodies against a specific type of flu virus in healthy people affect the vaccine.Beijing Wantai did not immediately response to a Reuters request for comment.Researchers in Britain are also studying inhaled versions of Covid-19 vaccine candidates to see if they deliver a localised immune response in the respiratory tract.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wantai-to-begin-mid-stage-trial-for-covid-19-nasal-spray-vaccine-in-china/story-R6D9DB7mfcgQgqlquddcFN.html

Australia is a major exporter of fossil fuels, particularly coal, and Morrison said many countries have made qualified climate commitments.On Monday independent lawmaker Zali Steggall introduced a climate bill to federal parliament seeking a net zero target, saying Australia would be “the pariah of the international community” if it didn’t strengthen its climate commitments.Meanwhile, underlining Australia’s frustration with the outgoing President Donald Trump’s “America First” policies, Morrison said Australia would welcome the US back to the WHO, and potentially the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, signed by Australia and 10 other countries in 2018.On Sunday, Morrison said Australia would also welcome the US engaging with the World Trade Organization, because the way out of a global recession triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic is “market-based trade, fair trade, under the proper rules through the World Trade Organization”.Australia is currently embroiled in a worsening commercial and diplomatic relationship with China, its largest trading partner.Australian exporters have expressed concern that Chinese importers were warned off buying seven categories of Australian products from November 6.Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said Chinese authorities had denied an “outright ban across a sweeping range of product categories”, and products appeared to be moving through Chinese ports at this stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-says-us-return-to-paris-agreement-who-under-biden-would-be-welcome/story-ZO1EkpVpKGByaWqCQ1CCJM.html
09-11-2020||World||A new role for Kamala Harris: Comic book hero||She will be the next vice-president of the United States but Kamala Harris has chalked up yet another achievement: Heroine of a new comic book published in Canada.The comic, in English and French, is called Kamala in Canada, and is based on the years she spent in Montreal.In a way, the volume by Winnipeg-based Kaj Hasselriis portrays what may be her very first foray into politics. “I did some research and discovered that, when Harris was a kid in Montreal, the landlord of her apartment complex ordered children to stop playing soccer. Harris objected to the soccer ban and, in response, organised her first protest! I felt it would be an inspiring story for kids, so Kamala in Canada was born,” Hasselriis told the Hindustan Times.Kamala in Canada was published just last month and has received plenty of attention and orders, with the Montreal Gazette calling it “an inspiring tale of perhaps her first political battle.”Harris was 12 when her mother Shyamala Gopalan, along with Kamala’s younger sister Maya, went to Montreal to work at the Jewish General Hospital in the city.The author based his comic version on Harris’s own account of that experience in her memoir The Truths We Hold, as well as media articles.Hasselriis started a series called Polikids last October as Canada had its Federal elections. In that instalment, Canada’s Leaders Tell Their True Childhood Tales, he looked at the lives of those like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Given the popularity of that comic, Hasselriis was asked when he would produce a sequel. “When Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris to be his running mate, I knew I had the answer. I was reminded that Harris lived in Montreal for five years as a kid, from the ages of 12 to 17. Those are extremely formative years for anyone, so I knew that her time in Canada must have been influential.”The book also riffs on how like her mother Kamala Harris had to “adapt to a new country, a new language and a new culture”, including the freezing weather and learning French.As it became apparent that Harris would be the next VP, sales of Hasselriis’s comic tripled. The book is targeted at children just as the series is as the attempt behind the project is “to help get kids engaged in politics.”A former journalist, Hasselriis said as a freelance reporter he was in Kolkata in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected President and saw “how excited people were that a person of colour was finally going to the White House” and can just imagine the excitement with the Indian-origin Harris assuming the second highest office in the US.Harris may well be unaware of this tribute to five years of her childhood since she was busy with the 2020 campaign , but Hasselris mailed a copy to her Senate office in Washington. “I hope she enjoys it!” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-new-role-for-kamala-harris-comic-book-hero/story-owJFPWKWgdZjFSuNEbqQsL.html

The country was recovering from a currency crisis in 2018 when the coronavirus pandemic hit and Albayrak’s stewardship came under much criticism.Before entering politics, Albayrak worked for Calik Holding, rising to CEO in 2007.He became a lawmaker for Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, or AKP, in 2015 and was shortly after appointed energy minister. According to some analysts, he was being groomed by Erdogan to be the president’s eventual successor.Timothy Ash, an emerging markets analyst at BlueBay Asset Management, questioned whether Albayrak’s health was the real reason for him quitting and suggested a “purge of Albayrak and his team.”Ash added that Albayrak’s close relationship with Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump’s adviser and son-in-law, was no longer important to Erdogan following Trump’s defeat in the US election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-finance-minister-president-erdogan-s-son-in-law-quits-post-over-health-reasons/story-FKAVm65E0RLI6MyqxxYrmL.html
09-11-2020||World||Eta expected to be hurricane and strike Florida Keys||A strengthening Tropical Storm Eta sliced across Cuba on Sunday and was aimed at the southern tip of Florida, where officials braced for a storm that could hit at hurricane force after leaving scores of dead and over 100 missing in Mexico and Central America.The US National Hurricane Center in Miami declared hurricane and storm surge warnings for the Keys from Ocean Reef to the Dry Tortugas, including Florida Bay, with the storm expected to reach that area by Sunday night or early Monday. Florida officials closed beaches, ports and Covid testing sites, shut down public transportation and urged residents to stay off the street. Several shelters also opened in Miami and the Florida Keys for residents in mobile homes and low lying areas. Broward County also shut down in-person schooling Monday and Miami seemed poised to do the same.On Sunday night, authorities in Lauderhill, Florida, responded to a report of a car that had driven into a canal. Photos taken by fire units on the scene about 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Miami showed rescuers searching what appeared to be flooded waters near a parking lot. Firefighters pulled one person from a car and took the patient to a hospital in critical condition, according to a statement from Lauderhill Fire’s public information officer. Responders were continuing to search for others.Eta had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph) on Sunday evening and was centered north of Cuba, about 65 miles (100 kilometers) east of Marathon, Florida, and about 90 miles (145 kilometers) south-southeast of Miami. It was moving northwest at 14 mph (22 kph).Read more | Donald Trump-to-Joe Biden handoff stalls as president rejects outcomeThe storm swelled rivers and flooded coastal zones in Cuba, where 25,000 had been evacuated. But there were no reports of deaths. Eta hit Cuba even as searchers in Guatemala were still digging for people believed buried by a massive, rain-fueled landslide. Authorities on Sunday raised the known death toll there to 27 from 15 and said more than 100 were missing in Guatemala, many of them in the landslide in San Cristobal Verapaz. Some 60,000 people had been evacuated in Guatemala. At least 20 people also were reported dead in southern Mexico and local officials in Honduras reported 21, though the national disaster agency had confirmed only eight.Pope Francis on Sunday spoke about the population of Central America, hit “by a violent hurricane, which has caused many victims and huge damage, worsened as well by the already difficult situation due to the pandemic.” Speaking to faithful gathered in St. Peter’s Square, Francis prayed that “the Lord welcome the deceased, comfort their families and sustain all those so tried, as well as all those who are doing their best to help them.”In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency Saturday for eight counties at the end of the state as Eta approached, urging residents to stock up on supplies. South Florida started emptying ports and a small number of shelters opened in Miami and the Florida Keys for residents in mobile homes and low-lying areas.Miami-Dade County declared a state of emergency Friday night and also warned a flood watch would be in effect through Tuesday night. Further south in the Keys, officials were monitoring the storm closely, but had no plans yet to evacuate tourists or residents. They urged residents to secure their boats and encouraged visitors to consider altering plans until Eta had passed. Eta initially hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, and authorities from Panama to Mexico were still surveying the damages following days of torrential rains during the week.In Guatemala, search teams first had to overcome multiple landslides and deep mud just to reach the site where officials have estimated some 150 homes were devastated. In the worst-hit village, Quejá, at least five bodies have been pulled from the mud. The Indigenous community of about 1,200 residents consisted of simple homes of wood and tin roofs clinging to the mountainside. Read more | Joe Biden’s long history with China is unlikely to mend Trump-era riftRescue workers used a helicopter to evacuate survivor Emilio Caal, who said he lost as many as 40 family members and relatives. Caal, 65, suffered a dislocated shoulder when the landslide sent rocks, trees and earth hurtling onto the home where he was about to sit down to lunch with his wife and grandchildren. Caal said he was blown several yards (meters) by the force of the slide, and that none of the others were able to get out.“My wife is dead, my grandchildren are dead,” said Caal from a nearby hospital.Firefighters’ spokesman Ruben Tellez said at least one additional person died in Guatemala on Sunday when a small plane went down while carrying emergency supplies to the stricken area. In neighboring Honduras, 68-year-old María Elena Mejía Guadron died when the brown waters of the Chamelecon river poured into San Pedro Sula’s Planeta neighborhood before dawn Thursday. In southern Mexico, across the border from Guatemala, 20 people died as heavy rains attributed to Eta caused mudslides and swelled streams and rivers, according to Chiapas state civil defense official Elías Morales Rodríguez. The worst incident in Mexico occurred in the mountain township of Chenalho, where 10 people were swept away by a rain-swollen stream; their bodies were later found downstream.Flooding in the neighboring state of Tabasco was so bad that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador cut short a trip to western Mexico and was flying to Tabasco, his home state, to oversee relief efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eta-expected-to-be-hurricane-and-strike-florida-keys/story-VWMM36fMXO8HMXgxFmppRI.html

09-11-2020||World||Republicans split on Biden’s election win as Trump refuses to concede defeat||Republicans are split on the projected win by President-elect Joe Biden even as President Donald Trump refused to concede defeat, claiming widespread voter fraud. Some GOP lawmakers were more accepting of Biden’s lead on Sunday, after he was projected the winner, while others leaned more into Trump’s narrative of voter fraud, championing legal challenges by his campaign, reported The Hill.Senator Mitt Romney of Utah is one of two Republican senators who congratulated the president-elect on his win on Saturday, although he said that Trump will ‘keep on fighting until the very end’.“You’re not gonna change the nature of President Trump in these last days, apparently, of his presidency,” Romney said. Moments after Biden was projected to be the winner of the US presidential elections, Trump refused to concede defeat, saying that the election was “far from over”, and promised legal challenges by his re-election campaign.Maryland Republican Governor Larry Hogan said on Sunday that though any potential evidence of widespread voter fraud should be released, but he doesn’t believe anything will overturn the projected election results.“There are legal processes if you think there are mistakes, but I don’t think we’re gonna see anything that’s gonna overturn this election,” The Hill quoted Hogan, who spoke to CNN’s “State of the Union.” Senator Pat Toomey also said that the news outlets were ‘probably correct’ to declare the winner of the election but stated that there was a reason why the count was done. Earlier, former President George W Bush also called Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to congratulate him on his election victory, while also congratulating Trump for a hard-fought election.Read more | Donald Trump-to-Joe Biden handoff stalls as president rejects outcome“They [the people] have spoken, and their voices will continue to be heard through elected Republicans at every level of government,” Bush said. Trump’s campaign has filed several lawsuits to challenge the results in a few battleground states after the president spent months spreading unsubstantiated claims that mail-in ballots could open the election up to fraud, reported The Hill. On the other hand, Senator Roy Blunt did not acknowledge Biden’s victory, instead noting that it was time for the President to present the facts, referring to allegations of voter fraud by the President.“It’s time for the president’s lawyers to present the facts, and it’s time for those facts to speak for themselves,” Blunt told an American broadcast network.GOP South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem asserted that Biden’s win was the result of ‘illegal activities’.Noem insisted that ‘computer glitches’ and reports of ‘dead people voting in Pennsylvania’ were examples of widespread fraud, reported New York Times.“When you break the process on which we elect our leaders, you will break America forever,” she said.“Every legal challenge should be heard,” said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader. “Then and only then will America decide who won the race.”Likewise, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina urged Mr. Trump to refuse to concede and fight on.“Do not accept the media’s declaration of Biden,” said Graham, on Fox News on Sunday morning. He called the election “contested” and urged: “Do not concede, Mr President. Fight hard.”Meanwhile, several Republican leaders and lawmakers, including Vice President Mike Pence, have refrained from making comments on Biden’s win, which has left Trump to battle against the election results without the full vocal support of his party behind him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-split-on-biden-s-election-win-as-trump-refuses-to-concede-defeat/story-5s2S0MrbYwbekyb2SCjUlM.html

While addressing an election rally in Chilas, Maryam said that the ‘turncoats’ should also be shown the way home, the days of ‘fake rulers’ have been numbered and the last push would be made on November 15, reported Dunya News.She also alleged that rigging of votes was taking place even before the Gilgit-Baltistan elections, and that people should protect their votes and prevent them from being stolen.The PML-N vice president added that the people of Gilgit-Baltistan are as strong as the mountains of Himalayas, and the people here have always supported the party in good and bad times.She claimed that development projects and the roads that pass through the area have been built during the PML-N era, reported Dunya News.Pakistan had earlier announced that they will hold elections to the Gilgit Baltistan legislative assembly on November 15.The Imran Khan government had earlier announced granting provisional province status to the region, which was not received well by the people of Gilgit-Baltistan, who have protested against Islamabad’s decision of integrating the illegally occupied region with the rest of Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-imran-khan-s-days-are-numbered-says-maryam-nawaz/story-HhNDZVkM9sOue9iOZqJcDP.html
09-11-2020||World||Joe Biden to work on H-1B visa plan||There will be much to cheer for Indians in the US if Joe Biden implements his action plan on citizenship, permanent residency and H-1B visas, used mainly by IT sector professionals from India.Biden will work towards providing a road map to American citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants, including over 500,000 from India, and will also establish a minimum admission number of 95,000 refugees annually.As a largely immigrant community, but in some cases with American roots reaching back generations, Indian-Americans know firsthand the strength and resilience that immigrants bring to the United States of America, according to a policy document issued by the Biden campaign.Biden plans to increase H-1B visa limits and remove country quotas for green cards, or permanent residency.Both these measures, if implemented, are expected to benefit tens of thousands of Indian professionals impacted by some immigration policies of the outgoing Trump administration.With Kamala Harris as his deputy, Biden is expected to reverse the move of Trump administration to revoke work permits to the spouses of H-1B visas, which had adversely impacted a large number of Indian families in the US.All these are part of a comprehensive immigration reform that the Biden administration plans to work on, either at one go or in separate pieces.“High skilled temporary visas should not be used to disincentivise recruiting workers already in the US for in-demand occupations,” said the Biden campaign’s policy document.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-work-on-h-1b-visa-plan/story-vzwSjyYtirVikzbd57nYAO.html
09-11-2020||World||US becomes first nation to cross 10 million Covid-19 cases as third wave of infections surge||The United States became the first nation worldwide since the pandemic began to surpass 10 million coronavirus infections, according to a Reuters tally on Sunday, as the third wave of the Covid-19 virus surges across the nation.The grim milestone came on the same day as global coronavirus cases exceeded 50 million.The United states has reported about a million cases in the past 10 days, the highest rate of infections since the nation reported its first novel coronavirus case in Washington state 293 days ago.The country reported a record 131,420 Covid-19 cases on Saturday and has reported over 100,000 infections four times in the past seven days, according to a Reuters tally.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The US latest reported seven-day average of 105,600 daily cases, ramped up by at least 29%, is more than the combined average for India and France, two of the worst affected countries in Asia and Europe.More than 237,000 Americans have died of Covid-19 since the illness caused by the coronavirus first emerged in China late last year.The daily average of reported new deaths in the United States account for one in every 11 deaths reported worldwide each day, according to a Reuters analysis.The number of reported deaths nationwide climbed by more than 1,000 for a fifth consecutive day on Saturday, a trend last seen in mid-August, according to a Reuters tally.Health experts say deaths tend to increase four to six weeks after a surge in infections.U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who spent much of his election campaign criticizing President Donald Trump’s handling of the pandemic, pledged on Saturday to make tackling the pandemic a top priority.Biden will announce a 12-member task force on Monday to deal with the pandemic that will be led by former surgeon general Vivek Murthy and former Food and Drug Administration commissioner David Kessler. The coronavirus task force will be charged with developing a blueprint for containing the disease once Biden takes office in January.The Midwest remains the hardest-hit region based on the most cases per capita with North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Nebraska the top five worst-affected US states.Illinois emerged as the new epicentre in the Midwest, with the state reporting over 60,000 COVID-19 infections in the last seven days, the highest in the country, according to Reuters data. The state reported more than 12,454 new cases on Saturday, the highest single-day number so far.Texas, which accounts for 10% of total US cases, is the hardest-hit state and became the first to surpass a million coronavirus cases in the United States on Saturday.According to a Reuters analysis, the South region comprises nearly 43% of all the cases in the United States since the pandemic began, with nearly 4.3 million cases in the region alone, followed by the Midwest, West and Northeast.New York, with over 33,000 fatalities, remains the state with highest number of deaths and accounts for about 14% of total US deaths.The United States performed about 10.5 million coronavirus tests in the first seven days of November, of which 6.22% came back positive, compared with 6.17% the prior seven-days, according to data from The COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-becomes-first-nation-to-cross-10-million-covid-19-cases-as-third-wave-of-infections-surge/story-7dcwo5GuLGvKEo2iwKKDkI.html
09-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Joe Biden, Kamala Harris say it’s time to heal||US President-elect Joe Biden called for an end to the “grim era of demonisation” and reached out to disappointed supporters of President Donald Trump, asking them to “give each other a chance” in a victory speech aimed unmistakably at unifying a bitterly divided country, saying it was “time to heal”.The President-elect also said he will announce a team of Transition Advisers on Monday to make a blueprint out of his campaign’s Covid-19 plan that is ready for implementation from January 20, 2021, the day he is sworn in as president.Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, who notched up a bunch of firsts as the first black woman and Indian-descent American elected to the high office, introduced Biden in a speech in which she spoke feelingly of her late mother Shyamala Gopalan Harris as the “woman most responsible for my presence here today”.“While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,” Harris said in her speech Saturday night.“...Now is when the real work begins. The hard work. The necessary work. The good work. The essential work to save lives and beat this pandemic. To rebuild our economy so it works for working people.To root out systemic racism in our justice system and society. To combat the climate crisis.To unite our country and heal the soul of our nation,” she said.Biden did not address Trump directly by name in his speech but did reach out to his supporters and voters. “To those who voted for President Trump, I understand your disappointment tonight. I’ve lost a couple of elections myself,” he said, adding: “But now, let’s give each other a chance. It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric. To lower the temperature. To see each other again. To listen to each other again.To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy. We are not enemies. We are Americans.” He returned to the theme of unity later in a clear sign of his priorities. “I ran as a proud Democrat. I will now be an American president. I will work as hard for those who didn’t vote for me — as those who did. Let this grim era of demonisation in America begin to end — here and now.”Biden, who is known for his ability to work across aisle, addressed himself to US Congress, which is a divided body. Democrats control the House of Representatives, although with a narrowed majority. Republicans control the Senate, but things could change because two seats will be settled in a January election. “The refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control,” he said. “It’s a decision. It’s a choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate from the American people. They want us to cooperate.” Biden and Harris spoke at a victory party in Wilmington, Delaware, amid honking of car horns — it was a drive-in rally — and much cheering. They were joined later by their spouses Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff, and their families — including Biden’s son Hunter Biden, who was targeted by the Trump campaign — for the ceremonial photo-ops, which were followed by fireworks. Biden clinched the race after winning Pennsylvania, the tipping-point state that had kept the nation and the world on edge as it took five days to count its votes, mainly the record high volumes of mailed ballots. Biden has won 290 electoral college votes — needed 270 to win — to Trump’s 214. But these numbers will change as the remaining states wrap up their counting — Arizona, Alaska, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina. Biden won a record 74 million votes, which is the highest number of votes won by any American presidential nominee. Trump, with 70 million, is second. These numbers will also change as remaining votes from the record turnout of 160 million are counted.Biden’s victory speech would have followed a concession speech or a call from the losing candidate, as is the practice. But President Trump has not only refused to concede the election but has accused the President-elect of “rushing to falsely pose as the winner”.Wisconsin and Georgia were headed for recounts, but Trump’s lawsuits, and those filed by Republican allies have modest to no impact thus far. Undeterred, the campaign filed another one on Saturday in Arizona, hours after Biden was declared winner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-joe-biden-kamala-harris-say-it-s-time-to-heal/story-qfOkJaB9r3VN0R6kt7RxkO.html
09-11-2020||World||Joe Biden’s India connection runs deep||President-elect Joe Biden uses every opportunity before an India related audience to tell them of his “great, great, great, great, great grandfather,” Captain George Biden, who was a captain in the East India Company, retired in India and had an Indian wife. He first spoke of this ancestor when, as US vice-president, he addressed the Bombay Stock Exchange in July 2013. He told the audience that when he was first elected a senator in 1972, “I received a letter from a gentleman named Biden… from Mumbai asserting that we were related.” The letter suggested “that our mutual, great, great, great, something or other, worked for the East India Trading Company back in the 1700s and came to Mumbai.” Biden joked to the audience, “If that’s true, I might run here in India for office. I might be qualified.” A few years later, in another speech, Biden expanded on this, saying the “Biden from Mumbai” claimed descent from a “British captain in the East India Tea Company. And he married, I believe, an Indian woman. And he settled in India”. He said a journalist had given him a list of five Bidens who lived in Mumbai. “I haven’t actually followed up and embarrassed the Bidens in Mumbai.”The King’s College historian and ex-diplomat Tim Willasey-Wilsey, in an essay for Gateway House in August, wrote “there are no records” of a George Biden. But he did find records of two Biden brothers who captained ships for John Company. They started out as third and fourth mates on ships running from Britain to India. William Henry Biden went on to captain a few ships before dying of stroke in Rangoon in 1843. His brother, Christopher Biden, captained his first ship in 1821 and made five return journeys between Britain and Calcutta. Each voyage was arduous but profitable and took a year to complete. In 1830, at the age of 41, he retired and settled near London and wrote a book about naval discipline.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-india-connection-runs-deep/story-6BzUPUdpQFTZCyCJqaju8I.html
