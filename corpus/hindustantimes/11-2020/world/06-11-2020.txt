The sanctions ban listed individuals from traveling within the European Union and a freeze on their assets. EU citizens and companies also are forbidden from providing them with funds.Protests have rocked Belarus ever since the Aug. 9 election, and more than 15,000 people in the country have been arrested. The official results returned Lukashenko to power with 80% of the vote and were widely seen as rigged, including by the EU. About 200 disabled people rallied in the capital Minsk on Thursday.In its sanctions listing, the EU said that President Lukashenko “is responsible for the violent repression by the State apparatus carried out before and after the 2020 presidential election, in particular with the dismissal of key opposition candidates, arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment of peaceful demonstrators as well as intimidation and violence against journalists.”The addition of Lukashenko and his associates means that a total of 59 Belarusian officials are subject to the EU sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-slaps-sanctions-on-belarus-leader-son-and-13-others/story-u3Zj9fthtInyKxgMUeNHOO.html

Several British companies operate in China.Minister for digital and culture Caroline Dinenage said, “The latest statistics show UK-China bilateral trade has exceeded the £70 billion mark for the first time and our digital tech sector is the fifth biggest exporter of services in the world”.“But we recognise the ethical, legal and commercial questions businesses face when they work in China or with Chinese businesses. The UK is determined to support our businesses to engage with China in a way that reflects the UK’s values and takes account of national security concerns”.The guidance sets out key issues digital and tech SMEs should consider as they weigh the benefits and risks of commercial ventures, as well as signposting specialist sources of advice. It asks those dealing with China to be aware of the country’s ‘Civil Military Fusion’, among other issues.Also read: Pompeo provokes China with a pinprick, revokes terror tag for Xinjiang groupOfficials said that the UK government’s concerns include China’s use of facial recognition and predictive computer algorithms for mass surveillance, profiling and repression of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and elsewhere; automated internet and media surveillance and censorship including in several new ‘smart cities’; and the planned use of technology in the Social Credit System to expand social control and limit individual freedoms.The guidance says, “When setting up your business you should consider the ethical implications of engaging with China on emerging technologies. While there are many opportunities, there is a risk that your company’s technology could be used to violate human rights, posing a significant risk to your business’s reputation”.“The UK Government is committed to upholding human rights and has serious concerns regarding the Chinese State’s use of technologies in ways that violate human rights and harm individuals and society”.“In addition, you should be aware of China’s programme of Civil Military Fusion. As well as ensuring that you are abiding by the relevant legal obligations, you may want to consider the possible reputational consequences if your company’s technology contributes to China’s military development”, it adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-revises-guidance-on-business-with-china-cites-national-security-concerns/story-KP0D1drk7KIPI3bmCTP77K.html
06-11-2020||World||Italy shuts down four regions as Europe tries lighter lockdowns||Luxury fashion boutiques, jewelry shops and most of Milan’s flagship department were shuttered Friday, as the center of Italy’s vibrant financial capital fell into a gray quiet on the first day of a partial lockdown in four regions aimed at stopping the coronavirus’s resurgence.The new restrictions — which led to closures of a patchwork of nonessential businesses — allow a great deal more freedom than Italy’s near-total 10-week lockdown that started in March, but nonetheless brought recriminations from regional governments that feel unfairly targeted. In particular, the south, which was largely spared in the spring, chafed the most, despite concerns that its weaker health care system was especially vulnerable.Italy’s move echoes those in many parts of Europe, where infections are rising again, but governments have been reluctant to impose the kind of nationwide shutdowns they did in the spring because of the terrible economic damage they did. For instance, many European countries have opted to keep schools open — making work easier for parents — while shutting bars and restaurants and many shops.Even the lighter restrictions this time around, however, are drawing stiff criticism — especially in countries like Britain and Italy where they have exacerbated regional tensions.Under Italy’s complicated 21-point formula, the northern regions of Lombardy, Piedmont and Valle d’Aosta and the southern region of Calabria, the toe of Italy’s boot, faced increased restrictions for the next 15 days, including the closure of all nonessential stores, take-out only for bars and restaurants, distance learning for students 12 and over and a ban on leaving hometowns except for work, health or other serious reasons.Sicily and Puglia, two other southern regions, fell into a second tier of restrictions, while the rest of the country maintained more freedom of movement but with a 10 p.m. curfew and restaurants closings at 6 p.m.In Rome, Italy’s health minister faced Parliament to defend the government’s handling of the new phase of the crisis amid concerns the government has too often bypassed lawmakers during the pandemic.“In a great country like Italy, this cannot be the field of a political battle,” Roberto Speranza said, noting that the criteria being applied had been in place since April without dissent. “I say this with all my strength and from my heart: Enough. Don’t fuel polemics.”Speranza said the lockdowns were a necessity as the number of confirmed infections skyrockets and deaths reach highs not seen since the spring.The restrictions took effect the day Italy hit a new all-time high of single-day confirmed infections — 37,809 — and registered the highest number of deaths — 446 — since spring. Lombardy’s latest caseload surged to nearly 10,000, accounting for more than 25% of Italy’s new confirmed infections on Friday.“Maybe people are getting used to seeing 400 dead. That number would have people petrified in front of their TV sets. Now people seem more indifferent,’’ Luca Zerbini, a lawyer drinking a take-out cup of coffee near the Duomo cathedral.In Calabria, the governor vowed to fight the restrictions. And some mayors in the Lombardy in cities that suffered in the first lockdown but are less hard-hit now have pushed for restrictions to vary by province and not by the larger category of region.Milan’s mayor, Giuseppe Sala, rejected such differential treatment within regions, which share a common health care system. “I invite Milanese to stay home as much as possible in these very difficult days,’‘ Sala said Friday.All was quiet in the city, where even the lines that usually form in front of popular takeaway sandwich shops — still allowed to be open — were nowhere to be seen. The hodgepodge of shops considered “necessary” includes hairdressers, cosmetic and perfume stores, florists, and sweet shops alongside grocery stores — but not ice cream parlors or pastry shops. That created the odd situation where the flagship Rinascente department store was open only to customers wanting to access the ground floor for cosmetics, the 7th-floor food court or the penthouse hair salon.That patchwork reflects efforts to balance slowing the virus’s spread with protecting the battered economy — and it can be seen across Europe. Many fear that businesses that suffered in the spring won’t survive new restrictions this time around.In France, bookshops have been shut, and Paris’ landmark English-language store Shakespeare and Company appealed to readers for support. And it got it, receiving 5,000 online orders in one week, compared with the usual 100.But even as politicians keep a wary eye on the economy, they are also concerned about pressure on their strained health systems.Luca Zaia, governor of the northern Italian region of Veneto region, said that the deaths in his region were mostly among people over 70 while most infections were among the young, underlining the necessity for people to observe new rules even in one of the regions with the lightest restrictions.“We are entering the most critical phase,’’ Zaia said, noting that if the situation worsens they will have to halt other medical procedures to find beds for Covid-19 patients.Germany’s health minister has warned of hard times ahead unless the country can “break” the rising trajectory of coronavirus cases, which has doubled the number of patients in intensive care in just 10 days and set a new record of over 21,500 new confirmed cases on Friday.And the French government is supplying quick virus tests to nursing homes around the country and to the nation’s biggest airport, Paris’ Charles de Gaulle. The tests are cheap and fast, but experts say they are also less accurate than the standard ones. Nursing homes in France, Spain and other European countries saw tremendous numbers of deaths in the first surge.“The second wave is here, and it is violent,” French Health Minister Olivier Veran warned Thursday night, while urging people to respect a partial national lockdown.In Denmark, meanwhile, more than a quarter-million people were put on lockdown in a northern region where a mutated variation of the coronavirus infected a mink farm. Although there was no evidence the mutation posed a threat to people, Danish authorities were taking no chances and ordered millions of the animals to be killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-shuts-down-4-regions-as-europe-tries-lighter-lockdowns/story-s4QQ2rsufvaOvb785DMBBL.html

The whole-city pilot may be rolled out elsewhere in the UK.A spokesman for Raab said, “The foreign secretary was today (Thursday) informed that an individual with whom he has been in recent close contact with has tested positive for coronavirus”.“In line with government regulations and NHS track and trace rules, the foreign secretary has taken immediate steps to self-isolate for the required period”, he added. Raab would continue to work remotely.People in Liverpool are being offered a mix of swab tests and new lateral flow tests, which could provide a result in 20 minutes without the need to send them to a laboratory. Test centres have been set up in schools, universities, offices and care homes.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “hugely grateful” to the people of Liverpool for their participation in this pilot, and set out the scale of Covid-19 challenge. “The challenges we face are significant across the UK. The average number of new cases each day is now 22,398, that’s up from 9,716 a month earlier,” he said.“There are now 12,320 patients in hospital, up from 2,602 a month earlier. 1,142 patients are now in mechanical ventilation beds, up from 369 a month earlier. Sadly 492 deaths were reported yesterday. The weekly average number of deaths each day is now 295, up from 53 a month earlier. That’s why new restrictions are in place in each part of the UK”.Also read: Pompeo provokes China with a pinprick, revokes terror tag for Xinjiang groupAddressing the country from Downing Street, Johnson ended with a note of optimism, telling Britons that there is “light at the end of the tunnel”, noting that health professionals now had better treatments and techniques to deal with the virus.“More broadly, there is also the very real chance of safe and effective vaccines. So taking those things together, these scientific advances can show us the way ahead”, he added.As of Thursday night, the UK had recorded 24,141 new cases – nearly five times the daily-rise in April and May – and 378 deaths. The cumulative figures were 1,123,197 cases and 48,120 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-testing-begins-in-uk-s-liverpool-foreign-secy-raab-in-isolation/story-sUOBieZAYrZ6kKrHSWOTvJ.html
06-11-2020||World||Pompeo provokes China with a pinprick, revokes terror tag for Xinjiang group||The United States has revoked the terror tag for the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an Islamic extremist organization that has been blamed by Beijing for attacks in its western region of Xinjiang. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo signed off on the order removing ETIM from the list of terrorist groups on October 20. The order was, however, made public on Thursday.The ETIM is a small Islamic separatist group believed to be active in Xinjiang province, home to China’s ethnic minority Uighur Muslims. It was founded by Hasan Mahsum, a Uyghur from Xinjiang’s Kashgar region, who was shot dead by Pakistani soldiers in 2003.The group, which was once alleged to have links with al Qaeda and the Taliban, however, continues to be designated under the United Nations Security Council resolution 1822.Pompeo’s decision is seen in the context of the Donald Trump administration’s sharp criticism of China’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang, formally called the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.Rights groups say China uses the ETIM threat as an excuse to impose restrictions on Uyghurs and discredit human rights activists outside China.Beijing frequently blames the shadowy group for inciting violence in the country’s far west, saying the group wants to create an independent state of East Turkestan in Xinjiang.As news of Pompeo’s order move emerged on Thursday, China’s foreign ministry insisted that the ETIM had long been engaged in terrorist and violent activities and posed serious threats to the security and stability in China, the region and beyond. “China deplores and firmly opposes the US decision… Fighting the ETIM is a consensus of the international community and an important part of the international endeavour against terrorism,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said.Dolkun Isa, president of World Uyghur Congress, the world International umbrella organization promoting Uyghur human rights, said China justified its mass detention of 1 to 3 million Uyghurs in concentration camps as a counter-terror measure. “Today’s revocation removes any Chinese justification that it is fighting terrorism in East Turkestan,” he told Radio Free Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pinpricks-china-lifts-terror-tag-for-east-turkestan-islamic-movement/story-u92WMdHBbyCzl0jKqI5ZmJ.html

They also exchanged views on the situation on the Korean Peninsula and discussed an agenda for a possible resumption of dialogue with North Korea,” the statement from the presidential administration of South Korea said.The three countries agreed that the trilateral security cooperation should go on “with no vacuum” regardless of the outcome of the US presidential election.The South Korean side emphasised the need to resume the US-North Korea dialogue as soon as possible.Representatives of the three countries also agreed to strengthen cooperation in the fight against the coronavirus and development of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-japan-us-security-officials-discuss-key-areas-of-cooperation/story-O1NeAvGUljAQ6xtmEnfyPK.html
06-11-2020||World||Developed countries inch closer to annual global climate finance goal||Wealthy countries have ramped up financing to help developing countries cut carbon emissions and cope with the impact of climate change, although it is unclear if they will meet their goal of $100 billion this year.In its annual update on climate finance for developing countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said donor governments contributed $78.9 billion in 2018, the latest year for which data are available. This was an 11% increase from $71.2 billion in 2017. The funds include loans, grants and a small amount of equity, plus private investments which public bodies helped mobilise. Developed countries agreed at the United Nations in 2009 to together contribute $100 billion each year by 2020 in climate finance to poorer countries, many of whom are grappling with rising seas, storms and droughts made worse by climate change.The $100 billion goal remains within reach, the OECD said, even though mobilised private finance, which totalled $14.6 billion in 2018, hardly increased from 2017-2018.“That means they’d need more public finance to meet that target,” said Simon Buckle, head of the OECD’s climate change division. “That’s not impossible, based on this trend.”With the coronavirus pandemic upending investments this year, the OECD said data were not yet available on how the pandemic has affected climate finance.“Developed countries haven’t yet delivered on their promise, both in terms of quantity and quality,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Nairobi-based think-tank Power Shift Africa.Adow urged developed countries to increase support for “climate adaptation” - such as defences against wilder weather, or methods to adapt farming practices during droughts and floods.Only a fifth of global contributions went on adaptation last year, while most support focussed on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries. The European Union and its member countries are, taken together, the biggest provider of climate finance to developing countries. The EU said last week it also increased such contributions in 2019, to 21.9 billion euros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/developed-countries-inch-closer-to-annual-global-climate-finance-goal/story-6XCRneI1KnFV6ieZESS15H.html
06-11-2020||World||Jacinda Ardern sworn in as New Zealand Prime Minister for second term||New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was sworn in for a second term Friday, as final election results showed her landslide victory was even bigger than previously thought.The charismatic leader and her ministers made their oaths of office in English and Maori during a ceremony at Wellington’s Government House.“I would say simply that sitting at this table is Aotearoa New Zealand,” Ardern said, gesturing to her gathered team, in which women and Maori are strongly represented.“They collectively represent a range of different perspectives, huge talent, enormous experience and, as you would expect in any time of crisis, a huge commitment to serving this country.”Ardern, 40, leveraged her success battling Covid-19 into an unprecedented majority at the October 17 election, leading her centre-left Labour Party to its biggest win since World War II.Final results released Friday showed Ardern won 50.0 percent of the vote, up from 49.0 on election night, giving her 65 seats in the 120-strong parliament, rather than 64.The main opposition National Party saw its seats reduced from 35 to 33, prompting campaign director Gerry Brownlee to step down as deputy party leader.Ardern said she had a clear mandate for reform, although her priorities were containing Covid-19 and rebuilding the virus-damaged economy.‘Incrementalist’ reformThe pandemic is one of a string of emergencies that tested Ardern’s leadership during a torrid first term, after she rode to an unexpected victory in 2017 polls on the back of a wave of support dubbed “Jacinda-mania”. She displayed both empathy and decisive action on gun control after a white supremacist gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers in the Christchurch mosques attack last year.Ardern again found herself comforting a shocked nation when a volcanic eruption at White Island, also known as Whakaari, killed 21 people and left dozens more with horrific burns.While praised for her crisis management, Ardern was criticised during her first term for failing to deliver on key promises such as improving housing affordability, protecting the environment and reducing child poverty.Since the election, Ardern has signalled she wants reform, but not at a rate that would alienate the centrist voters who switched support to Labour in the poll.“We must make sure we represent all those who elected us, be they in city seats, rural seats, general seats or Maori seats,” she told reporters Friday.She had flagged action on infrastructure projects including increased state housing and more renewable energy, as well as a determination to tackle issues such as climate change, poverty and inequality.Edward Elder, a teaching fellow specialising in political communication at the University of Auckland, said Ardern was likely to take an “incrementalist” approach to reform.“It really depends on what the Labour government thinks they can implement to create long-term change, rather than overreaching, facing a harsh backlash, and having National come in after 2023 and simply reversing all their decisions,” he told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jacinda-ardern-sworn-in-as-new-zealand-prime-minister-for-second-term/story-wmqAlvWVt4feIrknG2Y9aJ.html

Some briefly chased a man who held up a sign depicting the president as a Nazi pig behind a stage where right-wing talk-radio host Alex Jones was speaking.Also Read | Biden catches up with Trump in key states, prez vents steam againPolice intervened and broke up the altercation after the man and his small group of counter-demonstrators were surrounded by Trump activists, according to a Reuters witness. There were no reports of injuries.“They are trying to steal the election but America knows what happened and it’s fighting back,” Jones told the throng of some 300 people. “1776 is the answer to 1984,” he said, an apparent reference to the US Declaration of Independence and the dystopian George Orwell novel.Also Read | US Election 2020: Trump to explore more legal options as Biden inches closer to presidencyProtests have been scattered, small and largely peaceful since Americans went to the polls on Tuesday.Facebook Inc said it had taken down a rapidly growing group the social media site said pro-Trump activists had posted with violent rhetoric calling for “boots on the ground” to protect the integrity of the election.Biden supporters have adopted the slogan “count every vote,” saying a complete and accurate tabulation in the remaining battleground states would show the former vice president had won the 270 electoral votes needed to win.

PENNSYLVANIA PROTESTSBoth sides held rallies in Philadelphia on Thursday, where election staffers slowly counted thousands of mail-in ballots that could decide Pennsylvania’s crucial 20 Electoral College votes. Trump activists waved flags and carried signs saying: “Vote stops on Election Day” and “Sorry, polls are closed” as Biden supporters danced to music behind a barricade across the street.“We can’t allow the ballot counters to be intimidated,” said retired social worker Bob Posuney, a 70-year-old Biden supporter wearing a “count every vote” T-shirt as Marvin Gaye’s “What’s Going On” filled the air.Late on Thursday, Philadelphia police said they were investigating an alleged plot to attack the city’s Pennsylvania Convention Center, where votes were being counted. Police took at least one man into custody and seized a weapon. No injuries were reported.In Harrisburg, about 100 Trump supporters gathered on the steps of the Pennsylvania State Capitol Building on Thursday afternoon as part of a “Stop the Steal” demonstration organized by Virginia conservative activist Scott Presler. “This is not a rally supporting a particular candidate,” Presler said. “This is a rally fighting for two things: truth and justice.” He said in an interview that he planned to raise funds for an audit of the state’s vote count.Earlier on Thursday, a state appellate court ruled more Republican observers could enter the building in Philadelphia where poll workers were counting ballots. In Milwaukee, some 50 Trump supporters gathered in front of a city building where votes were being counted, blasting country music, waving flags and carrying signs reading “Recount” and “Rigged”.Roughly a dozen counter-protesters arrived after an hour, shouting “Black lives matter” and “say their names,” referring to the victims of police brutality. Others threw eggs at the Trump supporters from a passing car.“My country’s future is what brings me out here tonight,” said Mitchell Landgraf, a 21-year-old construction worker who cast his first vote in a presidential election for Trump. “I’m afraid if it goes one way that this country will go downhill fast.” At least 400 protesters gathered outside the Clark County Election Department in Las Vegas. Loud patriotic anthems blared over speakers as scores waved giant Trump and American flags. Biden has a lead of just over 11,000 votes in Nevada as counting continued.In Washington, D.C., a procession of cars and bicycles sponsored by activists from a group called Shutdown DC paraded slowly through the streets of the capital to protest what they called “an attack on the democratic process” by Trump and his “enablers,” according to its website.

Lam, who was picked as leader by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing members, was accused of being too close to the central government.China responded by enacting a national security law for Hong Kong earlier this year that has curtailed the protests, which were already dwindling because of Covid-19 restrictions on public gatherings.Han, one of seven members of the ruling Communist Party’s top leadership body, praised Lam’s government for its handling of the pandemic, easing the economic burden on the population, implementing the national security law and protecting the stability of Hong Kong.Lam was accompanied by several top city officials, which she said demonstrates the breadth of Hong Kong’s integration into China’s national development.She was heading to Guangdong, the southern province that borders Hong Kong, later Friday for economic talks on the Greater Bay Area, a region that also includes nearby Macao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-chinese-official-praises-carrie-lam-for-keeping-stability-in-hong-kong/story-AayNTrAMXEIuUo5bF2zmVJ.html
06-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Trump to explore more legal options as Biden inches closer to presidency||Democratic leader Joe Biden appeared to be a step away from winning the US presidential election as the latest count of votes from a handful of battleground states indicated that the re-election chances of incumbent Republican President Donald Trump are getting slim by the hour.By late Thursday night, Biden -- who bagged 253 seats as against Trump’s 213 -- appeared to be nearing the magical figure of 270 out of the 538 electoral college votes.In Georgia, which has 16 electoral college votes, Trump’s lead has reduced to 1,902 votes. In Pennsylvania, having 20 electoral college votes, Trump’s lead dropped down to 42,142 votes. With 213 electoral college votes, Trump is far away from the magical figure of 270.“We continue to feel very good about where things stand. And we have no doubt that when the count is finished, Senator (Kamala) Harris and I will be the winners,” Biden, told reporters in Delaware. While the counting process was going on, he urged fellow Americans to stay calm.“I ask people to stay calm. The process is working. The count is being completed,” the 77-year-old former US vice president said.At a White House news conference, Trump said he will go to court against electoral malpractice. The Trump Campaign has already filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Nevada. He has demanded recounting of votes in Wisconsin.“Donald Trump is going to court to stop votes from being counted. We have assembled the largest election protection effort in history to fight back and need your help,” Biden tweeted after Trump’s news conference at the White House.Trump alleged that the Democrats are stealing democracy.“Our goal is to defend the integrity of the election. We will not allow the corruption to steal such an important election or in the election for that matter and we can’t allow anybody to silence our voters and manufacture results,” Trump told reporters at the White House.“There is tremendous litigation going on and this is a case where they are trying to steal an election,” the 74-year-old president said. Biden dismissed the charges.“No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now, not ever. America has come too far, fought too many battles, and endured too much to let that happen,” he said in another tweet.According to The New York Times, major news channels ABC, CBS and NBC all cut away as Trump’s “false” statements mounted.“Biden’s path becomes clearer as vote count continues in decisive states,” The Washington Post said. In an editorial, the daily said, “There is zero — zero — evidence of fraud or corruption.” “What Mr Trump sees as nefarious is something more mundane though undoubtedly painful for him: He is losing. On election night in some states, he held a lead in partial counts. Then, as mail-in ballots were counted, his lead was ‘whittled away’, as he said. The explanation is obvious to everyone except, apparently, the president,” it said.The editorial further noted that Trump railed so much against mail-in voting before the election that few Republicans voted that way. “Most of the mailed ballots, therefore, favour Democrat Joe Biden. Now officials are counting the votes — with observers watching, contrary to another Trump lie; with both Republican and Democratic election officials participating, contrary to another Trump lie; and in accordance with the rules, contrary to yet another Trump lie,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-trump-to-explore-more-legal-options-as-biden-inches-closer-to-presidency/story-ufRxjR8AtGSPWX7OBlVTLJ.html

The Associated Press and Fox News have predicted that Joe Biden will win the state. According to the New York Times, Biden is currently leading in Arizona by over 45,000 votes. All eyes are on Maricopa County which will release the next update on Friday evening (IST). A win in Arizona could secure the presidential victory for Joe Biden.Biden catches up with Trump in key states, prez vents steam again• Georgia has seen a surge in mail-in ballots and according to the New York Times, Donald Trump is leading by 1,700 votes pitting him in a close race with Joe Biden. Georgia’s secretary of state office told the Associated Press that 18,936 absentee ballots across seven counties are yet to be counted. With a younger demographic and Atlanta becoming home to several younger electorates, Republican hold is loosening over the state. Georgia officials said that counting could go on until Friday evening if needed as ballots from US Army officials overseas need to be counted.US Election 2020: Trump predicts ‘lot of litigation’ in fight to keep his job•Trump’s lead in Pennsylvania has decreased by Friday evening, a state where he was leading by a huge margin in the initial rounds of counting. Biden is trailing by 22,000 votes in Pennsylvania with mail-in votes still being counted. Biden and the Democrats are trying to reclaim the three states Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania in a bid to rebuild the Blue Wall. Trump won all three states in 2016. Election officials have also said that there are 1,700 ballots which were found by them and they were being delivered for counting. Officials expect most of the ballots will be counted by Friday, according to the New York Times.‘They can try to steal from us’: Donald Trump fumes in White House press briefing• North Carolina could be among the last states to declare who has won the state’s electoral vote. North Carolina will consider receiving mail-in ballots till November 12 if they are postmarked on Tuesday according to the Associated Press. Though Trump appears likely to win the state, with 5% of votes still left uncounted there is a little chance for Biden to take the lead as more than 110,000 ballots and provisional mail-in ballots remain to be counted. The state will officially announce the results• Biden is leading in Nevada, which has been a Democrat stronghold for the last decade, by only 11,000 votes which means with mail-in ballots coming in there are chances that Trump could take the lead as more than 190,000 ballots remain uncounted. Nevada, like North Carolina, will consider receiving mail-in ballots till November 12 if they are postmarked on Tuesday. Nevada’s Clark County has also been the Centre of widespread protests by Trump supporters who have alleged voter fraud in the state. The timing of final count remains uncertain as mail-in ballots pour in resulting in a delayed outcome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-why-all-eyes-are-on-pennsylvania-georgia-and-arizona/story-4UrR8pYWKskuRyYM5fyljO.html
06-11-2020||World||Biden catches up with Trump in key states, prez vents steam again||Democratic nominee Joe Biden caught up with Donald Trump in Georgia, wiping out the US president’s early lead of hundreds of thousands of votes in the presidential election.Biden had slashed Trump’s lead in Pennsylvania by a few more thousands of votes as the president had raged in a monologue from the White House briefing room earlier at around 7 pm, “If you count the legal votes, I easily win,” he said, adding later, re-airing an old but unfounded grievance, “they are trying to steal an election” and that there was an effort under way to “rig” the elections. He made these claims without presenting any evidence.Daniel Dale, the CNN fact-checker, was aghast. “I’ve read or watched all of Trump’s speeches since 2016. This is the most dishonest speech he has ever given.”Even close Republican allies were publicly uncomfortable with the American president’s wild allegations. Chris Christie, the former Republican governor of New Jersey who had helped Trump prepare for his presidential debates, called for the president to produce evidence.“Keep the faith, folks,” Biden tweeted shortly after the president wrapped up his angry speech that was packed with unproven allegations of election fraud and showed an astonishing lack of understanding of the US election process. Mysteriously, he had said, his early leads in some states disappeared at one stage. Those were because of absentee ballots, which were counted later. It might have been a deliberate ploy, though, to muddy the waters.The race changed incrementally and surely in Biden’s direction all through Thursday, Day 2 of counting of votes. The former vice-president kept piling up his votes in Pennsylvania and Georgia, the former a well-known battleground state and latter a solidly Republican state that has not voted Democratic in a presidential election since 1992, when Bill Clinton won it in a three-way fight.As President Trump’s leads collapsed in these two states, he gained on Biden in Arizona, which some news organisations had already called for the former vice-president.The tally of Electoral College votes, which will decide the White House race, remained unchanged. Biden was still at 264 in Associated Press’s tracker, which has called Arizona for Biden, and Trump stayed at 214. They need 270 to win. The popular vote, which Biden leads by 4 million at this stage, is of no consequence.Sometime in the evening, with everything happening in counting centres, on streets and on television, Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s former chief of staff, injected a new element into the narrative. The president might lose this election but he will not go away and may make another run again in 2024. He attributed it to his former boss’s deep dislike of losing.The dread of defeat, however, had been overtaken by a sense of desperation in the Trump world. The president’s elder son, Don Trump Jr, demanded Republicans who would be on the ballot in 2024 to rally around the president and support his flailing re-election chances. His younger brother Eric Trump patronisingly thanked senior Republican Senator Lindsey Graham’s message of support for “having a spine”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-catches-up-with-trump-in-key-states-prez-vents-steam-again/story-S3C609LVJYv0XAJnoVdPlM.html
06-11-2020||World||Myanmar Election: Nobel winner Suu Kyi’s party expected to win second term||Myanmar’s citizens go to the polls Sunday in an effort to sustain the fledgling democracy they helped install just five years ago.There are about 37 million registered voters, though turnout is expected to suffer because of a recent surge in coronavirus cases.In 2015, excitement was high over the opportunity to end more than five decades of army-directed rule. The National League of Democracy party of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi roared to a landslide election victory, and she became her country’s leader after many hard years at the forefront of a non-violent struggle against military dictatorships that won international admiration.This year, her party is expected to again top the polls, but some critics feel her administration has failed to embrace democratic principles.Chances for real reform were always dicey, as the 2008 constitution drafted under the military assures it of enough seats in parliament to block charter changes. Key ministries are also under the control of the military.Critics accuse 75-year-old Suu Kyi and her party of being more concerned about entrenching itself in power than encouraging a broad-based democracy.“This time, neither Aung San Suu Kyi nor her party is bringing democracy to Myanmar. Instead, they are trying to bring in a one-party democracy system,” charged Khin Zaw Win, director of the Tampadipa Institute, a Yangon-based policy advocacy group.Enfeebling other parties has meant there has been little real debate about policies during the campaign. Myanmar needs a better political mix, he said.Even the voting process has become enmeshed in controversy, as the state election commission has been accused of conniving with Suu Kyi’s ruling party by canceling voting in some areas where parties critical of the government were certain to win seats.The Union Election Commission insisted the voting was canceled because of armed conflict with ethnic guerrillas in those areas.The decision was one of several points criticized this past week by Thomas Andrews, the U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar.Buddhist-majority Myanmar, he said, would not be able to hold free and fair elections “as long as ... the right to vote is denied based on race, ethnicity or religion, as it is with the Rohingya.”Long-standing prejudice against the Muslim Rohingya minority, whom many consider to have immigrated illegally from South Asia even though their families have lived in Myanmar for generations, has deprived most of them of the rights of citizenship.Western friends of Myanmar were shocked at the brutal 2017 counter-insurgency campaign by Myanmar’s army that drove about 740,000 Rohingya to flee into neighboring Bangladesh, drawing accusations of genocide.It also sent Suu Kyi’s reputation with Western admirers into a tailspin when she failed to restrain the security forces. But for most people in Myanmar, the Rohingya are not an issue in the election.Andrews also said opposition political parties claim they are denied access to state media and their messages have been censored for criticizing government policies.Measures to control the coronavirus severely restricted traditional large-scale campaigning by all parties, but Suu Kyi benefits from frequent reports in state media about her carrying out her official duties, and from her regular updates about fighting the coronavirus streamed on her Facebook page.Her administration had already been criticized by free speech advocates. It scrapped some censorship and licensing laws, but aggressively employs defamation and telecommunications laws against journalists and activists critical of the government and the military.Failure of much-touted plans to reconcile with the country’s fractious ethnic minorities is another dent in Suu Kyi’s reputation. Ethnic minority groups, mainly in border areas, have for decades been engaged in on-again, off-again armed struggle for autonomy.Ethnic political parties in 2015 worked out tactical agreements with the NLD to ensure victory against the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, the main challenger to Suu Kyi’s party.This year, disappointed with Suu Kyi’s failure to seal a deal expanding their political rights, they will be pushing only their own candidates.Nevertheless, Suu Kyi remains the country’s most popular political figure by far.“I think it is really the personal support, even love, that many people have for Aung San Suu Kyi herself, almost irrespective of how the government administration performs, how the economy performs and so on,” Yangon-based political analyst Richard Horsey said of her appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-election-nobel-winner-suu-kyi-s-party-expected-to-win-second-term/story-k4AtNVK178pNrVvWXrEptN.html

Besides, even as the Chinese staff is being paid in Yuan, the locals are getting their salaries in Pakistani rupees (PKR).“On Wednesday, the value of 1 CNY against 1 PKR was equal to Rs 24.02. According to the data of the salaries of 93 Chinese working at the OLMT project, the Chinese staff is highly paid. If the salaries of Pakistani officials working on the same/equivalent seats are compared with those of Chinese staff, the Pakistan employees are getting mere peanuts. According to data, a Chinese-origin deputy chief executive officer/CFO/director with grade L2 is being paid 136,000 CNY per month which is equal to over Rs 3.26 million. There were three positions and all were filled with Chinese. No Pakistani was hired on this designation,” The News International stated.While a Chinese official posted to the DGM rank gets 83,000 CNY per month, equivalent to more than Rs 1.9 million per month, Pakistani official Umer Chishti, who holds the position of DGM Equipment and Maintenance, receive merely Rs 625,000 per month.The News further reported that as many as 43 people of Chinese origin were recruited on the slots of technicians/train operators and each person is being paid 47,500 CNY, equal to over Rs 1.13 million.However, a locally recruited train operator/train crew gets only Rs 60,000.Giving another example of the disparity in salaries, The News International said while 12 people of Chinese origin working on the slot of train dispatcher/train crew are getting 57,000 CNY each, equal to Rs 1.36m, the locally recruited employees working on the OLMT project are getting much lower salaries.The Pakistani employees have demanded a salary hike from the government keeping in view the salary of their Chinese counterparts.Meanwhile, Uzair Shah, General Manager (operations) of Punjab Mass Transit Authority, has been quoted as saying that the morale of Pakistanis working at OLMT would not be down if they compared their salaries with their local counterparts. He added that the comparison in salaries between the Chinese and Pakistani employees cannot be made.

The former US vice president has so far bagged 253 votes as compared to 213 won by Trump, according to latest US media projections. To win the election, a candidate has to win at least 270 electoral college votes out of the 538 up for grabs. The incumbent president has claimed without presenting any evidence that there has been “fraud” in counting of votes and he will legally challenge the election result. “All of a sudden everything just stopped. This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election...Our goal now is to ensure integrity, for the good of this nation...This is a major fraud on our nation. We want law to be used in a proper manner. So we’ll be going to the US Supreme Court,” Trump told his supporters on Wednesday. Responding to a tweet on Thursday, Trump Jr said, “This is an important point! Everyone should be watching who is actually fighting this flagrant nonsense and who is sitting on the sidelines. Republicans have been weak for decades which has allowed for the left to do these things. Let’s end that trend once and for all.” He was responding to a Twitter user who wrote, “Where are the so-called future of the GOP? Nikki Haley is doing what?” In a series of tweets later, Trump Jr said, “The total lack of action from virtually all of the ‘2024 GOP hopefuls’ is pretty amazing. They have a perfect platform to show that they’re willing & able to fight but they will cower to the media mob instead. Don’t worry @realDonaldTrump will fight & they can watch as usual!” The 48-year-old former US Ambassador to the United Nations, Haley is seen as a potential Republican candidate for president in 2024. She also has the distinction of being the first ever Indian-American Cabinet ranking official in any administration. Haley, who had campaigned for Trump during the just concluded presidential election, later tweeted, “We all owe @realDonaldTrump for his leadership of conservative victories for Senate, House, & state legislatures.” “He (President Trump) and the American people deserve transparency & fairness as the votes are counted. The law must be followed. We have to keep the faith that the truth will prevail,” she added.

06-11-2020||World||Vladimir Putin may step down next year because of health reasons, claims report||Russian President Vladimir Putin may step down early 2021 as he has possible symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, reports claimed.Analysts have gone through the recent footages of Putin and noted that the 68-year-old president appears to be in pain; with his legs moving constantly and fingers twitching.“There is a family, it has a great influence on him. He intends to make public his handover plans in January,” Moscow political scientist Professor Valery Solovei has told The Sun. Speculations are rife that gymnast Alina Kabaeva, Putin’s rumoured long-time lover, and his two daughters Maria Vorontsova and Katerina Tikhonova are urging him to step down and take care of his health. The speculation comes at a time when Russian lawmakers have submitted a legislation that would grant former presidents lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution .At present, president can’t be held liable for crimes as long as they hold the office. A parliamentary working group, assessing Putin’s constitutional reforms, proposed to extend this immunity beyond their terms of office.Putin, who has been ruling for two decades either as prime minister or president, is slated to be in power till 2014. He has recently proposed constitutional reforms which could keep him in power until 2036. Nearly 78 per cent of Russian voters backed constitutional reforms, which also include a ban on same-sex marriage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-may-step-down-next-year-because-of-health-reasons-claims-report/story-OJiWWleZvaHbL2HXjHT5iI.html
06-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Trump predicts ‘lot of litigation’ in fight to keep his job||President Donald Trump is looking at a political map in which he might have to persuade the Supreme Court to set aside votes in two or more states to prevent Joe Biden from becoming president.Click here for full US Election 2020 coverageThat’s a substantially different scenario than in the contested presidential election of 2000, which was effectively settled by the Supreme Court. Then, the entire fight was over Florida’s electoral votes and involved a recount as opposed to trying to halt the initial counting of ballots.Trump’s campaign and Republicans already are mounting legal challenges in several states, although most are small-scale lawsuits that do not appear to affect many votes.Judges in Georgia and Michigan quickly dismissed campaign lawsuits Thursday, undercutting a campaign legal strategy to attack the integrity of the voting process in states where the result could mean Trump’s defeat.The rulings came as Biden inched closer to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House.Trump and his campaign promised even more legal action, making unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud.Speaking in the White House briefing room Thursday, the president launched into a litany of claims, without proof, about how Democrats were trying to unfairly deprive him of a second term. “But we think there’ll be a lot of litigation because we can’t have an election stolen like this,” Trump said, suggesting that the Supreme Court might eventually decide the election.Biden, for his part, has said he expects to win the election, but he counseled patience Thursday, saying: “Each ballot must be counted.”Earlier Thursday, a Biden campaign lawyer called the lawsuits meritless, more political strategy than legal. “I want to emphasize that for their purposes these lawsuits don’t have to have merit. That’s not the purpose. ... It is to create an opportunity for them to message falsely about what’s taking place in the electoral process,” lawyer Bob Bauer said, accusing the Trump campaign of “continually alleging irregularities, failures of the system and fraud without any basis.”Trump is used to suing and being sued. A USA Today analysis found that he and his businesses were involved in at least 3,500 state and federal court actions in the three decades before he became president.In one case dismissed Thursday, a Michigan judge noted that the state’s ballot count is over as she tossed the campaign’s lawsuit to get a closer look at local elections officials as they process absentee ballots.In Georgia, a state judge dismissed a case over concerns about 53 absentee ballots in Chatham County after elections officials in the Savannah-area county testified that all of those ballots had been received on time. Campaign officials said earlier they were considering similar challenges in a dozen other counties around the state.In Pennsylvania, meanwhile, the Trump campaign won an appellate ruling to get party and campaign observers closer to election workers who are processing mail-in ballots in Philadelphia.But the order did not affect the counting of ballots that is proceeding in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, as elections officials are dealing with an avalanche of mail ballots driven by fears of voting in person during a pandemic.Trump campaign officials, meanwhile, accused Democrats of trying to steal the election, despite no evidence anything of the sort was taking place.Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, in a call with reporters Thursday morning, said that “every night the president goes to bed with a lead” and every night new votes “are mysteriously found in a sack.” It is quite common in presidential elections to have vote counting continue after election day.Trump’s campaign has also announced that it will ask for a recount in Wisconsin. Stepien previously cited “irregularities in several Wisconsin counties,” without providing specifics.The Trump campaign filed a new federal lawsuit after hours Thursday in Nevada, alleging that ineligible votes were cast in the Las Vegas area, the biggest Democratic stronghold in an otherwise predominantly GOP state.The Associated Press called Wisconsin and Michigan for Biden on Wednesday. The AP has not called Georgia, Nevada or Pennsylvania.The president’s lawyers have asked to intervene in a pending Republican appeal to the Supreme Court over the three-day extension for the receipt and counting of mailed ballots ordered by Pennsylvania’s top court. Democrats in the state told the justices Thursday that they should put off granting the request because they “may well not need to hear and decide” the matter if Pennsylvania is not critical to the outcome or the late-arriving ballots wouldn’t make a difference.___Associated Press writers Jill Colvin in Washington, Ed White in Detroit, Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia, and Sudhin Thanawala in Atlanta contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-trump-predicts-lot-of-litigation-in-fight-to-keep-his-job/story-SRzUq0mB0jdeXMIDqYbxHL.html

He attacked the electoral process claiming that the ballot counting process was aimed at decreasing his lead in battleground states. He also blamed election workers without evidence and said that they were secretly supporting the Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden. US Presidential Elections: Click here for full coverage of the US Presidential race“Suppression. There are few states yet to be decided in the presidential race. The voting apparatus is run by Democrats in these states. We were winning at those key locations by a lot actually and then our numbers getting wheedled away miraculously in secret,” he said accusing Democrats of indulging in voter suppression.Here are the top updates for the US Presidential Election 2020: • Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and several other US states saw both Biden and Trump supporters hold protests against each other over the issue of vote counting. The Trump supporters gathered at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania chanted ‘Stop the Steal’ while Biden backers gathered in Philadelphia were heard demanding that ‘Every vote be counted.’• Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes), Georgia (16 electoral votes), North Carolina (15 electoral votes), Arizona (11 electoral vote)and Nevada (6 electoral votes) are expected to announce final vote counts. Donald Trump is leading in North Carolina but his lead has dropped in Georgia, according to the New York Times.

There has been no evidence of that.”• Pennsylvania Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar said, “The closer the race is, the longer it takes,” backing off on her previous statement that Pennsylvania could declare the winner in the presidential race by Thursday night, according to Bloomberg. • Nevada is yet to count 190,150 ballots and 90% of these ballots are in Clark County, Las Vegas, according to Bloomberg.

06-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Trump campaign loses legal fights in Georgia and Michigan, vows Nevada lawsuit||President Donald Trump’s campaign lost court rulings in the closely-contested states of Georgia and Michigan on Thursday, even as it vowed to bring a new lawsuit challenging what it called voting irregularities in Nevada.Click here for full US Election 2020 coverageIn the Georgia case, the campaign alleged 53 late-arriving ballots were mixed with on-time ballots. In Michigan, it had sought to stop votes from being counted and obtain greater access to the tabulation process.State judges tossed out both the suits on Thursday. Judge James Bass, a superior court judge in Georgia, said there was “no evidence” that the ballots in question were invalid.Also Read | ‘Have decisively won but there was polling interference from big media, big tech’, says US President TrumpIn the Michigan case, Judge Cynthia Stephens said: “I have no basis to find that there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.”Trump allies alleged that there had been voting irregularities in Nevada’s populous Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. A Trump campaign spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment on the Michigan and Georgia rulings.Votes are still being counted in all three states, among a handful of battleground states that could decide the presidency. Democratic challenger Joe Biden has a narrow lead in Nevada, Trump a narrow lead in Georgia, and Biden has been projected to win in Michigan.At a news conference in Las Vegas on Thursday, former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt and other Trump campaign surrogates, including former administration official Richard Grenell, gave no evidence to support their allegations of irregularities and did not answer questions from reporters. “We believe that there are dead voters that have been counted. We are also confident that there are thousands of people whose votes have been counted that have moved out of Clark County during the pandemic,” Laxalt said.He said a lawsuit would be filed in federal court to ask the judge to “stop the counting of improper votes.”Joe Gloria, an election official in Clark County, told reporters there was no evidence of improper ballots being processed.Bob Bauer, a senior advisor to Biden’s campaign, called the various Trump lawsuits a “meritless” distraction and said the strategy was designed to undermine the integrity of the electoral process.“This is part of a broader misinformation campaign that involves some political theater,” he said.“They’re intended to give the Trump campaign the opportunity to argue the vote count should stop. It is not going to stop,” he told reporters on Thursday. Election legal experts have said Trump’s legal strategy is unlikely to have a decisive impact on the outcome of the election. Trump has repeatedly said that he expects the US Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority including three justices he appointed, to have a key role. But it is unlikely the court would have the final word in any decisive way and any challenge would have to make its way through the usual court process, legal experts say.In Pennsylvania, where Trump is narrowly leading but Biden is making gains, the Trump campaign and other Republicans have already filed various legal challenges. An appeals court in Pennsylvania on Thursday ordered that Trump campaign officials be allowed to more closely observe ballot processing in Philadelphia, which led to a brief delay in the count.Pennsylvania Democrats on Thursday filed papers in the US Supreme Court saying although they would not oppose the Trump campaign’s bid to intervene in a pending appeal in which Republicans seek to block late-arriving mail-in ballots in the state, it was premature for the court to act on the motion.

06-11-2020||World||UN to commemorate all victims of World War II on December 1||The U.N. General Assembly decided Thursday to hold a meeting on December 1 to commemorate all victims of World War II, which ended 75 years ago.The Russian-drafted resolution was adopted by consensus after the 193-member assembly voted 54-40 with 45 abstention to eliminate a paragraph in the text that Germany, the U.S. and many European and Western nations objected to.It emphasized that victory in the war “is the common legacy” of all U.N. member nations. And it noted the importance of preserving and not desecrating or destroying “monuments erected in remembrance of those who fought in that war on the side of the United Nations.”Germany, which sponsored the amendment with three dozen co-sponsors, said it introduced the measure to eliminate the controversial paragraph because it politicized the resolution and didn’t promote its main aim of commemorating victims of the war.Ina Heusgen, the country’s legal adviser, said Germany was forced to do this because Russia “ignored” European Union efforts to edit the draft resolution and reach consensus.The language in the paragraph “is highly sensitive for many member states as the Second World War brought about painful divisions in Europe,” she said. “We cannot change this memory 75 years later.”World War II is considered the deadliest conflict in history, involving the vast majority of countries and leading to the deaths of an estimated 70 million to 85 million people -- the majority of them civilians including those who perished in the Nazi Holocaust. It began with Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939 and ended with Japan’s surrender in 1945 after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States.The former Soviet Union was part of a military alliance with the United States, Britain and other Western nation that fought the Axis alliance of Germany, Italy and Japan.Russia accepted a U.S. amendment saying that “2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, a war which brought untold sorrow to humankind, particularly in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Pacific and other parts of the world.” It expanded the Russian draft which only singled out Europe and Asia.The resolution asks General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir “to hold a special solemn meeting of the General Assembly on Dec. 1, 2020 in commemoration of all victims of the war.”It also asks all U.N. member states, U.N. bodies, non-governmental organizations and individuals to pay tribute to all victims of the war “in an appropriate manner.”The resolution underlines progress in overcoming the war’s legacy “and towards reconciliation, international and regional cooperation and the promotion of democratic values, human rights and fundamental freedoms,” in particular through the United Nations which was established on the ashes of World War II and regional organizations.The measure calls on U.N. member states “to make every effort to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-to-commemorate-all-victims-of-world-war-ii-on-december-1/story-udesJh7I5QH60OKebDB5lK.html
06-11-2020||World||In troubling new high-water mark, US tops 100,000 Covid-19 cases in single day||The US topped 100,000 coronavirus cases, a troubling new high-water mark as the country faces the prospect of a sustained increase in illnesses and deaths over the coming months.As of Thursday at 6:30 p.m. New York time, 106,414 cases had been reported in the country, bringing the total to 9.6 million, according to John Hopkins University Data compiled by Bloomberg. The number of new infections has been surging across the country, including in many of the battleground states in the Midwest that were expected to play a critical role in the still-undecided presidential election.Even as the number of cases has surged, testing is growing more slowly. According to the Covid Tracking Project, in the week through Nov. 4, new cases increased 7.1%, while tests increased 6.2%.The number of deaths from Covid-19 is also on the climb, topping 1,000 for the third day in a row on Thursday. While mortality rates remain lower than in the initial phase of the pandemic in the spring, the overall number of deaths is likely to follow the number of cases higher as infections accelerate. Deaths tend to lag infection trends by several weeks.Epidemiologists have been warning for some time that the U.S. could see a marked increase in infections during the colder months. New cases are also jumping in Europe, where leaders have taken measures to lock down economic activity and try to avert crippling health-care systems. There has been little talk of similar measures in America, however, even as many hospitals are bracing for an expected influx of Covid-19 patients in the weeks ahead.Governors from states including New York, New Jersey and Ohio raised further concerns Thursday of more infections, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said earlier in the day the recent increase in cases is “particularly concerning.”The surge is playing out as scientists race to develop viable vaccines, an effort that has been set back at times as some clinical trials were paused for safety concerns. And while there are an expanding array of treatment options available to doctors, including recently approved antiviral therapy remdesivir, other highly touted therapies are likely to be in more limited supply even once they receive clearance from regulators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-troubling-new-high-water-mark-us-tops-100-000-covid-19-cases-in-single-day/story-mbDMIr23m5csI1xpuLIJXJ.html

Donald Trump alleged that if the legal votes were counted then he is the winner. He alleged that there was voter fraud and said Democrats ensured that votes that were cast for Donald Trump remain uncounted. Click here for the complete coverage of the US elections“If you count the legal votes I easily win, they used illegal votes to steal the election from us,” said Donald Trump. He also said that the media falsely propagated the idea that there was a ‘Blue Wave’. He said Democrats were not able to create any such wave and claimed he has won the elections fairly. “There was election interference in the truest sense of the word, there were powerful special interests. There were phony polls to keep voters inside and create the illusion of momentum for Mr Biden and diminish Republican’s ability to raise funds,” Trump alleged. He also called the exit polls broadcasted by several news networks ‘suppression polls’.He said that the Republican party represents the American people and stands as a symbol for inclusion and said ‘Big Money, Big Tech and Big Media’ were backing the Democrats during the entire election process. “Suppression. There are few states yet to be decided in the presidential race. The voting apparatus is run by Democrats in these states. We were winning at those key locations by a lot actually and then our numbers getting wheedled away miraculously in secret,” he said accusing Democrats of indulging in voter suppression. He also said that his campaign team has filed several litigation against the electoral process while alleging that Republican poll observers were kept away from counting centres. The counting process across ballot-counting centres has been live streamed the entire time during the US presidential elections. He also said that the mail-in voting system is ‘corrupt’ and claimed that it ‘totally destroyed the voting system.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-have-decisively-won-but-there-was-election-interference-from-big-media-and-big-tech-says-us-president-donald-trump/story-sSRFZxFLDYbd8KU0CJzu2O.html
