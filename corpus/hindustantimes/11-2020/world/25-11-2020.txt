The annual figure is more than twice the amount raised during the peak of the global financial crisis and compares with analyst estimates of 482.8 billion pounds, according to a Bloomberg survey of 12 primary dealers.The surge in borrowing reflects the mounting cost of widespread lockdowns, which have shuttered businesses, kept workers at home and tipped the economy into its deepest recession in three centuries. It will also add to the government’s two-trillion-pound debt load and risks weighing on the market.“The UK economy is on a large amount of life support right now,” said Liam O’Donnell, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, before the announcement. “A modest rise in yield is fine, anything else is effectively a short circuit to activity while the economy still reels from the crisis.”For now, the surge in debt sales hasn’t pushed government borrowing costs higher, thanks largely to the Bank of England’s bond-buying program. The yield on 10-year gilts fell one basis point to 0.32%, having more than halved this year as the central bank soaked up the issuance.The BOE expanded its so-called quantitative easing program this month by 150 billion pounds to 895 billion pounds.With a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc found to be highly effective -- along with those from Pfizer Inc, and Moderna Inc. -- and a Brexit trade deal getting closer, economic prospects for 2021 could be in for a boost. The nation’s deficit grew less than expected in October, data showed last week.The DM0 is set to sell 393.6 billion pounds of bonds in the fiscal year through November, 8.6 billion pounds more than initially planned, it said. It raised 228 billion pounds during peak of the financial the crisis in 2009-2010.The Office for Budget Responsibility, meanwhile, said that the UK would bring the methods of maligned Retail Price Index gauge of inflation in line with the CPIH measure in February 2030.The switch to the new benchmark, which has shown consistently slower price increases since 2010, threatened to erode future returns on the inflation-linked bonds. The government said it wouldn’t offer compensation to holders of the securities.The 10-year breakeven rate jumped as much as 9 basis points to 3.09%, set of its biggest increase since 2017.Still, “long linkers should gradually start to feel the benefit of renewed demand,” said Adam Dent, UK rates strategist at Banco Santander SA. There is now “certainty around what ‘RPI’ will mean in any given year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-648-billion-debt-sale-plan-more-than-double-last-record/story-93zsVNxW8JVgsHvRLiMU1K.html
25-11-2020||World||Hungarian, Polish PMs to discuss EU budget veto||Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki will hold talks in Budapest Thursday on their recent EU budget veto over the planned link of funding to rule of law criteria.The EU’s 1.8-trillion-euro ($2.1 trillion) budget and coronavirus rescue package were vetoed last week by the two countries, both accused by Brussels of rolling back democratic freedoms.The talks between the two leaders were confirmed to the Hungarian state newswire MTI by Orban’s press officer Wednesday.“The meeting’s agenda is expected to include the MFF as Poland and Hungary intend to coordinate EU Budget negotiating positions,” said a message by the Permanent Representation of Poland to the EU on Twitter, referring to the bloc’s multi-annual financial framework (MFF) or long-term budget.Morawiecki said after the veto that a “European oligarchy” was trying to bully weaker EU members, while Orban called the conditionality plan a politically motivated “weapon” and a form of “blackmail” against member states opposed to immigration.EU leaders have since intensified efforts to convince Orban and Morawiecki to drop their veto, which has plunged the bloc into a new crisis threatening joint efforts to fight the epidemic.While the veto was not a complete surprise, the stand-off angered EU partners, with many keenly awaiting payouts from the stimulus to help fix economies shattered by the pandemic with worse feared yet to come.But the rule-of law issue is hugely sensitive for both Warsaw and Budapest. Poland is already subject to an EU investigative procedure over its efforts to trim the independence of the judiciary, as is Hungary for an erosion of democratic norms, such as press freedom, under Orban’s rule.“Many types of solutions are possible, it’s just a question of political will,” Orban said on Friday. Acceptable solutions for Hungary and Poland “would be those reached on the basis of legal standpoints rather than the political majority,” he told Hungarian public media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungarian-polish-pms-to-discuss-eu-budget-veto/story-5ZFUdvN4TZPZC0RBdybN0L.html
25-11-2020||World||Japan, China agree on economic ties, split over islands||China’s top diplomat told Japan’s leader on Wednesday that Beijing wants the two Asian powers to have good relations and cooperate in fighting the coronavirus and reviving their pandemic-hit economies, but the two sides remained at odds over an island dispute.Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a message from Chinese President Xi Jinping expressing his hope of developing positive relations with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and “strengthen cooperation with Japan in pandemic measures and for the economic recovery,” Wang told reporters after meeting with Suga.Wang told Suga that ties between the two countries have improved through high-level dialogue and mutual efforts and that China wants to cooperate further in a range of areas.“A stable relationship between the two countries is important not only for Japan and China but also for the region and the international community, and I would like to fulfill our responsibilities together,” Suga said during his talks with Wang.Wang’s visit came as Japan is actively promoting military and economic partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China’s rise, which Japan considers a security threat. Beijing has criticized the move as an attempt to create an “Asian NATO.”Often-thorny relations between the two countries have improved in recent years as China’s trade dispute with the U.S. has escalated, but territorial disputes continue to strain ties.Suga reminded Wang of Japan’s claim over Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands and raised concern about China’s growing activity in the area. Chinese coast guard ships have stepped up activity around the islands despite protests and warnings by Japan.Japan says the islands belong to it historically and under international law and that China started claiming them only after undersea oil reserves were found in the area in the 1970s.Earlier Wednesday, Japan protested the increased Chinese activity and what it called infiltration around the islands.Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said the government protested after Chinese ships entered Japan’s contiguous zone, just outside its territorial waters, for the 306th time this year, including 20 cases of territorial violations.“The situation is extremely serious,” Kato told reporters after meeting with Wang.The Chinese ships entered the zone only a day after both sides agreed to avoid provocative actions in the contested area, he said.On Tuesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Wang agreed to try not to escalate tensions over the islands.Wang was firm about China’s right to defend its sovereignty, and accused Japanese authorities of sending “fake” fishing boats into the area to interfere with the Chinese side. Japan has said Chinese ships threatened the safety of the Japanese fishing boats.“We hope that both sides can calmly deal with it so that it will not affect the current hard-won improvement of Sino-Japanese relations and the future development of bilateral relations,” Wang said.The two foreign ministers agreed to resume business travel between the world’s second and third largest economies through a “business track” program that will allow visitors to engage in limited activities during their 14-day quarantine periods. They also agreed to work together on climate change, energy conservation, health care and digital commerce as part of their economic cooperation.It was the first trip to Japan by a top Chinese official since the February visit of Chinese foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi. Officials said the two sides did not discuss a rescheduling of Xi’s state visit to Japan, postponed from the spring due to the pandemic.After his visit to Japan, Wang heads for meetings in South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-china-agree-on-economic-ties-split-over-islands/story-Z5RC1upkEGIr7og52CVmuM.html
25-11-2020||World||UAE halts visas to citizens of 13 mostly Muslim states including Pakistan||The United Arab Emirates has stopped issuing new visas to citizens of 13 mostly Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to a document issued by a state-owned business park.A source briefed on the matter told Reuters the visas had temporarily stopped being issued to Afghans, Pakistanis and citizens of several other countries over security concerns, but did not provide details of those concerns. The document, sent to companies operating in the park and seen by Reuters, cited an immigration circular that came into effect on November 18.The document said applications for new employment and visit visas had been suspended for nationals - those outside the UAE - of 13 countries that also included Somalia, Libya and Yemen until further notice.The ban also applies to citizens of Algeria, Kenya, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey, it says.It was not clear if there were any exceptions to the ban.The UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.The circular took effect a week after the French Embassy in the UAE urged its citizens to maintain vigilance after a bomb attack in Saudi Arabia on diplomats claimed by Islamic State.The explosion, which occurred during a World War One commemoration ceremony in Jeddah, was the first attack in years where explosives were used in an attempt to hit foreigners in the conservative kingdom.The visa ban also comes two months after the Gulf state established formal ties with Israel, a move that broke with decades of Arab policy and angered some Muslim states and communities. Others welcomed it. Still, the source familiar with the matter said the ban was unrelated to the UAE’s relationship with Israel and was expected to last only for a brief period. A diplomat commented that the UAE had strained relations with some of the states listed, such as Turkey.Last week, Pakistan’s foreign ministry said the UAE had stopped processing new visas for its citizens and those of some other countries, but that those already holding valid visas were not affected and could still enter the UAE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-halts-new-visas-to-citizens-of-13-mostly-muslim-states-document/story-Twea3dbGsLu2mguLtX0HtO.html
25-11-2020||World||Germany, Bhutan establish full-fledged diplomatic ties||Bhutan and Germany established full-fledged diplomatic relations on Wednesday during a ceremony held in the Bhutanese mission in New Delhi. The two sides have had consular relations since July 2000, and Germany’s envoy to India, Walter Lindner, and Bhutanese ambassador, V Namgyel, exchanged notes verbale on the establishment of diplomatic relations. Bhutan now has diplomatic relations with 53 countries and the European Union. However, there are no immediate plans for Bhutan and Germany to open embassies in each other’s capitals. Bhutan’s capital Thimphu hosts only three foreign missions – those of India, Bangladesh and Kuwait. The Indian side welcomed the development, and people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the proposal on full-fledged diplomatic ties had been in the pipeline for some time. “We have noted that Bhutan and Germany have established formal diplomatic relations through their embassies in New Delhi. Germany is an important development partner of Bhutan. This is a further step on that path,” one of the people cited above said. The German foreign ministry said the country’s ambassador in New Delhi will be accredited for Bhutan too, and maintain relations from across the border. Bhutan’s embassy in New Delhi is a “connection [that] has been used for dialogue with Germany in the past”, it said. “With the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries will now be able to collaborate more closely than ever before,” the German foreign ministry added. During Wednesday’s ceremony, Lindner and Namgyal exchanged views on mutual cooperation and expressed the desire of their governments to work closely in areas of mutual benefit, Bhutan’s foreign ministry said. The two ambassadors also “expressed the desire to further deepen the friendship and cooperation between the two countries”, it said. Petra Sigmund, director general for Asia and Pacific in the German foreign ministry, said Bhutan and Germany share democratic values, support a rules-based international order and are already cooperating in areas such as climate change and environment. “Establishing full-fledged diplomatic relations between our two countries is a logical step which will help us to intensify our cooperation across the board,” she said. Even in absence of full-fledged diplomatic ties, Germany has supported Bhutan’s socio-economic development since the 1970s. Bhutan also receives support from the European Union (EU), with Germany being the largest contributor to the grouping’s budget. As part of domestic reforms introduced by late King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, who ruled from 1952 to 1972, Bhutan gradually established relations with a small number of countries and joined the UN in 1971. Official bilateral contacts between Berlin and Thimphu were maintained through the German embassy in New Delhi and the Bhutanese mission in Brussels. Both countries also have honorary consuls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-bhutan-establish-full-fledged-diplomatic-ties/story-nLCkhTm0c7hNDrANhI3VyO.html
25-11-2020||World||Scotland to make period products freely available to all||Scottish lawmakers have unanimously passed legislation that will make period products freely available to anyone who needs them - a move that leader Nicole Sturgeon says makes Scotland the first country in the world to do so.Lawmakers in the Scottish Parliament unanimously approved a bill late Tuesday that will require local authorities to provide free access to items such as tampons and sanitary pads.Monica Lennon, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, had campaigned against “period poverty” — when someone who needs sanitary products can’t afford them — since 2016. She described the legislation as “practical and progressive,” especially during the coronavirus pandemic.“Periods don’t stop for pandemics and the work to improve access to essential tampons, pads and reusables has never been more important,” she said. “On the issue of period dignity, I am beyond proud that Scotland is leading the way and we have moved at a fast pace in a short space of time.”Her bill was passed in a 121-0 vote after winning the support of the Scottish government and the other opposition parties in the legislature in Edinburgh.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she was proud to vote for the “groundbreaking” legislation and described it as “an important policy for women and girls.”Under the bill, the Scottish government must set up measures to allow anyone who needs period products to get them free of charge. Schools and universities must make the products available for free in their bathrooms.The Scottish government already funds free period products in schools and universities, but the bill makes it a legal requirement.Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell from the Scottish National Party hailed the passing of the legislation as a “significant moment for gender equality.”And Rose Caldwell, chief executive of the girls’ rights charity Plan International U.K., said Scotland could soon become the first country to eliminate period poverty once and for all.A 2017 survey by the charity estimated that 10% of girls aged 14 to 21 in the U.K. have been unable to afford period products, and 15% of girls have struggled to afford them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scotland-to-make-period-products-freely-available-to-all/story-1lijfhueHyQygsmVyRRdJO.html
25-11-2020||World||Explained: When and how will Covid-19 vaccines become available around the world?||Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc have released trial data showing their Covid-19 vaccines to be about 95% effective at preventing the illness, while AstraZeneca Plc this week said its vaccine could be up to 90% effective. If regulators approve any of the vaccines in coming weeks, the companies have said distribution could begin almost immediately with governments around the world to decide who gets them and in what order. The following is an outline of the process:WHEN WILL COMPANIES ROLL OUT A VACCINE?Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have already started manufacturing their vaccines. This year, Pfizer said it will have enough to inoculate 25 million people, Moderna will have enough for 10 million people and AstraZeneca will have enough for more than 100 million people.The U.S. Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will manage distribution in the United States, likely starting in mid-December with an initial release of 6.4 million doses nationwide.UK health authorities plan to roll out an approved vaccine as quickly as possible, also expected in December. In the European Union, it is up to each country in the 27-member bloc to start distributing vaccines to their populations.WHO WOULD GET AN APPROVED VACCINE AND WHEN IN THE UNITED STATES?Upon authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the CDC has said first in line for vaccinations would be about 21 million healthcare workers and 3 million residents in long-term care facilities.Essential workers, a group of 87 million people who do crucial work in jobs that cannot be done from home, are the likely next group. This includes firefighters, police, school employees, transportation workers, food and agriculture workers and food service employees.Around 100 million adults with high-risk medical conditions and 53 million adults over the age of 65, also considered at higher risk of severe disease, are the next priority.U.S. public health officials said vaccines will be generally available to most Americans in pharmacies, clinics and doctors offices starting in April so that anyone who wants a shot can have one by the end of June.It is unclear when a vaccine will be available for children. Pfizer and BioNTech have started testing their vaccine in volunteers as young as 12. WHEN WILL A VACCINE BE AVAILABLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES? The European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada and Australia are all running rapid vaccine regulatory processes.Many of AstraZeneca’s doses this year are expected to go to the United Kingdom, where health officials have said that if approved they could begin vaccinating people in December. At the top of their list is people living and working in care homes.In Europe, the E.U. drugs regulator has said it could rule on the safety of a Covid-19 vaccine in December. Most countries have said the first vaccines will go to the elderly and vulnerable and frontline workers like doctors. Countries say they are buying vaccines via the European Commission’s joint procurement scheme, which has deals for six different vaccines and nearly 2 billion doses. Delivery timelines vary and most countries are still drawing up plans for distributing and administering shots.Italy expects to receive the first deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and AstraZeneca’s shot early next year. Spain plans to give vaccines in January.In Bulgaria, the country’s chief health inspector expects the first shipments in March-April. Hungary’s foreign minister said doses will land in the spring at the earliest. Germany, home to BioNTech, expects to roll out shots in early 2021 with mass vaccination centers in exhibition halls, airport terminals and concert venues. It will also use mobile teams for care homes. Front-line healthcare workers and people at risk for serious Covid-19 are expected to get inoculated first.WHEN WILL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE ACCESS TO VACCINES?COVAX, a program led by the World Health Organization and the GAVI vaccine group to pool funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to buy and distribute vaccines to dozens of poorer countries, has raised $2 billion. Its first goal is to vaccinate 3% of the people in these countries with a final goal of reaching 20%. It has signed a provisional agreement to buy AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which does not require storage in specialized ultra cold equipment like the Pfizer vaccine. It is expected but not certain that less wealthy countries in Africa and South East Asia, such as India, will receive vaccines at low or no cost under this program in 2021. Other countries such as those in Latin America may buy vaccines through COVAX. Several are also striking supply deals with drugmakers.HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?Vaccine makers and governments have negotiated varying prices, not all of which are public. Governments have paid from a few dollars per AstraZeneca shot to up to $50 for the two-dose Pfizer regimen. Many countries have said they will cover the cost of inoculating their residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-and-how-will-covid-19-vaccines-become-available-around-the-world-explained/story-5HadyrN52eiLUbE1reMSyO.html
25-11-2020||World||Biden to discuss coronavirus response as Thanksgiving holiday nears||US President-elect Joe Biden will give a speech on Wednesday highlighting the challenges facing Americans as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches and the nation faces a surge in coronavirus infections and a wave of unpopular health restrictions.The address is meant to encourage Americans and focus on the sacrifices they are making during the holiday season, his office said, as officials across the country plead with Americans to stay at home and avoid large gatherings that can spread Covid-19.Biden, who introduced his foreign policy and national security team on Tuesday as he begins a formal transition to the White House after defeating Republican President Donald Trump, has promised to make fighting the pandemic his top priority in office.The number of patients being treated for coronavirus infections in US hospitals surpassed 86,000, an all-time high, on Tuesday. The death toll has passed 257,000.Read more | Thanksgiving could make or break US coronavirus responseThe soaring caseload has taxed healthcare providers and further strained medical resources as 171,000 Americans test positive and another 1,500 or more perish from Covid-19 every day, on average.Not everyone appears to be heeding the warnings against travel. Millions of Americans have flocked to airports and highways in the days leading to Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday, leading to the busiest US travel period since the early days of the pandemic in March, though well below pre-pandemic holiday levels.Biden, who plans to spend Thanksgiving at home in Delaware with a few family members, said on Tuesday his team has been able to coordinate with the Trump administration on the pandemic, vaccine distribution plans and national security since getting the green light on Monday for formal transition efforts.The White House also gave the go-ahead for Biden to start receiving the president’s daily intelligence briefing.“It’s been offered,” Biden told reporters on Tuesday. “I did not have it today. We’re going to do it on a regular basis.”Trump has waged a failing legal battle to overturn the election results, falsely claiming it was stolen through widespread voting fraud. Critics have said Trump’s refusal to accept the results undercut Biden’s ability to combat the coronavirus pandemic and deal with national security threats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-discuss-coronavirus-response-as-thanksgiving-holiday-nears/story-BjqNlF2GrOBDf6sEy4yzsM.html

Devastating to watch,” Prowell said on Twitter.With caseloads soaring, more than half the nation’s governors imposed or reimposed statewide measures this month. But despite more stringent face-mask requirements, curfews and limits on bars and restaurants, the metrics of the virus have only worsened.US President-elect Joe Biden has promised to make fighting the pandemic his top priority upon taking office on Jan. 20 and will give a speech on Wednesday that is meant to encourage Americans and focus on the sacrifices they are making, his office said.Outgoing President Donald Trump has remained largely silent on the subject, making a one-minute appearance the White House briefing room on Tuesday to talk about the stock market.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMeanwhile school districts across the United States face pressure from all sides as they grapple with how to educate children during the pandemic, a Reuters survey of 217 districts showed.Many parents are balking at online instruction, seeing it as inferior to classroom learning and disruptive to life at home and work. Other parents worry about sending kids back into classrooms prematurely amid a raging pandemic. Teachers say they are not comfortable teaching in person, fearing infection.“Every school district across the nation is in the position in which no matter what decision they make and how well thought out it is, it will leave some in the community thinking it’s the wrong decision,” said Larry Rother, senior executive director of pre-kindergarten through 12th grade educational services in Chandler, Arizona.Help may be coming with vaccines showing promise.Officials from the US government’s Operation Warp Speed program told reporters Tuesday they plan to release 6.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses nationwide in an initial distribution after the first one is cleared by regulators for emergency use, which could happen as soon as Dec. 10.If all goes well 40 million doses will be distributed by the end of the year, they said.A Food and Drug Administration ruling on emergency use for Pfizer Inc’s vaccine is expected on Dec. 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-surpasses-2-000-coronavirus-deaths-in-a-day-with-hospitals-already-full/story-3t74u8RAeAvmoEwREpuZqJ.html

25-11-2020||World||Drones, micro-chillers may be needed for last-mile delivery of Covid vaccines||The ‘last mile’ of Covid-19 vaccine delivery will be crucial to re-start global economy and will depend on cargo drones, mobile cold rooms, micro-chillers and other innovative means in low-income countries for delivery, a new research report said on Wednesday.Successfully overcoming logistical challenges will be crucial to halt the spread of the virus and reconnect countries to international trade, said the report compiled by experts from the University of Birmingham, Heriot-Watt University, BRAC University (Bangladesh) and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.Vaccines are expected to be produced on a mass scale, including in the Serum Institute of India, following recent successful trials.High-income countries getting vaccines first would avoid 33% of preventable deaths, but equitable global distribution would stop 66% of such deaths, said the report titled ‘Understanding the cold-chain challenge for Covid-19 vaccination’.“Universal vaccine access is already a major challenge in low-income countries, due to the lack of robust refrigerated cooling networks especially to remote communities. Mass vaccination for Covid-19 will need to deliver vaccines globally at scale and speed never before considered,” the report added.The experts drew up a blueprint for in-country Covid-19 vaccination cold chain design for low and middle-income countries, using Bangladesh as a case study.The report identified several issues, including an urgent need to strengthen vaccine cold chains in low-income countries, particularly into rural and remote areas. It is estimated that nearly 3 billion of the world’s 7.8 billion people live in areas that lack temperature-controlled storage to deliver the vaccines.Existing vaccination, the report recommended, must continue alongside Covid-19 programmes, because nearly 80 million children may already have missed vaccinations against preventable diseases due to the pandemic.“Strengthening cold chains must not come at an environmental cost; this is a major opportunity to address gaps in the wider cold economy and use sustainable technology. A lack of qualified engineers will lead to long response times to equipment malfunctions and broken cold-chains”, the report said.It added that waste management will be a major challenge; alongside vaccines, disposable syringes, Personal Protective Equipment and other vaccination supplies will require disposal.Project developer Toby Peters, professor of Cold Economy at the University of Birmingham, said: “We can’t ‘build back better’ if lack of access to vaccination has condemned some countries to isolation because they remain Covid-19 hubs. We must reach everyone who needs a vaccine and the real challenge lies in overcoming that ‘last mile’.”“Cold-chains are energy intensive and rely on planet-warming refrigerants. Rapid expansion must not be based on environmentally harmful technologies and we are leading a fast-track research programme to design novel methods and instruments to support the cold-chain for Covid-19, but also to provide a lasting logistics legacy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drones-micro-chillers-may-be-needed-for-last-mile-delivery-of-covid-vaccines/story-jg4b2NBGnjJw9rdU5AQ0GP.html
25-11-2020||World||UK to relax Covid-19 rules over Christmas to allow indoor mixing||Coronavirus restrictions in the UK will be eased over Christmas to allow as many as three households to meet indoors.Households will be able to meet in a “Christmas bubble” in homes, places of worship and outdoor spaces between Dec. 23-27, the leaders of the four UK nations agreed Tuesday.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Prime Minister Boris Johnson is trying to balance demands to bolster the economy and allow people more freedoms with the need to keep the coronavirus in check before a potential vaccine can be rolled out. England has been under a four-week lockdown that’s set to end Dec. 2, to be replaced with a regional three-tier system of restrictions.Other European leaders are fighting their own battles: French President Emmanuel Macron will gradually lift a nationwide lockdown from Saturday following weeks of criticism from shopkeepers, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to extend the country’s partial lockdown as Covid-19 cases remain high.UK ministers will announce Thursday which regions in England will be placed into each tier. London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan has been lobbying the government to put the city into tier 2, which would allow pubs, bars and restaurants to stay open.Christmas BubbleUnder the new Christmas plans, people will be able to travel between tiers and across the whole of the UK, as long as they only meet with those in their “exclusive” bubble of three households. Those travelling to and from Northern Ireland will be allowed an extra day to travel either side of the five-day period.The move was agreed after days of talks between Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and the leaders of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In a joint statement, they said: “Even where it is within the rules, meeting with friends and family over Christmas will be a personal judgment for individuals to take, mindful of the risks to themselves and others, particularly those who are vulnerable.”In a video message on Twitter, Johnson urged people not to “throw caution to the wind,” adding: “The virus doesn’t know it’s Christmas, and we must all be careful.”But doctors from the British Medical Association immediately raised concerns. In an emailed statement, BMA council chair Chaand Nagpaul said the move “will almost certainly carry the risk of a rise in infection rate and possibly more hospitalization and deaths.”Balancing DemandsAs the virus continues to rage across Europe, leaders are grappling with how to get infection rates down while keeping their economies afloat. In France, small stores will be permitted to open from Nov. 28 but restaurants will remain closed until at least Jan. 20, depriving the sector of the income from one of the busiest periods of the year.Meanwhile, Germany is heading for an extension and further tightening of its partial lockdown, with Chancellor Merkel expected to agree with regional state premiers Wednesday on closing restaurants, gyms and cinemas until at least Dec. 20.A number of UK lawmakers have expressed concern about Johnson’s new tougher regional restrictions, coming into force next week. Some have publicly aired their opposition to London going into tier 3, which they warn would hit already struggling businesses hard.Health Minister Nadine Dorries spoke with London lawmakers on a video call Tuesday to hear their views ahead of the decision on the categorization of regions, two people familiar with the matter said.Keeping London in tier 2 -- where it was before lockdown -- would be the “right and sensible decision,” given that cases are lower than “most other parts of the country,” Khan said in a statement Tuesday.“London’s unique ecosystem of bars, restaurants, clubs and cultural venues have been through an extremely tough year,” he said. “If they had to close throughout the Christmas period and beyond in tier 3 it would be a hammer blow that many might not recover from.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday that no decision had yet been made. “London will come out at the tier that is necessary and appropriate based on the public health evidence,” he told MPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-relax-covid-19-rules-over-christmas-to-allow-indoor-mixing/story-NFqgsaGyWoV9KaItHVjf4O.html
25-11-2020||World||Row over England flu shots prompts fear of Covid-19 vaccine ‘chaos’||Communication failures risk derailing the mass roll-out of a potential Covid-19 vaccine in England, family doctors warned after they were blindsided by a government announcement on free flu shots for the over-50s.Ministers announced last week that people aged 50-64 will be able to get a flu vaccination from Dec. 1, but doctors complained they were not told in advance and were deluged with calls from patients demanding appointments. Some practices are still not able to get hold of enough flu vaccine for the over-65s, let alone younger patients.“There’s always this underlying feeling of chaos,” said Lizzie Toberty, a spokeswoman for the Doctors’ Association campaign group. “Our worry is that if we’re having problems delivering flu vaccines which we deliver to a limited number of people every year, then how can we be confident if we organize a Covid-19 program that the supply chain is definitely going to be there?”The row raises serious questions about the government’s handling of immunization programs as the National Health Service prepares for the roll out of a coronavirus vaccine, if approved by regulators, to tens of millions of people across the country.The NHS Confederation, which represents health care organizations, said family doctors are under “phenomenal strain” -- carrying out around 1.25 million appointments a day while preparing to deliver a Covid-19 vaccination program “at very short notice.”‘Poorly Executed’In a letter to health minister Jo Churchill, it said “poorly executed communications from the department on important matters such as this simply does not help in these trying times.”Richard Vautrey, a spokesman for the British Medical Association doctors’ union, said while it was always intended the flu campaign would eventually be extended to 50-64 year-olds, doctors have a right to be given “adequate notice” ahead of any public announcement.The Department of Health said in a statement there have been “regular communications” with doctors on the flu vaccine, and further deliveries will be arriving throughout November, December and into the new year.There is “a real disconnect” between central government and health workers on the ground, Toberty said. “We need to urgently improve the level of communication.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/row-over-england-flu-shots-prompts-fear-of-covid-19-vaccine-chaos/story-lXTz46zhe0iMU3VJj7aBHP.html

New Zealand’s Department of Conservation (DOC) said in total 97 pilot whales and three dolphins died in the stranding, adding that they were notified of the incident on Sunday.“Only 26 of the whales were still alive at this point, the majority of them appearing very weak, and were euthanised due to the rough sea conditions and almost certainty of there being great white sharks in the water which are brought in by a stranding like this,” said DOC Biodiversity Ranger Jemma Welch.Mass strandings are reasonably common on the Chatham Islands with up to 1,000 animals dying in a single stranding in 1918.Mass whale strandings have occurred throughout recorded modern history, and why it happens is a question that has puzzled marine biologists for years.In late September, several hundred whales died in shallow waters off the Australian coast in one of the world’s biggest mass whale strandings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-100-whales-die-after-mass-stranding-in-new-zealand/story-DiLg8egTABIDEB4MnKz9bJ.html
25-11-2020||World||EU seeks overhaul of key patents to ease technology court fights||The European Union will seek a sweeping overhaul of key patents that have fueled court battles between car makers and technology companies, the EU’s technology chief said Wednesday.Margrethe Vestager said regulators “will consider reforms to further improve the framework in place for standard-essential patents” and work on industry-led initiatives “to reduce frictions and litigation” that has dogged industries such as cars seeking to add communications technology, she told a Wednesday press conference.The EU move could help resolve lengthy legal battles, such as Nokia Oyj’s effort to get Daimler AG to pay more for mobile technology used in cars. Companies often seek court help to determine whether certain technology patents are valid and how much should be paid for licensing technology seen as essential for an industry. The EU has often been asked to weigh in on how much is fair for key technology.Read more | First EU citizens may be vaccinated against Covid-19 by December end“There’s quite a lot of litigation back and forth and in the short-term we would want to push for industry to figure out how to set up foras to enable discussions and mediation so that maybe to a bigger degree it can be solved out of court, Vestager said.The current system to set up so-called standard essential patents deemed key to certain technology “is not very transparent,” she said. “This is why we will consider a very close consultation with anyone involved whether we should set up a third-party essential ‘reality check’ so someone outside of your business” can rule on whether a parent is really important or not.It’s important that there be broad agreement in an industry on the right patents for an essential patent instead of many, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-seeks-overhaul-of-key-patents-to-ease-technology-court-fights/story-FROeu9T5ov45fRX3f504LJ.html
25-11-2020||World||Top Chinese vaccine maker seeks govt nod to market Covid-19 shots||China’s leading vaccine producer China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) said on Wednesday it has applied with the country’s regulators to market its Covid-19 vaccine.The announcement was made by Sinopharm general manager, Shi Shengyi, state media reported.The company, which is carrying out clinical trials of the candidate vaccine abroad said it had collected data from host countries such as UAE.Results are expected to be good, but it is up to Chinese authorities to make the decision as the authorities have strict review standards, the company was quoted as saying.Earlier, the company said it had submitted the vaccine’s phase-3 clinical data to China’s State Food and Drug Administration and was in the process of giving more detailed data.The company said it is in the final stage before launching it in markets and is now making approval of the vaccine its top priority.If approved, Sinopharm will likely become the first vaccine developer outside of Russia to see its shots being made available for general public, underscoring China’s push to be a major player in supplying inoculations to countries around the world.Western drugmakers like Pfizer Inc. are only at the stage of seeking authorisation for emergency use of their shots, a status China granted to its developers in July.Five Chinese vaccine candidates are under clinical trials in countries including the UAE, Brazil, Pakistan and Peru, and phase-I and II clinical trials of other candidates have been accelerated, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said last week at a regular briefing.At least one million people have taken an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by Sinopharm through the country’s emergency use programme, the firm had said last week.China launched the emergency use programme in July, which so far includes three vaccine candidates for essential workers and other limited groups of people.Experts have questioned the move as clinical studies have yet to be completed to prove their safety and efficacy.Earlier this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China is ready to step up global Covid-19 vaccine cooperation, calling for better international coordination on policies to facilitate movement of people.“China is willing to strengthen cooperation with other countries in the research and development, production and distribution of vaccines,” Xi told the G-20 Riyadh Summit via video link on Saturday. “We will fulfil our commitments, offer help and support to other developing countries, and work hard to make vaccines a public good that citizens of all countries can use and can afford.”Xi urged stronger international policy coordination to establish travel “fast tracks”, facilitating orderly global movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-chinese-vaccine-maker-seeks-govt-nod-to-market-covid-19-shots/story-LCV2OBAU8Hf1qhudMyWphL.html
25-11-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson offers days off from lockdown to form ‘Christmas bubble’||Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed a time-limited one-off dispensation from Covid-19 lockdown rules agreed by all parts of the United Kingdom for families to get together to form a Christmas bubble between December 23 and 27.In a video message on Tuesday evening from Downing Street, where he continues to self-isolate after being in contact with a Covid-positive politician, Johnson said a family can get together with two other households to form such a bubble in order to spend the festive period together.“All four nations of the UK (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales) have agreed that from the 23rd of December to the 27th of December, you will be able to form a Christmas bubble with up to two other households,” Johnson said.It would mean that up to three households will be able to come together from any part of the UK over the brief four-day period and also attend church and communal services.“We can’t afford to throw caution to the wind. The virus doesn’t know it’s Christmas and we must all be careful,” he said, urging people “think carefully” about the festive plans.“I know this doesn’t equate to a normal Christmas and it won’t work for everyone. And it is up to each of us to think carefully about how we use this time-limited special dispensation. The virus has not gone away and families will need to make a personal judgement about the risk of forming a bubble with or visiting elderly relatives and the vulnerable,” he said.“‘Tis the season to be jolly but ‘tis also the season to be jolly careful,” he added.Making a reference to some good news from at least three Covid-19 vaccines in the last few weeks, Johnson expressed hope for a better period by early next year at the end of a tough 2020.“I have to level with you and say we face some tough weeks and months ahead. But if we follow the rules, remembering to wash our hands, wear a face covering and keep our distance from anyone we don’t live with, then after this tough winter, we can look forward to a much, much brighter spring,” he said.A joint statement issued by the four UK governments said they had been working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each other, recognising it must be “limited and cautious”. They also urged people to “think carefully” about their Christmas plans and to consider meeting outside or getting together virtually, instead of mixing indoors.England remains under a strict stay-at-home lockdown, set to expire next Wednesday when it will move into a tougher three-tier system. The different regions will find out on Thursday which tier they fall under, a decision based on a number of factors including case numbers, the infection reproduction rate – or R number – and pressure on local National Health Service (NHS) capacity.Some scientists have warned that the relaxation of Covid restrictions over Christmas could spark another wave of infections and further deaths.On Tuesday, the UK government recorded another 608 deaths, pushing the country’s death toll to 55,838.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-offers-days-off-from-lockdown-to-form-christmas-bubble/story-3D8ncmxOzdP7WkmGmGI8CL.html

25-11-2020||World||Angela Merkel set to extend Germany’s partial shutdown well into December||German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors are expected Wednesday to extend a partial shutdown well into December, and discuss tightening some restrictions while allowing somewhat more generous rules for the Christmas period.Germany embarked on a so-called “wave-breaker” shutdown on Nov. 2, shutting restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities but leaving schools, shops and hair salons open. It was initially slated to last four weeks.Proposals drawn up ahead of Wednesday’s videoconference by state governors, who are responsible for imposing and lifting restrictions, call for extending the shutdown until Dec. 20.So far, the measures have succeeded in halting an upward surge in new coronavirus infections — but they have stabilized at a high level, rather than sinking back to levels at which authorities feel contact-tracing efforts can be successful.On Wednesday, the national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 18,633 new cases over the past 24 hours — compared with 17,561 a week earlier. The number of deaths linked to COVID-19 climbed by 410, the highest single-day total yet.Proposals for Wednesday’s gathering envision tightening contact restrictions and mask-wearing rules. The federal government reportedly plans around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) more in aid to compensate businesses hit by the shutdown, following more than 10 billion euros this month.Over the Christmas period, plans so far call for somewhat looser contact restrictions.Germany, which has 83 million people, was credited with a relatively good performance in the first phase of the pandemic. It still has a lower death rate than several other European countries, and its current shutdown has been relatively mild.Germany has reported a total of 961,320 virus cases since the pandemic began, including 14,771 deaths.___Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-set-to-extend-partial-shutdown-well-into-december/story-9PFrNQwt2Q8bO67GU9iPmL.html
25-11-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic could be stopped if at least 70% public wore face masks consistently: Study||The Covid-19 pandemic could be stopped if at least 70 per cent of the public wore face masks consistently, according to a review of studies which suggests that the type of material used and the duration of mask use play key roles in their effectiveness. The research, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, assessed studies on face masks and reviewed epidemiological reports on whether they reduce the number of people an infected person spreads the pathogen to -- the reproduction number of the virus. “The highly efficacious facemask, such as surgical masks with an estimated efficacy of around 70 per cent, could lead to the eradication of the pandemic if at least 70 per cent of the residents use such masks in public consistently,” the scientists, including Sanjay Kumar from the National University of Singapore, wrote in the study. “Even less efficient cloth masks could also slow the spread if worn consistently,” Kumar added. According to the scientists, one key aspect of face mask function involves the size of fluid droplets expelled from the nose and mouth when a person talks, sings, sneezes, coughs, or even simply breathes. They said larger droplets, with sizes around 5-10 microns, are the most common, adding that smaller droplets below 5 microns are possibly more dangerous. In comparison, the scientists said the human hair is about 70 microns in diameter. Among the many types of facemasks in use, such as cloth masks, surgical masks, and N95 masks, they said only the latter can filter out aerosol-sized droplets. The performance of face masks worn for many hours, such as by health care or other essential workers, impact how effective overall mask wearing can be, the researchers added. They found that face masks made of hybrid polymer materials could filter particles at high efficiency while simultaneously cooling the face since the fibres used in these allow heat to escape from beneath the mask. “There could be some relation between breathing resistance and the flow resistance of the face mask which will need to be studied for a face mask-wearing interval,” said Heow Pueh Lee, another co-author of the study. “Also, the environmental condition in the compartmental space within the face mask will need to be more accurately quantified using miniaturised sensors and the development of human replicas for such studies,” Lee said. Based on the analysis, the researchers underscored the importance of consistent use of efficient facemasks, such as surgical masks.

25-11-2020||World||China weighs legal steps against ‘diehard’ supporters of Taiwan independence||China is considering drawing up a blacklist of “diehard” supporters of Taiwan’s independence, the government said on Wednesday, which may see Beijing try to take legal steps against democratically-elected President Tsai Ing-wen.Taiwan condemned the plan after the pro-Beijing Hong Kong-based newspaper Ta Kung Pao first reported on it this month. China’s widely-read Global Times tabloid has said the list could include senior Taiwanese government officials.China claims self-governing Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan’s government says the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, although China rejects this position.Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said the “list of diehard Taiwan secessionists” now under consideration was only aimed at a very small number of independence supporters and those who fund them.“It is absolutely not aimed at the vast majority of Taiwan compatriots,” she told a regular news briefing in Beijing.Zhu did not give details or a timeframe, saying only that Beijing would take “targeted steps to severely punish in accordance with the law” those it viewed as hard-core backers of independence. Chinese media have said the 2005 Anti-Secession Law, which mandates the use of force if China judges Taiwan to have declared independence, as well as national security legislation, could be used to charge those on the list.It is unclear how that would play out, as Chinese courts have no jurisdiction in Taiwan, and Taiwan’s government leaders do not visit China.The moves follows Beijing’s July unveiling of new national security laws for Chinese-run Hong Kong that prescribe sentences ranging up to life terms for crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.Separately, Zhu said a Chinese court this week sentenced a Taiwanese citizen to four years in prison for espionage.Last month, Chinese state television ran a series of programmes featuring “confessions” by Taiwanese spies, which Taiwan described as entrapment and another reason for people to fear visiting China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-weighs-legal-steps-against-diehard-supporters-of-taiwan-independence/story-7a9ugPphWh1lZHGPiFYIgO.html
25-11-2020||World||Chinese vaccine maker seeks approval for public use of Covid-19 shot||A leading Chinese vaccine developer has applied for authorization to bring its Covid-19 vaccine to the market, seeking to get a jump on Western rivals as the race for a working shot against the pandemic enters the final stretch.China National Biotec Group Co. has submitted an application to Chinese regulators, reported state media Xinhua Finance on Wednesday, citing parent company Sinopharm’s vice general manager Shi Shengyi. The application likely includes data from the company’s Phase III human testing conducted in the Middle East and South America.Stocks related to Sinopharm Group, including its Hong Kong unit, surged on Wednesday after the news.A CNBG spokeswoman said she had no further information when contacted by Bloomberg. Calls to Sinopharm Group went unanswered.With the application, CNBG will likely become the first developer outside of Russia to see its shots made available for general public use, underscoring China’s determination to be a major player in supplying inoculations to countries around the world. Western drugmakers like Pfizer Inc. are only at the stage of seeking authorization for emergency use of their shots, a status China granted to its developers months ago.The race has taken on vital importance as countries look to more definitively re-open their economies and stem a pandemic that has sickened more than 59 million. Working vaccines are seen as the best hope as a fresh wave of infections is forcing nations to reintroduce lockdowns and other restrictions.A state-owned drugmaker that has a dominant share of China’s vaccine market, CNBG in April was among the world’s first to push experimental shots to the crucial final stage of human testing. The company’s research institutes developed two shots using an inactivated version of the virus to stimulate immune response, an approach widely adopted by many of the existing vaccines used around the world.Despite the fact that the vaccines haven’t yet received regulatory approval for widespread use, they have already been given to hundreds of thousands of people in China under an emergency-use program. That has raised concern among scientists of potential risks in using shots whose safety has yet to be thoroughly studied.CNBG has said that its phase III trials -- involving more than 50,000 people in countries from Argentina to Egypt -- have been progressing smoothly, and it has not received any reports of serious adverse events.Safety has become a major concern as drugmakers compress the vaccine development process from years to a matter of months. AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson paused their trials after a participant developed an unexplained illness. Another Chinese frontrunner, Sinovac Biotech Ltd., also saw its trial briefly halted in Brazil after a participant died. All three trials resumed after investigators found no evidence that the events were caused by the vaccines.Pfizer said this month that the shot it co-developed with BioNTech has a protection rate of more than 90%. Russia later declared that its Sputnik V vaccine has achieved a protection rate of 92%. CNBG has not released any public data on the efficacy of its shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-vaccine-maker-seeks-approval-for-public-use-of-covid-19-shot/story-zOvDlbFrcK794sfAldbmSP.html

He was shot in the head, during the firefight in the compound in Pakistan, where he was taking shelter.Pakistan had long denied his presence in the country.The presentation of the dossiers comes ahead of India joining the 15-member council for a two-year term starting January 1, 2021.On November 19, four terrorists were killed and two policemen were injured in a gun battle in Jammu and Kashmir’s Nagrota. The encounter broke out after a truck was intercepted in the morning during a routine check. Inspector-General of Police, Jammu Zone had said that it was possible that they were planning a big attack and targeting the upcoming District Development Council (DDC) elections in the Union territory. The terrorists were infiltrated in India using a 150-metre long tunnel.Meanwhile, Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla briefed a select group of head of missions in New Delhi about Pakistan’s direct role in planning the terror attack which was foiled by Indian security forces.ANI learned that heads of missions were provided a detailed information docket giving details of the incident as it transpired as well as list of items and ammunition that was recovered from terrorists clearly indicating their Pakistani origins.Sources said they were also briefed on how terrorists got into India, which is now clear as an underground tunnel has been found in the Samba sector.They said envoys were told how preliminary investigations by police and intelligence authorities and markings on the recovered AK-47 rifles and other items brought it out that terrorists belonged to JeM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remember-abbottabad-india-slams-pak-for-presenting-dossier-of-lies-at-un/story-LCnL8zJlbN3HKXfUbRFwkO.html
25-11-2020||World||Russia says vaccine 95% effective, roll-out in Jan||Russia on Tuesday said its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine was 95% effective and would be cheaper and easier to store than some alternatives, as the global race heats up to develop a shot, even as some experts raised questions over the low number of cases reviewed.The vaccine will cost less than $10 a dose and be available in international markets from February 2021, said its developer Gamaleya Center and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the latest in a flurry of breakthroughs as several vaccine makers worldwide published preliminary data showing high efficacy rates in the last three weeks.Countries are hoping to begin inoculating their populations by year’s end or in early 2021 to stop a pandemic that has claimed the lives of nearly 1.4 million people. In statement on Tuesday, the vaccine’s developers said preliminary data after trials involving thousands of volunteers showed “an efficacy of the vaccine above 95%” after a second dose.“We are ready to start deliveries of Sputnik V to foreign markets, thanks to partnerships with manufacturers in India, Brazil, South Korea, China and four other countries,” Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) that has invested in production and promotion of the vaccine, told a virtual news conference.. Russia was one of the first to announce the development of a vaccine in August -- dubbed Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite -- but before the start of final clinical trials.The interim clinical trial data – Tuesday’s was the second when the trial hit 39 infections -- has found no unexpected adverse events during the trials and the monitoring of the participants is ongoing. The interim data will be published in a peer-reviewed international medical journal following the completion of Phase 3 trials. Russian citizens will be vaccinated free. “Sputnik V is now available for civil use in Russia, specifically for high-risk groups. Following the completion of the current Phase III trial, the ultimate goal is to voluntarily vaccinate approximately 70% of the population to end the pandemic in Russia. To this end, Russia is launching mass production of Gam-COVID-Vac using multiple production sites within the country,” said Dr Alexander Gintsburg, director general of the Gamaleya Scientific Research Institute, Moscow, in an email interview. India is set to begin adaptive Phase 2/3 clinical trials this week following a partnership between Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and RDIF in September. As part of the partnership, RDIF is supplying 100 million doses of the vaccine to Dr Reddy’s upon regulatory approval in India. Experts said the initial data appeared promising. “All the vaccines - whether mRNA or adenoviral - are looking promising from initial data. The most important part will be ability to prevent severe cases, deaths and ability to block asymptomatic infections to prevent transmission. This will be known better as we look deeper and wait longer to see how long the protection lasts,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi. The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vector platform – similar to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine -- that has proven safe and effective with no long-term side effects in more than 250 clinical trials globally during the past two decades. It uses two different human adenoviral vectors that allows for a stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to the vaccines using one or the same vector for two doses, the Gamaleya Institute said. “Sputnik V is a human adenovirus-based vaccine candidate and the only late-stage adenovirus-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate to use two different vectors for different injections, human adenovirus types Ad5 and Ad26. In vaccines that use the same vector in both injections, the immune system may launch defense mechanisms against the second one making the vaccine less effective,” said Gintsburg. The vaccine can be stored at between two and eight degrees Celsius, they develop said, referring to a freeze-dried formulation that will also be rolled out. Pharma giants Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their virus vaccine is 95% effective, while US company Moderna said last week early results showed its candidate was 94.5 percent effective.

The United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany do.Trudeau said it is understandable that an American pharmaceutical company will distribute first in the US before they distribute internationally.“Shortly afterwards they will start honoring and delivering the contracts that they signed with other countries including Canada,” Trudeau said. “We’re expecting to start receiving those doses in the first few months of 2021.”Trudeau said Canadians won’t have to wait for everyone in the US to be vaccinated before Canada gets doses.The issue was discussed at the G-20 this past weekend and Trudeau said he’s working with allies to make sure there is a free flow of contracts. He said countries recognize that “no one place gets through Covid-19 until all places are through Covid-19.”Trudeau said having pre-bought an array of vaccine candidates from foreign manufacturers will help get Canadians effective doses as soon as possible and noted Canada pre-bought millions of doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadians-won-t-be-among-the-first-to-get-vaccine-pm-justin-trudeau/story-zvVi3J5t95VEOTtsOWsioJ.html
25-11-2020||World||Rishi Sunak to pledge $5.7 billion to help UK unemployed find work||Rishi Sunak will announce 4.3 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) of new funding to help the unemployed back into work as the UK government tries to repair some of the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The Chancellor of the Exchequer will lay out the plan in his spending review on Wednesday, the Treasury said. It includes a 2.9 billion-pound, three-year program to help one million unemployed people find new roles, and 1.4 billion pounds to increase the capacity of job centers, it said in a statement.Sunak Sets Public Services at the Heart of UK Economic RevivalMeasures to slow the spread of the virus have shuttered businesses and caused a spike in unemployment in the UK, where the jobless rate surged to 4.8% in September -- the highest level in four years. The number of employees on payrolls in October was down 782,000 compared to March.“My number one priority is to protect jobs and livelihoods,” Sunak said Tuesday in a statement. The spending review will “ensure that no one is left without hope or opportunity,” he said.There will also be 138 million pounds of new funding for the lifetime skills guarantee announced in September by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. That’s part of a wider package for skills totaling 375 million pounds and including previously announced funding.The measures follow 13.7 billion pounds of job support announced in July, though Sunak later scrapped the biggest portion of that -- a job retention bonus program planned for January costing as much as 9.4 billion pounds -- after he instead extended the UK’s furlough program.The July plan also included a 2.1 billion-pound “Kickstart Scheme” to create job placements for 16 to 24-year-olds. On Wednesday, Sunak will allocate 1.6 billion pounds of that promised expenditure.The chancellor also plans to extend a program giving employers as much as 2,000 pounds for every new apprentice they hire. The program had been due to end on January 31, but will now run until March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-to-pledge-5-7-billion-to-help-uk-unemployed-find-work/story-hiH8LV9aZ0Uyb7bRo2Y60M.html

While most of the mutations didn’t make much of a difference, one of them, however, turned out to be crucial, helping Covid-19 spread faster, the report says. “The mutation, known as 614G, was first spotted in eastern China in January and then spread quickly throughout Europe and New York City,” the report says. “Within months, the variant took over much of the world, displacing other variants.”Meanwhile, Michael Ryan, the head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that it’s “extremely important” for its international team to visit China to look into the origins of the coronavirus, confirming that the UN health agency has been reassured such a trip will happen “as soon as possible”.In China, hundreds of flights at Pudong airport were cancelled on Tuesday as Shanghai raced to bring a local Covid-19 outbreak under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-mutation-made-covid-19-harder-to-stop-report/story-lukOMIlHk9ObKwskeXl7GL.html
25-11-2020||World||Biden welcomes national security team, says ‘America is back’||Joe Biden on Tuesday introduced the team of foreign policy experts he plans to nominate to his administration, led by Antony Blinken as secretary of state, as the president-elect seeks to calm international relations after a tumultuous four years under President Donald Trump.The appointees, all experienced in their fields, will work with Biden on his goal of restoring US relations with international organizations that Trump spurned in his “America First” approach to foreign policy. Biden has promised to seek multilateral approaches to common problems like climate change, the coronavirus pandemic and arms control.“It’s a team that reflects the fact that America is back,” Biden said. “Ready to lead the world, not retreat from it. Ready to confront our adversaries, not reject our allies. And ready to stand up for our values.”“This team meets this moment,” he said.A former deputy secretary of state in Barack Obama’s administration, Blinken will be tasked with rebuilding an agency hollowed out by a loss of top diplomats under Trump while reassuring longtime allies of the US commitment to international relationships.Blinken spoke movingly about his family’s journey to America, including his stepfather who escaped the Nazis as a child in Poland and greeted a US soldier with the only words he knew in English, “God Bless America.”Biden also named former Hillary Clinton aide Jake Sullivan as national security adviser and veteran foreign service officer Linda Thomas-Greenfield as ambassador to the United Nations, who would be the highest-ranking Black official named so far.Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat and a native of Louisiana, promised “Gumbo diplomacy” as a way to make politics personal.“Wherever I was posted around the world, I’d invite people of different backgrounds and beliefs to make a roux, chop onions for the holy trinity, and make homemade gumbo — my way to break down barriers, connect with people, and start to see each other on a human level: a bit of lagniappe as we say in Louisiana,” she said to nods from her fellow appointees.For his director of national intelligence, Biden has selected Avril Haines, a former top CIA official with years of experience in the espionage community who would fill a job that Trump had largely reserved for people better known for their loyalty to him.And as homeland security secretary, the president-elect has picked Alejandro Mayorkas, a former head of Citizenship and Immigration Services who would become the first Latino and immigrant to lead an agency that has played a central role in Trump’s widely criticized border crackdown. Mayorkas also served as deputy secretary of the department.Mayorkas, who came to the US from Cuba as a child, also spoke of his family’s American dream.“My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism,” he said. “They cherished our democracy and were intensely proud to become United States citizens. As was I. I have carried that pride throughout my nearly twenty years of government service and throughout my life.”Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who served under Obama, was named climate envoy, a move to highlight Biden’s commitment to the issue.Biden has close relationships with Blinken, who is 58, and Sullivan, 43, who served stints as advisers on national security when he was vice president and worked with his campaign.Secretary of state is regarded as one of the most prestigious cabinet posts and is fourth in line for the presidency. Serving as the nation’s top diplomat, Blinken will meet directly with foreign leaders around the world and will fill an especially important job for Biden, the former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.National security adviser is a key post in the White House, serving as the gatekeeper of information from dozens of experts in military, diplomatic and intelligence agencies. UN ambassador is also an important post, serving as the voice of the administration on major global issues.Notably absent from the list is a nominee for defense secretary. Former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy had been the favorite for the job but Biden has not yet finalized his choice. Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is another contender for the job.Asked later why he had not named a leader for the Defense Department on Tuesday, Biden said he was creating his cabinet, “a piece at a time here.”In an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine earlier this year, Biden laid out a blueprint for “diplomacy as the United States’ principal tool of foreign policy,” laying out a process-oriented approach that would lean on “experienced and empowered professionals.”A graduate of Harvard and Columbia Law School, Blinken worked for Biden on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and his 2008 presidential campaign. After advising Biden as vice president, he served as deputy secretary of state and later co-founded WestExec Advisors, a political strategy firm.​As secretary of state, Blinken will lead Biden administration efforts to rejoin international agreements like the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal and is expected to oversee a tougher posture toward China.Biden’s spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said Biden would name an economics team next week. Bloomberg News reported that will be helmed by former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-welcomes-national-security-team-says-america-is-back/story-tSAEy5ozUSKrtZLp3EjkJM.html

25-11-2020||World||Will being vaccinated be must for air travel?||International travellers will need to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to fly with Australia’s Qantas, the company has said, the first major airline to suggest that such rules could become common across the industry.Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said late Monday the Australian flag carrier would implement the measure once a coronavirus vaccine was made available to the public.“We are looking at changing our terms and conditions to say for international travellers that we will ask people to have a vaccination before they can get on the aircraft,” he told Channel Nine television.“Whether you need that domestically, we will have to see what happens with Covid-19 in the market but certainly, for international visitors coming out (to Australia) and people leaving the country, we think that is a necessity.”Joyce predicted the rule would likely become standard practice around the world as governments and airlines currently consider the introduction of electronic vaccination passports.Other major regional airlines, however, said that it was too early to comment on what travel requirements might be when a vaccine becomes widely available. “We don’t have any concrete plans to announce at this point on the vaccine as it is still in development and will take time to distribute,” a Korean Air representative told AFP.Japan Airlines similarly said it had “no plans to require international travellers to have a vaccination” and is for now asking “passengers to follow rules of their destinations, such as taking tests”.Vaccination entry requirements are already widely used around the world, with many countries demanding travellers show they have been inoculated against yellow fever if they are coming from regions where the disease is endemic.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced late Monday it was in the “final stages” of developing a digital health pass that it says can be used to record Covid-19 tests or vaccinations and will “support the safe reopening of borders”.“We are bringing this to market in the coming months to also meet the needs of the various travel bubbles and public health corridors that are starting operation,” IATA director general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac said.Up in the airAustralia’s borders have effectively been closed since March to curb the spread of novel coronavirus, which has already claimed more than a million lives worldwide.The country has even limited the numbers of its own citizens allowed to return each week, leaving tens of thousands of Australians stranded overseas.The global airline industry has come under huge pressure from restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus.Qantas has grounded more than 200 planes and laid off 8,500 staff as it attempts to offset a US$1.9 billion loss caused by the collapse in demand for air travel.A slew of other carriers have collapsed because of the pandemic, including Virgin Australia, Chilean-Brazilian airline LATAM and Britain’s Flybe.IATA said in October that after a predicted 66-percent drop in global air traffic this year, airlines’ revenues are expected to be down by 46 percent in 2021 compared to 2019.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said Australia is seeking to create “travel bubbles” with other countries that have curbed the spread of the virus.But the country is unlikely to fully reopen to international travellers until a vaccine is widely available.The government also signalled in its recently released Covid-19 vaccination policy that Australia and other nations may introduce proof of inoculation as a condition of entry.Australia has been relatively successful in containing the coronavirus, recording just over 27,800 cases and 907 deaths since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-being-vaccinated-be-must-for-air-travel/story-Bf8L3FYYpltmSA5DUL5UNP.html
25-11-2020||World||Dow hits 30,000 points for first time as US stocks boom||The Dow surged past 30,000 points for the first time Tuesday as receding US political uncertainty and hopes for coronavirus vaccines offset worries over spiking Covid-19 cases.After crossing the threshold in mid-day trading, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated a few times throughout the afternoon before closing at 30,046.24, up 1.5 percent.The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.6 percent to 3,635.41, also a record, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 1.3 percent to 12,036.79.Investors now feel more reassured that the United States can avoid a constitutional crisis over the transition of power following presidential elections earlier this month in which Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump.Trump still has not conceded his election defeat, but on Monday night, his administration officially authorized a transition, clearing the way for Biden to have access to funds, office space and the ability to meet with federal officials. Trump himself called the 30,000-point benchmark a “sacred” figure, touting it as a product of his administration’s efforts to advance vaccines, the progress of which he said was “absolutely incredible.”  ‘Another excuse’ Investors have already been cheered by an upbeat coronavirus vaccine announcement by British drugs group AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford as well as news that Biden will tap former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as treasury secretary.Yellen “is a known and respected face on the international scene,” said a note from High Frequency Economics, adding that the former Fed chair is not known as a hardline critic of Wall Street.Briefing.com analyst Patrick O’Hare recognized the latest Washington developments as “another excuse” for the market to rally in a holiday-shortened week when positive momentum is driving a “fear of missing out” trend.That outlook is based on expectations that the US economy will pick up speed in 2021 as vaccines become further available and hard-hit sectors such as travel and energy begin to recover.Markets are looking past near-term weakness tied to surging coronavirus cases.The Conference Board, a New York-based business research organization, reported consumer confidence fell slightly more than expected in November to 96.1 from its upwardly revised 101.4 in October, driven mostly by worsening forecasts for the months ahead.“Heading into 2021, consumers do not foresee the economy, nor the labor market, gaining strength,” senior director of economic indicators Lynn Franco said.“In addition, the resurgence of Covid-19 is further increasing uncertainty and exacerbating concerns about the outlook.”Within the Dow, industrials and financial companies were the biggest gainers in Tuesday’s session, with Boeing winning 3.3 percent, Chevron 5.0 percent, Goldman Sachs 3.8 percent and JPMorgan Chase 4.6 percent. Other big gainers included Disney, American Express and IBM.Among individual companies, Best Buy dropped 7.0 percent as it reported higher profits on strong sales but declined to offer financial forecasts due to the uncertainty of the pandemic.Dick’s Sporting Goods added 0.3 percent as it announced third-quarter profits more than tripled compared with the year-ago level to $177.2 million behind a 23.2 percent surge in same store sales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dow-hits-30-000-points-for-first-time-as-us-stocks-boom/story-tbLT816g7DiJoztbje2gJK.html

Officials said she is passionate about sharing her experience and knowledge of mindfulness, meditation and personal development with colleagues.“The workshops she has set up help and advise officers and staff – with more than 1,500 benefitting over the last year alone – on how to cope with life’s challenges. SHINE is run by a team of seven officers and the project is continuing to grow due to a huge demand for its services,” Scotland Yard said.Shortly after she launched the project, Deol had brain surgery and later highlighted SHINE’s importance by using the practices and techniques she learnt through the project to cope with the ordeal. The doctors were amazed how quickly she healed, from not being able to talk after surgery to returning to work within three months.Commissioner Cressida Dick said, “The awards celebrate the extraordinary work of our people, who day in, day out, work incredibly hard, protecting and serving the people of London. They include real acts of bravery, but also the complete determination it can take to bring offenders to justice.”She added, “It’s about people pushing themselves to be the best in their field; and about those who have gone above and beyond to protect a victim and get the justice they deserve. I am sure, like me, you will be humbled and inspired by their stories.”The awardees included Baljit Singh Badesha, a special police sergeant in Harrow, Barnet and Brent, who was given the Special Constabulary Award.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scotland-yard-award-for-brinder-deol-a-punjab-origin-constable/story-T80OfYizQXdtAI9QgebnyN.html
25-11-2020||World||Cambridge launches appeal for missing Darwin notebooks||The University of Cambridge’s library on Tuesday launched a public appeal to help locate two notebooks of the iconic naturalist and alumnus, Charles Darwin, one of which contains his landmark 1837 ‘Tree of Life’ sketch, missing since 2001.Following an exhaustive search, the library curators concluded that the priceless notebooks, first listed as missing in January 2001, have likely been stolen, the university said in the appeal on its websiteThe local police have been informed and the missing notebooks added to Interpol’s database of stolen artworks.The appeal launch on November 24 coincides with what is commonly known each year as Evolution Day – recognising the anniversary of Darwin’s publication of On the Origin of Species on November 24, 1859. Darwin (1809-1882) was a student at Christ’s College.Jessica Gardner, university librarian, said: “I am heartbroken that the location of these Darwin notebooks…is currently unknown, but we’re determined to do everything possible to discover what happened and will leave no stone unturned during this process”.“This public appeal could be critical in seeing the notebooks safely return, for the benefit of all, and I would ask anyone who thinks they may be able to help to get in touch. Someone, somewhere, may have knowledge or insight that can help us return these notebooks to their proper place at the heart of the UK’s cultural and scientific heritage.”The library said the notebooks were removed from the Special Collections Strong Rooms– where the rarest and most valuable items are kept – for photography to take place in September 2000, but a subsequent routine check found that the small box containing the two notebooks had not been returned to its proper place.For many years, previous librarians believed that the notebooks had been misplaced in the vast storerooms and collections of the library, which is home to around 10 million books, maps, manuscripts and other objects. Despite a number of searches over the years, they remained undiscovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cambridge-launches-appeal-for-missing-darwin-notebooks/story-z1lexKsvkV7lcSEITZuZ4N.html
