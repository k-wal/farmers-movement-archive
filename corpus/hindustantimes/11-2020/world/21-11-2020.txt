In his first public appearance in days, the outgoing president falsely claimed once again he had won. It was a briefing on pricing of medicines but he took no questions.Trump has refused to admit defeat, launched legal challenges that have all fallen without impacting outcome, and his lawyers and allies have taken to citing conspiracy theories that have together tainted the election among the president’s supporters who, polls show, believe it was unfair.The Trump administration has refused to cooperate with the incoming Biden team, which has had to resort to workarounds to prepare itself to take charge on January 20, inauguration day. Biden met a bipartisan group of governors to discuss Covid-19, which he has said will be a top priority for his administration.He has also continued to announce members of his team. Indian American Mala Adiga was named on Friday as policy director to Jill Biden, the incoming first lady. She is a lawyer who earlier served in the departments of state and justice in the Obama administration, and had worked on the 2008 Obama-Biden campaign.The president-elect is expected to name members of his cabinet around Thanksgiving next week, and Vivek Murthy, another Indian American, is among leading contenders for secretary of health and human services. The former US surgeon general currently co-chairs Biden’s advisory team on Covid-19.Biden has also met CEOs and business leaders and the US chamber of commerce, the most powerful lobbyist for the private sector, has urged the president to start the transition process without any delay. Republican governors, who are critics of the president, have also joined in.The public face of the Trump administration’s obduracy is Emily Murphy, a Trump-appointee who heads the federal General Services Administration, which must under law officially issue an “ascertainment” recognising Biden’s election to kickstart the transition process. She has refused thus far.Asked if the Biden administration can get access to everything that they needed pending that ascertainment, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Friday that the administration has done “everything statutorily required, and we will continue to do that”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-attempts-to-overturn-poll-outcome-fail-biden-forges-ahead/story-jodf50mExXSTzxUGeUOtgM.html
21-11-2020||World||Trump tweets about voter ‘Fraud’ during G-20 opening meeting||As leaders from across the globe began a virtual summit discussing issues from the coronavirus pandemic to climate change, Donald Trump’s thoughts were elsewhere -- on the tussle over the US election.The president kept his head down, staring at something on his desk out of sight during a nine-minute speech on Saturday by Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz, who welcomed countries taking part in a meeting of the Group of 20 nations hosted by his kingdom. The speech and footage of other leaders was shown live on the official G-20 website.Then, within moments of the monarch ending his remarks, Trump tweeted to comment on an encounter with Republican leaders of the Michigan state legislature. He promised: “We will show massive and unprecedented fraud!”Trump’s post was in response to a tweet by Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, who met Trump at the White House on Friday along with House Speaker Lee Chatfield. “We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan,” Shirkey and Chatfield wrote in a joint statement.Trump went on to send further tweets alleging voter fraud and commenting on his son, who has been diagnosed with Covid. That’s even as leaders continued their discussions in private.The optics underscored Trump’s disinterest in such forums, with the president often clashing with other leaders during the past four years, especially on issues such as multilateralism, climate change and international trade.Trump subsequently gave his own opening remarks to the summit, where he said the US under his watch had made the world safer, strengthening NATO, defeating Islamic State and fighting terrorism, according to a European official with knowledge of the proceedings. He claimed America had been efficient in fighting the pandemic while touting low unemployment and what he said was surging demand in the US economy.Specifically on a Covid-19 vaccine, Trump repeated his long-held stance that “every American” who wanted one should have access, according to another official with knowledge of his remarks -- implying such shots should be optional. Unlike other leaders in their comments to the meeting, Trump did not speak of the need to share vaccines around the world, especially with poorer nations.After delivering his remarks to the summit, Trump left the White House shortly afterward for his Virginia golf club.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-tweets-about-voter-fraud-during-g-20-opening-meeting/story-UqO0QFZQ5rwDFGVteVK5NM.html

The Friday’s visit amounts to an acknowledgment of both the democratic system of CTA and its political head.Sangay was invited to the US State Department for the first time in 60 years last month.The CTA informed that Dr Sangay met with White House officials, and prior to this meeting, he had met them in undisclosed meetings and locations over a dozen times in the past 10 years since he became the CTA’s Sikyong in 2011.“Though he nears the end of his term as the Sikyong of the Central Tibetan Administration, Dr. Sangay has tirelessly advocated for the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019,” said the release.Earlier this week, Dr Sangay held several virtual meetings, through which he discussed Tibetan Policy and Support Act (TPSA) and other matters with the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China Chairman Jim McGovern and senior Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffers, both on the Republican and Democrat side.Representative Ngodup Tsering and Kelsang Dolma had also accompanied Dr Sangay on these meetings.In October, after Sangay was invited by the State Department, the Chinese government has asked the US to stop interfering in China’s internal affairs or undermining the development and stability of the country’s Tibet region.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing on Tuesday that Destro “violated the commitment and the policy stance of the US side on not supporting Tibet’s independence and not acknowledging this government in exile”.

It is one reason why so many countries’ financial systems are exposed to money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing. Yet even as the G20 publicly calls for the full implementation of Financial Action Task Force standards around the globe, not all G20 members have taken effective action to make a real difference,” Pleyer wrote in his article titled ‘Lead by Example’.The FATF president added that money laundering is not a “victimless crime” and the ramifications of ineffective action are real. “Failing to take action means organised criminals trafficking people, drugs, arms and wildlife, and corrupt stakeholders and terrorists, operating with impunity,” he added.“Taking the profits out of these crimes will protect people, the environment and the economy. The G20 must start leading by example and act now to stop money laundering. G20 members must root out criminality by tracing illegal profits,” the President wrote further.This year’s G-20 Summit is being held via video conferencing which began on Saturday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald among several other leaders sharing the platform.

21-11-2020||World||China’s Sinopharm says almost a million people inoculated with experimental Covid-19 vaccine||Nearly a million people have taken an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by Chinese company Sinopharm, the firm said, although it has not yet provided any clear clinical evidence of efficacy.China has been giving experimental Covid-19 vaccines to people including state employees, international students and essential workers heading abroad since July.Sinopharm’s chairman told media this week that nearly a million people have now received their vaccine for emergency use, though he did not provide a specific figure.“We have not received a single report of severe adverse reaction, and only a few had some mild symptoms,” Liu Jingzhen said in an interview re-published by the state-owned firm on Wednesday.China has been bullish about the development of its vaccine for the new virus -- which first emerged in the centre of the country late last year -- with four vaccines now in late-stage testing.Many of the trials are taking place overseas, as China has largely brought the virus under control within its borders.Sinopharm is testing two vaccines in late-stage trials in countries including the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina.The company claimed this week to be “leading the world in all aspects” of vaccine development, although it did not offer clinical evidence from ongoing trials.Instead it cited anecdotal experiences from those who have been inoculated, including “construction personnel, diplomats, and overseas students” who it said have gone on to visit more than 150 countries after vaccination without being infected.President Xi Jinping has declared that any Chinese vaccine would be a “global public good”, after the country came under criticism, particularly from the US, for its early handling of the outbreak.Many who have been inoculated in China are not formal participants in drugmakers’ trials and are said to have done so voluntarily.Competition has intensified among pharmaceutical companies racing to develop a Covid-19 shot, with two vaccines -- one by US company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and another by US firm Moderna -- publishing large-scale trial data this month that showed their jabs were around 95 percent effective against Covid-19.bys/rox/ohoPFIZERBioNTech||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-sinopharm-says-almost-a-million-people-inoculated-with-experimental-covid-19-vaccine/story-mF1bMhysC9I7gPX5miAGxO.html
21-11-2020||World||China used Covid-19 for strategic gains in Indo-Pacific: Think-tank||China used the Covid-19 crisis for strategic gains across the Indo-Pacific region, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) has said in a report which noted that the pandemic was replete with “significant” geopolitical ramifications.China’s increasingly active drive and India’s rivalry with Pakistan will continue to dominate the regional security environment when the pandemic dies down, said Strategic Survey 2020: The Annual Assessment of Geopolitics, which was launched virtually on Friday.“Competition intensified in the region. Beijing seemed steadily more intent on asserting strategic primacy in its maritime littoral. The US government…saw evidence that China was taking advantage of other governments’ preoccupation with the Covid-19 pandemic to gain strategic advantage throughout what the US, its allies and other states including India and Indonesia increasingly referred to as the Indo-Pacific region”, it said.In South Asia, according to IISS, the pandemic severely disrupted economies and tested governance and public-health infrastructure. Densely populated urban areas, poverty and poor sanitation, weak public health systems, and low testing rates by Asian standards challenged the region’s ability to limit infections and deaths.Reviewing the events and issues related to the changed constitutional realities in Jammu and Kashmir, the think-tank concluded that during the year, although India’s actions resulted in greater international attention, Indian diplomacy successfully ensured that it remained a bilateral issue with Pakistan and avoided international mediation.Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, senior fellow for South Asia at IISS, said: “In effect, for 2021, India is likely to see the resumption of ‘hard power’ geo-politics amidst growing Sino-Pakistani security convergences and relative neglect by the US and the ‘Quad’ countries [India, US, Australia, Japan] ....a tough year, amidst a dramatically weakened economy.”In his perception, South Asia’s geopolitics in 2021 will be shaped by US president-elect Biden’s relative neglect of the region (in view of his domestic priorities and foreign policy constraints with a likely Republican-controlled Senate).It will also be shaped, he added, by continuing Chinese assertiveness on the Sino-Indian border amidst growing influence amidst India’s neighbours and in the Indian Ocean due to regional economies weakened by the impact of Covid-19; and a decreasing focus on the Indo-Pacific from a ‘free and open’ region to one of ‘security and prosperity’ by the US and Japan.“As a result, for India, its key priorities will be: to adroitly counter the repercussions of a political transition in Afghanistan and resultant loss in influence, by seeking to engage with a likely Taliban-dominated Afghan government to prevent ‘safe haven’ for anti-India terrorists while attempting to shield itself from a possible civil war in Afghanistan; counter Chinese assertive policy by building on its own economic and military capabilities and focusing on extending its influence and leverage in the Indian Ocean; and managing tensions with Pakistan with the possibility of an escalation of conflict”, Roy-Chaudhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-used-covid-19-for-strategic-gains-in-indo-pacific-think-tank/story-lLocRwlSLs9ueqZnr3B5cN.html
21-11-2020||World||Iran closes businesses, curtails travel amid coronavirus surge||Iran on Saturday shuttered businesses and curtailed travel between its major cities, including the capital of Tehran, as it grapples with the worst outbreak of the coronavirus in the Mideast region.Top Iranian officials initially downplayed the risks posed by the virus outbreak, before recently urging the public to follow measures like wearing masks and avoiding unessential travel.Iran has recorded daily death tolls of above 430 over the past five days. The Iranian Health Ministry said on Saturday that the total number of confirmed cases has risen to above 840,000.The new lockdown measures, which include shuttering most businesses, shops, malls, and restaurants, include Iran’s largest cities of Mashhad, Isfahan, and Shiraz. Iranian authorities have designated the nearly 160 towns and cities affected as hot spots because these urban centers have the highest daily per capita positive coronavirus test results.On Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a televised speech urged people to follow the measures to help “lessen the death toll.” He added that the government plans to supply cash subsidies to Iran’s 30 million poorest people for four months to help them to manage the economic fallout from the new outbreak.The latest round of restrictions to stem the outbreak came as a spat among top Iranian health officials led to the resignation of at least two officials.Iranian newspapers said Saturday that the deputy health minister in charge of research, Reza Malekzadeh, resigned from his post in reaction to recent remarks by the Minister of Health Saeed Namaki, who said government-led research projects were not successfully addressing the current needs of the ministry.In reply, Malekzadeh in his resignation letter criticized public mismanagement of the virus outbreak by the minister.“The pandemic’s very wrong management that was caused by a lack of consultation and paying attention to warnings from experts has led to a large number of human deaths,” Malekzadeh said in his statement.Iranian news websites also said that Ali Nobakht, an advisor to the health minister, resigned over similar reasons, without providing further details.In Tehran, the head of the city’s chamber of commerce, Qassem Nodeh, said that the restrictions will lead to the closure of 70% of business in the capital and its surrounding areas.Manoochehr Nassiri, who runs a lighting shop in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, complained about the closures.“We shop owners don’t know what to do, considering the economic situation of the country,” he said standing outside his shuttered store.The closures are set to last two weeks but can be automatically extended.Beginning on Saturday, government offices that provide essential public services —including banks, post offices, communications and utilities services —will continue their work with half of the regular number of staff. All other government offices will continue working with one third of their staff.All schools in the capital will also be closed and required to switch to virtual instruction by Internet. Authorities will also close shrines in Tehran and cancel mass prayers in mosques, though it was not immediately clear if the same restrictions would apply in other cities, including the holy city of Mashhad.Any travel between the affected cities by private car is also suspended. Public transportation will be available but the use of private cars is banned between 9 p.m. to 4 a.m.People who have tested positive for the virus are required to stay at home and can face a roughly $8 cash fine if they appear in public.Media organizations, construction jobs, agriculture, heavy industry, and services for the elderly and assisted living are largely exempt from the closures.Iran has avoided the full lockdowns seen in other countries as it struggles to keep its faltering economy alive in the face of crushing U.S. sanctions. President Donald Trump re-imposed sweeping sanctions on the country after withdrawing from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-closes-businesses-curtails-travel-amid-coronavirus-surge/story-sZ4hMpaYuGqIkdxDcHEhUN.html
21-11-2020||World||UK signs trade deal with Canada to prepare for Brexit||The UK signed an interim trade deal with Canada on Saturday, the second major agreement the country has reached as negotiators hurry to cement trading relationships in preparation for life outside the European Union.While Britain formally withdrew from the EU in January, it continues to trade with other countries under the bloc’s umbrella during a transition period that is scheduled to end Dec. 31. Without a series of new bilateral agreements, trade with countries around the world may be hampered by barriers such as tariffs and increased paperwork.The UK government says the stopgap agreement paves the way for future negotiations on a new tailor-made UK-Canada trade deal.“This is is a fantastic agreement for Britain which secures trans-Atlantic trade with one of our closest allies. British businesses export everything from electric cars to sparkling wine to Canada, and today’s deal will ensure that trade goes from strength to strength,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.“Our negotiators have been working flat-out to secure trade deals for the UK, and from as early next year we have agreed to start work on a new, bespoke trade deal with Canada that will go even further in meeting the needs of our economy.”The deal with Canada follows an agreement struck last month with Japan, which largely replicated existing trading arrangements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-signs-trade-deal-with-canada-to-prepare-for-brexit/story-Cu5V5SMTBexgtxiAjQE8IO.html
21-11-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine updates: How Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate has taken the lead||American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech are racing against time to get their vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) approved now that final trial results have shown that their candidate has an efficacy rate of 95 per cent. Countries all over the globe are rolling out detailed roadmaps for immunisation and Pfizer has secured its rightful place in it.Here are the latest updates on the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine1. Britain has formally asked its medical regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), to assess the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for its suitability, the very first step in making the shot available outside of the United States. Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, which has been found to be 95% effective in preventing the spread of a virus that has killed more than 1.3 million worldwide. Britain expects to have 10 million doses of the vaccine, enough to protect 5 million people, by the end of the year if regulators approve it.2. Spain has announced its plan to vaccinate a majority of the population by mid-2021. Pfizer and BioNTech have taken the lead alongside US firm Moderna in the race for immunisation in Europe. The Spanish government has been working on a plan for vaccination since September. 3. Both the pharmaceutical companies sought approval on Friday to roll out their Covid-19 vaccine early, a first step towards relief as surging infections prompt a return to shutdowns that traumatised nations and the global economy earlier this year. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said its vaccines committee would meet on December 10 to discuss the request for emergency use authorisation4. Pfizer is eyeing a rapid roll out of coronavirus vaccine in Latin America once it gets emergency authorization from the US. The firm was aiming to supply around 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year, said Alejandro Cané, the North America chief of scientific and medical affairs for Pfizer’s vaccines division, adding that the under trial vaccine candidate had shown high efficacy across different ethnicities. Pfizer/BioNTech said doses of the vaccine would be ready for distribution “within hours” after US authorisation, which could mean shipments beginning in the second half of December. They would initially be provided by a US factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and a Belgian plant in Puurs.5. The Netherlands is all set to rollout coronavirus vaccines to some 3.5 million people in the first quarter of next year, the health minister announced on Friday. It has concluded deals for vaccines with five manufacturers: AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Janssen, CureVac and Sanofi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-updates-how-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-candidate-has-taken-the-lead/story-NfwaOSBNXO4bX1bVRGnmdK.html
21-11-2020||World||Supporters in Pakistan mourn the death of radical cleric who protested against France||Tens of thousands of supporters on Saturday thronged the funeral of a radical cleric whose Islamist party has defended Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy law that calls for the death penalty for insulting Islam.The mourners gathered in the eastern city of Lahore, where the Islamist scholar and leader, Khadim Hussein Rizvi, died two days ago at the age of 54.Rizvi’s party, Tehreek-e-Labiak, holds only two seats in parliament, but his movement has repeatedly pressed its cause by staging large-scale demonstrations.Rizvi led last Sunday thousands of his followers at a sit-in in the capital of Islamabad protesting the republishing in France of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, which he deemed blasphemous. Demonstrators briefly clashed with security forces at the rally, which was one in a wave of protests across the country expressing outrage over the caricatures.Pakistan’s government promised on Tuesday that the protesters’ demands for cutting diplomatic ties with France and expelling the French ambassador would be discussed in parliament soon. A spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Labiak, said the government had also agreed to release any party members detained at the recent protests.The radical Islamist party gained prominence in Pakistan’s 2018 elections, campaigning on a single-point agenda of defending the country’s blasphemy law.In November 2017, its followers staged a 21-day protest and sit-in after a reference to the sanctity of the Prophet Muhammad was removed from the text of a government form.Rizvi led the protests last year, after Pakistani authorities freed Aasia Bibi, a Christian Pakistani woman held on death row for eight years on charges of committing blasphemy. A court acquitted her but she had to flee to Canada after threats to her life.The prophet caricatures published in France sparked protests across Asia and the Middle East, with calls for the boycott of French products. They were also seen as the trigger for several deadly attacks against French nationals and interests in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supporters-in-pakistan-mourn-the-death-of-radical-cleric-who-protested-against-france/story-7miNPXN0FtNUX38Au7GK6L.html
21-11-2020||World||Pakistan’s FATF future seems grim with its continuous involvement in Afghanistan||While Pakistan retained its position on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) grey list and was given another opportunity to avoid being dragged down to the blacklist, its continuous involvement along the border with Afghanistan may not bode well for its future in terms of its FATF status aspirations.A few days before its full-scale review meeting, the FATF had reprimanded Pakistan for its ‘meagre progress’ in combating terror financing and money laundering, while the FATF’s Asia-Pacific Group (APG) had expressed dissatisfaction as Pakistan has so far only complied to only two of the 40 recommendations provided to address issues of anti-money laundering and combating financing terror, reported Don McLain Gill for Centre for Peace Asia.It is believed that the concessions granted to Pakistan have a lot to do with the presumption that Pakistan will toe a supporting line with the US amidst the crucial peace deal with the Taliban. However, shreds of evidence received from multiple intelligence reports suggest that Pakistan has starting nesting terror networks in Taliban safe havens of Afghanistan.Also Read | Pak opposition slams Imran Khan-led govt for failing to exit from FATF grey listThe Centre for Peace Asia wrote that although Pakistan has desperately tried to erase its footprints through its alleged ‘crackdown on terrorism’, evidence has pointed out that the relatively ‘unruled areas’ along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, particularly in the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktia, Khost, Paktika, Zabul and Kandhar in eastern Afghanistan have enabled Pakistan to set-up terror training camps and bases, with the active support and cooperation from the Taliban, Haqqani Network and Al-Qaeda.It can be assumed that a nexus has developed between the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, Haqqani Network, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) along with the Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-KP) in the region. Moreover, Pakistani agencies’ links with the IS-KP, the Haqqani Network, JeM and LeT remain exposed in recent times if some scattered dots are to be joined.Huzaifa al-Bakistani, who was killed in a drone strike in Nangarhar province was an ex-LeT member, who along with his father-in-law Aijaz Ahangar (Usman al Kashmiri), an ISKP leader and ex-member of Pakistan-backed groups, namely Tehreek-ul- Mujahideen (TuM) and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM), was looking after India-centric affairs of IS.The recent Jalalabad Jail attack in August 2020 was a joint effort of sections affiliated with the Pakistani agencies, ISKP and HQN which worked very closely.The threads associating Pakistani agencies with the IS-KP became more apparent after the arrest of Maulavi Abdullah Orakzai alias Aslam Farooqi on April 4, 2020. This galvanized Pakistan authorities to summon the Afghan Ambassador to Pakistan to seek custody of Aslam Farooqi. Pakistan reportedly claimed Farooqi on the grounds that he had committed acts of violence against the Pakistani state. However, Kabul refused to concede to the request, wrote Center for Peace Asia.These proxies, having lines of communication to Pakistan have planned on targeting Indian interests in Afghanistan such as the recent attack in the Sikh Shrine.Also Read | Erdogan’s Turkey sole supporter of Pak for removal from Grey List at FATF Paris PlenaryWhile Pakistan’s symbiotic relationship with the Taliban in Afghanistan is a dire necessity for gaining strategic depth against India, a renewal of the Afghan-Pak terror nexus may not go down well for peace in this already troubled Asian region.This series of events does not bode well for Pakistan’s desire to achieve a favourable status as an advocate of counter-terrorism, instead, this is only going to further complicate its standing in the FATF.Gill wrote that there would be much pressure put on the government to deal with Pakistan’s grey list status in the long term. Pakistan is clearly treading a complex path towards its goals of escaping the FATF grey list especially with its indirect involvement in Afghanistan.The country must significantly address the issues of terror support and financing while adhering to FATF recommendations to have the slightest chance of improving its status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-fatf-future-seems-grim-with-its-continuous-involvement-in-afghanistan/story-gOJaKSPlfb7c77pC2jr8jI.html
21-11-2020||World||UK to buy a million doses of AstraZeneca’s antibody treatment||The UK has agreed to buy a million doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 antibody treatment if it succeeds in Phase 3 trials.The company is recruiting 5,000 participants globally to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination, called AZD7442, to prevent infection for up to 12 months in people who can’t be given vaccines or don’t respond well to them.Long-acting antibodies can potentially “treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected with the virus,” the company said in a joint statement with the UK government. The antibody can also be taken prior to exposure to the virus, and can be complementary to a vaccine.AstraZeneca is playing catch-up as it prepares to report key findings from the vaccine it’s developing with the University of Oxford. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE requested emergency authorization of their Covid vaccine, shown to be 95% effective, in the US on Friday. Moderna Inc. has also released positive interim results from a final-stage trial.“As we move closer to a Covid-19 vaccine, we must keep driving forward clinical trials for new and alternative treatments that protect our vulnerable, particularly those who cannot receive a vaccine,” U.K. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-buy-a-million-doses-of-astrazeneca-s-antibody-treatment/story-hfdplUBqfTSiasUlGfMnjK.html
21-11-2020||World||US vow of early exit from Afghanistan raises threat of resurgent Taliban||Afghanistan’s government is struggling to maintain its grip on power after President Donald Trump’s decision to accelerate US troop withdrawal from the war-torn nation emboldened the Taliban and other militant groups.The United Nations has noted a dramatic surge in violence since Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani’s government and the Taliban began peace talks in September, ranging from attacks on Afghan army bases to attempts to capture key cities including Kandahar. Terrorists have launched assaults on Kabul University and other educational centers, killing dozens of students and on Saturday, unknown assailants fired a deadly barrage of rockets that struck residential areas in the capital.Trump’s decision to drawdown US troops sooner, especially without any reciprocity from the Taliban, gives militants a free hand to try and gain control over the country by violent means, according to Michael Kugelman, senior associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center in Washington. Meanwhile, expecting a surge in violence, many Afghans are fleeing the nation.“The prospects of civil war increase when the US troop presence is no more,” Kugelman said, adding that the absence of American air power opens up the possibility of the insurgent group making a push into cities. “Once the Taliban starts taking urban territory, it will be easier to gain more political power, and from that point it’s easier to seize power on the whole.”Some of the recent violence has been blamed on the Taliban, who have ignored Ghani’s warnings about using the attacks to gain leverage in the peace talks. The Islamic State, active in several parts of the country, has claimed responsibility for other attacks.Also Read |  Mortar shells hit Kabul residential areas; at least 8 deadExperts and even some top officials in Ghani’s administration have warned that even worse scenarios are possible.Afghanistan’s National Security Adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, last month warned that the surging violence and the American departure could result in “civil war.”Meanwhile, Afghans have been voting with their feet.In a quiet exodus driven by an absence of hope, nearly half of all refugee arrivals in Greece are from Afghanistan, which by the end of last year was the country with the highest number of migrants, according to International Organization of Migration figures.“We’re all in a limbo now,” said Kamila Zafari, 24, a student at Kabul University. “The country has weak leadership but a strong Taliban who know only killing. In this anarchic situation, the US leaving further adds to our desperation and fears.”The militant group has welcomed the news that the US will reduce troops from about 4,500 to 2,500 by Jan 15, with Trump looking to a complete withdrawal by May 2021 to deliver on his longtime pledge to exit from his country’s “endless wars.”“The new US administration should focus on the implementation of the US-Taliban agreement as it the most reasonable and effective tool for ending the war between our countries,” Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid said about President-elect Joe Biden, in a WhatsApp message this week. The Taliban seek “positive relations” with all countries including the U.S. in the future, he said.Fears, DesperationAfter being toppled by the US invasion in 2001, the Taliban were pushed to the margins, before starting to regroup in 2004. They re-emerged as a potent threat to the US and its Afghan government allies since 2009 and now control about half the country.The Ghani administration and the insurgents have been locked in a delicate dance, made more complicated by the peace deal the Taliban entered with the US in February. That agreement paved the way for the start of the US-brokered talks between the government and militants in Doha on Sept. 12. Those have made little headway with both sides failing to agree on even the most basic issues so far.And while the Doha process plays in the background, both sides remain bitter antagonists on the ground in Afghanistan.The Taliban haven’t minced words in denouncing the officials and troops working for Ghani’s government as un-Islamic mercenaries whose “killing is not prohibited.”Also Read | US decision to reduce troops in Afghanistan, Iraq draws ireWhile some in the Afghan government, like Mohib, have voiced concerns about the growing intransigence of the Taliban, others have tried to downplay the impact of the US troop cuts and early departure.The country’s acting Defense Minister, Asadullah Khalid, told parliament on Tuesday that Afghan troops were now carrying out almost all counter-terrorism operations on their own. He cited major attacks in Helmand and Kandahar last month where government soldiers were able to kill thousands of Taliban militants in a weeks long standoff.But the government is also still holding onto hopes that American influence may turn the intra-Afghan peace talks around. The country’s Second Vice-President, Mohammad Sarwar Danish, recently called on the new US administration to “fully review” the peace talks and pressure the Taliban to give in and accept a cease-fire.“The Taliban have become very powerful and now control many remote areas despite the presence of NATO, US, and the Afghan government,” said Ahmad Saeedi, an independent political analyst in Kabul and a former Afghan diplomat in Pakistan. “Ghani’s government alone seems to be unable to stop Taliban ambitions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vow-of-early-exit-from-afghanistan-raises-threat-of-resurgent-taliban/story-wuh2xgLFusn6VxgStIFdNO.html
21-11-2020||World||Pakistani opposition warns of ‘street battles’ if force used to stop Peshawar rally||The opposition’s Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on Friday vowed to defy government ban on its public gathering in Peshawar on Sunday and warned the district administration that use of force to stop the protesting citizens could spark street battles.While speaking at a joint press conference at the Peshawar Press Club, the representatives of the opposition parties declared that rallies across the country will be held as the PDM planned, until Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government is removed, reported Dawn.This came after the Peshawar deputy commissioner had refused to allow the opposition to hold their rally scheduled for November 22 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.“The COVID-19 positivity rate [in] District Peshawar has presently exceeded 13 per cent, which is alarmingly high and any large public gathering is likely to further increase the spread of life-threatening virus. The undersigned regrets to inform you that permission for the said event has not been granted,” Dawn quoted the Peshawar deputy commissioner, reported Dawn.Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) central information secretary Dr Nafeesa Shah at a separate presser also warned the government against playing with the emotions of the masses, asking the administration to allow the 11-party opposition alliance to hold its Peshawar rally in a ‘peaceful’ manner.Expressing serious concern over the increasing prices of life-saving drugs, food items and other essential commodities, Dr Shah said the existing inflation was the outcome of bad governance.She further added the government was trying to hide behind the pandemic but warned that it would not find any route to escape.The PPP leader also alleged that the recent Gilgit-Baltistan election once again proved that the PTI had come to power through election engineering.Meanwhile, several other opposition leaders also condemned the administration for turning down the permission for the Sunday gathering during the press conference, and said the rulers were using different pretexts to disturb the people’s movement against the government, according to Dawn.They further warned the government that any attempt to create hurdles in the holding of PDM’s meetings would spark street protests.“We are ready to go to extreme point against government,” said Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter chief Senator Maulana Atta-ur-Rehman.The PDM had earlier held massive rallies in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan, demanding Prime Minister Imran Khan’s resignation.Meanwhile, opposition candidates have led protests in Gilgit Baltistan, who accuse the local election commission of delaying and manipulating the results of Sunday’s polls to favour Imran Khan’s PTI party.

21-11-2020||World||Trump administration has done ‘everything required’ in event of transition, says White House||The Trump administration has done “everything statutorily required” to do in the event of a transition, the White House has said, asserting that a constitutional process is being played out to determine the winner of the November 3 presidential election.Click here for full US Election 2020 coverageIncumbent US President Donald Trump, a Republican, has refused to concede the election to 78-year-old Joe Biden, a Democrat, and has filed multiple lawsuits challenging the poll results in several states. Trump, 74, has made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence.Former US vice president Biden was declared the winner of the closely-fought US presidential election on November 7. Biden now has 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232 votes. To win the race to the White House, the successful candidate should have at least 270 electoral votes out of the 538-member Electoral College. His lead in the public vote overall stands at more than 5.9 million.Backing President’s Trump’s stance, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany refused to acknowledge President-elect Biden’s victory in a press briefing on Friday— her first press briefing since October 1 and since President Trump lost the election. “The president’s been very clear, he wants every legal vote to be counted,” McEnany said. She did not say when Trump would concede, but said there were “very real claims” of voter fraud without identifying any evidence. “There is a Presidential Transition Act that determines exactly what an administration needs to do in advance of an election. And we have done everything statutorily required, and we will continue to do that,” McEnany asserted. Biden is set to take office on January 20 as the 46th US president.Meanwhile, after a string of court defeats in his efforts to challenge the election results, Trump’s team is hoping to convince legislatures controlled by his fellow Republicans in key states to ignore the outcome and declare him the victor, according to multiple US media outlets.In the absence of certification of the election and conceding by President Trump, the General Services Administration (GSA) has refrained from taking the steps necessary to ensure smooth transition of power to the incoming Biden administration, including the release of over USD 9 million for the Congressional-mandated transition team. Emily Murphy, the Administrator of the GSA, a Trump appointee, is yet to formally recognise Biden’s victory, thus denying him access to contacts with federal agencies and access to classified intelligence briefings. The delayed transition has sparked concerns about national security and the impacts it could have on the incoming Biden administration’s Covid-19 response, especially the distribution of a vaccine.“The GSA will make the determination of ascertainment at the right moment. Right now, there is a constitutional process that is being played out. There are questions being asked in court. But the GSA will determine when ascertainment is reached,” McEnany said in response to a question.There is ongoing litigation, she emphasised.“What we know, 74 million Americans voted for this President, that is more votes any President has got in history. It is really extraordinary. There are very real claims out there that the campaign is pursuing -- 234 pages of affidavits publicly available in one county alone; that is Wayne County. And two individuals in the canvassing board there that have declined to certify,” she said, referring to the most populous county in the US state of Michigan.Democrats accuse Trump of abusing his office by trying to pressure the legislators to subvert the will of voters and seat their own electors to the Electoral College, which gathers on December 14. Amid the row with Trump, President-elect Biden has sought to plough on with the transition, this week announcing appointments and meeting national security experts.On Friday Biden met two top Democratic legislators, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, to discuss how to help “struggling working families and small businesses” during the worsening coronavirus outbreak.

Future discussions will alternate between the US and Taipei, Brent Christensen, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, said in a briefing in Taipei on Saturday.Both sides agreed that strategic cooperation on the semiconductor industry is a mutual priority, and will push for further collaboration in supply chains, science and technology, 5G and telecommunications security and global health. The talks were led by US State Department Undersecretary of State Keith Krach and Taiwanese minister John Deng.The agreement can be extended another five years once the current pact is over, Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said, adding he was confident the MOU would be supported by the next US administration.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo launched the Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue with Taiwan in an effort to bolster cooperation. The talks follow repeated calls from Washington and Taipei for negotiations over a formal trade deal with Taiwan.Last month, 50 senators signed a letter urging US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to begin talks with Taipei. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen echoed the call earlier this week, saying a trade deal would further strengthen the complementary nature of the two economies.Also Read |  Taiwan ‘confident’ over trade deal with new US government under President-elect Joe BidenPressure on Lighthizer to begin trade talks has increased since Tsai lifted Taiwan’s restrictions on the import of US pork and beef in August, a long-standing impediment to a free-trade agreement with the US Since then, the Taiwanese government, industry groups and US political figures had urged the Office of the US Trade Representative to start talks with Taiwan. The USTR has so far given no indication it intends to do so.China has repeatedly signaled its displeasure over improving ties between Washington and Taipei. When Krach visited Taiwan in September, China called the trip a political provocation and sent military aircraft over the median line of the Taiwan Strait.China’s ruling Communist Party in Beijing claims the democratically ruled island as part of its territory despite never having controlled it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/u-s-taiwan-sign-pact-to-hold-annual-economic-talks-for-5-years/story-yHHNszsRASV1sccYebrs4M.html

No one took immediate responsibility for the early morning attack that also targeted the posh Wazir Akbar Khan area of Kabul, which houses diplomatic missions.The Taliban issued a quick statement denying any responsibility for the attack. The Islamic State group affiliate also operates in the area and has claimed responsibility for recent assaults in Kabul including two devastating attacks on educational institutions that killed more than 50 people, many of them students.As well as insurgent groups, there are several heavily armed warlords with militias living in Kabul with long-standing animosities against each other.The mortar barrage comes as representatives of the Afghan government and the Taliban continued to hold talks in Qatar, though progress has been slow. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to press for a reduction in violence in his meetings with both Taliban and government negotiating teams later Saturday during a daylong stop in Doha. The Taliban have mostly ignored such previous requests.Hours before the attack rattled Kabul, a bomb attached to a car killed one security personnel and wounded three others in an eastern neighborhood of the capital, said Kabul police spokesperson Ferdaws Faramarz.Violence in Afghanistan has spiked in recent months with increasingly horrific attacks often claimed by the Islamic State group affiliate. Still the Taliban have been waging near daily assaults on beleaguered Afghan security forces.There have been increasing calls for a cease-fire if peace talks are to continue. The Taliban have been steadfast in their refusal, demanding that any cease-fire be part of the negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mortar-shells-hit-kabul-residential-areas-at-least-8-dead/story-bAz18BqLBOhHDJ9dV32swJ.html
21-11-2020||World||Germany may extend lockdown to slow Covid-19 spread before Christmas||Germany’s partial lockdown may be extended well into next month as Europe’s biggest economy seeks to regain control over the spread of the coronavirus before people head home for the holidays.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Officials are beginning to assume that the current curbs will have to be extended and are aiming to see them lifted shortly before the holiday period, according to a person familiar with the matter.State leaders are considering reopening hotels and restaurants at least during the lucrative Christmas and New Year period so they can generate much-needed sales, the person said, declining to be identified because the talks are private. Officials would look at reinstating the controls in January if the infection rate is still considered to be too high, the person added.More than two weeks into a partial shutdown -- which closed museums, bars and restaurants but kept schools and most shops open -- Germany’s contagion rates are still above the level that authorities have determined to be manageable, raising the prospect of tougher curbs over the festive period. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier entered quarantine on Friday after contact with an infected colleague, though Altmaier himself has tested negative.Still, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the one-month circuit breaker is effective and managed to “break the exponential growth” in new infections. “We agree that this is not enough, but it has succeeded -- once again,” Die Welt quoted the minister as saying.Also Read | Germany to prioritize vaccinations in care homesGermany added nearly 23,000 new coronavirus infections as of Saturday morning, lifting total cases to more than 900,000. The regions of Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony posted the highest infection rates recently, and the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care has “risen sharply” since mid-October, the Berlin-based Robert Koch Institute said.Government PlanChancellor Angela Merkel will meet with state leaders on Wednesday to lay out a long-term plan to fight the pandemic under mounting pressure to lift restrictions. The German leader drew widespread criticism from state leaders this week for proposing that children be limited to just a single playmate and that face masks should be mandatory in schools.There is far-reaching consensus that Germany’s lockdown should be prolonged until Dec 20, Berliner Morgenpost reported earlier, citing people from the state government in Berlin whom it didn’t identify.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-may-extend-lockdown-to-slow-covid-19-spread-before-christmas/story-Cfx2maJvlNwKSut7NZVnWJ.html

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Beijing in July of violating Tibetan human rights and said Washington supported “meaningful autonomy” for the region.Beijing officials have since accused the United States of using Tibet to try to promote “splittism” in China. China has also refused to engage with Destro.China seized control over Tibet in 1950 in what it described as a “peaceful liberation” that helped it throw off its “feudalist past”, but critics led by the exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama say Beijing’s rule amounts to “cultural genocide”.Chinese President Xi Jinping said in August that China needed to build an “impregnable fortress” in Tibet in order to protect national unity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tibetan-political-leader-visits-white-house-for-first-time-in-6-decades/story-jCaLlTZC6jPZnM7waFG5DK.html

Confirmed cases touched 320,417 on Friday, up nearly 5,000 over the previous day and a nearly 40% spike over a fortnight. Deaths stood at 11,334, with the daily toll going up by over 50% when compared to 14 days earlier.The provincial government of Ontario announced new lockdown measures beginning Monday including in Toronto. In-restaurant services will cease and non-essential businesses and malls will be impacted. These measures will remain in place for up to 28 days.Trudeau also supported the re-imposition of restrictive measures in the coronavirus hotspots. “Going into lockdowns and supporting businesses while we’re in that lockdown is a better way of ensuring their success in a few months, in a few years, than trying to tough through a virus that is running around unchecked.”Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr Theresa Tam asked for “urgency” from the public to limit their contacts, adding, “We’re not on a good trajectory.”In returning to the daily coronavirus update similar to this spring when cases first emerged, Trudeau said he was using his voice and position as PM to send out a clear message that “we’re in a serious situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/normal-christmas-out-of-question-says-trudeau-as-toronto-set-to-enter-lockdown/story-8I7ACaKGeJ9dcuNOUyX6MP.html
21-11-2020||World||Recent breakthroughs on Covid-19 vaccines offer ray of hope: UN chief Guterres||UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has described the recent breakthroughs towards development of Covid-19 vaccines as a “ray of hope” that needs to reach everyone and called on the G-20 nations to support the global collaboration to accelerate development of coronavirus treatments and drugs.This week, global drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech said their Covid-19 vaccine candidate is 95 per cent effective, including in adults over 65 years of age. “The recent breakthroughs on Covid-19 vaccines offer a ray of hope. But that ray of hope needs to reach everyone,” Guterres said at a news conference on Friday.“That means ensuring that vaccines are treated as a global public good — accessible and affordable to everyone, everywhere. A people’s vaccine. This is not a ‘do-good’ exercise. It is the only way to stop the pandemic dead in its tracks,” he said.Asserting that “solidarity is indeed survival”, Guterres said that the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and its COVAX Facility are the vehicles to get nations there.Based on current projections, the companies expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. The major announcement came just days after Moderna said its virus vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.5 per cent.The announcements about the vaccines and their potential availability for use among the general population in the coming weeks and months has offered hope to millions around the world in a year that has seen the COVID-19 pandemic devastate lives and economies with no signs of abating.So far, the coronavirus has infected more than 55 million people around the world and killed over 1.3 million people even as governments implemented strict lockdowns and restrictions to slow the spread of the virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. A second wave of infections is threatening to derail economies and impact lives again as countries had gradually begun to ease restrictions and open up.Guterres said that over the past seven months, countries have invested USD 10 billion in the effort to develop vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics but that USD 28 billion more are needed — including USD 4.2 billion before the end of the year. “This funding is critical for mass manufacturing, procurement and delivery of new COVID-19 vaccines and tools around the world. G20 countries have the resources. I am urging all of them to fully support the ACT-Accelerator,” he said, referring to the global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to Covid-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. Launched at the end of April 2020, the ACT- Accelerator brings together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, and philanthropists and global health organisations (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI, FIND, Gavi, The Global Fund, Unitaid, Wellcome, the WHO, and the World Bank).Guterres, however, voiced concern that vaccine myths and wild conspiracies continue to spread on social media, saying it is unfortunate that there is no vaccine for misinformation.“Our UN communications networks are working to build vaccine confidence with factual, reliable and persuasive content — and reaching out to social media platforms to strengthen public trust. All of these efforts are vital to save lives and provide an exit strategy out of this global economic and human crisis,” he said.Responding to a question on whether common policies have been agreed or will be discussed for the distribution of the vaccine during the G20 summit, he said there are now more than 160 countries that have committed to the COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator.“The COVAX will be a system of coordination of the investments needed, both for the development, the production, and the distribution of the vaccines,” he said, adding that beyond the COVAX, there are other initiatives of different countries that are intending to buy vaccines for their own people. “And of course, I don’t blame a government that decides to protect its own people, but this needs to be done combined with their commitment to COVAX.” Guterres said several developed countries that have their own programmes already have joined the COVAX and already have invested in the COVAX to obtain vaccines also from the COVAX. “So, I’m hoping that the COVAX will be the main instrument to guarantee that, indeed, vaccines will become a global public good available and affordable for all. And the G20 has a very important role, and I appeal to all G20 members to become members of the COVAX.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recent-breakthroughs-on-covid-19-vaccines-offer-ray-of-hope-un-chief-guterres/story-0Unop4s9lnEXYva2pjoWWL.html
21-11-2020||World||Indian-American uses Bollywood music to spread message of Biden and Harris during US polls||A Silicon Valley-based Indian-American entrepreneur used Bollywood music to effectively take the message of President-elect Joe Biden and his deputy Kamala Harris to the diverse community members in multiple languages during the just concluded presidential elections.Earlier this year, entrepreneur Ajay Jain Bhutoria voluntarily designed an innovative multi-lingual campaign based on some popular Bollywood numbers with the idea that Indian-Americans will feel more connected with Biden when campaign volunteers reach out to them in their language.“There were complaints that Indian-Americans don’t vote. But I ask, ‘have you ever reached out to them in their language?’ When a campaign volunteer speaks to a voter in their language, they are more likely to listen,” Bhutoria told PTI in an interview.“Not necessary all Indians speak English,” he said, adding “people get connected when someone talks to them in their language.” He launched several viral digital outreach campaigns in many Indian languages to attract all the Indians across the US.Slogans like- “America Ka Neta Kaisa Ho Joe Biden Jaisa Ho”, “Trump Hatao America Bachao”, “Biden-Harris ko Jitao, America ko aage badao” and “Jaago America Jaago- Biden Harris ko Vote do”- were released in 14 Indian languages.At a time when every vote mattered, particularly in the battleground states, Bhutoria said his purpose was to reach out to every Indian-American with the message of their party candidate in the language they spoke and the medium they understood.Bhutoria and his wife Vinita released the video “Chale Chalo, Chale Chalo Biden Harris ko Vote do” (Let’s go vote for Biden Harris) which was a super hit with the Indian-American community.This was the first-ever South Asian musical video for the presidential campaign. He said that “people connect with music, food, language, and culture.” “There was lots of excitement,” he said, adding that “the vast majority had never experienced such campaign outreach previously.” “We present the diversity of people in our community, inspired by Biden’s vision of hope and change,” reads the video’s description. “We come from all ages, places, and professions, but we are united in our passion for a candidate who represents our common values,” he said in response to a question.Based out of Fremont in California, Bhutoria is an influential Indian-American community leader, political activist, author and tech entrepreneur. For over a decade, he has served as a prominent leader in the Democratic Party’s National Finance Committee. He has served as a national leader of the Asian-American Pacific Islander (AAPI) on the Biden 2020 campaign and in the Biden South Asian Foreign Relations Policy Committee.Born in Rajasthan, Bhutoria was raised in Guwahati, Assam.Inspired by his father, Bhutoria, like many immigrants, came to the US with a suitcase and an empty bank account, searching for limitless opportunity.He began his career of political activism by getting involved with the 2008 Obama for America presidential campaign, as a community leader for the Democratic National Committee and its National Finance Committee.Drawing inspiration from Obama, he became closely involved to boost civic engagement and drive national Indo-American political participation.Bhutoria hosted former President Bill Clinton at his home for the 2016 presidential campaign and was a co-host for Hillary Clinton fundraisers over 20 times in various events, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, eBay CEO John Donahue, and LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman. He has raised a substantial amount of funds and co-led the AAPI leadership council for Hillary for president.He was probably the only Indian-American to have flown in from California to be present in Philadelphia on May 18, 2019, when Biden formally launched his presidential campaign. “I believe it is only he (Biden) who can put the United States back on the path of development. The United States needs to lead the world,” Bhutoria then told PTI after the launch event.A few months later, he hosted Dr Jill Biden in a national effort to raise funds for the Biden Campaign at his residence. In addition to raising grassroots funds for the campaign, Bhutoria said he focused on ensuring that 1.3 million Indian-American votes in the swing states were delivered for Biden. He helped strengthen and build the AAPI for Biden Leadership and grassroots team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-uses-bollywood-music-to-spread-message-of-biden-and-harris-during-us-polls/story-4C7bL2zqssIpzdJzhX7OCK.html

The US State Department said in a statement on the talks that the two agreed to negotiate a science and technology agreement, and that future talks would help strengthen their economic relationship and “our shared commitment to free markets, entrepreneurship, and freedom”.The dialogue, held virtually and in person in Washington, is part of increased US engagement with Taipei by the Trump administration which has angered Beijing. China claims the democratic island as its sovereign territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-confident-over-trade-deal-with-new-us-government-under-president-elect-joe-biden/story-dFtznmd5SLszZ2CNFVbIaM.html

They asked not to be identified because Biden hasn’t announced a nominee.The president-elect may yet make history by appointing a woman to lead the Treasury Department for the first time. Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, would meet his description of a person acceptable to the entire party. Progressives support her in part because she has endorsed the idea of taxing carbon emissions to fight climate change.Biden said Thursday that he had decided on a nominee but wouldn’t say who it is. However, he gave a clue, telling reporters that his choice “is someone who I think is, will be accepted by all elements of the Democratic Party, from the progressive to the moderate coalitions.”Brainard is opposed by some liberal groups because of perceptions she defended the Obama administration’s conciliatory position toward China and hasn’t advocated for strong climate change policies while at the Fed.Brainard declined to comment through a Fed spokesperson. Yellen also declined to comment.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fed-governor-lael-brainard-frontrunner-for-new-us-treasury-secretary-falls-behind-in-race/story-vwiFNdGULykxZyFzNqTzmM.html

Many have pinned their hopes on vaccines as reports of two of them, including the candidates of Pfizer and Moderna, being highly effective and others clearing advanced stages of trials come in.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageExperts have highlighted several concerns that lie ahead as the world seeks to come up with a fair system for distribution of vaccines once they are out.The rush to buy in advancePfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine candidate BNT162b2 was recently found to be 95% effective without any major safety concerns and Moderna announced that preliminary phase three trial data showed its vaccine was 94.5% effective.Even as none of these vaccines has been approved yet, countries are purchasing doses in advance. According to Duke University in North Carolina, 6.4 billion doses of potential vaccines have already been bought, and another 3.2 billion are either under negotiation or reserved as “optional expansions of existing deals”, the BBC reported.When can countries expect a working vaccine?Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics, told BBC that whichever country can pay the most in early stages of production of the vaccine would get to the front of the line and the “vast majority” of vaccine doses that have been bought so far have been by high-income countries.Also Read: Bharat Biotech to recruit volunteers for trial, Pfizer files for emergency use authorisationWhile Serum Institute of India has said it will keep half of all doses it produces for domestic distribution, Indonesia is partnering with Chinese vaccine developers and Brazil is partnering with the trials run by the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “equitable distribution is particularly important in the area of vaccines, which, if used correctly and equitably, could help to stop the acute phase of the pandemic and allow the rebuilding of our societies and economies.”Pfizer has said it hopes to produce up to 50 million doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021 and Moderna too has also shown promising results. The Moderna vaccine also has fewer requirements around keeping it cold, which has been a concern for poorer countries, particularly in warmer areas.WHO’s equitable vaccine distribution planA landmark global vaccine plan by WHO known as Covax seeks to ensure an equitable distribution of future coronavirus vaccines. “Once a vaccine(s) is shown to be safe and effective, and authorized for use, all countries receive doses in proportion to their population size, albeit initially in reduced quantities. This will enable every country to start by immunizing the highest priority populations,” WHO advises.“In the second phase, vaccines would continue to be deployed to all countries so that additional populations can be covered according to national priorities,” the organisation adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-some-countries-rush-to-buy-covid-19-vaccine-in-advance-will-others-be-left-out/story-5LfkOukjrOSfQXYMb4bodP.html
21-11-2020||World||Twitter to hand @POTUS account to Joe Biden on inauguration day||Twitter will hand control of the presidential @POTUS account to Joe Biden when he is sworn in on inauguration day, even if President Donald Trump has not conceded his election loss, US media reported Friday.The social media giant is “actively preparing to support the transition of White House institutional Twitter accounts on January 20th, 2021,” Twitter spokesperson Nick Pacilio told Politico in an email.The process is being done in consultation with the National Archives, as it was in 2017, he said.The handover will see all existing tweets on @POTUS, as well as @FLOTUS, @VP and other official accounts, archived.The accounts will then be reset to zero tweets and transferred to the incoming Biden White House that day. Trump, who still has not conceded his November 3 loss, used Twitter to help build his political brand and, later, wield the power of the presidency -- though he mainly uses his personal account, @realDonaldTrump, whose 88 million followers dwarf @POTUS’s 32 million.The @POTUS account is largely used to retweet Trump’s personal account as well as the White House and other accounts.Trump’s frequent habit of abruptly announcing new policies on the platform has led to long-standing complaints of governing by tweet.Twitter has long come under pressure to curb the president’s use of the site to spread misinformation and conspiracy theories.Since the election the company has slapped warning labels on many Trump tweets as he continues to insist, despite evidence to the contrary, that he won the vote, and that Biden’s victory is down to massive fraud.Biden, for his part, is a far more sedate Twitter user. He has sent less than 7,000 tweets to his 19 million followers, compared to Trump’s 58,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-to-hand-potus-account-to-joe-biden-on-inauguration-day/story-OjiFhuRyDKOo6TXlFAIfdK.html
21-11-2020||World||At least 8 dead as barrage of rocket fire hits Kabul||At least eight people were killed Saturday when a barrage of rockets struck densely populated parts of Kabul, officials said, marking the latest attack in an ongoing wave of violence sweeping the Afghan capital.“The terrorists fired 23 rockets on the city of Kabul. Based on the initial information, eight people were martyred, and 31 others were wounded,” said interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian, who blamed the Taliban for the attack. A police source also confirmed the toll.The salvo slammed into various parts of central and north Kabul -- including near the heavily fortified Green Zone that houses embassies and international companies -- just before 9:00 am (0430 GMT).“This morning, the terrorists fired 14 rockets on the city of Kabul,” interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said. Photos and videos circulating online showed several buildings with damage to walls and windows, including at a large a medical complex.No group immediately claimed the blasts and the Taliban denied responsibility.Recent big attacks in Kabul, including two horrific assaults on educational institutions that killed nearly 50 people in recent weeks, follow a familiar pattern in the aftermath, with the Taliban denying any involvement while the Afghan government pins the blame on them or their proxies. “The rocket attack in Kabul city has nothing to do with the mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said, using the insurgents’ name for Afghanistan.“We do not blindly fire on public places.”The Taliban are under pressure not to attack urban areas, having pledged not to do so under the terms of a US withdrawal deal signed in February.Any acknowledgement of overt involvement in such incidents could in theory slow the American pull-out, though outgoing US President Donald Trump has made clear that he wants US forces out regardless of the situation on the ground. The Islamic State group claimed the two attacks on educational centres, but Kabul said the Taliban’s ultra-violent Haqqani network was responsible. - Pompeo heads to Doha -Taliban and Afghan government negotiators launched peace talks in Doha in September but progress has been slow and violence has raged across Afghanistan regardless.Officials told AFP on Friday however that a breakthrough was expected to be announced in the coming days, and the US State Department announced late Friday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would meet negotiators from the Taliban and the Afghan government in Doha. Trump has repeatedly vowed to end “forever wars,” including in Afghanistan, America’s longest-ever conflict that began with an invasion to dislodge the Taliban following the September 11, 2001 attacks.President-elect Joe Biden, in a rare point of agreement, also advocates winding down the Afghanistan war although analysts believe he will not be as wedded to a quick timetable.Earlier this week, the Pentagon said it would soon pull some 2,000 troops out of Afghanistan, speeding up the timeline established in a February agreement between Washington and the Taliban that envisions a full US withdrawal in mid-2021.In the past six months, the Taliban carried out 53 suicide attacks and 1,250 explosions that left 1,210 civilians dead and 2,500 wounded, interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said this week.The interior ministry said two small “sticky bomb” explosions had been reported earlier Saturday morning, including one that hit a police car, killing one policeman and wounding three others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multiple-blasts-rock-kabul-casualties-feared-report/story-EAVarcjkOgMK1Mw0fgUr2O.html
21-11-2020||World||Covid-19: Air travel bubble with Hong Kong to begin on Sunday as planned, says Singapore||The uncertainty surrounding the high-profile Hong Kong-Singapore air travel bubble has eased after Singapore’s civil aviation authority on Saturday announced that its planned travel bubble with the former British colony will commence on Sunday as planned, despite a surge in Hong Kong’s cornovarius disease (Covid-19) cases.“Hong Kong has a comprehensive public health surveillance system and the overall incidence rate is still low,” the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement on Saturday, explaining why the travel bubble would proceed ahead as planned.Hong Kong reported 45 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, its highest daily count in three months, a day after reporting 26 cases, of which 21 were local.The uncertainty surrounding the bubble had risen after Hong Kong on Friday announced several measures to control what authorities here described as a probable “fourth wave” of Covid-19.“Hong Kong’s epidemic has shown rapid deterioration and experts have said the fourth wave is inevitable,” secretary for food and health Sophia Chan had said in a briefing on Friday. “We have done a series of measures to strengthen control, but we still see the situation turning bad,” she had further said. Various measures announced by the Hong Kong government to control the virus’ spread include suspension of classes for primary school levels 1 to 3 for two weeks starting November 23, as well as mandatory mass testing among certain groups.Commenting on the situation, the CAAS had said on late Friday it was working closely with the Singapore health ministry to “gather the facts.” Responding to queries on whether the air bubble would indeed proceed ahead as planned, it said, “The Singapore and Hong Kong governments are in close contact on the situation.”Hong Kong and Singapore had entered talks over a possible air travel bubble last month and, last week, confirmed November 22 as the start date of the bubble. This arrangement between the two financial hubs is the world’s first quarantine-free travel arrangement open to all residents. Under the agreement, the travel bubble would be suspended for two weeks once the seven-day moving average of local, untraceable cases on either side rise to over five.Hong Kong’s figure is currently at 2.14 and will be exceeded if more than 22 unlinked cases are reported over the next three days, the CAAS said,(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-hong-kong-witnesses-fourth-stage-of-covid-19-concerns-rise-over-air-travel-bubble-with-singapore/story-HuXTHgWyHgVWZWdoRnV8FK.html
21-11-2020||World||Indian-American doctor identifies possible Covid-19 treatment||An Indian-American scientist has discovered a potential strategy to prevent life-threatening inflammation, lung damage and organ failure in patients diagnosed with Covid-19. Published online in the journal Cell, the research coming from the lab of Dr Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, an Indian-born researcher working at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee, identified the drugs after discovering that the hyperinflammatory immune response associated with Covid-19 leads to tissue damage and multi-organ failure in mice by triggering inflammatory cell death pathways. The researchers detailed how the inflammatory cell death signaling pathway worked, which led to potential therapies to disrupt the process. “Understanding the pathways and mechanism driving this inflammation is critical to develop effective treatment strategies,” said Kanneganti, vice chair of the St Jude Department of Immunology. Kanneganti was born and raised in Telangana. She received her undergraduate degree at Kakatiya University in Warangal, where she majored in Chemistry, Zoology, and Botany. She then received her M.Sc. and Ph.D from Osmania University in India. She joined St. Jude, in Memphis, Tennessee, USA, in 2007. “This research provides that understanding. We also identified the specific cytokines that activate inflammatory cell death pathways and have considerable potential for treatment of Covid-19 and other highly fatal diseases, including sepsis,” she said. The other researchers were Shraddha Tuladhar, Parimal Samir, Min Zheng, Balamurugan Sundaram, Balaji Banoth, R K Subbarao Malireddi, Patrick Schreiner, Geoffrey Neale, Peter Vogel and Richard Webby, of St. Jude; and Evan Peter Williams, Lillian Zalduondo and Colleen Beth Jonsson, of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Covid-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The infection has killed more than 1.2 million people in less than one year and sickened millions more. The infection is marked by increased blood levels of multiple cytokines. These small proteins are secreted primarily by immune cells to ensure a rapid response to restrict the virus. Some cytokines also trigger inflammation. The phrase cytokine storm has been used to describe the dramatically elevated cytokine levels in the blood and other immune changes that have also been observed in Covid-19, sepsis and inflammatory disorders such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), St Jude’s said in a statement. But the specific pathways that initiate the cytokine storm and the subsequent inflammation, lung damage and organ failure in Covid-19 and the other disorders were unclear. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that comprehensively define cytokine storm was also lacking. Kanneganti’s team focused on a select set of the most elevated cytokines in Covid-19 patients. The scientists showed that no single cytokine induced cell death in innate immune cells, it said. “The findings link inflammatory cell death induced by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma to Covid-19,” Kanneganti said. “The results also suggest that therapies that target this cytokine combination are candidates for rapid clinical trials for treatment of not only Covid-19, but several other often fatal disorders associated with cytokine storm,” she said. “We were excited to connect these dots to understand how TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma trigger PANoptosis,” said co-first author Rajendra Karki, a scientist in the Kanneganti laboratory. “Indeed, understanding how PANoptosis contributes to disease and mortality is critical for identifying therapies,” added co-first author Bhesh Raj Sharma, a scientist in the Kanneganti laboratory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-doctor-identifies-possible-covid-19-treatment/story-ez0uOaOl6Lwfa6REVUaNFO.html
21-11-2020||World||Google, Facebook and Twitter threaten to leave Pakistan over new rules||Internet and technology companies have threatened to leave Pakistan after the government granted blanket powers to authorities to censor digital content, a move critics say was aimed at curtailing freedom of expression in the conservative Islamic nation.Thursday’s warning from the Asia Internet Coalition, which represents global technology giants including Google, Facebook and Twitter, comes after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan granted enhanced powers to government media regulators Wednesday.Also Read: Imran Khan drags India into his letter to Facebook opposing IslamophobiaThe coalition said it was “alarmed by the scope of Pakistan’s new law targeting internet companies, as well as the government’s opaque process by which these rules were developed.”Under the new regulations, social media companies or internet service providers face a fine of up to $3.14 million for failure to curb the sharing of content deemed to be defamatory of Islam, promoting terrorism, hate speech, pornography or any content viewed as endangering national security.Social media companies are required to provide Pakistan’s designated investigation agency “with any information or data in decrypted, readable and comprehensible format,” according to Pakistan’s DAWN newspaper. Pakistan also wants the social media companies to have their offices in the country.The coalition said the “draconian data localization requirements will damage the ability of people to access a free and open internet and shut Pakistan’s digital economy off from the rest of the world.” It said the new rules will make it difficult for its members “to make their services available to Pakistani users and businesses.”There was no immediate comment from Khan’s government, which has repeatedly said it was not against freedom of expression.Khan’s office had previously said the new rules were made after observing a delayed response in the removal of anti-Pakistan, obscene and sectarian-related content by social media sites since 2018, when Khan’s government came into power.Under the new regulations, social media companies are required to remove or block any unlawful content from their websites within 24 hours after being reported by Pakistani authorities.The latest development comes weeks after Khan’s government temporarily banned the video-sharing platform TikTok, saying it took the step after receiving complaints of “immoral and indecent” content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-new-rules/story-LIBChHJbeR9Vjy2CYJs9dJ.html

Wham posted a picture of himself holding the sign on his social media accounts.The rights campaigner, who has already served two brief stints in jail this year, faces a fine of up to $5,000 Singaporean dollars (US$3,723). “These charges against me only show how absurd the situation has become,” Wham said in a text message. “Calling what I did an assembly is an abuse of the English language. How can one man standing in public for a few seconds for a photo-op be a threat to public order?” Wham argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-man-faces-action-for-holding-up-smiley-outside-police-station/story-euA4dHbK7z4RPFfqaMOcOO.html
21-11-2020||World||Mike Pompeo visits Israel museum honoring Christian Zionists||Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrapped up a trip to Israel on Friday with a visit to a museum in Jerusalem that honors Christian Zionists and was founded by a prominent evangelical adviser to the Trump administration.The museum visit came a day after Pompeo became the first secretary of state to visit an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank. He also announced a new policy allowing settlement products exported to the US to be labeled “made in Israel” and a new initiative to combat the Palestinian-led international boycott movement.Christian Zionism is a belief by some Christians that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land and the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 were in accordance with biblical prophecy.The Friends of Zion Museum was founded by Mike Evans, a prominent evangelical supporter of Israel. Evangelical Christians are among President Donald Trump’s most loyal supporters and have hailed his unprecedented support for Israel. They would also be an important constituency should Pompeo pursue elected office following Trump’s presidency.Pompeo did not deliver any public remarks at the museum and departed Israel midday.The Trump administration has broken with decades of US policy to support Israel’s claims to territory seized in war and to isolate and weaken the Palestinians.It moved the US Embassy to contested Jerusalem, adopted the position that settlements are not contrary to international law, recognized Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights — which Pompeo also visited on Thursday — and released a Mideast plan that overwhelmingly favored Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians. It has also adopted a “maximum pressure” campaign against Israel’s archenemy Iran while brokering normalization agreements with Arab nations.The moves Pompeo announced Thursday are largely symbolic and could be easily reversed by President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration. But it was a powerful show of support for Israel and its Christian allies.Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war, territories the Palestinians want for their future state. The Palestinians view the settlements as a violation of international law and a major obstacle to peace, a position shared by most of the international community.Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the same war and later annexed it. Last year, the US became the first country to recognize it as part of Israel, a position Pompeo reaffirmed during his visit to the strategic plateau on Thursday.Biden is opposed to settlement construction and has vowed to adopt a more evenhanded approach aimed at reviving peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-visits-israel-museum-honoring-christian-zionists/story-aUCnPIot5ZHoGHVDLmc1LP.html

Swat district is among the top 20 sites in Pakistan which is home to every kind of tourism like natural beauty, religious tourism, cultural tourism and archaeological sites.Several places of worship of Buddhism are also situated in Swat district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-300-year-old-hindu-temple-discovered-in-northwest-pakistan/story-epNXvI69fpLIV1DR3wQLfM.html
21-11-2020||World||After Georgia recount, Joe Biden tightens grip on presidency||As President-elect Joe Biden’s 306-232 lead in electoral college votes was reaffirmed on Thursday by a recount in the state of Georgia, President Donald Trump yet again launched efforts to overturn the US election’s outcome after having failed to mount a credible legal challenge in the battleground states that he lost.Biden, who turned 78 on Friday, and his team have maintained a public posture of confidence in the outcome. “It’s hard to fathom how this man thinks,” he told reporters on Thursday. “I’m confident he knows he hasn’t won, and is not going to win, and we’re going to be sworn in on January 20.”The Democrat president-elect did speak disapprovingly of Trump’s behaviour, which he felt was “totally irresponsible” and sent “damaging” messages to the rest of the world about how democracy works, conveying a “horrible message about who we are as a country”.Georgia’s hand recount of votes lasted six days, but brought no real relief to Trump. He can, however, still seek another recount under the state’s election rules. Wisconsin, meanwhile, began a recount in two counties on Friday, as demanded by the Trump campaign.Trump and Republican allies have filed more than 30 lawsuits since November 3, when polling closed for the 2020 election. They first alleged election fraud and irregularities, and then dropped them, indicating how tenuous they were. Mitt Romney, a Republican senator who has been critical of Trump, said, “Having failed to make even a plausible case of widespread fraud or conspiracy before any court of law, the president has now resorted to overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election. It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic act by a sitting American president.”Trump has invited a group of Republican legislators from Michigan, a battleground state he lost, to the White House on Friday in a reported bid to persuade them to reject the election’s outcome. Trump lost Michigan, which has 16 electoral college votes, by more than 150,000 popular votes and tried earlier to persuade local Republican officials to not certify the result in the state’s largest county, which is mostly black. He has had no success yet.The US president will need to deploy this strategy based on the use of the power of his office in other states to overturn the 306-232 verdict and could next target Georgia (16 electoral votes) and Arizona (11) - states with Republicans in control of the legislatures and the governorships. Biden is set to hold his first in-person meeting since winning the election with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Friday. He will host the top Democrats in the House and Senate at his makeshift transition headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-georgia-recount-joe-biden-tightens-grip-on-presidency/story-uSIvabvwhZscJS0MEx0TKJ.html
21-11-2020||World||Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $120 million damages in New York baby powder case||Johnson & Johnson has been ordered by a New York state judge to pay $120 million in damages to a Brooklyn woman and her husband, after she blamed her cancer on asbestos exposure from using the company’s baby powder.Justice Gerald Lebovits of the state supreme court in Manhattan reduced the payout from the $325 million a jury awarded Donna Olson, 67, and Robert Olson, 65, in May 2019 following a 14-week trial.While upholding the jury’s liability finding, Lebovits wrote on Nov. 11 that the damages were too high, and the Olsons could either accept $120 million or have a new trial on damages.The judge approved the lowered payout on Wednesday, court records show. It includes $15 million of compensatory damages and $105 million of punitive damages, down from an original $25 million and $300 million, respectively.Johnson & Johnson said it will appeal the verdict, citing “significant legal and evidentiary errors” at the trial.“We deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from cancer, which is why the facts are so important,” the company said. “We remain confident that our talc is safe, asbestos free, and does not cause cancer.”Jerome Block, a lawyer for the Olsons, said they were satisfied with the result and confident it would stand.He also said Donna Olson’s mesothelioma “is at an advanced stage, and we are hoping for the best.”Donna Olson had testified that she used Johnson’s Baby Powder or Shower to Shower daily for more than 50 years.Lebovits wrote that jurors could find that Johnson & Johnson was for many years “knowingly deceitful about” or “willfully blind to” potential health risks of its talc products, in part to maintain market share and profit.The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company is appealing to the US Supreme Court a $2.12 billion damages award in Missouri to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in its baby powder and other talc products.Johnson & Johnson has faced intense scrutiny of its baby powder’s safety following a 2018 Reuters investigative report that found it knew for decades about asbestos in its talc. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-ordered-to-pay-120-million-damages-in-new-york-baby-powder-case/story-ajJS1sAbFhZGiZCuwB0LaN.html

21-11-2020||World||8 injured in US mall shooting: Police||Police in Wisconsin say that eight people were injured in a shooting Friday at a suburban Milwaukee mall and that they are still seeking the suspect.Wauwatosa Police Chief Barry Weber gave no motive for the attack at Mayfair Mall in a brief update about three hours after the 2:50 p.m. incident. He said the extent of injuries to the eight — seven adults and one teenager — was unknown, but all were alive. He added that the shooter was “no longer at the scene.”Weber said based on statements from the wounded, police were seeking a white man in his 20s or 30s and were working to identify the man. He called the mall an active crime scene and asked people to continue to stay away.Wauwatosa Mayor Dennis McBride said in an afternoon statement that a suspect remained at large after the shooting at Mayfair Mall, where witnesses told WISN-TV that they had heard what they believed to be eight to 12 gunshots.WISN reported that at least five people were taken away from the mall on stretchers, at least two of whom were sitting upright and appeared to be conscious. Some people remained in the mall while police searched for a suspect. The station interviewed several people outside the mall who said they had friends sheltering in stores inside.Jill Wooley was inside Macy’s with her 79-year-old mother when they heard eight to 12 gun shots just outside the store entrance.“We heard the first shot fired and knew immediately it was a gunshot,” Wooley told CBS58 in Milwaukee. “We both just dropped to the floor.”Wooley said she didn’t see anyone but the shots were “very close.” She added that they ran in the opposite direction to the basement of the store, where they then hid.Trish Cox’s 19-year-old nephew works at Finish Line sporting goods store. She said she was worried because the store’s phone wasn’t being answered. She was waiting frantically while FBI agents cleared the mall.An agent who wouldn’t give his name said the mall was being “methodically” cleared. Heavily armed FBI personnel were visible at the mall.Mall operator Brookfield Properties said in a statement they were “disheartened and angered that our guests and tenants were subject to this violent incident today.” They declined further comment.The Mayfair Mall was the site of a February shooting in which a city police officer, Joseph Mensah, shot and killed Alvin Cole, a Black 17-year-old. Police said Cole was fleeing from police; Mensah, who is also Black, said he shot Cole because Cole pointed a gun at him. The mall was the target of sporadic protests over several months in the wake of the shooting.The Milwaukee County district attorney declined to file charges against Mensah, but the city this week agreed to a separation agreement in which Mensah will be paid at least $130,000 to leave the force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-injured-in-us-mall-shooting-police/story-O3AfpcqhgpZ3PzZ5nDA3dO.html

Cases continue to spike and authorities complain some people are being more careless about taking precautions.Trudeau, saying “a normal Christmas is quite frankly right out of the question”, spoke shortly after Theresa Tam, chief public health officer, predicted new daily cases could soar to 60,000 by the end of the year from less than 5,000 now.“Cases across the country are spiking massively ... we’re really at risk of seeing case loads go up and hospitals get overwhelmed,” said a clearly upset Trudeau.He dismissed the idea of Ottawa invoking emergency powers to reintroduce the kind of widespread national shutdown that provinces imposed earlier in the year, saying “I’m not looking to bring in a federal hammer to try and do things”.Tam said the worst case scenario, a spike to 60,000 daily cases, would occur if people became more sociable. Even if current restrictions on gatherings are maintained, new daily cases will jump to over 20,000 by Dec 31.Only if people reduce their personal contacts can the situation be kept stable and even then, the experience of European nations strongly suggests more curbs will be needed, she said.“Absolutely do not go above what we have now (in terms of daily cases) otherwise we are really in trouble,” she said.Officials predict that by Nov. 30 the total death toll could be between 11,870 and 12,120, with the total cases between 366,500 and 378,600. Canada has recorded a total of 315,751 cases and 11,265 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-seeing-a-massive-spike-in-covid-19-cases-hospitals-could-be-swamped-pm-trudeau/story-qUk2ZkliwztLJQvgUxm3SJ.html

The European Commission said on Thursday that Hungary’s plan raises safety concerns, opening a new front in the EU’s fraught relations with Budapest.Hungary is in touch with all three Chinese companies working on a vaccine and they will soon send the documentation to Hungary that will allow local authorities to decide whether to allow use of the vaccines, Szijjarto said.“The approval for the export procedure is already in progress. If laboratory tests in Hungary are positive, 500,000 to one million doses of Chinese vaccines could arrive in the next few months,” he said.Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government said it would begin importing a small number of doses of Russia’s Sputnik V this week, which could lead to larger imports and mass production in Hungary.Under EU rules, all vaccines must be authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before they can be marketed in any of the bloc’s 27 member states.Asked about Orban’s Sputnik V plans, a spokesman for the Commission, the EU’s executive, said: “The question arises whether a member state would want to administer to its citizens a vaccine that has not been reviewed by EMA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-could-receive-up-to-one-million-doses-of-chinese-coronavirus-vaccine-foreign-minister/story-muymP7lbtuyZdHRecaKnxM.html
21-11-2020||World||Britain asks regulator to assess Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for suitability||Britain has formally asked its medical regulator, the MHRA, to assess the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for its suitability, the first step in making the shot available outside of the United States. Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, which has been found to be 95% effective in preventing the spread of a virus that has killed more than 1.3 million worldwide and crippled the global economy.Britain’s health minister, Matt Hancock, said the government had taken the step after the two companies applied for emergency use authorisation in the United States.“That has given us the confidence ... formally to start the process here,” he told a news conference. “This is another important step forward in tackling this pandemic,” he said. “If a vaccine is approved it will, of course, be available across the UK from our NHS (National Health Service), free at the point of delivery, according to need, not ability to pay.” Hancock said Pfizer-BioNTech have already starting supplying data to the medical regulator and will submit more in the coming days.Pfizer spokesman Andy Widger said that the company is continuing to work closely with the MHRA and is in the process of providing the data to allow the regulator to make a full assessment.The MHRA has launched an accelerated review of the shot, to speed up the process of approving a successful vaccine in the country, by allowing researchers to submit findings in real time, without waiting for studies to conclude.The aim of the “rolling reviews” is to speed up evaluations of promising medicines during the pandemic while maintaining the same standards of safety and effectiveness.Britain expects to have 10 million doses of the vaccine, enough to protect 5 million people, by the end of the year if regulators approve it. Health officials stressed that the MHRA was independent and highly regarded. Jonathan Van Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said the MHRA would work “at the speed of science”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-asks-regulator-to-assess-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-suitability/story-OKCeiOxcPtQE6hfZrCvCXL.html
21-11-2020||World||Georgia Secretary of State to certify Biden’s win||Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is to certify Joe Biden’s win in the state Friday, a day after completing a hand audit of the state’s more than 5 million ballots, starting the clock for electors to be named and any further recount demand from President Donald Trump’s campaign.The deputy secretary of state, Jordan Fuchs, said an earlier announcement that the certification had already occurred had been sent in error.“A team member sent out the wrong press release,” Fuchs said. She said the certification involves signing thousands of documents and that the error was not a reflection of any pressure on Raffensperger, who is a Republican, not to certify the results.Biden won Georgia by a margin of 12,284 votes, or about 0.3 percentage points, marking the first time a Democrat won the state since 1992.“Numbers don’t lie. As secretary of state, I believe the numbers that we have presented today are correct,” Raffensperger said in a press conference ahead of the certification. “The numbers reflect the verdict of the people.”Republican Governor Brian Kemp will have until Saturday to approve the state’s electors. Kemp has scheduled a news conference at 5 p.m. New York time on Friday to discuss the results.Because of the slim margin, Trump will have the right to request a recount by Tuesday. Absent a court order, any recount would only require counties to feed ballots through scanners again instead of the more time consuming process of tallying them by hand. The Trump campaign has not said if it will request such a count, but Thursday night said it intends “to pursue all legal options to ensure that all legal ballots are counted.”The Associated Press called the state for Biden when the audit was complete.Certification is an important legal milestone because it’s the state’s official declaration of who won unless a court intervenes, and it also triggers the appointment of state electors to the Electoral College.The president’s efforts to reverse the results of the election have launched lawsuits and demands for recounts in several states. A federal district court denied a Trump supporter’s bid to delay certifying the results in Georgia on Thursday.In Georgia, the election and its aftermath have pitted Republican against Republican, including a call for Raffensperger to resign from Republican U.S. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, both of whom face competitive run-off elections in January.Raffensperger has defended the integrity of the vote. In an interview on Tuesday, he criticized what he called “a campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-corrects-news-release-says-election-certification-due-later-on-friday/story-QJzxFDVrAgerVh4xSKuI8O.html

I don’t think we should rock the boat at the present moment,” Guterres told reporters when asked about US plans.A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthi group. UN officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country’s suffering is also worsened by an economic and currency collapse and the Covid-19 pandemic. “In the absence of immediate action, millions of lives may be lost,” Guterres said in a statement earlier on Friday.The United Nations describes Yemen as the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its population in need of help. A senior Western diplomat said an FTO designation of the Houthis by the United States “would certainly not contribute to progress on Yemen.”“It’s likely that they want to do whatever it takes to increase the pressure on Iran,” said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.UN aid chief Mark Lowcock has said the United Nations has received less than half of what was needed this year - about $1.5 billion - for its humanitarian operations in Yemen. Last year it received $3 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-says-yemen-in-imminent-danger-of-famine-warns-against-unilateral-moves/story-wBhmnMmkiDS6E7Mc2i4STN.html

The event organised by the Royal Commonwealth Society (RCS) included readings from the winning pieces by Indian actor Kareena Kapoor and British actor-writer Stephen Fry.This year, the competition’s theme was “Climate action in the Commonwealth”.Choudhury’s essay was titled “Voices from the Blue World”, which imagines a grouper fish speaking at an underwater conference on the impact that climate change has had on the ocean community.Mukerji wrote “The Waters Rise”, which imagines an impassioned call to recognise the impact of climate change on small island states, and the need to take action. The junior winner was Cassandra Nguyen (13 years) from Canada while Eleni Bazikamwe (10 years) from Ghana was the runner-up.The Duchess of Cornwall said, “Amazingly, since the launch, there have been 12,888 entries from young people across the Commonwealth: one of the most successful competitions on record. I am incredibly proud of all of you for overcoming the year’s challenges with your outstanding creativity on this vitally important subject.”Linda Yueh, RCS chair, said, “We are delighted that, during a period of great uncertainty and disruption across the globe, this year’s competition attracted almost 13,000 entries from nearly every country in the Commonwealth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-indian-origin-student-wins-queen-s-commonwealth-essay-contest/story-4UQDcUcI6RRPdOvoZgMaWP.html
21-11-2020||World||UK secures early access to 355 million doses of prospective Covid-19 vaccines||The UK government has secured early access to 355 million doses of various coronavirus vaccines currently under various stages of trials - the most, 100 million, are of the vaccine currently in advanced trial stage at the University of Oxford.Officials said early access had been secured to over 355 million vaccines doses through agreements with vaccine developers at various stages of trials. The UK has invested over £230 million into manufacturing any successful vaccine.Health secretary Matt Hancock said on Friday that recent news from Pfizer and Oxford trials was promising. “The likely big numbers, if it comes off, and I stress on the ‘if’... will be next year for a Covid vaccine. But we still hold out hope that we might get some going in December this year,” he said.Mass vaccination at over 40 centres across the UK has been planned by the National Health Service, with retired doctors and nurses joining the initiative. The regulator, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said there are two routes to obtain a Covid-19 vaccine approval: through a full marketing authorisation or through a temporary authorisation route known as regulation 174.As regulation 174 is a public health-related measure, manufacturers cannot apply for this authorization; it is the government that requests the MHRA approval for specific products as part of a public health response.The MHRA will apply the key criteria of safety, quality and efficacy before authorising the use of a vaccine under either route after receiving the full results of the trials.This means that, for both routes, once the data is submitted, MHRA scientists and clinicians will carefully and scientifically review the safety, quality and effectiveness data - how it protects people from Covid-19 and the level of protection it provides.The data must include: results from the lab and clinical trials in humans; manufacturing and quality controls; product sampling; and testing of the final product.“The safety of the public will always come first. A Covid-19 vaccine will only be approved for use via either route once it has met robust standards on safety, effectiveness and quality through clinical trials,” the MHRA said.After thoroughly reviewed the data via either route, the MHRA will seek advice from the independent advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines, which will critically assess the data before advising the UK government on the safety, quality and effectiveness of any potential vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-secures-early-access-to-355-million-doses-of-prospective-covid-19-vaccines/story-MoFTIUjHWr7dM2afSltpwN.html
21-11-2020||World||UK’s Boris Johnson stands by minister found to have bullied staff||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson refused to fire or censure his interior minister on Friday despite an investigator’s conclusion that she bullied members of her staff.A report said Home Secretary Priti Patel had not met the standards required of a government minister, and concluded her behavior fit the definition of bullying.Cabinet ministers found to have breached the ministerial code are generally expected to resign. But the government said the prime minister had “full confidence” in Patel and “considers this matter now closed.”Johnson’s adviser on ministerial standards Alex Allan, who led the investigation into Patel, resigned instead, saying he could not continue in his job.“I recognize that it is for the prime minister to make a judgment on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the ministerial code,” Allan said. “But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the Prime Minister’s independent adviser on the code.”Patel has been under investigation since March after several civil servants accused her of bullying. The top civil servant in the Home Office, Philip Rutnam resigned that month, saying Patel had belittled employees and fostered an environment of fear in the department. She denied the allegations.The investigation’s conclusions were published Friday after months of delay by Johnson’s office.Allan concluded that Patel “has not consistently met the high standards required by the Ministerial Code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect.”He said there were “occasions of shouting and swearing” that had upset people, though he accepted that Patel may not have intended to have that effect.“Her approach on occasions has amounted to behavior that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals,” Allan said. “To that extent her behavior has been in breach of the Ministerial Code, even if unintentionally.”He said that Patel also felt, “justifiably in many instances,” that there was a lack of support and responsiveness from senior civil servants.Patel said she was “sorry that my behavior in the past has upset people,” though she stopped just short of apologizing for the behavior itself.“I’m here to give an unreserved apology today and I am sorry if I have upset people in any way whatsoever,” she told the BBC. “That was completely unintentional.”In a separate statement, Patel said “I acknowledge that I am direct and have at times got frustrated.”“I am very grateful for the hard work of thousands of civil servants who help to deliver the government’s agenda,” she said.Opposition politicians accused the prime minister of condoning bullying. The prime minister’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, insisted Johnson took allegations of bullying “exceedingly seriously.”“He loathes bullying,” Stratton said. “It is not his belief that Priti Patel is a bully.”Patel was appointed by Johnson to the key post responsible for immigration and crime-fighting after his December 2019 election victory. A law-and-order hard-liner, she has vowed to stop migrants trying to cross the English Channel from France in small boats, though without much success.She was fired as International Development Secretary by Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, for holding unauthorized meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials during a private trip to the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-boris-johnson-stands-by-minister-found-to-have-bullied-staff/story-Ga8mmIjyOjU214vlTmcCNL.html
21-11-2020||World||UK bullying row: Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands by home secretary Priti Patel||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday expressed “full confidence” in home secretary Priti Patel after an inquiry into her alleged bullying behaviour with civil servants concluded that she did behave in a way that amounted to bullying.Alex Allan, the UK government’s standards adviser, resigned soon after Johnson stood by Patel, prompting another political row, days after Downing Street witnessed the resignations of two top advisers that were seen as the prime minister resetting his office.Patel, who has faced such allegations while working in the home office and other departments, apologised for her behaviour that the adviser said amounted to breaching the ministerial code of conduct. Several Conservative MPs lent her support.Labour leader Keir Starmer said, “Yet again, the prime minister has been found wanting when his leadership has been tested. If I were prime minister, the home secretary would have been removed from her job.“It is hard to imagine another workplace in the UK where this behaviour would be condoned by those at the top. The government should be setting an example. Instead, it is one rule for Boris Johnson and his friends, another for everyone else.”He added, “The prime minister has previously said he loathes bullying. Yet when one of his own ministers is found to have bullied their staff, he ignores the damning report sat on his desk and instead protects them.”A government spokesperson said Johnson is reassured that Patel is sorry for inadvertently upsetting those with whom she was working. As the arbiter of the ministerial code, Johnson’s judgement is that the code was not breached, the spokesperson added.“The prime minister has full confidence in the home secretary and considers this matter now closed. He is grateful to the thousands of civil servants working extremely hard to support delivery of the government’s priorities,” the statement said.Breaching ministerial code usually leads to a minister resigning. Patel had been asked to resign by former PM Theresa May in 2017 for holding unauthorised official meetings during a holiday when she was the international development secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-bullying-row-prime-minister-boris-johnson-stands-by-home-secretary-priti-patel/story-gAOyLu3WkmGQQnmVZlGu0L.html
21-11-2020||World||One in five US hospitals face staffing crises within a week||Hospital workers, many of them beleaguered since early in the coronavirus pandemic, have more pain ahead.This week, 1 in 5 American hospitals anticipated a critical staff shortage within seven days, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. The ratio was a record as cases swell and patients flood facilities for a third time since the pandemic began.North Dakota, Missouri and Wisconsin reported the highest share, each with almost half of its hospitals in need of medical staff as of Wednesday. That tracks with the trajectory of the virus, which by some measures is ravaging the Midwest in a way the rest of the country hasn’t seen. The seven-day average of new cases in the region is higher than at any point in the Northeast, West or South, Covid Tracking Project data show.A dearth of nurses, doctors and other key health-care workers could not only endanger patients, but also risk burning out existing staff, many of whom have been laboring -- and struggling -- since March. Frontline workers are vulnerable to the consequences of overwork, propelling turnover, prompting mistakes and, in the most serious cases, mental illness and even suicide.The US reported an additional 182,832 cases on Thursday, according to Covid Tracking Project data. There have been more than 252,000 deaths cumulatively, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-in-five-us-hospitals-face-staffing-crises-within-a-week/story-4XuCQiKFimtVlibTnj1SLM.html
