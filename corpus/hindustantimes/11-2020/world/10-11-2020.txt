The agreement ended military action and restored relative calm to the breakaway territory, internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and, until recently, fully controlled by ethnic Armenians.The territory that Azerbaijan will keep includes the mountain enclave’s second city of Shusha, which Armenians call Shushi, and ethnic Armenian forces must give up control of a slew of other areas by December 1.Russian President Vladimir Putin said the deal, announced overnight and also signed by Moscow, should pave the way for a lasting political settlement to weeks of fighting that killed thousands, displaced many more and threatened to spark a wider war.Azerbaijan, which had been trying to regain land lost during a war in the 1990s, hailed the deal as a victory. Azeris celebrated in the capital, Baku, sounding car and bus horns in delight and cheering and waving the Azeri national flag. “This (ceasefire) statement has historic significance. This statement constitutes Armenia’s capitulation. This statement puts an end to the years-long occupation,” Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said. Armenian PM Nikol Pashinyan denied Armenia had suffered a defeat but acknowledged a “disaster” for which he took personal responsibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-deploys-peacekeepers-to-secure-azeri-armenia-truce/story-7zJrp9VZSfoZJ7aeXf3SlI.html
10-11-2020||World||Christian mother, son killed in Pak over alleged blasphemous remarks||A Christian mother and her son were murdered in broad day light at a village in the Pakistani province of Punjab on Monday in what media reports said was a killing over alleged blasphemy.In a report filed by Shabbir Masih with the local police, he stated that his wife Yasmeen Masih and son Usman Masih were killed by their neighbour Hussain Shakoor in Hussain Kathore village located in Ahmad Nagar area of Gujranwala district after a heated argument between Yasmeen and Hussain’s mother, Itrat Bibi.There is no mention of blasphemy in the police report and the reason for the killing has been described as a personal dispute over cleaning of the street on which both families lived. The husband has stated in his report that some months ago, the two women had entered into an argument and this was the reason why Itrat Bibi and her son took revenge on Monday. Hussain Shakoor first shot Yasmeen and when her son came to aid his mother, he also was also shot in the chest.Media reports have suggested that Itrat Bibi and her son Hussain Shakoor killed the mother and son because they claim they heard them utter blasphemous words during the argument. Police have so far refuted this claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christian-mother-son-killed-in-pak-over-alleged-blasphemous-remarks/story-N4Tr8s5waF4qkkMsjtznSJ.html

Other forms of online advertising would also be banned.The plan is being put out for consultation with the industry, the public and other interested parties over the next six weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-mulls-plan-to-ban-online-junk-food-adverts-to-tackle-obesity/story-JEiON8vQM2iv6sQH9zjDYO.html

The two sides are trying to strike a new trade deal, but talks are stuck on key issues, and have been soured further by the Internal Market Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-govt-defiant-after-house-of-lords-rejects-brexit-bill/story-xWZASr81fN8Wgizlsj2jCK.html
10-11-2020||World||Xi says SCO member states should resolve disputes, differences through dialogue||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday said that members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) should deepen mutual trust and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultations, while firmly dealing with terrorist, separatist and extremist forces. Addressing the Council of Heads of State of the SCO grouping via video link, Xi said that history has proved and will continue to prove that good, neighbourly friendship will go beyond a beggar-thy-neighbour approach, mutually beneficial cooperation will take over the zero-sum game and multilateralism will prevail over unilateralism.“We need to deepen solidarity and mutual trust and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultations,” Xi said in remarkes in the backdrop of the over six-month-long border standoff between India and China in eastern Ladakh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of the eight-member SCO grouping attended the virtual summit hosted by Russian President Vladimir Putin.“We need to act on the vision of common, comprehensive and sustainable security, address all forms of threats and challenges effectively and foster a sound security atmosphere in our region,” he said.Countries of the SCO should “resolutely oppose external forces’ interfering in their internal affairs under any pretext,” Xi said. SCO members should “firmly support countries concerned in law-based efforts to steadily advance major domestic political agenda. Firmly support countries in safeguarding political security and social stability and firmly oppose interference by external forces in the domestic affairs of SCO members under whatever pretext,” he said.In order to cement the political foundation for SCO development it is important to foil “terrorist, separatist and extremists attempt to exploit the pandemic for disruption, curb the proliferation of drugs, crackdown on internet-based propagation of extremist ideology and deepen SCO members law enforcement cooperation,” he said.“It is import we support biosecurity, data security and outer space security and engage in active communication and dialogue in this field”, he said. The SCO founding members are China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India and Pakistan were admitted into the grouping in 2017. The SCO summit over video link is being organised by Russia, which will also host a virtual summit of BRICS, (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) leaders on November 17.India is also set to host the virtual meeting of the SCO Heads of the Government on November 30 in which Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is expected to take part.On the fight against Covid-19, Xi said SCO countries should set up a hotline among their centres for disease control, and China is ready to consider in a proactive approach to the needs of countries for Covid-19 vaccines.It is necessary to strengthen joint forces among countries in prevention and controls, support each other’s fight against the epidemic, and further promote exchanges and cooperation in such areas as epidemic surveillance, scientific research, disease prevention and treatment, Xi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-says-sco-member-states-should-resolve-disputes-differences-through-dialogue/story-NSiB8gOEbs3XUR7nHOj8uM.html

We do not have such facility,” Philippines’ Health Secretary Francisco Duque told Reuters.“We will have to wait and see for now,” he added. “The technology Pfizer is using is new technology. We don’t have experience with that, so risks can be high.”Pfizer told Reuters that it had developed detailed logistical plans and tools to support vaccine transport, storage and continuous temperature monitoring.“We have also developed packaging and storage innovations to be fit for purpose for the range of locations where we believe vaccinations will take place,” it said.‘VACCINE IS STORY FOR FUTURE’Yet even wealthier nations like South Korea and Japan are managing expectations.“Storage is going to be a big challenge for us,” said Fumie Sakamoto, infection control manager at St. Luke’s International Hospital in Tokyo.Also read | Covid-19 vaccine 90% effective in Phase 3 trial, says US pharma giant Pfizer“I’m not sure how well prepared our government is with regards to maintaining the cold chain. Hospitals in Japan usually do not have ultra-cold freezers, but I think it’s high time we started thinking about the logistics for the vaccine.”Japan is among three countries in Asia Pacific that have announced supply deals for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. It has signed a deal for 120 million doses, while Australia has secured 10 million doses and China’s Fosun has secured 10 million doses for Hong Kong and Macau.Japan’s PHC Corp, which supplies medical freezers, told Reuters that demand had shot up 150% this year and that they were increasing production to meet demand.Kwon Jun-wook, an official at South Korea’s Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), said it wanted to see how vaccination progressed in other countries first and would thoroughly review its supply chain.The country had recently experienced the problems of cold storage when it had to discard about 5 million doses of flu vaccines because they were not stored at recommended temperatures.A 2018 study commissioned by the agency found that only a quarter of 2,200 private clinics it surveyed had medical refrigerators, with 40% using household refrigerators.For some countries, it’s still very early days.Indonesia, whose 273 million people are scattered over more than 17,000 islands, is considering a variety of vaccines, but the Pfizer one is not yet among them, said Airlangga Hartarto, who heads the country’s COVID-19 response team.Vietnam, which successfully contained its outbreak through aggressive mass testing and strict border controls, said it would continue to focus on containment effort.“The vaccine is a story for the future,” Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam, told a government meeting on Friday.“Demand is far higher than supply, and we have to pay large deposits to secure our position, which I see as very high risk and a waste of money and time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-pfizer-vaccine-could-be-cold-comfort-for-some-asian-nations/story-il7CW5RCDMUxFyXOKeTSdM.html
10-11-2020||World||‘Lockdown’ is Collins Word of the Year 2020||Lockdown, the containment measure implemented by governments around the world to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, has been named the Collins Word of the Year 2020.According to the dictionary, lockdown is defined as “the imposition of stringent restrictions on travel, social interaction, and access to public spaces”. “Our lexicographers chose lockdown as Word of the Year because it is a unifying experience for billions of people across the world, who have had, collectively, to play their part in combating the spread of COVID-19,” Collins said.“Language is a reflection of the world around us and 2020 has been dominated by the global pandemic,” said Helen Newstead, language content consultant at Collins.“Lockdown has affected the way we work, study, shop, and socialise. With many countries entering a second lockdown, it is not a word of the year to celebrate but it is, perhaps, one that sums up the year for most of the world,” she said.The dictionary said it registered over a quarter of a million usages of the word lockdown during 2020, against only 4,000 the previous year.Several other words related to the pandemic are included in Collins’ long list of the top 10 words of the year, which include furlough or the temporary laying-off of employees, usually because there isn’t sufficient work to employ them, and self-isolate, or to quarantine oneself if one has or suspects contagious disease. The word coronavirus is there too, with an extraordinary 35,000-fold increase in use year-on-year, and defined as any of the group of viruses that cause infectious illnesses of the respiratory tract, including Covid-19. But the social impacts – the changes to behaviour and the human way of life – dominate the list for the year.“The restrictions placed on how we move about and interact with one another arguably had the most impact. And they’re represented first and foremost by social distancing, a concept now so pervasive that it has also entered the language as a verb ‘to socially distance’,” Collins notes.However, the dictionary points out that 2020 was not all about the pandemic. Megxit, or Prince Harry and wife Meghan Meghan’s decision to stand down as senior members of the UK royal family, was among some of the other top words of the year. BLM or Black Lives Matter, the huge global anti-racism movement, was one of the other key words. And, on a lighter note, there is the word “mukbang” all the way from Korea, which means a video or webcast in which the host noisily eats a large quantity of food for the entertainment of viewers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-is-collins-word-of-the-year-2020-as-it-is-unifying-experience-amid-pandemic/story-5EakpjIPn0MCMVzLQo5SdN.html

Detectives initially looked into the deaths of 15 babies between 2015 and 2016, and the probe later widened to the deaths of 17 babies and 16 “non-fatal collapses” in the same period.The nurse was previously arrested in 2018 and 2019. She was bailed pending further enquiries both times and had not been charged.She was questioned in police custody Tuesday.Detective Chief Inspector Paul Hughes said a team of detectives has been working on the “highly complex and very sensitive case” and said he could not provide further details.“Parents of all the babies have been kept fully updated on this latest development,” he said in a statement. “This is an extremely difficult time for all the families and it is important to remember that, at the heart of this, there are a number of bereaved families seeking answers as to what happened to their children.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-nurse-re-arrested-on-suspicion-of-murder-in-baby-deaths/story-KHOMeK3zfr3kDaTRAVDjCM.html

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency had seized 3.5 million such pills worth £10 million in 2019, 96 per cent of them shipped from India.ED pills are available through pharmacies on a doctor’s prescription after an assessment, but often illegal traders posing as legitimate suppliers sell unlicensed medications for the UK market online, offering tempting prices lower than the real deal, officials said.Officials said on Tuesday that during the Operation Thunder from September 14 to October 11, Border Force officers at ports and airports made 178 seizures containing thousands of products regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.The international operation was co-led by the World Customs Organisation and Interpol and involved police, customs, environment, wildlife and forestry agencies from 111 countries. The seizures included 1.3 tonnes of ivory, more than one tonne of Pangolin scales, 1,400 live turtles and 1,800 reptiles.Chris Philp, minister for Immigration Compliance and the Courts, said: “The trade in endangered species is driven by organised crime groups and the movement of banned animal products is key to how they operate”.“This is why Border Force’s specialist officers will continue their vital work at the border to prevent the importation and exportation of endangered animals and plants, as well as working alongside enforcement partners such as the National Wildlife Crime Unit, and police from across the UK to eradicate this ruthless and exploitative trade”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-seizes-nearly-1-75-lakh-erectile-dysfunction-pills-sourced-from-india/story-5Y6ok3kg7eDgTmxNMS3InK.html

The shooting has strengthened calls in Austria for a crackdown on Islamic extremism.Kurz called Monday for a coordinated, Europe-wide effort on actions including tackling political Islam, addressing the threat of fighters returning from conflict zones and “proper protection of the EU’s external borders.”In France last month, an Islamic extremist killed three people in a church in the French city of Nice, and another extremist beheaded a teacher near Paris because he had shown his students cartoons of Islam’s prophet for a discussion about freedom of expression.As a result of the attacks, Macron last week proposed tighter controls on the EU’s external borders, more coordinated policing inside the bloc’s border-free zone, and changes to EU migration policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-leaders-weigh-terrorism-strategy-after-attacks/story-mFCmapldUT0EZDJP5fb4fL.html
10-11-2020||World||23 Indian sailors docked off Chinese port not allowed to disembark since June||The fate of 23 Indian sailors stuck on a merchant navy ship anchored off a port in northern China appears to be uncertain with Beijing reportedly not allowing them to get off the vessel in the backdrop of increasing imported Covid-19 cases in the country.The bulk carrier Jag Anand has been anchored off the Jingtang port on Bohai Sea in northern China’s Hebei province since June, putting the physical and mental health of the sailors at risk.The ship sailed from the port of Gladstone in Australia on May 26 – carrying Australian coal – and reached Jingtang port in China on June 13.Since that day, the ship has been anchored 2-3 km away from the port.In April, China’s General Administration of Customs had announced strict management measures for crew members of international ships and flights coming into the country.In October, China opened up 10 ports for foreign crew exchange while implementing a circuit-breaker mechanism to prevent imported Covid-19 cases – Jingtang, an artificial deep water port, wasn’t among the 10.Shipping companies have been advised to closely monitor the port’s local quarantine conditions and implement a closed-loop management as per the quarantine requirements issued by the local port, Copenhagen-based BIMCO, an organisation for shipowners, shipbrokers and agents, said in a report in October.It’s not clear whether the rapidly deteriorating ties between China and Australia also played a part in the situation that the ship and its crew find themselves in.The Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to questions from the Hindustan Times asking about the well-being of the Indian sailors and on the protocols that need to be followed in such cases.At the regular ministry briefing on Tuesday, foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, however, said “convenience” was being provided to the sailors.“As I understand, China has clear regulations on ports epidemic prevention and control and crew members quarantine requirements and as much as the regulations allow, we are providing convenience for these crew members,” Wang said.Responding to the question on whether the “…ship has been arrested and denied departure”, Wang declined to share details.“As for the specifics, I would still refer you to the competent Chinese authorities or relevant local government,” he said.A report by India’s ANI earlier this week said the 23 Indian crew members on board are seeking help to return home; some are suffering from health issues and the ship is running short of medicines, the report said.HT has learnt that while the local port authorities have not allowed the “crew change” – whereby a ship’s crew can disembark and head back to their country of origin – it has been communicated to them that anyone needing treatment could be allowed to come ashore temporarily for medical attention.Many of the crew members have completed their tenure with the company and were expecting to be back home months earlier.Port authorities have also communicated to the ship that it has the option to sail away from the port or wait its turn – in a queue of multiple ships – to discharge its cargo.No timeframe, however, has been given when Jag Anand’s turn would come to discharge its cargo.According to the ANI report, the family members of the crew have written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar regarding the situation.“Due to severance of diplomatic ties between China, the Australia vessel is on anchor since June 13. The Customs authorities have not cleared the concerning cargo. At present, most of the crew have ended their stipulated contractual obligation and been on board for more than a year, some of them even exceeding 15 months,” the letter, quoted in the ANI report said.“Despite various attempts by the company through diplomatic resources, there has been no respite to crew sufferance who have been inflicted with not only physical stress but mental fatigue,” the letter read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/23-indian-sailors-docked-off-chinese-port-not-allowed-to-disembark-since-june/story-FofK175I4wRS5tOVkKtgQN.html

The partnerships include a greenhouse venture focused on growing fruit and vegetables with less water. ADIO will also work with a firm that uses the International Space Station to research producing food in space and extreme climates on Earth.The pandemic has forced a rethink among many nations on how to feed their people. Oil-rich but water-scarce countries like the United Arab Emirates -- which imports as much as 90% of its food -- have been working on boosting domestic output and investing in farming abroad ever since food crises struck a decade ago. The coronavirus crisis is now accelerating those plans.“What 2020 has brought to light is the need to improve self-sufficiency, to be more efficient with the resources that we do have,” Tariq Bin Hendi, director general of the ADIO, said in an interview. “It’s not just about growing crops, we are looking at this across the seed-to-plate ecosystem of agtech.”This year, the UAE announced a project to grow rice in the desert and imported 4,500 dairy cows from Uruguay.Abu Dhabi will award financial and non-financial incentives to expand companies’ operations in the emirate. FreshToHome Foods Pvt will bring expertise in fish farming, while Pure Harvest Smart Farms, which already operates greenhouses in the United Arab Emirates, will invest in artificial intelligence, autonomous growing and robotics at new farms in Al Ain, an oasis town near the border with Oman.NanoRacks LLC is creating a commercial space research center in Abu Dhabi to develop technology for desert farming and long-term space exploration.Additional SpendingThe spending builds on a $100 million investment earlier this year to encourage agtech firms to build research and development facilities in Abu Dhabi, which has attracted vertical farming companies such as AeroFarms LLC.“You have a big push to bring in these technology players because it does help with water usage, with yield, with how it is you manage crops,” Bin Hendi said. “We are never going to move away from reliance on international food imports, but we need to become more self-sufficient with some of the critical food items that we have.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/abu-dhabi-to-spend-41-million-to-develop-technology-to-grow-food-in-arid-regions/story-Xdl5468YbipywQvsdfeQcI.html
10-11-2020||World||Much at stake as Supreme Court weighs future of ‘Obamacare’||When the Supreme Court weighs the fate of “Obamacare,” arguments will revolve around arcane points of law like severability — whether the justices can surgically snip out part of the law and leave the rest.But what’s at stake has real-world consequences for just about every American, as well as the health care industry, a major source of jobs and tax revenues. Whether the Affordable Care Act stays, goes or is significantly changed will affect the way life is lived in the US. The argument against the law from the Trump administration and conservative states is that the 10-year-old statute was rendered unconstitutional in its entirety when Congress dialed down to zero a penalty on those remaining uninsured. The court has shifted solidly to the political right under President Donald Trump. Here’s a look at some of what’s at stake if the opponents of the law prevail:Covid-19 A NEW PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONBefore the ACA, insurers could turn a person down for an individual policy, or charge them more, based on their medical history. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that about 54 million working-age adults have health issues that would have made them “uninsurable” before former President Barack Obama’s signature law.Tens of millions more have issues that could have led to higher premiums. Female gender was one, as insurers routinely charged women more.Covid-19 would become America’s newest pre-existing condition, for more than 10 million people who have tested positive so far.Under the ACA, a coronavirus case cannot be used to deny someone coverage or charge them more. If Obamacare is gone, that becomes a real question.Trump promised to always protect people with preexisting conditions, but never said how he’d do it.COVERAGE FOR MORE THAN 20 MILLIONThe ACA’s two main programs for covering uninsured people would be wiped out if the law is overturned, leaving more than 20 million people uninsured unless a divided Congress can put a new safety net in place.About 12 million low-income people are covered through the health law’s Medicaid expansion, now available in most states. Most of them are adults working in jobs that don’t pay all that much, and don’t come with health insurance. Some have lost jobs in businesses like hotels, restaurants, and movie theaters, which continue to struggle because of the pandemic.Another group, more than 11 million people, has private coverage purchased through taxpayer-subsidized private markets such as HealthCare.govThat’s also in jeopardy.PREVENTIONMost American women now pay nothing out of their own pockets for birth control. That’s covered as a preventive service, free of charge to the patient, under the ACA.Many other services, from colonoscopies to flu shots, are also free.If people again face copays for routine preventive care, that may discourage some to go for tests shown to detect diseases like cancer at early stages when they are easier to treat.RETURN OF A MEDICARE GAP“Obamacare” took the first major steps to close Medicare’s unpopular “doughnut hole,” a coverage gap that used to leave seniors on the hook for hundreds of dollars in prescriptions drug costs. Congress later accelerated the timetable.Repealing the ACA would mean the return of the coverage gap, sure to infuriate older voters, many of whom say their medications still cost too much.That’s just one of many potential consequences to Medicare. The ACA slowed payments to hospitals and insurers to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund.LONGER RUNWAY SHORTENEDOne of the earliest benefits to take effect after the passage of “Obamacare” was a requirement that insurers allow young adults to stay on a parent’s plan until they turned 26.That provided a longer economic runway for millions of young adults, who back then were struggling with the lingering effects of the Great Recession. Nowadays it’s the consequences of the coronavirus economy.Before the ACA’s coverage extension, insurers routinely cut off young adults upon graduation.TAX CUT FOR THE WEALTHY“Obamacare” raised taxes on upper income individuals to help finance its coverage expansion.If the entire law is repealed, that would deliver a tax cut to well-to-do people, many of whom have escaped the economic shock of the Covid-19 pandemic because stock market investors have continued to do well.POLITICAL RUBIK’S CUBEPassing the 900-page-plus ACA was a political challenge that took more than a year at a time when Democrats controlled the White House and both chambers in Congress.Putting together a replacement under a divided government would be the ultimate political puzzle. Neither Democrats nor Republicans agree even within their own ranks what that should look like.President-elect Joe Biden would build on the ACA by improving it and adding a new public health insurance option. But party liberals want a government-run system for all Americans, including the 160 million covered through employer plans.Many Republicans, meanwhile, want to scale back the government’s support for health care. They would make deep cuts to Medicaid financing, and leave the ACA’s insurance markets as a state option. Protections for people with pre-existing conditions could be eroded under new rules.Trump once famously said, “nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” That was in 2017, when he and a Republican-controlled Congress harbored hopes they could “repeal and replace” the ACA.It didn’t happen then because Republicans could never agree on what a replacement would look like.Fast forward to 2020. Health care has only gotten more complicated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/much-at-stake-as-supreme-court-weighs-future-of-obamacare/story-WRICd5CWtvFp2OPqXlBXEI.html

10-11-2020||World||UK PM cautiously welcomes cheer around Pfizer vaccine||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has cautiously welcomed the promising results from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and warned people not to rely on this news as a solution as it is still “very, very early days”.Addressing a briefing from 10 Downing Street here on Monday, Johnson urged the British public not to “slacken” their resolve as it is still “very, very early days”, even as he confirmed that the UK had pre-ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine – enough for about a third of the UK population, taking into account that two doses each are required.“The Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been tested on over 40,000 volunteers and interim results suggest it is proving 90 per cent effective at protecting people against the virus. But we haven’t yet seen the full safety data, and these findings also need to be peer-reviewed,” said Johnson.“We have talked for a long time, or I have, about the distant bugle of the scientific cavalry coming over the brow of the hill, and tonight that toot of the bugle is louder. But it is still some way off. And we absolutely cannot rely on this as a solution,” he said.He reiterated that it is “crucial” not to overdo things and follow the lockdown rules strictly until December 2, after which England is set to revert to a tiered lockdown system.“We cannot let our enthusiasm (about a vaccine) run away with us. It is more vital now than ever that we follow the basics,” said the prime minister.England’s deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, who joined Johnson at the briefing, said he was “hopeful” that the first vaccine could be seen by Christmas after Pfizer’s announcement earlier on Monday that its vaccine candidate has proven 90 per cent effective in a large trial.“This is a very important scientific breakthrough. I am certain of that. I am hopeful because of all that, but not yet certain that we could begin to see some vaccine by Christmas… I think we have to be optimistic but we have to wait and see how vaccine manufacture goes,” said Prof Van-Tam.“Alas, the death figures are tragically rising, running at an average of over 300 a day – sadly double where they were 24 days ago. The number of Covid-19 patients in hospital has risen from just over 10,000 two weeks ago to nearly 13,000 on November 5, and we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak,” said Johnson, as the experts ran through the statistics with him.Meanwhile, on Tuesday UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the National Health Service (NHS) is ready to start providing the new coronavirus vaccine “as fast as safely possible”, with vaccination clinics to be open seven days a week.Hancock told the BBC: “We still appeal this morning for people’s patience, firstly to follow existing rules. Because this is still a deadly disease and this is not over yet.“Even once we start to roll it out, we still need to look after ourselves, look after our community by following the rules and being careful to stop the spread of transmission.” The main focus of Johnson’s briefing on Monday was on the mass testing rolled out in Liverpool on Friday, which the prime minister said were being widely taken up in the city and urged others to also come forward and get tested for “your friends, for your relatives, for your community”.He confirmed that the government is going beyond the city-wide pilot and sending out hundreds of thousands of rapid lateral flow tests to local authorities right across England and other parts of the United Kingdom.“We’re also working with universities to establish, as soon as possible, similar mass testing capacity for students up and down the country,” Johnson added.His comments came as a further 21,350 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Monday, along with 194 deaths, taking the country’s death toll towards 49,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-cautiously-welcomes-cheer-around-pfizer-vaccine/story-hggNrKzYt44G3KgeBUjdFJ.html
10-11-2020||World||Covid-19 raises serious questions for Denmark’s mink farmers||Mink farms pose a serious threat to human health in the age of Covid, and will continue to do so even if individual mink mutations of the virus are fought back, according to Kare Molbak, Denmark’s top epidemiologist.The arrival of Covid-19 in the Nordic country was a clear “game changer” for its mink farmers, Molbak told newspaper Politiken in an interview published on Tuesday. Maintaining the industry now “represents far too high a national health risk,” he said.Denmark had planned to cull its entire population of mink -- 17 million animals -- after discovering a new strain of Covid-19 that has the potential to derail global efforts to develop a vaccine. The so-called cluster 5 variant carried in Danish mink led to mutations in the virus pod’s spike protein, which most vaccines target.But this week, the planned cull was shelved after political infighting forced Denmark’s minority government to acknowledge it didn’t have parliament’s support to move ahead. There are even questions as to the legality of its order to exterminate the country’s mink population.For now, farmers across Denmark have halted the mass slaughter, and are only putting down animals that are infected. Before the government was forced to back down, farmers had already culled about 2.5 million mink, according to broadcaster TV2.With political agendas dominating the day, the concern now is that the scientific arguments will get drowned out. Molbak, in his interview with Politiken, voiced his concern over the focus of lawmakers, which he suggested is misplaced.“I think that the issue of cluster 5 has received far too much attention,” he said. Even if the cluster 5 mutation dies out, “there’d be new variants in mink that would spawn equivalent or bigger problems, a cluster 6, 7 or 8.”Molbak says the key question now is whether it’s reasonable to continue farming mink, given the risks.“Our biggest concern since June has been the large reservoir that the mink provide the virus,” he said. “It’s a perfect storm. You have an animal that’s particularly receptive toward the virus and that, at the same time, is kept in large numbers, as is the case in Denmark.”“Mink are very easily infected by the coronavirus, and once it’s there, it spreads at the speed of light,” he said. “We’ve seen how that then spreads to humans. That makes it practically impossible to handle the spread during a pandemic.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-raises-serious-questions-for-denmark-s-mink-farmers/story-VopY0Q75AR3FfUFkPkyioN.html
10-11-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine will be a game changer, says top German economist||The availability of a vaccine against the coronavirus would be a game changer for Germany’s economy, boosting growth significantly, the head of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW) said on Tuesday.“An effective vaccine with few side effects changes everything,” Gabriel Felbermayr told Reuters. An aggressive second wave of infections and a new partial lockdown to slow the spread of the disease have clouded the growth outlook in Germany.Germany has closed bars, restaurants, cinemas and gyms for a month until the end of November. Schools and shops remain open under certain conditions.Felbermayr said if, in a first step, a vaccine could protect vulnerable groups of people, many cultural activities could resume and restaurants and hotels could re-open. It would be possible to ease restrictions as much as over the summer, he said.Once 50-60% of the German population are vaccinated, all restrictions could be lifted, Felbermayr said.Pfizer

Aliyev said Turkish troops will join the Russian peacekeeping mission in a televised address to the nation early Tuesday.The peace accord also gives Erdogan potential land access across southern Armenia to Azerbaijan and the resources-rich republics of central Asia for the first time, even as Turkey rejects diplomatic relations with its Armenian neighbor and keeps their joint border closed.The pact effectively sidelines the US and France, enabling Putin and Erdogan to dominate talks on the terms of any future settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Russia, France and the US tried and failed for decades as international mediators to persuade the two sides to reach a peace agreement after Moscow brokered a 1994 truce to halt a war that killed 30,000 and displaced 1 million amid the collapse of the Soviet Union.“We got what we wanted,” Aliyev said in his TV address, in which he mocked Pashinyan for accepting “capitulation” in the war. “We forced them” to peace, he said.“For Putin it’s the best deal under the circumstances given our reluctance and inability to fight the war on Armenia’s side,” said Vladimir Frolov, a former Russian diplomat who’s now a foreign policy analyst in Moscow. “It keeps a functioning relationship with Erdogan while avoiding a major fight.”The pact provides for Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh to have secure access to Armenia across a land corridor through Azerbaijani territory that will be policed by Russian forces. It also allows people in the Azerbaijani exclave of Naxcivan bordering Turkey to travel across southern Armenia to Azerbaijan, again with Russian security on the ground.It was “an extremely difficult decision” to accept the deal to halt the war, Pashinyan said in a Facebook post. “I made that decision as a result of a deep analysis of the military situation,” he said, after Armenian officials acknowledged they’d lost control of a key city just 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Nagorno-Karabakh’s capital, Stepanakert, to Azerbaijan.“It’s not a victory,” Pashinyan wrote. “But there’s no defeat unless you consider yourself to be the loser.”Protests erupted in the streets of the Armenian capital, Yerevan, after news of the agreement emerged. Demonstrators broke into the parliament and angry crowds gathered outside the government building and Pashinyan’s official residence, accusing him of betraying the country.Armenian President Armen Sarkissian, who has a largely ceremonial role, signalled tensions with Pashinyan by saying that he’d only learned about the deal through media reports. There was no “discussion on this document with me,” Sarkissian said in a statement calling for immediate political consultations “at this crucial moment of national preservation.”The agreement to halt the fighting that broke out September 27 sets out a timetable for Armenian withdrawal from occupied Azerbaijani districts outside Nagorno-Karabakh in stages by December 1, effectively restoring Azerbaijan’s control of most of the territory it lost in the 1990s. It also provides for exchanges of prisoners and the return of refugees, while saying nothing about the final status of the disputed enclave.The deal came after Azerbaijani forces took control of the city of Shusha, which is called Shushi by Armenians, on Sunday, putting them on the outskirts of Stepanakert. The government there, backed by Armenia, had warned that the loss of Shushi would lead to the fall of the entire region.“I don’t know what assessment history will give to this decision but we were forced to take it,” Nagorno-Karabakh President Arayik Harutyunyan said, adding that Azerbaijani troops were 2-3 kilometers from Stepanakert.The two sides have been fighting for more than six weeks over the enclave and seven surrounding regions taken by Armenians in the 1990s, which are internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan. More than 5,000 people have been killed in the latest conflict, according to Russian officials.Azerbaijan said it fought to restore control over its territory. Armenia said it was defending Nagorno-Karabakh’s right to self-determination after its Armenian majority voted for independence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-brokers-deal-to-end-karabakh-war-brings-turkey-into-russian-caucasus/story-1uIu6QY17Dc0XDiXpkpD1K.html
10-11-2020||World||US allows emergency use of pharmaceutical company’s Covid antibody treatment||The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an emergency use authorisation (EUA) for American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly’s experimental Covid-19 antibody treatment called ‘bamlanivimab’ for non-hospitalised patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms.“The FDA’s emergency authorisation of bamlanivimab provides health care professionals on the frontline of this pandemic with another potential tool in treating Covid-19 patients,” said Patrizia Cavazzoni, M.D., acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in press statement. While giving the EUA, the US administration specified that emergency use is different than FDA approval.”In determining whether to issue a EUA, the FDA evaluates the available evidence and carefully balances any known or potential risks with any known or potential benefits of the product for use during an emergency,” the statement said.While the safety and effectiveness of this investigational therapy continue to be evaluated, bamlanivimab was shown in clinical trials to reduce Covid-19-related hospitalisation or emergency room visits in patients at high risk for disease progression within 28 days after treatment when compared to placebo, it added.According to the FDA, the investigational drug could be effective for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in adults and children who are 12 years of age and older and who are at risk of needing hospitalisation.Eli Lilly and Company said that the FDA’s decision was a crucial development in the fight against the coronavirus.”Today’s emergency use authorisation for Lilly’s investigational #Covid19 antibody is a key moment in the fight against this disease. There’s more work to be done, but we’re proud of this contribution to the global effort to beat Covid-19,” the Eli Lilly and Company tweeted.FDA said the company will now pass bamlanivimab to authorised distributors who will then supply health care facilities with the new treatment, as directed by the US government and in collaboration with local authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allows-emergency-use-of-pharmaceutical-company-s-covid-antibody-treatment/story-VOmL1ruUEMCvq0URp8OU1K.html
10-11-2020||World||Singapore may get first shipment of Covid-19 vaccine early next year: Report||Singapore may get the first shipment of a Covid-19 vaccine, co-developed by Singapore researchers along with US pharmaceutical company Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc, early next year, according to a media report on Tuesday. Singapore’s Economic Development Board (EDB) is pumping in some USD45 million into the manufacture of the vaccine, The Straits Times reported. EDB will also have the right to purchase up to USD 175 million of the vaccine at pre-negotiated prices, with shipments expected to begin in the first quarter of 2021, said Arcturus Therapeutics, the American pharmaceutical company working with Duke-National University of Singapore (NUS) scientists on the vaccine. Duke-NUS Medical School’s Professor Ooi Eng Eong, who had co-developed the vaccine with Arcturus, said the results so far show that the vaccine could be effective as a single dose. “This differentiates this investigational vaccine from many other Covid-19 vaccines in development,” Prof Ooi, who is also a member of Arcturus’ Vaccine Platform Scientific Advisory Board, was quoted as saying. “The vaccine has the potential to provide important public health benefits by greatly facilitating broad administration across multiple populations worldwide,” said Prof Ooi. Meanwhile, Singapore reported nine new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, bringing the country’s infection tally to 58,073.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-may-get-first-shipment-of-covid-19-vaccine-early-next-year-report/story-TPXZwXl5eeNFOn5x9DPoIJ.html

Dublin-based Ryanair, the continent’s biggest discount carrier, has more than 135 Max 200 jets on order, and has previously said it intends to take delivery of as many as 30 next year, once the model is cleared to fly following its 2019 grounding.Unlike other carriers that have deferred aircraft purchases to conserve cash amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Ryanair has said it expects to receive its first Max plane early in the new year. The airline has about 4.5 billion euros ($5.3 billion) in cash, and wholly owns 80% of its fleet, the carrier said in a statement last week.Boeing has over 300 pending orders for planes with airlines in the EU. Those include British Airways, which has 10 787s and 18 777Xs pending, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG has 20 787s and 20 777Xs due.Boeing is likely to step in to make sure the move doesn’t impact its bumper order, according to Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group.“There’s no way Ryanair is going to pay these tariffs in the current environment,” he said by phone. “Boeing’s going to have to figure out how to resolve this, either by convincing the new administration to settle the case or paying the 15% for Ryanair.”Counter PunchThe EU decision represents a counter punch to the US placing tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods after Washington won a World Trade Organization case against aid to Airbus SE. Last month, in a parallel 16-year-old lawsuit, the EU received final WTO permission to slap $4 billion of duties on American products over subsidies to Boeing.Airbus welcomed the EU decision to impose tariffs on US imports. The planemaker “supports all necessary actions to create a level-playing field and continues to support the EU’s commitment to finding a negotiated settlement of this long-standing dispute,” a spokesman said in a statement.Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Leary has previously said discussions are ongoing with Boeing for a follow-on order for new planes. Ryanair declined to comment, as did IAG SA, the parent company of British Airways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-tariffs-on-us-made-jets-may-affect-ryanair-s-max-order/story-V8DNrdnmZLENcBh9rtDwCP.html

10-11-2020||World||UK PM Johnson suffers heavy defeat in House of Lords on treaty-breaking Brexit laws||Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered a heavy defeat in parliament’s upper chamber on Monday over proposed laws which would allow him to breach Britain’s EU exit treaty - a plan that has been criticised by US president elect Joe Biden.The Internal Market Bill is designed to protect trade between Britain’s four nations after Brexit. It contains clauses ministers say are needed to protect Northern Ireland’s delicate status as part of the United Kingdom, but would also break international law in a “specific and limited” way.The House of Lords voted to strip those clauses from the bill in a series of defeats for the ruling Conservative Party. The government does not have a majority in the Lords and even some high-profile Conservative members opposed the clauses. “The government should see sense, accept the removal of these offending clauses, and start to rebuild our international reputation,” said Angela Smith, the opposition Labour Party’s leader in the Lords. Far from backing down, however, the government said it would retable the contentious clauses when the bill returns to the House of Commons, where it had previously passed by 340 votes to 256.“We’ve been consistently clear that the clauses represent a legal safety net to protect the integrity of the UK’s internal market and the huge gains of the (Northern Ireland) peace process,” a spokeswoman said.The publication of the bill in September provoked criticism with some saying it would wreck Britain’s international standing. Biden tweeted on Sept. 16 that anything which endangered the peace accord between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland would threaten Anglo-American trade.Johnson says the clauses are there to act as a safety net in case ongoing negotiations with the EU fail to work out how goods can flow between Britain, the British province of Northern Ireland, and across the open border with EU member Ireland. Many instead saw the bill as a negotiating gambit to win concessions from the EU in trade negotiations. Brussels has launched legal action against Britain over the proposals.“EU cannot ratify a new deal while UK is legislating to break a previous agreement,” Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said on Twitter. “Trust & Good Faith Matters.” The final wording of the bill has to be agreed by both houses, and typically the unelected Lords does not permanently block laws supported by the directly elected House of Commons.However, the clauses may no longer be needed if talks with the EU on how to make the Irish border work are successful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-suffers-heavy-defeat-in-house-of-lords-on-treaty-breaking-brexit-laws/story-tiSbh4HjUaF4XomgK26gBM.html
10-11-2020||World||Brazil suspends Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine trial due to severe adverse event||Brazil’s health regulator has suspended a clinical trial for China’s Sinovac coronavirus vaccine citing a severe adverse event, surprising the trial organisers who countered there had been a death but it was unrelated to the vaccine.The health regulator, Anvisa, said on Monday the event occurred on Oct. 29 but did not specify if it took place in Brazil or in another country. It also did not give an indication of how long the suspension might last.The trial is one of three large late-stage trials underway for the Sinovac vaccine. The vaccine has, however, faced controversy in Brazil with President Jair Bolsonaro dismissing it as lacking credibility.The setback to Sinovac’s efforts contrasts with good news from Pfizer Inc which said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results.Dimas Covas, the head of Sao Paulo’s medical research institute Butantan which is conducting the Sinovac trial, said the regulator’s decision was related to a death but added he found it strange “because it’s a death unrelated to the vaccine.”“As there are more than 10,000 volunteers at this moment, deaths can occur... It’s a death that has no relation with the vaccine and as such it is not the moment to interrupt the trials,” Covas told local broadcaster TV Cultura.Butantan plans to hold a news conference on Tuesday at 11 a.m. local time (1400 GMT).Sinovac said in a statement on its website on Tuesday it was confident in the safety of its vaccine and will continue to communicate with Brazil on the matter. It has previously said it expects interim results of late-stage trials this year.BOLSONARO’S OPPOSITIONIt is not uncommon for clinical trials to be suspended temporarily - sometimes for as short as a week - after a volunteer dies or takes ill so that trial organisers can check whether it is related to the drug being tested.Sinovac’s vaccine is among the three experimental Covid-19 vaccines that China has been using to inoculate hundreds of thousands of people under an emergency use programme. A Chinese health official said on Oct. 20 that serious side effects have not been observed in clinical trials.The Sinovac vaccine has, however, been dismissed by Bolsonaro, who regularly expresses anti-Chinese sentiment and has previously said the federal government will not buy the vaccine.Earlier on Monday he appeared to row back on those comments, saying the government would buy any vaccines that were approved by the Health Ministry and regulator Anvisa.Even so, Bolsonaro’s stance has set a clear political battleline with the Governor of Sao Paulo, Joao Doria, who has said his state will both import the vaccine and produce it, with work having begun on a plant capable of producing 100 million doses a year.Doria, who is widely expected to challenge Bolsonaro at the next presidential election in 2022, has said a public inoculation program in Sao Paulo with the Sinovac vaccine would likely be rolled out as early as January.Sinovac is also hoping to supply its experimental coronavirus vaccine to more South American countries by outsourcing some manufacturing procedures to Butantan.Late stage trials are also being conducted in Indonesia and Turkey. Indonesia’s state-owned Bio Farma said on Tuesday that its Sinovac vaccine trials were “going smoothly”.Brazil has the second deadliest coronavirus outbreak outside the United States, with over 160,000 dead and more than 5.6 million confirmed cases.Four vaccines are being tested in Brazil seeking Anvisa approval, including those developed by Oxford University/AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical subsidiary Janssen.Pfizer’s vaccine, developed in partnership with BioNTech SE , is undergoing late-stage tests involving 3,100 volunteers in Sao Paulo and Bahia states.Worldwide, there are at least 10 vaccine candidates in late-stage clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization. Four of them are from China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-suspends-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-trial-due-to-severe-adverse-event/story-pW9y3cZmmEARgZfVwUKn7L.html
10-11-2020||World||China turns up heat on internet giants with antitrust rules||China on Tuesday laid out detailed regulations for the first time to root out monopolistic practices in the internet industry, as Beijing seeks to curtail the growing dominance of corporations like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.The country’s antitrust watchdog is seeking feedback on a raft of regulations that establish a framework for curbing anti-competitive behavior such as colluding on sharing sensitive consumer data, alliances that squeeze out smaller rivals and subsidizing services at below cost to eliminate competitors. They may also require companies that operate a so-called Variable Interest Entity -- a vehicle through which virtually every major Chinese internet company attracts foreign investment and lists overseas -- to apply for specific operating approval.Alibaba and Tencent were both down more than 4% in Hong Kong, hurt also by a broader tech selloff. JD.com Inc. dived as much as 8.9%, its steepest intraday fall on record. And Meituan was down more than 12%, the biggest intraday decline since November 2018.“This is a watershed moment,” said Ma Chen, a Beijing-based partner at Han Kun Law Offices who specializes in antitrust. Chinese regulators “are stepping up control because these platform companies have become too powerful and touch upon all corners of life.”The rules also restrict targeting specific customers through their online behavior, a common practice adopted by players both at home and abroad. Under the regulations unveiled by the State Administration of Market Regulation, violators may be forced to divest assets, intellectual property or technologies, open up their infrastructure and adjust their algorithms.The latest proposal follows heightened scrutiny of technology companies worldwide, as regulators investigate the extent to which internet giants from Facebook Inc. to Alphabet Inc.’s Google can leverage their dominance. Consumers in China -- home to some of the world’s largest corporations from e-commerce giant Alibaba to WeChat-operator Tencent -- have in recent years protested against the gradual erosion of their privacy via technology from facial recognition to big data analysis.Beijing is increasingly seeking to diminish the influence that a handful of its tech corporations wield over vast swathes of the economy. It investigated Tencent’s music arm’s exclusive agreements with publishers last year, and most recently modified regulations to rein in risk at fast-growing micro-lending entities such as Ant Group Co. The latter step derailed Ant’s planned IPO last week, before it was to complete what would have been the world’s largest such offering on record.Alibaba and Tencent now dominate e-commerce and gaming, and are key backers of leaders in adjacent businesses such as food delivery giant Meituan and car-hailing leader Didi Chuxing. They’ve together invested billions of dollars in hundreds of up-and-coming mobile and internet companies, gaining kingmaker status in the world’s largest smartphone and internet arena by users. Companies like TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent-rival NetEase Corp. that have risen to prominence without backing from either of the pair are viewed as rare exceptions. In other areas, Baidu Inc. dominates online search.The new rules were proposed in accordance with China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, which included broad language governing internet companies in January for the first time. The watchdog will seek public feedback on the regulations till Nov. 30.Ma said the specific regulation pertaining to VIEs requiring approval should be of concern to much of the industry as well. The model has never been formally endorsed by Beijing but has been used by tech titans such as Alibaba to list their shares overseas. Under the structure, Chinese corporations transfer profits to an offshore entity with shares that foreign investors can then own. Pioneered by Sina Corp. and its investment bankers during a 2000 initial public offering, the VIE framework rests on shaky legal ground and foreign investors have been nervous about their bets unwinding overnight.“It will not only have a huge impact on Alibaba but also all the companies that use a platform business model and a VIE structure,” Ma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-turns-up-heat-on-internet-giants-with-antitrust-rules/story-vPM0hLUGm0iobI1cYJXAjI.html

Groups such as the United Nations have also raised questions over Al Qaeda with a senior U.N. official telling the BBC last month that the group were still “heavily embedded” with the Taliban.Outgoing US President Donald Trump had made ending the war in Afghanistan a major campaign promise and had said in a Tweet in October that troops could be out of Afghanistan by Christmas, though officials such as his national security advisor have said that they were working to the May 2021 deadline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-call-on-joe-biden-to-stick-to-us-troop-withdrawal-deal/story-XFTCCs0UmpQjvWExESNt5N.html
10-11-2020||World||Aung San Suu Kyi’s ruling party claims resounding election win in Myanmar||Myanmar’s ruling party claimed a resounding victory on Monday in the country’s second parliamentary election since the end of strict military rule, based on its own unofficial tally of votes.Sunday’s election was viewed as a referendum on the fledgling democratic government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and her ruling National League for Democracy (NLD), which remains very popular at home but has seen its overseas reputation battered by accusations of genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority.NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters it had won many more than the 322 seats in parliament needed to form a government, based on data compiled from reports by party agents at polling stations nationwide, though he gave no specific estimate.“For the people, for the party, this is such an encouraging election result,” he said, adding that the NLD expected to exceed the total of 390 seats it won in its 2015 landslide win.The Election Commission had been expected to release results on Monday but had only published a handful by the evening, as candidates and parties posted their own data online. Up for grabs were 315 seats in the 425-member lower house and 161 seats in the 217-seat upper house of parliament.A spokesman for the second biggest party, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), could not immediately be reached for comment.In separate statements, the European Union and Britain commended Myanmar on the polls but criticised the disenfranchisement of more than a million voters, including hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state.Some unable to voteThe military, which ruled Myanmar for nearly 50 years until it began withdrawing from civilian politics in 2011, controls a quarter of seats in both houses of parliament under a constitution it drew up and which Suu Kyi wants to amend.The NLD had been expected to win but with a smaller margin following the emergence of new parties and ethnic minority parties gaining support in some regions.Political analyst Yan Myo Thein said early results showed ethnic parties had won some seats in Kayah, Mon, and Shan states, where many people harbour grievances against the central government but the overall picture was of another NLD landslide.The results, he said, “show that the majority of people don’t want… the involvement of the military in politics and the majority of people still continue to recognize and support Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the NLD, as their leader.”In contrast to the wave of optimism that greeted the NLD’s 2015 win, Myanmar held this election amid a surge in Covid-19 infections, economic hardships and escalating ethnic conflicts. More than a million people were unable to vote after polls were cancelled due to insurgencies.In Rakhine state, where Rohingya Muslims are confined to camps and villages and mostly denied the vote because they are not citizens, the vast majority of polling stations were closed due to fighting between government troops and ethnic insurgents.Myo Kyaw, general secretary of the Arakan League for Democracy (ALD), said the Rakhine nationalist Arakan National Party (ANP) had won most seats contested in the state.The Democracy and Human Rights Party, a Rohingya party, said in a statement it was “utterly disappointed” that its people had been disenfranchised.The government does not consider most Rohingya Myanmar citizens but migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh even though many can trace family roots back many generations.The United Nations has said there was genocidal intent in a 2017 army crackdown that forced 730,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. Myanmar says its security forces were carrying out legitimate operations against Rohingya militants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aung-san-suu-kyi-s-ruling-party-claims-resounding-election-win-in-myanmar/story-tOW4gyLlK66jw1KeN5jRDL.html
10-11-2020||World||US president-elect Joe Biden defends health care law as high court mulls its fate||President-elect Joe Biden is championing the Obama administration’s signature health law as it goes before the Supreme Court in a case that could overturn it.He will deliver a speech on the Affordable Care Act on Tuesday, the same day the high court will hear arguments on its merits. It ruled eight years ago to leave the essential components of the law known as Obamacare intact, but is now controlled 6-3 by a conservative majority after President Donald Trump’s appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett.The speech reflects the importance Biden is putting on health care as he prepares to take office in January amid the worst pandemic in more than a century. He’s launching his transition process this week as the virus surges across the country. The US surpassed 10 million cases Monday.Biden also focused on health care Monday as he pleaded with Americans to put aside their political differences and wear masks to protect themselves and their neighbours from the virus.“We could save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democratic or Republican lives, American lives,” Biden said. “Please, I implore you, wear a mask.”The suit challenging the health care law was brought in America’s largest conservative state, Texas, and is backed by Trump and top Republicans. It asks the Supreme Court to declare the law’s mandate to buy health insurance unconstitutional because Congress had previously repealed the penalties for non compliance.After serving as President Barack Obama’s vice president for eight years, Biden has pledged to build on the Affordable Care Act while championing a “public option” that would allow more people to opt into government-sponsored health insurance even as millions of others could stick with their current, usually employer-based coverage.But such changes could be difficult to enact if Democrats fail to win a majority in the Senate. Control of the chamber hinges on two run-off races in Georgia that will be decided in January.Biden, meanwhile, is moving forward with planning a presidential transition even as Trump refuses to concede the race and falsely argues it was stolen from him.The president-elect is expected to quickly name a chief of staff and start considering Cabinet appointments, though those likely won’t be finalized for weeks.But he’s running into hurdles from the General Services Administration, which is tasked with formally recognizing Biden as president-elect. That designation eases cooperation between the outgoing and incoming administrations. The agency’s Trump-appointed administrator, Emily Murphy, has not started the process and has given no guidance on when she will.That lack of clarity is fueling questions about whether Trump will spend as much of his remaining time in office as possible hindering Biden from building out his government. Biden has so far largely ignored Trump and instead called for bipartisanship — but he may not be able to keep doing so for much longer.“This election is over,” Biden said during his speech Monday. “It’s time to put aside the partisanship, and the rhetoric that is designed to demonize one another.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-elect-joe-biden-defends-health-care-law-as-high-court-mulls-its-fate/story-HNVvshQBABGnaRZ261PjfN.html
10-11-2020||World||Trump challenges Pennsylvania voting, ropes in attorney general||President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign on Monday filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania, the tipping point state that gave President-elect Joe Biden the 2020 elections, challenging its “two-track” voting system and his attorney general William Barr authorised an investigation into “substantial allegations” of irregularities.Trump has refused to accept the outcome of the election called for Biden unanimously by media outlets, not conceded the election and continued to file lawsuits. Biden, who has sought to move on declaring the “election is over”, has continued to increase his victory margin in Pennsylvania, which along with key swing states, propelled him to victory.“Voters in Pennsylvania were held to different standards simply based on how they chose to cast their ballot, and we believe this two-tiered election system resulted in potentially fraudulent votes being counted without proper verification or oversight, as well as many voters being disenfranchised simply for casting their votes in-person,” said Matt Morgan, Trump 2020 campaign general counsel, announcing the lawsuit.Trump’s lawsuit contends that those who voted by mail were not subjected to the same rigorous scrutiny as those who voted in person, and this resulted “in two Constitutional violations: 1) Equal Protection Clause violation, and 2) Elections and Electors Clauses violation”.The Trump campaign has also sought recount of votes in Wisconsin and Georgia. The former is a state Trump won in 2016 but where he is trailing by more than 20,000 votes, and the latter is a solidly Republican state that last voted for a Democrat in 1992 and now has the president-elect ahead by 11,000 votes.Recounts are legitimate and matter. But in the 2000 recount, the best known one that is being discussed widely now, the initial winner, President George W Bush, had prevailed.President Trump is determined to make a fight of it though. “We will not stop fighting for transparency and integrity in our electoral process and ensuring all Americans can trust in the results of a free and fair election” Morgan, the campaign counsel, added.Attorney General Barr joined in Monday with instruction to US attorneys, according to a memo obtained and cited by Associated Press, that investigations “may be conducted if there are clear and apparently credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual state”.Barr has acquired the reputation of a pliable attorney general who has reduced the office to serve as a lawyer to the president. But his memo was seen as an attempt to please the president while, at the same time, leave enough room for doubt through carefully worded caveats.President Trump’s efforts to discredit the election suffered another setback when a body of international election observers invited by his administration reported no irregularities in the elections.“While the OAS (Organization of American States) Mission has not directly observed any serious irregularities that call into question the results so far, it supports the right of all contesting parties in an election, to seek redress before the competent legal authorities when they believe they have been wronged,” the report said. “It is critical however, that candidates act responsibly by presenting and arguing legitimate claims before the courts, not unsubstantiated or harmful speculation in the public media.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-challenges-pennsylvania-voting-ropes-in-attorney-general/story-4GgdhVrILQLxK3amEBA6tK.html
10-11-2020||World||China vaccine trial halted in Brazil after serious adverse event||The final-stage trial of a Chinese frontrunner vaccine candidate has been halted in Brazil due to a serious adverse event, the first time that any of the Asian nation’s rapidly developed Covid-19 shots have met with such a setback.Testing of Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s vaccine, called Coronavac, has been halted in Brazil after an event that occurred on Oct. 29, said the Brazil Health Agency on Tuesday, without any further detail on the illness. The study is interrupted in accordance with regulations while the agency analyzes if the study should continue, it said.Serious adverse events that occur in drug trials include death, immediate risk of death, long term or serious incapacitation, and hospitalization.Such pauses are not uncommon in large-scale drug trials and two western developers - AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson -- have paused their vaccine trials in recent months due to serious adverse events, only to re-start them after investigation.But China has already started administering its vaccines, including Coronavac, to hundreds of thousands of people under an expansive emergency use approval, making the prospect of a safety issue being detected at this stage more concerning.China Defends Giving Experimental Vaccines to ThousandsLast month, China’s science ministry said its companies have inoculated about 60,000 volunteers in final-stage trials, but there have been no reports of serious adverse events. Sinovac’s company representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Brazil trial pause.Chinese vaccine developers have been at the forefront of the global race to create an effective immunization against the virus. The push has taken on vital importance as countries look to move beyond Covid-19 and more definitively re-open their economies.Vaccine development processes that usually take years have been compressed into months by global players, encouraged by politicians wanting a quick fix to the pandemic that has sickened more than 50 million.The Chinese setback comes as Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE released early findings showing that a vaccine they are developing prevented more than 90% of symptomatic infections in the trial of tens of thousands of volunteers, boosting hope for a quick neutralization of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-vaccine-trial-halted-in-brazil-after-serious-adverse-event/story-tKE1z5y93bF3l0IVHpxegN.html
10-11-2020||World||Joe Biden acts on Covid plan with task force||President-elect Joe Biden, who has announced a team to shape his Covid-19 plan, on Monday called Pfizer’s announcement of vaccine test success as “excellent news” but said masks remained a “more potent weapon against the virus”.Biden, who had made fighting the pandemic his top priority, named a 13-member advisory board on Sunday to “shape my approach to managing” the surge in cases and the search for vaccine. It is co-chaired by former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, former head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) David Kessler and Yale School of Medicine’s Marcella Nunez-Smith.Biden’s transition team was informed of Pfizer’s vaccine, which the company said has proven to be 90% effective, just hours later. “Last night, my public health advisors were informed of this excellent news,” he said on Monday. “I congratulate the brilliant women and men who helped produce this breakthrough and to give us such cause for hope.”But he cautioning the end of the battle against Covid-19 was “still months away”. It will be “many more months” before a vaccine is widely available. This is why, he said, citing Centers for Disease Prevention Director Robert Redfield, “for the foreseeable future, a mask remains a more potent weapon against the virus than the vaccine”.“Today’s news does not change this urgent reality. Americans will have to rely on masking, distancing, contact tracing, hand washing, and other measures to keep themselves safe well into next year. Today’s news is great news, but it doesn’t change that fact.”Biden had withstood ridicule for his use of masks and strict adherence to social distancing norms during the campaign.President Trump, who has not conceded the election and is challenging the outcome, welcomed the announcement in a tweet in all-caps: “STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS!”Vice-President Mike Pence, who leads the White House task force on Covid, was equally effusive. “Thanks to the public-private partnership forged by President @realDonaldTrump, @Pfizer announced its Coronavirus Vaccine trial is EFFECTIVE, preventing infection in 90% of its volunteers,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-acts-on-covid-plan-with-task-force/story-tOyHp5mCgWlYITjObLhXnI.html
10-11-2020||World||Behind Covid vaccine, a couple with shared passion for cancer research||Positive data on BioNTech and US partner Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine is an unlikely success for the married couple behind the German biotech firm, who have devoted their lives to harnessing the immune system against cancer.Pfizer said on Monday said its experimental vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 based on initial data from a large study.From humble roots as the son of a Turkish immigrant working at a Ford factory in Cologne, BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin, 55, now figures among the 100 richest Germans, together with his wife and fellow board member Oezlem Tuereci, 53, according to weekly Welt am Sonntag.The market value of Nasdaq-listed BioNTech, which the pair co-founded, ballooned to $21 billion as of Friday’s close from $4.6 billion a year ago, with the firm set to play a major role in mass immunisation against the coronavirus.“Despite his achievements, he never changed from being incredibly humble and personable,” said Matthias Kromayer, board member of venture capital firm MIG AG, whose funds have backed BioNTech since its inception in 2008. He added Sahin would typically walk into business meetings wearing jeans and carrying his signature bicycle helmet and backpack with him.Doggedly pursuing his childhood dream of studying medicine and becoming a physician, Sahin worked at teaching hospitals in Cologne and the southwestern city of Homburg, where he met Tuereci during his early academic career. Medical research and oncology became a shared passion. Tuereci, the daughter of a Turkish physician who had migrated to Germany, said in a media interview that even on the day of their wedding, both made time for lab work.Together they honed in on the immune system as a potential ally in the fight against cancer and tried to address the unique genetic makeup of each tumour.Founded in 2008, BioNTech pursued a much broader range of cancer immunotherapy tools. That included mRNA, a versatile messenger substance to send genetic instructions into cells.The BioNTech story took a twist when Sahin in January came across a scientific paper on a new coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan and it struck him how small the step was from anti-cancer mRNA drugs to mRNA-based viral vaccines.BioNTech quickly assigned about 500 staff to project “light speed” to work on several possible compounds, winning pharma giant Pfizer and Chinese drugmaker Fosun as partners in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/behind-covid-vaccine-a-couple-with-shared-passion-for-cancer-research/story-dUV9Z9Ndv8msRC49delHiJ.html
10-11-2020||World||China, Russia hold off on hailing Biden’s victory as Trump digs in||China and Russia held off congratulating US President-elect Joe Biden on Monday, with Bejing saying it would follow usual custom in its response and the Kremlin noting incumbent Donald Trump’s vow to pursue legal challenges.Democrat Biden clinched enough states to win the presidency on Saturday and has begun making plans for when he takes office on January 20. Trump has not conceded defeat and plans rallies to build support for legal challenges.Some of the United States’ biggest and closest allies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, including India, quickly congratulated Biden over the weekend despite Trump’s refusal to concede, as did some Trump allies, including Israel and Saudi Arabia.“We noticed that Mr Biden has declared election victory,” China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a daily media briefing. “We understand that the US presidential election result will be determined following U.S. law and procedures.” In 2016, Chinese President Xi Jinping sent congratulations to Trump on November 9, a day after the election.While Biden is expected to maintain a tough stance on China – he has called Xi a “thug” and vowed to lead a campaign to “pressure, isolate and punish China” – he is likely to take a more measured and multilateral in his approach.The Kremlin said it would wait for the official results of the election before commenting, and that it had noted Trump’s announcement of legal challenges. President Vladimir Putin has remained silent since Biden’s victory. In the run-up to the vote, Putin had appeared to hedge his bets, frowning on Biden’s anti-Russian rhetoric but welcoming his comments on nuclear arms control. Putin had also defended Biden’s son, Hunter, against criticism from Trump. “We think it appropriate to wait for the official vote count,” a Kremlin spokesperson told reporters.There were two other notable holdouts among the world leaders who rushed to congratulate Biden: the leaders of Latin America’s two largest countries, both of whom have been seen as friendly to Trump.President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, sometimes dubbed “the Trump of the Tropics” for his populist, off-the-cuff style, has kept silent on Trump’s loss. And Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador refused to congratulate Biden at this point, saying he would wait until the legal challenges over the vote were resolved.On Saturday, López Obrador was one of the few world leaders still willing to heap praise on Trump. “President Trump has been very respectful of us, and we have reached very good agreements, and we thank him because he has not interfered and has respected us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-russia-hold-off-on-hailing-biden-s-victory-as-trump-digs-in/story-TB431Vw26Xo3eAhx7VPGiI.html
10-11-2020||World||Pfizer says its Covid vaccine 90 per cent effective||The Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE prevented more than 90% of infections in a study of tens of thousands of volunteers, the most encouraging scientific advance so far in the battle against the pandemic that has infected over 50 million people, of whom 1.2 million have died.Eight months into the crisis, the preliminary results pave the way for the companies to seek an emergency-use authorisation from regulators if further research shows the shot is also safe. The vaccine may be available by the end of the month. The disclosure ends the suspense over the release of interim analysis of the company’s Phase 3 clinical trials that was initially expected by the end of October. The data (the first interim efficacy analysis as it is called of late stage trial data) was released after being vetted by independent experts. Interim efficacy data presents the first significant evidence that a vaccine has been able to prevent disease, and not just trigger an immune response. Pfizer and BioNTech’s announcement that the messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine had at least 90% efficacy among 94 confirmed cases means that at least 84 of the people who developed symptomatic Covid from over 43,000 trial volunteers had received the placebo.This includes people who got two doses of the vaccine as well as those who received a placebo shot. According to Pfizer’s trial protocol released previously, this number falls closer to what would have been the third interim analysis checkpoint, for which it had set a 62.7% efficacy target – the 90% number far exceeds this target. “The first set of results from our Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccine trials provides the initial evidence of our vaccine’s ability to prevent Covid-19,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. He termed it “a great day for science and humanity.”The companies’ findings do not include details on safety because the US Food and Drug Administration requires at least two months of safety data and the company is in the process of collating that for the trial that began in late July and involves almost 44,000 participants. In a statement, Pfizer said it will “have the required safety data by late November. Submission for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be planned soon after the required safety milestone is achieved, which is currently expected to occur in the third week of November.” If approved, the companies expect to produce around 50 million doses of the vaccine this year itself. “With today’s news, we are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,” Bourla added.According to science informatics and analytics company Airfinity, Pfizer’s positive results mean they could have enough cases for EUA in the US following the safety readouts in less than two weeks. “We also expect EU and UK to approve quickly,” said Airfinity’s CEO Rasmus Bech Hansen, in an email to HT. “These results increase the likelihood of a positive readout for Moderna, whose vaccine follows similar technology and had comparable phase I data,” Hansen said, adding that “US, EU, and Japan stand as biggest winners as they have pre-purchased the most doses from Pfizer”.Pfizer-BioNTech have secured supply deals with multiple countries for a little over 1 billion doses till the end of 2021. In all, its production capacity till the end of 2021, based on deals with vaccine makers, is estimated at 1.8 billion doses, according to Airfinity data. To be sure, one of the fundamental questions about any vaccine for Covid-19 remains unanswered by this data (although that was never meant to be answered rightaway): the length of immunity provided by the vaccine.Pfizer and BioNTech are among the frontrunners in the race to develop a vaccine for Covid-19. Others that are in the midst of late-stage human trials include Moderna Inc, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca-Oxford.The interim data from the Pfizer vaccine was to be initially reviewed after 32 volunteers in the trial contracted the infection; this was subsequently increased to 62; but eventually, the data for 94 participants who were infected and symptomatic was analysed.If successfully tested and launched, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be the world’s first mRNA one. Its vaccine carries a piece of genetic instruction code (mRNA) that activates human cells to themselves make a version of the spike protein of SARS-COV2, the virus that causes Covid-19. This spike protein then activates the body’s immune system, producing an immune reaction. Moderna’s vaccine candidate is also based on the same technology. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will require two shots. According to the companies, the data indicates that the efficacy rate is in excess of 90%, seven days after participants received their second shot.News of the vaccine’s efficacy breaks amidst a surge in cases in the US, with the 7-day average crossing 100,000 over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-its-covid-vaccine-90-per-cent-effective/story-rpCzQlRMmLSXK9TtGJsfoM.html
10-11-2020||World||Trump fires US defence secretary Mark Esper||US President Donald Trump on Monday fired defence secretary Mark Esper and announced Christopher C Mills, head of the National Counterterrorism Center, as acting head of the defence department.Esper was Trump’s second defence secretary. The first, James Mattis, had resigned over policy differences with the president about troops in Syria.“I am pleased to announce that Christopher C Miller, the highly respected Director of the National Counterterrorism Center (unanimously confirmed by the Senate), will be Acting Secretary of Defense, effective immediately,” president said on twitter.“Chris will do a GREAT job! Mark Esper has been terminated. I would like to thank him for his service.”Esper had only two months, as does Trump who lost the election to Joe Biden, the president-elect.Esper’s firing further destabilises a government already navigating Trump’s refusal to concede election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden.Esper had clashed with Trump over his suggestion of using military personnel to quash civic unrest.Trump, who is pursuing so far flimsy claims of election fraud in the courts, has only until January 20 before he has to leave office and Biden takes over.Esper’s departure could foreshadow a broader post-election purge of appointees who displeased the president. It also means Trump will have seen the departure of two confirmed defence secretaries in less than two years.While Esper, 56, had worked with the president on controversial priorities such as sending US troops to the border with Mexico and drawing down forces in Germany, Afghanistan and Syria, the president voiced increasing dissatisfaction with his Pentagon chief in recent months.Trump said privately in August that he planned to replace Esper after the election, according to people familiar with the discussions, while the defence secretary told people close to him that he intended to leave regardless of the election’s outcome.The president was frustrated that Esper, who became secretary in July 2019 after serving as Army secretary and as a former executive at Raytheon Technologies Corp., didn’t do more to publicly defend him on key issues, including Trump’s rejection of reports that Russia paid Taliban fighters “bounties” for the killing of U.S. troops in Afghanistan.Trump has increasingly sought overt signs of loyalty and a willingness by his top aides to engage in partisan fighting, as demonstrated by Secretary of State Michael Pompeo’s making of a video in support of the president while on an official trip to Jerusalem for the president’s behalf at the Republican National Convention in August.But while Trump’s cabinet secretaries routinely shift praise for key accomplishments to the president, Esper sometimes showed neutrality. Last month, Esper lauded 10 NATO allies for meeting defence spending thresholds he didn’t mention that Trump had pressed for that outcome.Trump was also angered that Esper in June publicly opposed the idea of deploying active-duty military to contain nationwide protests over racism. He confronted his defense secretary June 3 at the White House after Esper held a news conference in which he said that using active-duty military forces to perform law enforcement within the US is “a matter of last resort” and that the National Guard was better-suited to the task, people familiar with the matter said.The president again signalled fatigue with Esper on August 15, when he used a derogatory nickname for his defense chief meant to suggest he’s a yes-man.“Mark Yesper, did you call him Yesper” Trump said at the time. “Some people call him Yesper. I get along with him,” he added with a shrug.When asked if he was considering firing Esper, the president replied, “I consider firing everybody. At some point that’s what happens.”(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-fires-us-defence-secretary-mark-esper/story-XTMhJ81YVCyZZxmA58p7lK.html
