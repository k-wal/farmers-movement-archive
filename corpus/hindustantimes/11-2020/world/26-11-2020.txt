They will make an assessment with lots of data that is not currently in the public domain on efficacy and on safety,” Whitty said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-uk-scientific-adviser-says-astrazeneca-vaccine-against-covid-19-works/story-BGBuZR0c5ST7RDqu27Z4aI.html
26-11-2020||World||Astrazeneca likely to run additional global vaccine test, CEO says||AstraZeneca Plc is likely to conduct an additional global trial to assess the efficacy of its Covid-19 vaccine, according to the company’s chief executive officer, after current studies raised questions over its level of protection.The new trial would be run instead of adding an arm to an ongoing U.S. trial and would evaluate a lower dosage that performed better than a full amount in Astra’s studies. The company’s acknowledgment that the lower level was given in error fueled concerns, and the new trial would be used to confirm whether or not the higher 90% efficacy rate stands.“Now that we’ve found what looks like a better efficacy we have to validate this, so we need to do an additional study,” CEO Pascal Soriot said in his first interview since the data were released. It will probably be another “international study, but this one could be faster because we know the efficacy is high so we need a smaller number of patients.”Soriot said he didn’t expect the additional trial to hold up regulatory approvals in the U.K. and European Union. Clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may take longer because the regulator is unlikely to approve the vaccine on the basis of studies conducted elsewhere, especially given the questions over the results, he said. Authorization in some countries is still expected before the end of the year, he said.“The question for us was, will we need the U.S. data to get approval in the U.S. or can we get approval in the U.S. with international data, and it was never clear,” said Soriot, who is in quarantine after arriving in Australia. “Now with those results it’s more likely that we will need the U.S. data.”Astra and its CEO are facing scrutiny as the drugmaker responds to growing confusion over the vaccine. The company’s late-stage data initially increased confidence that the world would soon have multiple shots to combat the pathogen, following positive reports from front-runners Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. But scant disclosures and the manufacturing discrepancy have sparked doubts among scientists and investors.Different RatesAstra and its partner, the University of Oxford, reported Monday that a lower initial dose of the vaccine, followed by a full dose, produced a 90% efficacy rate in a smaller set of participants, compared with 62% for two full doses.A day after the data were unveiled the head of the U.S. vaccine program known as Operation Warp Speed said that the regimen showing the higher level of effectiveness was tested in a younger population. He also said that the half-dose was given to some people because of an error in the quantity of vaccine put into some vials. None of those details were disclosed in Astra or Oxford’s original statements.Astra May Need New Covid-19 Vaccine Trial Beyond the U.S.: ReactSoriot disputed the idea that the half-dose regimen was an error, saying that after researchers realized the dosing error they formally changed the trial protocol with the blessing of regulators.“I won’t tell you we expected the efficacy to be higher,” said Soriot. “People call it a mistake -- it’s not a mistake.”Astra shares closed 0.7% lower in London. They have declined about 7% this week amid questions about the trial results.The company has previously said it was considering adding a new arm to its U.S. trial to test the lower dosage.Astra and researchers have declined to provide more data ahead of a peer-reviewed analysis that is expected to be published in the coming weeks. Results have been submitted to an undisclosed journal, Astra said in a statement.Astra’s is one of three vaccines that could be approved before the end of the year. Pfizer and Moderna, which have both created vaccines using messenger RNA, published data earlier this month that showed their vaccines were about 95% effective, and Pfizer has applied to U.S. regulators for emergency approval.There’s added pressure on the Astra shot to succeed because it’s easier to store and the company is selling it at cost during the pandemic, which means many low- and middle-income countries are relying on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-likely-to-run-additional-global-vaccine-test-ceo-says/story-fxpfgx9jJ5GyR62yyApq9L.html
26-11-2020||World||In Georgia, Republicans juggle Biden win and Trump loyalties||Twin Georgia Senate runoffs have Republicans in a quandary. They could admit President Donald Trump lost his re-election bid and turn all attention to salvaging a Senate majority to counter President-elect Joe Biden. Or they could march lockstep alongside Trump and his unfounded assertions of a stolen election.So far, Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, along with a gaggle of GOP power players right up to Vice President Mike Pence, seem to want it both ways. Some Trump loyalists insist that’s not enough.This tightrope act threatens party unity as Loeffler and Perdue try to beat back strong Democratic challenges from Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, respectively, in Jan. 5 contests that will determine which party controls the Senate at the outset of a Biden administration. The worrisome reality for Republicans is that it wouldn’t take much splintering to tilt the contests in Democrats’ favor in a newfound battleground where Biden outpaced Trump by just 12,000 votes out of about 5 million cast in the general election.“If they want to excite Trump supporters to turn out to vote in the Senate runoff, candidates need to be supportive of what the Trump campaign is doing in the regard to challenging the election,” said Debbie Dooley, a national tea party organizer in Georgia and an early supporter of Trump’s 2016 campaign.After Georgia’s Republican secretary of state and Republican governor certified the state’s vote totals in Biden’s favor, Dooley said, the sentiment among the president’s strongest supporters crystallized. They “question why they should support candidates that aren’t fully supporting Trump,” she said.To be sure, Perdue and Loeffler have made considerable efforts to align themselves with Trump throughout their Senate tenures — nearly six years for the first-term Perdue, less than a year for the appointed Loeffler now seeking her first election. Since Election Day, the senators have called for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s resignation. They’ve echoed nebulous claims about irregularities in Georgia’s voting process and tabulation and have yet to publicly acknowledge Biden as the president-elect.Yet the campaign on the ground offers a different story, with the senators and their top supporters stressing an argument that admits, without saying as much, that Biden has been duly elected and will take office on Jan. 20.Perdue calls a Republican Senate “the last line of defense” as he campaigns on a bus emblazoned with a clear message: “Win Georgia. Save America.”On stage recently with Pence in Canton, Georgia, the senator got even more direct, cautioning that if he and Loeffler lose, Democrats will “have the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives. They’ll do anything they want.”Indeed, Democrats are maintaining their House majority and Republicans must win at least one of the Georgia seats for a Senate majority. A Democratic sweep would yield a 50-50 Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking the tie as presiding officer.Loeffler avoids explicit acknowledgements of Trump’s defeat, but her message isn’t subtle. “We are the firewall to socialism in America,” she roared at one of the rallies with Pence.Neither Ossoff nor Warnock is a socialist, but Loeffler’s hyperbole acknowledges that there’ll be Democratic veto pen in the Oval Office. So, Loeffler said, “We are going to hold the line right here in Georgia.”The balancing act extends through Trump’s Cabinet. “I’m here because I stand with President Donald Trump,” Pence declared in Gainesville, Georgia.The vice president, almost certainly a future presidential candidate himself, carefully parsed his words, declaring that a GOP Senate majority “could be” Republicans’ last tool to protect “all that we’ve accomplished.” Pence said nothing to counter the passions of crowds that erupted into chants of “Stop the steal!”Sonny Perdue, Trump’s agriculture secretary and the senator’s cousin, covered every base, perhaps clumsily. The former Georgia governor called Biden’s name, unlike Pence, and warned against giving him “a blank check on America’s values.” Yet in the same speech, the secretary insisted “we’re not going to give up on President Trump.”The circumstances are precarious enough that many establishment Republicans, including Loeffler and Perdue confidants, decline to speak openly about it. The senators have not taken questions at their joint runoff campaign events, and neither campaign responded to an Associated Press inquiry on whether they recognize Biden as the incoming president.Trump is doing little to make his fellow Republicans’ course any easier.The president has chastised Raffensperger, the Georgia elections chief, and Gov. Brian Kemp, himself a former Georgia secretary of state, on social media. Raffensperger has taken to the editorial pages of The Washington Post to defend his job performance and his conservative credentials. When Kemp announced his certification of the 16 Democrats who’ll cast Georgia’s electoral votes for Biden, the governor took pains to make clear it was a purely ministerial act required by law.Trump remains defiant even after losing round after round of court disputes and after the General Services Administration finally acknowledged Biden as president-elect, the legal step required for the federal government to begin the customary transfer of power.As recently as Wednesday, Trump retweeted hollow claims of a fraudulent election, and, in Georgia, his team’s top lawyer, Lin Wood, fanned the flames.Wood tweeted that Loeffler and Perdue should demand that Georgia hold a special legislative session to review ballots and conduct a “legitimate” recount, despite the thorough one that was held, as a condition for getting the votes of Georgians in the run-off.Voters like Shaun Tracy are the targets of the muddled messaging.The 60-year-old came to see Pence, Loeffler and both Perdues, but made clear she was there because of her loyalties to the president. “There’s just been too many irregularities and discrepancies going on,” Tracy said, repeating the baseless assertion that Biden’s victory is due to fraudulent absentee ballots, among other things. “They’re trying to take our freedom away.”Days later, David Perdue heard that refrain more directly.Standing in front of his campaign bus, the senator launched into his usual entreaty about the runoffs’ importance. As Perdue spoke, a man in the audience cried out: “What are you doing to help Donald Trump?”___Associated Press writer Jeff Amy contributed from Canton, Georgia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-georgia-republicans-juggle-biden-win-and-trump-loyalties/story-t5IMpSQLBf8iZ58WLMeFLO.html
26-11-2020||World||‘Why now?’ Dismay as US considers troop pullout from Somalia||No country has been involved in Somalia’s future as much as the United States. Now the Trump administration is thinking of withdrawing the several hundred US military troops from the Horn of Africa nation at what some experts call the worst possible time.Three decades of chaos, from warlords to al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab to the emergence of an Islamic State-linked group, have ripped apart the country that only in the past few years has begun to find its footing. The US Embassy returned to Somalia just last year, 28 years after diplomats and staffers fled.Somalia faces a tense election season that begins in the next few weeks to decide the presidency and parliament. United Nations experts say al-Shabab, supporting its 5,000 to 10,000 fighters on a rich diet of extorting businesses and civilians, is improving its bomb-making skills. And an ever bigger military force, the African Union’s 19,000-strong AMISOM, has begun its own withdrawal from a country whose forces are widely considered unready to assume full responsibility for security.It is not clear whether President Donald Trump will order the withdrawal of the some 700 US military forces from Somalia, following his orders for Afghanistan and Iraq, or whether the reported urge will pass before he leaves office in January. But the idea is taken seriously, even as US drone strikes are expected to continue in Somalia against al-Shabab and IS fighters from neighboring Djibouti and Kenya — where al-Shabab carried out a deadly attack against US forces early this year.The US Africa Command has seen a “definitive shift” this year in al-Shabab’s focus to attack US interests in the region, a new report by the Department of Defense inspector general said Wednesday — and the command says al-Shabab is Africa’s most “dangerous” and “imminent” threat.Here’s what’s at stake:COUNTERTERRORISM“The first thing ... it’s disastrous for Somalia’s security sector, it just causes that first panic reaction: You know, why now?” said Samira Gaid, a Somali national security specialist who served as senior security adviser to the prime minister and special adviser to the head of AMISOM. “Especially since over the past three and half years in particular the security sector really improved, and we tried to work closely with” the US, she told The Associated Press.Recent progress includes a “war council” between the US and Somali governments, she said, where the US helps to draw up military plans. “We call them Somali-led operations, but really the US is hand-holding us through it.”The US military also trains Somalia’s elite Danab special forces that now number around 1,000, and is providing Danab with air cover and intelligence, Gaid said.“Danab was expanding, that’s why this is so shocking,” she said. “Is it possible to move forward with that plan now?”Danab units are now operational in four of Somalia’s five member states, the US military says, and they conducted about 80% of the Somali national army’s offensive forces in the quarter ending Sept. 30 and “nearly all” operations against al-Shabab.The Danab forces also serve as a model for how the rest of Somali military forces can develop to be “more meritocracy and less clan-focused,” said Omar Mahmood, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.The loss of US forces is widely seen as a gain for al-Shabab, and for the far smaller presence of hundreds of IS-affiliated fighters in Somalia’s north. “From the al-Shabab perspective, they just need to hold out,” Mahmood said, and they might even ask themselves what need there is for any potential Taliban-style negotiations.Al-Shabab’s messaging has always stressed the extremist group’s staying power, national security specialist Gaid said: “These external forces will always leave.” A US withdrawal will play into that narrative.Gaid said she doesn’t see any other country stepping into the US military’s role, though a withdrawal would open space for powers like Russia and China. Somalia also has some 1,500 special forces that have been trained by Turkish troops, she said, but “they don’t benefit from Turkish advisers on the ground.”SECURITYWithout US forces, al-Shabab “will find it easier to overrun AMISOM, let alone the Somali national army,” Vanda Felbab-Brown, co-director of the African Security Initiative at the Brookings Institution, told an online event this week. And with neighboring Ethiopia’s conflict increasing pressure to withdraw more Ethiopian forces from Somalia, a US troop withdrawal “is really just the worst time.”The support that US forces give AMISOM is “huge,” Gaid said, including as a key interlocutor with Somali forces. And with AMISOM also drawing down by the end of next year, “it’s a tricky time.”The US has said implementation of the plan for Somali forces to take over the country’s security next year is “badly off track,” said the new report by the Department of Defense inspector general.Somali forces cannot contain the al-Shabab threat on its own, the report said. They still rely on the international community for financial support, and yet they “sometimes go unpaid for months.”Maybe a US withdrawal would lead the AMISOM force to adjust its own withdrawal timeline “more realistically,” Mahmood said.The US has been the most engaged security partner in Somalia “willing to get down and dirty,” he added. But no other country appears to have the willingness to replace what US forces are doing on the groundAnd a withdrawal of both the US and AMISOM would risk leaving the impression that “Somalia increasingly can rely less and less on external security partners,” Mahmood said.POLITICAL STABILITYSomalia is on the brink of elections, with the parliamentary vote scheduled in December and the presidential one in February. What had meant to be the country’s first one-person-one-vote election in decades instead remains limited by disputes between the federal government and regional ones — which the US has said also weakens command and control of Somali forces.At least keep US forces in Somalia until after the elections, Felbab-Brown wrote this week, warning of possible post-election violence or al-Shabab taking advantage of any chaos.Even though US forces don’t provide election security, “our problem is, with the US focused on a drawdown of troops, it would not be focused on how the elections are going politically,” Gaid said.The US has been one of the most vocal actors on Somalia’s election process, she said. “We were all expecting after November that the US would be clear on a lot of stuff. Now it seems we have to wait.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-now-dismay-as-us-considers-troop-pullout-from-somalia/story-tZSDO8L2ZCEzLmFTzV5qFP.html

Curbs across the European Union and elsewhere also impacted travel to the UK.UK granted 917,683 visitor visas granted in the year ending September 2020, a 61% fall due to the pandemic, as against the general upward trend over the last 10 years. Chinese (171,610) and Indian (156,725) nationals together accounted for 36% of all visitor visas granted.Indian professionals accounted for almost half (45%) of all Tier 2 visas granted, but their number of grants fell by 36% to 36,219 in the year ending September 2020. In the year ending September 2019, 56,164 such visas were granted to Indians.The top non-EU nationality granted British citizenship during the year was Indian (11,801). The citizenship is granted after a period of mandatory stay in the UK, usually five years in the case of professionals.There was a “notable increase” in the number of Tier 4 (student) visas granted to Indians: an increase of 48% compared to the year ending September 2019, and continuing an increase seen since 2016.However, how many of them actually arrived to begin their courses at UK universities and higher education institutions from September will not be clear until early 2021 when new student enrolment figures are released.The number of student visas to Indians was up 14,496 or 48% to 44,992. India was the only nationality to see a large increase and now account for 26% of all Tier 4 visas in the year ending September 2020, up from 11% a year earlier, the Home Office said.While Tier 4 visas to Indian nationals decreased by 6,444 or 48% from April-August 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 due to Covid-19, the significant increase in other months of the year ending September 2020 sustained a notable increase compared to 2019.Those arriving in the UK on student visas bring relatively few dependants. In the year ending September 2020 the top three nationalities accounted for more than two thirds (68%) of Tier 4 dependants: India (40%), Nigeria (15%), and Saudi Arabia (14%).On grants related to family visas, officials said there was a fall for most nationalities as a result of the pandemic, but there were particular falls for the top two nationalities: Pakistan (down 2,588 or 28%), India (down 778 or 19%),Indian nationals in the UK were granted the highest number of all work-related extensions during the year (41% of the total, which reflects the higher proportion of successful applications for Tier 2 visas issued to Indian professionals).Up to the end of September 2020, 14,612 Indians who were unable to travel home at the end of their current visa were given visa extensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-hit-uk-immigration-but-indians-among-top-to-get-visas/story-Prkq4A3fDYtoNjCL9x6pcI.html
26-11-2020||World||Joe Biden could soon reveal his stance on ‘court-packing’. Here’s why||President-elect Joe Biden has been dodging the question around “packing” the Supreme Court, but the recent ruling to block the enforcement of Covid-19 restrictions on religious congregations could prompt the Democrat to reveal his stance. Before the US elections, President Donald Trump announced the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the top court seat, replacing liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg who died in September. Later, Senate confirmed the nomination of Barrett, which gave the Supreme Court a 6-3 conservative majority. On the night before Thanksgiving, newly-inducted Barrett sided with her conservative colleagues to block New York Governor Andrew Cuomo from enforcing Covid-19 restrictions, which limited the number of people attending religious services. While Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberal justices in dissent, the 5-4 ruling highlighted Barrett’s impact on the court.Also Read | How Trump compares to other US presidents on pardons and commutationsWhat is ‘court-packing’?‘Court-packing’ means adding seats to the bench of the US Supreme Court by passing a law. The strength of the bench has remained at nine for 151 years and there is no term limit on the top court justices. In such a scenario, a judge can serve in the apex court for decades, which makes an appointment highly consequential on contentious matters.Barrett is popular among the religious conservatives and anti-abortion campaigners and it was expected that her appointment would impact some of the most partisan issues. During the first presidential debate, Fox News moderator had asked Biden on his thought over packing the Supreme Court. “Whatever position I take, it will become an issue,” said Biden, refusing to share his stance on the matter.At a campaign rally in Arizona, Biden reiterated that he would not discuss court-packing till the presidential elections, arguing that his comment would divert the attention from other burning issues. While Biden’s comment indicated that the issue was not central to the Democratic campaign, it has been one of the most debated topics around the Supreme Court, and people of the United States could get their answer soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-could-soon-reveal-his-stance-on-court-packing-here-s-why/story-retpBjcwUiia6Ti8fKssQJ.html
26-11-2020||World||Joe Biden calls for unity against Covid-19; Donald Trump wants election loss overturned||US President-elect Joe Biden called for unity and hope in a Thanksgiving eve address to Americans, reminding them that the country was at “war with the virus, and not with each other” even as President Donald Trump railed against the election outcome, called for his defeat to be “turned around”, and pardoned a former top aide who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.The contrast between the two leaders, their priorities and their styles played out in full public view over the day on Wednesday. A sombre Biden spoke to Americans from an empty music hall about the need for “solutions, not shouting; reason, not hyper-partisanship; light, not heat”, and urged them not to despair in the face of the pandemic, which has killed more than 260,000 Americans. Speaking of the Covid-19 vaccines in the pipeline, he said, “Hang on, don’t let yourself surrender.”Trump stayed home at the White House, rage-tweeted - “RIGGED ELECTION” - about the polls, barely mentioned the pandemic or greeted the nation on Thanksgiving, phoned into a packed news conference held by his allies in Pennsylvania, and called for “this election to be turned around”.The White House issued a standard Thanksgiving proclamation signed by the president. But Trump sent his greetings only to former national security adviser Michael Flynn, while granting him full pardon. The Washington Post slammed the pardon as a “parting disgrace” from the outgoing president.President-elect Biden, who has sought to stay above Trump’s persisting attempts to challenge his election and obstruct smooth transfer of power, addressed the issue head on.“In America, we have full and fair and free elections, and then we honour the results,” he said without naming anyone. “The people of this nation and the laws of the land won’t stand for anything else.”Biden said he understood the task of unifying the country is not be easy, but he insisted he was determined to bring together Democrats, Republicans and Independents. He added, “Americans dream big. And, as hard as it may seem this Thanksgiving, we are going to dream big again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-for-unity-against-covid-19-donald-trump-wants-election-loss-overturned/story-PJprAq2Dkm15UL2jQP5euN.html
26-11-2020||World||Corruption trial for France’s Nicolas Sarkozy to begin on Monday||A landmark trial involving allegations of corruption and influence-peddling by former French President Nicolas Sarkozy will begin in earnest Monday, after a Paris court rejected an appeal for a delay by an ailing co-defendant.After the co-defendant, 73-year-old magistrate Gilbert Azibert, was examined by a judicial expert at his Bordeaux home, the judges ruled Thursday that he was fit to appear in person in court.The trial was meant to begin earlier this week, but Azibert’s lawyer argued that his client’s poor health made it risky for him to travel and appear in court amid the coronavirus pandemic. Judges suspended the proceedings until Thursday pending the expert medical report.It’s the first time the 65-year-old Sarkozy is facing trial, though the conservative politician is the target of multiple investigations.In the current case, Sarkozy is accused of having tried to illegally obtain information from Azibert about a campaign finance investigation in 2014.Sarkozy, Azibert and Sarkozy’s former lawyer, Thierry Herzog, face prison sentences of up to 10 years and a maximum fine of 1 million euros ($1.2 million). They deny any wrongdoing.Azibert’s lawyer, Dominique Allegrini, disagreed with Thursday’s decision but said “what really matters now is seeing the debates continue in serene conditions so that we can, finally … present Gilbert Azibert’s defense and defend his honor after it was mistreated during the several years of the investigation.”Sarkozy was president from 2007 to 2012. He withdrew from active politics after failing to be chosen as his conservative party’s presidential candidate for France’s 2017 election, won by Emmanuel Macron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/corruption-trial-for-france-s-nicolas-sarkozy-to-begin-on-monday/story-PrwWtl51qaPqZRK5jQXadL.html
26-11-2020||World||Covid-19 in US: Schools struggle to stay open as quarantines sideline staff||The infection of a single cafeteria worker was all it took to close classrooms in the small Lowellville school district in northeastern Ohio, forcing at least two weeks of remote learning.Not only did the worker who tested positive for the coronavirus need to quarantine, but so did the entire cafeteria staff and most of the transportation crew, because some employees work on both. The district of about 500 students sharing one building had resumed in-person instruction with masks and social distancing and avoided any student infections. But without enough substitute workers, administrators had no choice but to temporarily abandon classroom operations and meal services.“It boils down to the staff,” Lowellville Superintendent Geno Thomas said. “If you can’t staff a school, you have to bring it to remote.”Around the country, contact tracing and isolation protocols are sidelining school employees and closing school buildings. The staffing challenges force students out of classrooms, even in districts where officials say the health risks of in-person learning are manageable. And the absences add to the strain from a wave of early retirements and leaves taken by employees worried about health risks.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicIt’s another layer of the “tremendous stress” faced by administrators and educators navigating the pandemic, said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA, the nation’s leading school superintendents association.The superintendent in Groton, Connecticut, recently announced the entire district would transition to distance learning for two weeks following Thanksgiving — a decision driven primarily by a staffing shortage.“When you have the wrong teacher, like an art teacher who over a two-day period sees as many as 80 children, you’ve got the possibility of a really significant number of contacts,” he said. “It’s not being transmitted in schools apparently, but we have lots of cases of children and staff members who are getting it very typically from a family member.”In Kansas, the 27,000-student Shawnee Mission School District announced recently that middle and high school students would return to remote learning until January because of difficulty keeping buildings staffed. Scores of employees are quarantined because of known or potential exposure.“It is important to emphasize that this decision is not being made because of Covid-19 transmission within our schools,” Superintendent Mike Fulton wrote to families. He said available substitute teachers would be shifted to elementary schools to keep up in-person learning for younger students.Social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands and completing daily Covid-19 assessments “seem to be working to keep transmission low within schools,” Fulton said.The effects of school staffing struggles have prompted some officials to suggest relaxing quarantine rules.On Monday, leaders of several Louisiana public school systems told the state House health committee that too many students are missing in-person classroom instruction because they have been sent home for 14 days to quarantine. The state health department said it would not recommend any changes to quarantine regulations.“We have a lot of healthy kids who are home when they don’t need to be,” West Baton Rouge Parish Superintendent Wesley Watts told lawmakers. “We’re not asking to do away with quarantine. We’re just asking for some modifications.”In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Parson took a different approach to trying to keep schools open. He announced new guidance this month that teachers and students exposed to an infected person no longer have to quarantine for two weeks as long as both people were wearing masks. He said quarantines had interrupted learning and created staff shortages.Also Read: One third of England face toughest Covid-19 curbs, London spared for nowShortages of substitute teachers have compounded the personnel problems.“I think everybody understands when you can’t have enough subs to fill the roles, it’s also a safety issue: You can’t have that many children without support from adults,” said Julie Mackett, a kindergarten teacher in Perrysburg, Ohio, who went through her own two-week quarantine early in the school year after a student tested positive.Staffing shortages in her district in mid-November moved up the start of a return to remote learning around Thanksgiving for Perrysburg’s high schoolers, and the district was closely monitoring elementary schools.Cincinnati’s public school system pointed to staffing concerns and surging virus cases in southwest Ohio when it decided to shift to distance learning until after winter break. It noted that community spread of the virus directly affects staff absences.“Teachers and staff must stay home when sick, when in quarantine as a result of a close contact or as needed to take care of family members,” the district said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-in-us-schools-struggle-to-stay-open-as-quarantines-sideline-staff/story-Lx2J6nJUOHgdhuvhCpnOvK.html

26-11-2020||World||Pak politician Bilawal Bhutto tests positive for Covid-19||As Covid cases once again rise in Pakistan, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said on Thursday that he is self-isolating after testing positive for the virus. He also informed organisers of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) rally to be held in Multan that instead of appearing in person, he would give his speech via video link. The rally coincides with the PPP foundation day on November 30.Apart from his absence from the crucial Multan rally, Bilawal will also be missing the engagement of his sister, Bakhtawar Bhutto-Zardari, to a Dubai-based businessman which will take place over the weekend.Bilawal tweeted that he was currently experiencing mild symptoms. “I’ll continue working from home and will be addressing PPP foundation day via video link. Wear a mask everyone, see you on the other side.”A second and deadlier wave of the coronavirus has shown an increased rise in cases in Pakistan. Pakistan reported 3,306 infections on Thursday, a day after it confirmed more than 3,000 daily infections for the first time since July.Prime Minister Imran Khan had criticised the PDM for holding rallies at a time when the second wave of the pandemic hit Pakistan. Last week, the Pakistan PM warned that his government would be compelled to enforce complete lockdown if the opposition did not desist from holding public gatherings at a time when the country was reeling under the impact of Covid-19.Khan tweeted that the 11-party PDM would be responsible for the consequences if it continued with its rallies. “In (Pakistan), the PDM by continuing with jalsas (public gatherings) is deliberately endangering lives and livelihoods (because) if cases continue to rise at the rate we are seeing, we will be compelled to go into complete lockdown & PDM will be responsible for consequences,” Khan said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-politician-bilawal-bhutto-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-dgRlSTXSi75ytk4MTtTrVL.html
26-11-2020||World||One third of England face toughest Covid-19 curbs, London spared for now||More than 20 million people across large swathes of England will be forced to live under the toughest category of Covid-19 restrictions when a national lockdown ends on Dec. 2, while London was placed in the “high alert” second-toughest tier.Health minister Matt Hancock on Thursday announced final details of a regional system set to take effect when blanket restrictions on England’s 55 million population end after a month-long lockdown - dictating the terms of daily life for the country’s citizens and businesses.“Hope is on the horizon but we still have further to go so we must all dig deep. The end is in sight, we mustn’t give up now,” Hancock told parliament, alluding to growing prospects for a vaccine against the coronavirus in the coming months.Britain has Europe’s highest official death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic and has been hit hard by a second wave. The government’s response on lockdown rules, procurement and testing has been criticised as disjointed, expensive and slow.“We must follow these new rules and make sure that our actions today will save lives in future and help get our country through this,” Hancock said. Thursday’s decision had been keenly awaited by businesses across the country whose ability to trade in the critical pre-Christmas period will be affected. Hospitality is one of the large sectors that will suffer the most in higher tiers.Hancock said cases were rising in parts of the capital and needed to be brought under control.London will be in tier 2; it was also in tier 2 before the national lockdown was imposed, although a tighter set of rules for each tier was announced earlier this week.For London, this means no mixing of households indoors and a maximum of six people permitted to meet outdoors, hospitality venues can only offer alcohol alongside a substantial meal, and attendance will be tightly limited at sporting events.PRE-CHRISTMAS ‘SIGH OF RELIEF’“Many businesses across London and the Square Mile will be breathing a collective sigh of relief now that they will be able to trade in the run up to Christmas,” said City of London Corporation Policy Chairwoman Catherine McGuinness. However some large regions of England, including the northern city of Manchester and the prosperous southeastern county of Kent, were placed in tier 3, the most restrictive, where the rate of infection is highest.In tier 3, hospitality venues must remain closed, except for takeaway services.“This will cause real hardship for people whose jobs will be affected and risk the loss of many businesses,” Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said. The decisions have been made according to five criteria, including the pressure on health services in each region and the rate of change in positive coronavirus cases.The announcement angered some local and regional politicians in the hardest hit areas, goading a rebellious core within the ruling Conservative Party who feel the government is overreacting and unjustifiably restricting daily life.“The authoritarianism at work today is truly appalling. But is it necessary and proportionate to the threat from this disease?” Conservative lawmaker said on Twitter, demanding the government publish their evidence.Only three regions in England were placed in the lowest tier 1 category: the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly - all far removed from more heavily populated metropolitan areas of the country. Tiers will be reviewed on Dec. 16, making it possible for areas that slow the spread of the virus to be moved down a notch before Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-third-of-england-face-toughest-covid-19-curbs-london-spared-for-now/story-ZYi76QL5RcMby44SnulFTL.html
26-11-2020||World||Adults, children must move more to stay fit in Covid-19 pandemic era: WHO||All adults should do a minimum of 150 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week, even more vital for well-being and mental health in the Covid-19 era, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday in its first guidance in a decade.It recommended that children and adolescents have an average of one hour of daily physical exercise and limit time in front of electronic screens.And people of all ages must compensate for growing sedentary behaviour with physical activity to ward off disease and add years to their lives, the WHO said, launching its “Every Move Counts” campaign.“Increasing physical activity not only helps prevent and manage heart disease, type-2 diabetes and cancer, it also reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety, reduces cognitive decline including Alzheimer’s and improves memory,” Ruediger Krech, WHO director for health promotion, told a news briefing.Yet one in four adults and a “staggering” four out of five adolescents do not get enough physical activity, which can include walking, cycling, gardening and cleaning, the WHO said. “These guidelines emphasise what many are experiencing during the Covid restrictions that are applied all over the world. And that is that being active every day is good not only our bodies but also our mental health,” said Fiona Bull, head of WHO’s physical activity unit.“Phone a friend and do classes online together, help your family members, do it as a family. And when you can, get outside,” she said.Research into the ill-effects of sedentary behaviour has grown in the past decade, leading to the new advice, Bull said.“That is limit sedentary time, and do more activity to offset sedentary time, particularly for those who do long hours of sedentary, which includes a lot of people who have got office-based work environments,” she said. “For children we also recommend they limit sedentary time, particularly screen time.” Pregnant women and postpartum mothers are now included in the recommendations of 150 to 300 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity per week for adults.This brings health benefits for both the mother and baby, according to Juana Willumsen, a WHO technical officer. “For example there is a 30% reduction in gestational diabetes amongst women who are physically active during pregnancy,” she said.Adults above 65 are advised to add muscle strengthening and activities focusing on balance and coordination to help prevent falls later.Devices worn on the wrist or hip that track physical activity are helpful for all, Bull said. “Monitoring how active you are is very good feedback,” she said. “That is important because we tend to think we might be more active. We tend to underestimate how much time we spend sedentary.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/adults-children-must-move-more-to-stay-fit-in-covid-10-pandemic-era-who/story-pcSe3SqtBm7LbStbBkgIQM.html
26-11-2020||World||Turkey does not expect US sanctions over Russian S-400s under Joe Biden||Turkey does not expect ties with the United States to be strained under President-elect Joe Biden and does not anticipate sanctions over its purchase of Russia S-400 defence systems, a senior official in President Tayyip Erdogan’s AK Party said.Relations have been tense between Ankara and Washington over issues from policy toward Syria to the US refusal to extradite a cleric Turkey blames for a 2016 coup attempt. Turkey has relied on the good personal ties between Erdogan and US President Donald Trump to smooth over divisions, but Biden is expected to be tougher on Turkey over foreign and defence policies and Ankara’s human rights record.Ankara’s purchase last year of the S-400s, which are not compatible with NATO defences, raised the prospect of US sanctions early next year if Congress approves a defence spending bill which the House of Representatives has already voted to include language requiring the president to sanction Turkey. In an interview with Reuters, AK Party Deputy Chairman Numan Kurtulmus played down that prospect.“The US President will most likely watch the balance in the Middle East very carefully for US interests, and will not want to continue the tense ties with Turkey,” Kurtulmus said.“...I believe they will take positive steps in the future.”PROMISED REFORMSWashington says the S-400s pose a threat to the capabilities of its F-35 stealth fighter jets and has removed Turkey from the jet programme where it was a manufacturer and buyer. Ankara says the S-400s will not be integrated into NATO and has called for a joint working group to discuss US concerns. Kurtulmus repeated that Turkey would not bow to pressure to return the Russian systems, or leave them unused.“Sorry, but we didn’t procure these to hide them. We got them to meet Turkey’s security needs,” he said.While Erdogan has downplayed the possible fallout from these sanctions and vowed counter-sanctions, he has also promised economic and judicial reforms, following an overhaul of Turkey’s economic leadership amid a plunge in the lira.Asked if the reforms were aimed at easing tensions with the United States and the European Union, which will also evaluate possible sanctions against Ankara next month, Kurtulmus said the government would act only for Turkey’s interest.“We act by thinking about what reforms we need, what steps to democratization will benefit our people and move on that path, not by thinking what act or rhetoric would please them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-does-not-expect-us-sanctions-over-russian-s-400s-under-joe-biden/story-t4FrC9qKyeRVA5jltZkksJ.html
26-11-2020||World||Pakistan tries to brush off OIC snub on not discussing Kashmir issue||Pakistan on Thursday tried to brush aside reports that the Kashmir issue was not part of a foreign ministers’ meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), calling them “part of false Indian propaganda”.The OIC statements, both in English and Arabic, issued for Friday’s Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) meeting in Niamey, capital of Niger, made no mention of Kashmir in the agenda announced in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia which is currently leading the grouping. A report in Daily Dawn newspaper said the latest omission comes at a time when ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and UAE remain strained over what Pakistani diplomats say are “unfulfilled expectations”.But foreign office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri told a weekly press briefing that the Kashmir issue was a “permanent item” on the OIC agenda.He said Friday’s would be the first CFM meeting after India revoked Kashmir’s special status in August last year.“It is expected that the session would reiterate its strong support to the Kashmir cause. Let me confirm that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute continue (s) to be amongst the longest standing items on the OIC agenda,” he insisted.The spokesperson also said that OIC has been “unambiguously pronouncing itself on the issue for decades, through a succession of summit as well as CFM resolutions.”He insisted that the OIC had spoken on the Kashmir issue multiple times and has “called for a settlement [...] with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions”. The OIC Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir has met thrice in the past 15 months, Chaudhri said, adding that a meeting of the group with foreign ministers was held in June this year.“The final communique of that meeting called upon India to rescind its illegal actions and stop egregious human rights violations in the illegally occupied territory,” he said.Pakistan is being represented at the meeting by foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who left Islamabad on Wednesday for participating in the OIC meeting.Before leaving for Niger, Qureshi told journalists he would raise the Kashmir issue and Islamophobia at the two-day meeting.“I will focus on the Kashmir issue and Islamophobia at the meeting. We will discuss the issues faced by the Muslim Ummah (nation) at the meeting,” he said.The foreign minister said that on the sidelines of the meeting, he will also hold bilateral parleys with his counterparts from the Islamic countries. “The OIC members will give their positions on the international issues and efforts would be made to evolve a joint stand by the Muslim-majority countries,” he added.In August, Qureshi had asked the OIC to “stop dilly-dallying” on the convening of a meeting of its Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) on Kashmir, angering the grouping’s Saudi leadership.“If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,” he had said at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-tries-to-brush-off-oic-snub-on-not-discussing-kashmir-issue/story-12Cn49kDWOvM1VsiX9E0bK.html
26-11-2020||World||Fast spreading bird flu puts European poultry industry on edge||A highly contagious and deadly form of avian influenza is spreading rapidly in Europe, putting the poultry industry on alert with previous outbreaks in mind that saw tens of millions of birds culled and significant economic losses.The disease, commonly called bird flu, has been found in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Britain, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden and, for the first time this week in Croatia, Slovenia and Poland, after severely hitting Russia, Kazakhstan and Israel.The vast majority of cases are in migrating wild birds but outbreaks have been reported on farms, leading to the death or culling of at least 1.6 million chickens and ducks so far around the region.In the Netherlands, Europe’s largest exporter of chicken meat and eggs, nearly 500,000 chickens died or were culled due to the virus this autumn, and over 900,000 hens died on one single farm in Poland this week, the countries’ ministries said.“The risk of a transfer in poultry farms and more cases among wild birds is higher than in the past two years because of the massive appearance of various bird flu viruses in Europe,” said a spokeswoman for the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute, Germany’s federal animal disease research agency.Russia’s poultry death toll reached 1.8 million by the end of October, with nearly 1.6 million of that on one farm near Kazakhstan, data by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) showed.The main strain found this year in Europe is H5N8, which decimated flocks in 2016/17 when the region recorded its largest outbreak in poultry and wild birds, but there were also reports of H5N5 and H5N1.Although the risk to humans is low, the European Food Safety Agency EFSA said this week that the virus’ evolution needed to be closely monitored. A strain of H5N1 has been known to spread to humans.EU poultry industry players said they were very concerned about the latest outbreak but were now experienced in dealing with them. “We have worked so hard to improve safety, to train breeders and improve traceability that we hope that if there are cases we will manage to contain them,” said Anne Richard, head of France’s poultry industry lobby ANVOL.Most counties have raised their alert status to “high”, implying that poultry and birds of all types be kept indoors or protected in order to avoid contact with wild birds.Bird flu outbreaks like other animal diseases often prompt importing countries to impose trade restrictions. That will add to coronavirus-related lockdowns threatening to curb year-end holiday sales.“It’s already difficult to export with the Covid, it would make it even worse,” Denis Lambert, chief executive of France’s largest poultry group LDC told reporters on Wednesday.However, importing countries’ approach to limit restrictions to regions affected by the virus should help soften the impact. China, for example, has suspended imports of poultry products from four regions in Russia due to bird flu, TASS news agency reported on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fast-spreading-bird-flu-puts-european-poultry-industry-on-edge/story-taAuTOm5VMJekfCk8ANHWO.html
26-11-2020||World||New counter-terror centre set up in Britain||A new London-based Counter Terrorism Operations Centre, manned by officers of Scotland Yard, intelligence agency MI5 and others, has been established to improve coordination and response to attacks in the capital and across the UK, officials said on Thursday.Funding for the centre was confirmed by chancellor Rishi Sunak in the House of Commons on Wednesday evening. The centre, which for the first time brings all London-based counter-terrorism institutions in one place, was planned since the terror attacks in London during 2017.The current UK threat level from international terrorism is ‘severe’, which means an attack is highly likely.Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police commissioner said: “Following the dreadful attacks of 2017, I, along with the Director General of MI5, committed both our organisations to identify exactly where we could learn from those events and continually improve the way we work together to protect the public from the terrorist threat; the concept of bringing police closer together with our national security partners into a joint operations centre came directly out of this learning”.“Since 2017 we have worked closely with the Mayor of London, our intelligence agency and security partners and the government to turn the concept into reality. The investment…will assist significantly in keeping London and the United Kingdom safe,” she said.Officials said the centre was developed following the series of attacks in 2017 which killed 36 people and caused injury and life-changing impacts to many others. The attacks and the subsequent operational improvement review highlighted the need to further develop counter-terrorism response to ensure it continues to adapt to an evolving threat.Basing the centre in London will enable co-location of the London-based elements of counter terrorism policing, the intelligence agencies, and the criminal justice system, as well as other agencies focused on tackling the threat from terrorism, they added.Neil Basu, head of Counter Terrorism Policing in Scotland Yard, said: “The creation of a world-leading, fully integrated counter terrorism operations centre is a genuinely historic milestone. Counter Terrorism Policing and our national security partners have always had a close and effective working relationship, but being co-located is an opportunity for us to take that one step further, and will only improve our ability to protect the UK and its citizens”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-counter-terror-centre-set-up-in-britain/story-lxK2FK6XfQQ39Yn2Jyc1DP.html

Austria is investigating 21 people and has remanded 10 in custody on suspicion of being connected to the attack.“The investigation’s findings currently show that it cannot be ruled out that the perpetrator also wanted to deliberately seek out victims in churches,” Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told a news conference.“There will therefore be a reinforced protection of church facilities as of today,” he said, adding that the aim was to guard against copycat attacks in the “sensitive phase” following the Nov. 2 attack and in the run-up to Christmas.Much about what happened before the attack, including how the gunman got to the scene of his rampage in the centre of the Austrian capital, remains unknown.Austrian authorities have admitted “intolerable mistakes” were made in the handling of intelligence on the attacker, which included an attempt to buy ammunition in Slovakia and a meeting in Vienna with known foreign Islamists. They say he could have been considered a greater threat and monitored more closely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/austria-tightens-security-at-churches-citing-vienna-attack-inquiry/story-flJoQaJJEVA33ce76MmhLO.html
26-11-2020||World||EU nations on Mediterranean coast renew push for migrant quotas||The four European Union countries hardest hit by the arrival of hundreds of thousands of unauthorized migrants over the past five years said Thursday they fear that new proposals to revamp the EU’s asylum system will continue to leave them shouldering most of the burden.Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain said in a joint paper that mandatory quotas for sharing out people who qualify for refugee status among the 27 EU countries must be pursued, despite the outright rejection of such a move by Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and others.The four’s demands could be a major setback for the asylum reform plans.“The front-line member states cannot face the migratory pressure on the whole European Union,” said the text. It was sent to the president of the European Commission, which drew up the new asylum proposals, the EU Council representing member countries and Germany, which holds the bloc’s presidency.The entry in 2015 of well over 1 million migrants, mostly people fleeing conflict in Syria, sounded the death knell for the EU’s asylum system, and sparked a deep political crisis that continues to echo even though entries have dropped to a relative trickle.The row over who should take responsibility for people when they arrive and how much other EU countries should assist has helped fuel public support for far-right parties across the bloc. Populist governments in Hungary and Poland, notably, challenged a previous system of migrant quotas at Europe’s top court.In the text, seen by The Associated Press, Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain argue that their responsibilities as countries where most unauthorized migrants arrive across the Mediterranean Sea are strict and clear in the “New Pact for Migration and Asylum,” but that the duties of their EU partners are not.“The solidarity mechanism remains complex and vague,” the four countries said.“The notion of mandatory relocation should remain and be pursued as the main solidarity tool,” the text continued.Under the proposed reforms, migrants arriving at Europe’s outside borders without permission to enter would be screened within five days. They would then enter an asylum procedure or be deported, both within 12 weeks. People could be held in detention and would not be deemed to have officially entered the EU.EU countries would then face two choices: take in some of the refugees or provide other material and logistical support; or if they are not willing to do that, they could take charge of deporting people whose applications are refused. Mandatory refugee quotas have been abandoned.Broadly speaking, countries that agree to host refugees would receive 10,000 euros ($11,900) per person in assistance from the EU’s coffers. The others, dubbed “Europe’s bouncers,” would have up to eight months to deport people not allowed in or be forced to accept them.In recent years, only about a third of all people ordered to be sent home were actually deported.Germany has said it wants to reach a political agreement between EU countries and the European Parliament on the asylum reforms by the end of the year, in the hope that they could be officially endorsed early in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-nations-on-mediterranean-coast-renew-push-for-migrant-quotas/story-z127TqsPqq6NUKsaWx9uAN.html
26-11-2020||World||AstraZeneca faces more vaccine questions after manufacturing error||AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford, among the front-runners in the quest to deliver a Covid-19 vaccine, face mounting questions about their trial results after acknowledging a manufacturing error.While an announcement Monday by Astra and Oxford showed their shot was 70% effective on average in a late-stage study, the scant details released by the UK partners have sparked worries about whether regulators would clear it. In a later statement, Oxford said a difference in manufacturing processes led to some participants being given a half dose instead of a full one.Astra and Oxford said their vaccine was 90% effective when a half-dose was given before a full-dose booster, and that two full doses showed an efficacy of 62%. But the head of the US vaccine program known as Operation Warp Speed said the next day that the dose showing the higher level of effectiveness was tested in a younger population, and that the half-dose was given to some people because of an error in the quantity of vaccine put into some vials. None of this was disclosed in Astra’s original statement.The findings had fueled optimism that an end to the pandemic is in sight and that multiple vaccines to combat Covid-19 could be ready soon following positive results from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. Astra and Oxford remain near the front of the pack, although the way they have handled the large trial has rattled scientists and investors, raising the risk it could slow them down.“Any time you have confusion in trials it’s not a good thing because it effectively removes any kind of credibility you had,” said Ketan Patel, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management. “I think there will be a lot more scrutiny of Astra’s product due to the manufacturing issue.”In its statement, Oxford said that when it was apparent that a lower dose was used, it was discussed with regulators, and an agreement was reached to push ahead with the two regimens. “The methods for measuring the concentration are now established and we can ensure that all batches of vaccine are now equivalent,” according to the university.A spokesman for Astra said the trials were conducted “to the highest standards” and more analysis is being done to refine the efficacy reading.Astra shares were little changed Thursday after slumping 6.2% earlier in the week amid questions about the trial results.‘Unknown’ Efficacy“The most likely explanation for the divergent efficacy in its interim analysis is either chance or patient demographics,” Sam Fazeli, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, wrote in a note. “Either way, approval based on current data means people will be inoculated with a vaccine the true efficacy of which is unknown.”The battle against Covid-19 is at a turning point with encouraging vaccine trial findings coming this month. One vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech SE and another from Moderna Inc. were both about 95% effective in preliminary analyses of trials of tens of thousands of volunteers.Fazeli added: “We remain most convinced by the Moderna and Pfizer data for now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-faces-more-vaccine-questions-after-manufacturing-error/story-ZQIAWS3lkhr6vvmVK6pxFM.html

Asked about its co-operation with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it said in an email the agency may not be able to synchronise the decision making process with other international regulators.The EMA started a real-time review of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Oct. 6 to speed up the process of approving a successful vaccine in the bloc, by allowing researchers to submit findings in real time, without waiting for studies to conclude.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-drugs-watchdog-expects-first-application-for-covid-19-vaccine-in-days/story-12QGrSYrU23DsSCQNcp95N.html

Russia has experienced a surge in infections since September, but authorities have resisted imposing lockdowns, relying instead on targeted measures in certain regions. Speaking at the inauguration via video link, Putin said the plant would produce Covid-19 drugs, as well as medicine used to treat tuberculosis, diabetes, hepatitis and other diseases.“People need these drugs,” he said. “They need them literally every day.”Russia reported a record high of 25,487 new coronavirus infections on Thursday and 524 deaths in the last 24 hours, the highest numbers it has reported since the start of the pandemic. Roszdravnadzor, the healthcare watchdog, said on Thursday that some regions in the country of around 145 million were running out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients, the TASS and RIA news agencies reported. Authorities in Moscow, which reported 6,075 new cases on Thursday, extended a recommended self-isolation period for residents over 65 and those in high-risk groups until Jan. 15.Companies that had been ordered to have at least 30% of their staff work remotely must continue doing so until mid-January, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.Sobyanin said the city’s healthcare system was under pressure but still able to sustain an influx of Covid-19 patients. “Experts believe that in these conditions there is no need to introduce additional restrictions, but lifting the ones that are already in place would be premature and a reckless decision,” Sobyanin wrote on his website. With 2,187,990 infections, Russia currently has the fourth-largest number of Covid-19 cases in the world behind the United States, India and Brazil. Russia said on Thursday it had recorded 38,062 deaths related to Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic.Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine is 92% effective at protecting people from Covid-19, according to interim trial results, as Moscow rushes to keep pace with Western drugmakers in the race for a shot.

We will be trying to coordinate in Europe whether we could close all ski resorts,” Merkel told parliament, adding that this might not be possible given resistance from Austria, but Germany would try again.In the first wave of the coronavirus at the start of the year, many Germans were infected at the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl. Germany last month issued travel warnings for popular ski regions in Austria, Italy and Switzerland. France, Italy, Austria and Germany have all ordered even the high-altitude lifts that could be running this early in the winter to remain closed for now in the hope that all resorts can benefit at peak-season, if and when the infection rate slows.Austria’s nationwide lockdown is due to be lifted on Dec. 7, but it is not clear what that will mean for the ski sector. Austria has been lukewarm about common European rules.Germany is Austria’s biggest source of foreign tourists.Earlier this week, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned people not to ski during the Christmas holidays to help curb a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.He also called on other European countries to agree on common rules for the sector to prevent cases being imported from abroad if Italy keeps its slopes closed.France says its ski slopes must stay off limits until 2021.If the European Union forces skiing areas to stay closed, it will mean losses of up to 2 billion euros, which the EU should cover, Austrian Finance Minister Gernot Bluemel said earlier this week.Switzerland, which is not part of the EU, is allowing near-normal operations at its ski resorts.Merkel agreed with leaders of Germany’s 16 federal states late on Wednesday to extend and tighten a coronavirus lockdown until Dec. 20, but ease rules over the Christmas holidays to let families and friends celebrate together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-wants-ski-resorts-closed-but-hard-to-get-deal-with-neighbour-austria/story-98Bw36m5PsS5L0oQIkOBQN.html

Trump is expected to use his clemency power to pardon or commute the sentences of his allies before leaving the office, however, the outgoing commander-in-chief has used the power less frequently than any other president in modern history.As of November 26, Trump has granted clemency 45 times, including 29 pardons and 16 commutations, which is the lowest of any US president since William McKinley. Trump has received at least 10,051 petitions for clemency but he has used the power for less than 0.5 per cent cases, according to the data from the US Department of Justice.Also Read | Apart from Flynn, here are some big names granted pardon or commutation by TrumpTrump’s predecessor, Barack Obama exercised his clemency power 1,927 times, including 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations. George W. Bush had granted clemency 200 times, while Bill Clinton used the power 459 times to pardon or commute sentences. In terms of percentage, Harry Truman, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson used their power more frequently than other modern presidents.“The Justice Department’s statistics...do not count clemency granted through proclamation or executive order, such as the actions taken by Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter to forgive thousands of Vietnam-era draft dodgers,” Pew Research Center noted in its report.The US-based think tank also observed that presidents have “generally become less forgiving over time” when looking at the proportion of clemency requests they have granted. While Trump has rarely used his clemency power, it has been controversial because of the nature of his pardons and commutations, given a personal or political connection in some of them. Trump used his power to commute the prison sentence of longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, who was convicted on the charges brought as part of Mueller’s report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-trump-compares-to-other-us-presidents-on-pardons-and-commutations/story-LlUPRznOVMz2DWC2Jfz7TJ.html
26-11-2020||World||‘There is light at the end of the tunnel’: Merkel urges patience as Covid curbs extend in Germany||Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans to remain patient with restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus, saying Thursday that with promising vaccines on the way, “there is light at the end of the tunnel.”Addressing parliament the day after agreeing with state governors on extending restrictions through at least Dec. 20, Merkel said officials had sought with the measures to keep life as normal as possible while protecting people from the virus and ensuring hospital systems aren’t overwhelmed.“In the fight against the pandemic it’s not about health or economy, health or education, health or culture, health or social contacts, it’s about all of these things,” she said. “To think of these things in opposition to one another is a common misunderstanding, but it’s always about both.”Germany embarked on a so-called wave-breaker shutdown on Nov. 2, closing restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities but leaving schools, shops and hair salons open.Also Read: Markets mostly up, but coronavirus and weak data keep traders cautiousIt was initially slated to last four weeks but Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors agreed late Wednesday to extend it through Dec. 20 with a goal of pushing the number of new coronavirus cases in each region below 50 per 100,000 inhabitants per week. It’s currently at 140 per 100,000, with some regions far higher.The country hit the grim milestone Thursday of more than 15,000 deaths from the coronavirus and appeared likely to surpass 1 million infections on Friday, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute, the country’s disease control center.Germany, which has 83 million people, was credited with a relatively good performance in the first phase of the pandemic. It still has a lower death rate than several other European countries, and its current shutdown has been relatively mild.The current restrictions have managed to stop the exponential rise of new cases, but they have stabilized at a high level, which authorities now want to try and bring down.The government also agreed upon some additional restrictions Wednesday, including further limiting private gatherings, discouraging traditional New Year’s Eve fireworks and banning some events entirely, expanding mask requirements and reducing the number of customers allowed into larger stores.The government also plans around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) more in aid to compensate businesses hit by the shutdown, on top of 15 billion euros (around $17.9 billion) provided by federal authorities in November.Also Read: Germany extends Covid-19 lockdown until December 20, limitations of social contacts until JanuaryMerkel said with several promising vaccines nearing approval, possibly before Christmas, people had reason for optimism.“That won’t solve the problem immediately, but there is light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, told RTL television that it was likely that some restrictions were likely to remain in place through March, as the vaccine was rolled out.“The winter will be difficult,” Merkel told lawmakers. “But it will end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/there-is-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-merkel-urges-patience-as-covid-curbs-extend-in-germany/story-FW2zgx0kY57bPc7pVsuuWN.html
26-11-2020||World||Four more students charged in France over teacher’s beheading||Four teenage students have been charged in France over the killing of Samuel Paty, including three for allegedly pointing out the teacher to his murderer, a judical source said Thursday.Three other pupils were charged with complicity earlier this month over the beheading last month of Paty, who had shown his students cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed as part of a lesson on free speech.Three of the four students charged Thursday were suspected of identifying Paty to his killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, who then tracked him down and beheaded him in a street near his school.The three, who are between 13 and 14 years old, are being charged with “complicity in a terrorist murder,” the source said.The fourth is the daughter of Brahim Chnina, who launched a virulent online campaign against Paty denouncing the teacher’s use of the cartoons published by satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.She has been charged with “slanderous denunciation” of Paty after relating her version of events in the classroom, though she did not actually attend his civics lesson.Paty’s murder sparked a torrent of outrage that prompted President Emmanuel Macron to crack down on Islamist extremism and violence in a country reeling from a wave of jihadist attacks since 2015 that have killed more than 250 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/four-more-students-charged-in-france-over-teacher-s-beheading/story-rPjMGBPfJPByLuD238XHAP.html
26-11-2020||World||Malaysian PM gains political lifeline with budget approval||Malaysia’s Parliament approved the government’s proposed 2021 budget on Thursday, throwing a political lifeline to embattled Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin amid strong resistance to his 9-month-old leadership.Opposition lawmakers as well as members of his governing coalition had warned during three weeks of debate that they would reject the budget, citing insufficient funding to fight a surge in coronavirus cases and help those hit by the pandemic.Finance Minister Zafrul Aziz made some minor revisions to the 322.5 billion ringgit ($79 billion) budget, the biggest ever, in his concluding speech Thursday in response to the complaints. He insisted that “this is a Covid-19 budget, a budget for survival and resilience.”In the end, the budget was approved despite the dissenting voices.“A budget vote has always been a de facto vote of confidence or no-confidence in the government,” said Ahmad Fauzi Abdul Hamid, a political science professor at Malaysia’s University of Science.Muhyiddin’s “government is temporarily secure but it will continue to have to fight from bill to bill as it survives on a slender majority and on the goodwill of bigger parties in the (governing) coalition,” he said.Had Muhyiddin failed to obtain Parliament’s support for the budget, it would have triggered new calls for him to resign or spur him to seek a general election, which is not favored during the surge in coronavirus cases. Malaysia’s cases have jumped fivefold in two months to nearly 60,000.Muhyiddin, 73, has only a slim two-seat majority in Parliament. He has been challenged by opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who last month said he has majority support to form a new government with defections from Muhyiddin’s coalition.The support reportedly comes from the United Malays National Organization, the biggest party in the unelected governing coalition, which was angry at being sidelined amid rivalry with Muhyiddin’s own Malay party.Lawmakers from both sides of the divide have also pushed for a vote of no-confidence in Muhyiddin, but the bids have been thwarted by the house speaker, appointed by the prime minister.Muhyiddin last month proposed a coronavirus emergency that would have suspended Parliament and given him uncontested powers, but it sparked widespread anger. The king rejected the proposal, saying that existing laws were sufficient to tackle the pandemic, but urged lawmakers to back the budget.“He got lucky again — until the next showdown, as his government remains a decidedly weak one,” said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow at the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.Muhyiddin took power in March after withdrawing his party from Anwar’s ruling reformist alliance that won 2018 polls. He tied up with the corruption-tainted UMNO and other opposition parties to form a Malay-centric government, but his administration has been riven by infighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-pm-gains-political-lifeline-with-budget-approval/story-nHE8yJdYP6uzd98XHT5U6K.html

An EU diplomat said it was more likely to come next week.The European Commission - where Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is leading talks with Britain on behalf of the whole bloc - is due to update national envoys to Brussels on the latest in the trade talks at 0800 GMT on Friday. EU sources said Barnier himself may travel to London later on for more discussions with his British counterpart, David Frost, if there is a chance for a breakthrough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-says-brexit-trade-deal-can-be-reached-but-not-at-any-cost/story-7ZwiN6lx2mZXreOTkyImBM.html
26-11-2020||World||Turkish court issues life sentences in trial of 2016 coup leaders||A Turkish court handed down dozens of life sentences on Thursday for some of the nearly 500 defendants, including army commanders and pilots, accused of leading a 2016 coup attempt from an air base near the capital Ankara.More than 250 people were killed on July 15, 2016, when rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, helicopters and tanks and sought to take control of state institutions and overthrow the government of President Tayyip Erdogan. The trial was the highest profile of dozens of court cases targeting thousands of people accused of involvement in the coup attempt, which Ankara blamed on supporters of the US-based Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen.Former air force commander Akin Ozturk and others at the Akinci air base near Ankara were accused of directing the coup and bombing government buildings, including parliament, and attempting to kill Erdogan.Four ringleaders, dubbed “civilian imams” over ties to Gulen’s network, were given 79 aggravated life sentences for charges of attempting to assassinate the president, murder, and seeking to overthrow the constitutional order, state-owned Anadolu news agency said.F-16 warplane pilots were also among those given aggravated life sentences - the severest punishment in Turkish courts - meaning there is no possibility of parole. Turkey’s then-military chief and now defence minister Hulusi Akar and other commanders were held captive for several hours at the base on the night of the coup. A total of 475 people were on trial, 365 of them in custody.SUSTAINED CRACKDOWN The 79-year-old cleric Gulen, who was once an ally of Erdogan and has denied any role in the coup, was one of six defendants being tried in absentia. Their dossiers were separated from the main trial, media reports said.The government declared a state of emergency in Turkey - a NATO member and candidate for European Union membership - after the failed coup and carried out a large-scale crackdown which alarmed Ankara’s Western allies.Some 292,000 people have been detained over alleged links to Gulen, nearly 100,000 of them jailed pending trial, Anadolu cited Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu as saying. Some 150,000 civil servants were sacked or suspended after the coup, with some 20,000 expelled from the military. Courts have handed down more than 2,500 life sentences.Four years on, police operations targeting suspects accused of links to Gulen continue on a regular basis.The government has said the crackdown was needed given the security challenges which Turkey has faced to root out a network of Gulen supporters deeply embedded in the state apparatus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-court-issues-life-sentences-in-trial-of-2016-coup-leaders/story-5qBIAjgbNeuMZbA8kTvq9K.html

Flights that had been cancelled or rescheduled were reinstated, however, as air traffic controllers called off their strike after a court ruled their participation illegal.Greek journalists were also participating with a two-hour work stoppage between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., during which no news broadcasts will be aired.Civil servants’ unions called the strike on a variety of demands, including the increase of coronavirus-related protective measures in workplaces and in schools, mass hirings in the public transport and health sectors, and salary increases for civil servants.Public transport workers are also calling for workers to be allowed to undergo tests for Covid-19 at their companies’ expense.Greece has seen a significant surge in coronavirus cases and deaths that is straining the country’s health system.Although the government has carried out mass hirings of medical workers since the pandemic struck and has more than doubled the number of intensive care unit beds in the country since mid-2019, many ICUs, particularly in northern Greece where the outbreak has been most severe, are at or near their capacity. Health authorities have appropriated two private clinics in the northern city of Thessaloniki and their staff, to be used for coronavirus patients.Greece currently has more than 97,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and just over 1,900 deaths in this country of 11 million. Nearly 600 people are intubated in ICUs nationwide, according to figures released Wednesday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greek-civil-servants-hold-strike-demands-include-better-workplace-protection-against-covid/story-Rgqq9UCfFH0uKjpW6jmN9N.html

Trump took to Twitter to announce the executive grant of clemency to Flynn, saying he “will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!” Calling Flynn “an innocent man”, the White House said in a statement that he should have never been prosecuted. It described the retired US Army three-star lieutenant general as the “victim of partisan government officials engaged in a coordinated attempt to subvert the election of 2016.” Trump is expected to use his presidential power to pardon or commute the sentences of his allies before leaving the office.Also Read | Trump pardons Michael Flynn, taking direct aim at Russia probeHere are some of the big names who were pardoned or their prison sentences commuted by Trump:Roger Stone: Trump used his presidential power to commute the prison sentence of longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone, who was convicted on the charges brought as part of Mueller’s report. Stone had denied any wrongdoing and called all the charges politically motivated but his lawyers failed to call any witnesses in his defence.Joe Arpaio: The controversial former Arizona sheriff was convicted of criminal contempt after he defied court order to stop patrols targeting suspected undocumented immigrants. While announcing the pardon, Trump said, “Throughout his time as Sheriff, Arpaio continued his life’s work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration.”Susan B Anthony: The American social reformer and women’s rights activist played a key role in the women’s suffrage movement and was convicted of illegal voting and fined in 1873. In August 2020, Trump granted full pardon posthumously to Susan B Anthony for “a wrongful and unjust conviction stemming from the only vote she ever cast in an election.”Scooter Libby: The American lawyer and former vice-president Dick Cheney’s chief of staff was found guilty of lying about leaks to the media. President George W. Bush had commuted Libby’s sentence shortly after his conviction. The White House said that Libby’s record, since his conviction, is “unblemished, and he continues to be held in high regard by his colleagues and peers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apart-from-flynn-here-are-some-big-names-granted-pardon-or-commutation-by-trump/story-Zuzqvz8YHCWLSr166WFuYK.html
26-11-2020||World||China’s top diplomat touts South Korea ties amid row with US||China’s top diplomat on Thursday stressed the importance of bilateral relations while meeting senior officials in South Korea, where there’s growing concern the country is becoming squeezed between its biggest trading partner and military ally the United States.After meeting South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters that his visit amid a spreading coronavirus pandemic shows how much Beijing values its relations with Seoul. He called for stronger cooperation over anti-virus efforts, trade and finding a peaceful solution to a nuclear standoff with North Korea.When asked whether Beijing was pressing Seoul to choose a side amid rising US-China tensions over trade, security and other issues, Wang said “America is not the only nation in the world.” “There are 190 countries and each of them are sovereign nations,” he said. “They include China and South Korea, which are close neighbours and should visit each other more often like relatives.” Wang, who arrived in Seoul following a visit to Japan where he met Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, was expected to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in later Thursday.In Tokyo Wednesday, Wang told Suga that he wants the two Asian powers to have good relations and cooperate in fighting the coronavirus and reviving their pandemic-hit economies. But the two sides remain at odds over an island dispute.South Korea has been eager to repair its relations with China, its biggest trade partner that reacted furiously to Seoul’s decision to deploy an advanced US anti-missile system on its soil in 2016 to better cope with North Korean threats. There’s also concern in South Korea over a deepening row between Washington and Beijing over trade, security, human rights and other issues, which could force Seoul into a difficult balancing act.China, which has claimed that the US anti-missile system in South Korea could be reconfigured to peep into its territory, had been accused by Seoul of retaliating by limiting Chinese tour groups visits to South Korea. Beijing also destroyed South Korean supermarket giant Lotte’s business in China after the company sold a plot of land to the South Korean government where the anti-missile system was later installed.South Korea had hoped to secure a visit by Chinese leader Xi Jinping this year in what Seoul officials describe as a key step in repairing relations, but the pandemic has complicated such plans.When asked about a possible visit by Xi, Wang pointed to the face masks worn by reporters, saying that the coronavirus situation must first be contained.South Korea earlier reported 583 new cases of the coronavirus, its biggest daily increase in about eight months, as a resurgence in the greater capital area threatens to erase hard-won gains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-top-diplomat-touts-south-korea-ties-amid-row-with-us/story-lSiICFihsjgWYRN8b5aLFJ.html

And more than 600,000 people who rely on monthly food rations haven’t received them this month.Travel blockages are so dire that even within the Tigray capital, Mekele, the UN World Food Programme cannot obtain access to transport food from its warehouses there.Communications and travel links remain severed with the Tigray region since the deadly conflict broke out on November 4, and now Human Rights Watch is warning that “actions that deliberately impede relief supplies” violate international humanitarian law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-of-very-critical-shortages-in-ethiopia-s-tigray/story-NUT9qlEAYXEz4DEJND4eZJ.html
26-11-2020||World||US will appeal order barring expulsions of migrant children||The US government on Wednesday appealed a judge’s order barring the expulsions of immigrant children who crossed the border alone, a policy enacted during the coronavirus pandemic to deny the children asylum protections.Judge Emmet Sullivan issued a preliminary injunction on Nov. 18 sought by advocates for immigrants that barred expulsions of unaccompanied children under public health laws.The Justice Department filed a notice of appeal Wednesday night to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It also asked Sullivan to issue a stay of the injunction pending appeal, a request he previously denied.Since March, border agents have expelled 200,000 immigrant adults and children citing the pandemic and a need to prevent the spread of the virus, even though Covid-19 is spreading broadly through border communities and the country at large.Sullivan’s order only covered children who cross the border without a parent and not adults or parents and children. At least 8,800 unaccompanied children have been expelled without having a chance to seek asylum protections or speak to a lawyer. Most people have been expelled within hours or days, though the Trump administration detained hundreds of children for weeks in hotels near the US-Mexico border for days or weeks at a time until another judge barred that practice.President-elect Joe Biden has said he will reverse several of President Donald Trump’s immigration programs when he takes office in January. Biden has not stated whether he will stop expulsions of immigrants.In its filing Wednesday night, the Justice Department cited the spread of the virus in border communities in Arizona and Texas. It warned that Sullivan’s order “likely will have an irreversible impact on public health” by straining hospital capacity and forcing the government to move “potentially infected” children and teenagers through airports.The Associated Press reported on Oct. 3 that top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention resisted issuing an emergency declaration allowing immigrant expulsions because it lacked a public health basis, but that Vice President Mike Pence ordered the agency to move forward anyway.Immigration advocates who sought the injunction say the government has the ability to protect children and border agents simultaneously. They argue the Trump administration is using the pandemic as a pretext to crack down on immigrants.“There is no basis for allowing this cruel, unprecedented policy to take effect, given the harm that these young children would face if sent back and the readily available ways of safely housing the children,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, in an email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-appeal-order-barring-expulsions-of-migrant-children/story-V605DvMCgSV7hyZM8tmjSO.html

26-11-2020||World||US Supreme Court rules against New York Covid-19 restrictions on houses of worship||As coronavirus cases surge again nationwide the Supreme Court late Wednesday temporarily barred New York from enforcing certain attendance limits at houses of worship in areas designated as hard hit by the virus.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The court’s action could push New York to reevaluate those restrictions. But the court’s action also won’t have any immediate impact since the two groups that sued as a result of the restrictions, the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Jewish synagogues in Brooklyn and Queens, are no longer subject to them.The groups sued to challenge attendance limits at houses of worship in areas designated red and orange zones, where New York had capped attendance at 10 and 25 people, respectively. But the groups are now subject to less-restrictive rules because they’re now in areas designated yellow zones.The justices split 5-4 to bar the state from enforcing the restrictions against the groups for now, with new Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the majority. It was the conservative’s first publicly discernible vote as a justice. The court’s three liberal justices and Chief Justice John Roberts dissented.The justices acted on an emergency basis while lawsuits challenging the restrictions continued. In an unsigned order, a majority of the court said the restrictions “single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment.”The move was a shift for the court. Earlier in this year, when Barrett’s liberal predecessor, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was on the court, the justices divided 5-4 to leave in place pandemic-related capacity restrictions affecting churches in California and Nevada.The court’s action was a victory for the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Jewish synagogues that had sued to challenge state restrictions announced by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Oct. 6.The Diocese of Brooklyn, which covers Brooklyn and Queens, argued houses of worship were being unfairly singled out by the governor’s executive order. It noted that in red zones, businesses deemed “essential,” from grocery stores to pet shops, can remain open without capacity limits, though “non-essential” businesses had to close. And in orange zones, most businesses can open without capacity restrictions.Also Read |  Disney to lay off about 32,000 workers in first half of 2021The diocese argued it had previously operated safely by capping attendance at 25 percent of a building’s capacity and taking other measures. Parts of Brooklyn and Queens are now in yellow zones where attendance at houses of worship is capped at 50 percent of a building’s capacity.Agudath Israel of America, an Orthodox Jewish organization with synagogues affected by the restrictions, also sued. The organization argued the governor’s restrictions targeted the Orthodox Jewish community in particular.New York, for its part, told the court that religious gatherings were being treated less restrictively than secular gatherings that carried the same infection risk, like concerts and theatrical performances, which were prohibited entirely.Two lower courts had sided with New York in allowing the restrictions on houses of worship to stand. There are currently several areas statewide designated orange zones but no red zones, according to the state’s website that tracks areas designated hot spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-rules-against-new-york-covid-19-restrictions-in-houses-of-worship/story-DHBC2K47H66SlPsCtDWcJL.html

Pakistan is being represented at the meeting by foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who left Islamabad on Wednesday for participating in the OIC meeting.Before leaving for Niger, however, Qureshi told journalists he would raise the Kashmir issue and Islamophobia at the two-day meeting. “I will focus on the Kashmir issue and Islamophobia at the meeting. We will discuss the issues faced by the Muslim Ummah (nation) at the meeting,” he said.The foreign minister said that on the sidelines of the meeting, he will also hold bilateral parleys with his counterparts from the Islamic countries. “The OIC members will give their positions on the international issues and efforts would be made to evolve a joint stand by the Muslim-majority countries,” he added.Qureshi said the OIC members already know about what he alleged was a “wave of terror” by India in Kashmir. “There is a need to press India to stop the bloodshed and implement the UN resolutions in the occupied territory,” he said.In August, Qureshi had asked the OIC to “stop dilly-dallying” on the convening of a meeting of its Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) on Kashmir, angering the grouping’s Saudi leadership.“If you cannot convene it, then I’ll be compelled to ask Prime Minister Imran Khan to call a meeting of the Islamic countries that are ready to stand with us on the issue of Kashmir and support the oppressed Kashmiris,” he had said at the time.In his statement, OIC Secretary-General Dr Yousef Al-Othaimeen has said that the Niamey meeting will discuss the Palestinian cause, the fight against violence, extremism and terrorism, Islamophobia and defamation of religion, Muslim minorities and communities in non-member states, fundraising for the Rohingya case at the International Court of Justice, as well as the promotion of dialogue among civilisations, cultures and religions, and other emerging matters.The agenda of the Niamey meeting also includes discussion on the political, humanitarian, economic, social and cultural and other issues related to science and technology, the media and the progress made in the implementation of the “OIC-2025: Plan of Action” document. It would also feature a brainstorming session on “Security and Humanitarian Challenges Confronting African Sahel States Members of the OIC”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kashmir-not-on-oic-meet-agenda-in-apparent-snub-to-pakistan/story-jwSq5WivVDD5BhCxUqNamM.html

Earlier this month, Disney said it was furloughing additional workers from its theme park in Southern California due to uncertainty over when the state would allow parks to reopen.Disney’s theme parks in Florida and those outside the United States reopened earlier this year without seeing new major coronavirus outbreaks but with strict social distancing, testing and mask use.Disneyland Paris was forced to close again late last month when France imposed a new lockdown to fight a second wave of the coronavirus cases. The company’s theme parks in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo remain open.Disney did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on whether the 28,000 layoffs announced earlier were included in the latest figure, but a spokesperson for the company confirmed to Variety that the figure includes the previously announced number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disney-to-lay-off-about-32-000-workers-in-first-half-of-2021/story-rl8p1Lj8qrCjOov6RjsRYJ.html
26-11-2020||World||Fears of booming black market rises amidst Covid-19 vaccine rush in China||Before a planned trip to the US, Cheng wanted to get vaccinated against Covid-19. To do so, he asked a friend working at a cold-chain logistics company in southeast China to pretend he was employed by the firm, allowing Cheng access to one of the country’s experimental shots.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Cheng, a business-owner from Beijing, now plans to fly to Guangdong province and pay as much as $91 to take two doses of what he believes is a vaccine being produced by a unit of Sinopharm, the state-backed Chinese developer at the front of the global Covid-19 vaccine race.“You just transfer him the money via Alipay, but he won’t tell you the details because apparently it’s black market,” said Cheng, referring to a digital payments platform that’s used widely in China. Cheng asked to only be identified by his last name as he fears reprisal for speaking publicly.As developers from AstraZeneca Plc to Pfizer Inc. near the finish line for their coronavirus vaccines, nations are preparing for the challenge of rolling them out, with inevitable supply shortages fueling concerns about inequitable distribution and even the emergence of illegal markets. One place where vaccine delivery is already being road-tested is China, which has allowed local developers’ shots for emergency use since mid-year.While that program is technically reserved for Chinese front-line workers, such as medical staff treating Covid patients and port employees, Bloomberg spoke to nearly a dozen people who have bent the rules, or know those who have, to get hold of the yet unproven Chinese vaccines. They asked not to be identified, or to just use their first names, so they could talk freely about their experiences, which point to a prevalent practice of working connections and officials to jump the queue.Unlike western frontrunners, the Chinese vaccine makers have yet to release any public data on the efficacy of their shots in Phase III trials, making it difficult to tell how successful their efforts have been. People are seeking them out nonetheless, particularly those headed outside of China, where the coronavirus has been all but eliminated.Also Read | Explained: When and how will Covid-19 vaccines become available around the world?Paying Bribes“There are substantial opportunities for the vaccine to be diverted to those with connections,” said Rachel Cooper, the London-based director of Transparency International’s health initiative. “Prior to the pandemic, citizens often used personal connections or had to pay bribes in order to access health-care services,” she said, citing research by the anti-graft group that found one in five people across Asia have called in favors to get care.Despite the fact that the vaccines haven’t received final regulatory approval, hundreds of thousands of people in China have been jabbed under the emergency-use program. That has heightened concern among scientists over potential safety risks.China National Biotec Group Co., the arm of Sinopharm developing two leading Covid vaccines, has said only that its final stage human trials -- involving more than 50,000 people in countries from Argentina to Egypt -- have been progressing smoothly, and it has not received any reports of serious adverse events in participants.On Wednesday, Xinhua Finance reported that the company applied for public use authorization for its shots, citing Sinopharm’s vice general manager Shi Shengyi. If approved, it would mean CNBG will be the first developer outside of Russia to reach the general market. Western developers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca are only at the stage of asking for emergency authorization.CNBG has also inked supply agreements with several countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, according to public reports compiled by Bloomberg.Though many are taking the vaccine in China, some remain skeptical.Jason’s family friends were vaccinated through work connections with officials in the provincial government of Hebei, in China’s north. Some have pressured his family to get inoculated, but he demurred as he doesn’t trust the safety and effectiveness of the Chinese vaccines.“They are proud that they took the shots,” Jason said. “They see it as a privilege, tout it around, lobbying me and my family to be vaccinated. It’s not hard to have the access if you have some connections in China.”Staff in government ministries and state-owned companies have found low barriers to access. One person employed at China’s foreign ministry said they were vaccinated with the CNBG shot two months ago because their job puts them into contact with foreigners, even though they don’t travel overseas for work. Many bureaucrats at the ministry have also been given doses, they said.Also Read | Drones, micro-chillers may be needed for last-mile delivery of Covid vaccinesAn employee at Bank of China Ltd. said many of their colleagues were vaccinated before traveling to an expo in Shanghai this month. Another at a state-owned technology company said dozens at the firm were inoculated before they hosted a big forum in September. The tech company’s employees signed non-disclosure agreements and were only offered jabs before the event.One person said they were able to get access to a vaccine because their parents worked at another state entity. A Bloomberg journalist was even offered CNBG’s shot in the course of reporting this story.‘Test Run’Some, like Cheng, simply want protection from Covid-19 -- proven or otherwise -- before they travel. One Chinese student who needs to return to France next month to complete her MBA found a CNBG booth at a Beijing expo in September offering vaccinations to students traveling overseas.“I was told this offer to students headed abroad was just a test run,” said the student, who added that the company made clear the vaccine hadn’t been fully approved. By mid-October, after presenting her student credentials, she received her first shot at the company’s factory in suburban Beijing. She was told not to talk about the inoculation on social media and she said students who did post pictures were asked to take them down.That this is happening in China, which has aggressively contained the spread of Covid-19 since its initial outbreak, may heighten concerns of misappropriation in countries with weak health systems battling higher rates of infection. The pressure on limited supply will likely be acute in neighboring India, which has enormous wealth disparities and the second-worst outbreak globally with more than 9 million infections.Despite tight travel restrictions, advertising for unverified vaccine tours to the US are popping up across Indian WhatsApp groups. Gem Tours & Travels Pvt. Ltd., a Mumbai-based company planning to run such trips for people to receive Pfizer’s mRNA shot, told Bloomberg they won’t be procuring doses themselves and have yet to nail down travel timings. However, while the firm isn’t collecting deposits yet, they are registering interested clients and collecting passport copies.Waiting GameVaccine producers in the country, including the Serum Institute of India Ltd. -- which is running human trials for AstraZeneca and will produce at least a billion doses if its candidate gets the green light -- have played down concerns that the wealthy will hive off scarce batches. They point to government intentions to ration the first set of jabs to front-line workers and the vulnerable before a private market develops.That hasn’t stopped some calling Serum’s Chief Executive Officer Adar Poonawalla and attempting to get first dibs on any vaccine it brings forward. “I’ve refused, whether you’re rich and powerful or a common friend, I think we all just have to wait,” he said in an interview earlier this month.“Of course, if there’s some friends and others we can always make a few hundred. It’s nothing, it’s not even a day’s production,” Poonawalla added. “But getting firstly access to all the vulnerable and elderly, the front line workers, is the key.”Also Read | What is Mission Covid Suraksha? All you need to knowGiven what’s happening in China, and the enormous logistical challenges of rolling out a vaccine to the entire world, others aren’t convinced it will work out so fairly.Anil Hebbar, who runs a medical equipment firm and volunteered for Astra’s Covid vaccine trial in Mumbai after a friend died from the disease, knows people who use forged documents to ride on the city’s trains reserved for medical workers. It’s not much of a leap for the 56-year-old to imagine that will also happen once vaccines are deployed across India.“Everybody will claim to be a nurse now, or a doctor or hospital worker,” Hebbar said. “Human beings will always circumvent things to their favor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fears-of-booming-black-market-rises-amidst-covid-19-vaccine-rush-in-china/story-pKtGpby7EXDOrUajKzsgsM.html
26-11-2020||World||Despite tensions, China buying computer chips made by Taiwan firms||Despite the growing disquiet in Taipei against Beijing, Chinese technology companies have increased orders for computer chips or semiconductors made in Taiwan. According to a report of VOA, Taiwan has reported a six per cent jump in export from July through September this year.Experts believe that the jump is most likely a result of increased orders from technology businesses in mainland China.Alicia Garcia Herrero is a chief Asia-Pacific economist with the French investment bank Natixis. Of Chinese companies, she said, “They know they’re not yet able to produce at least the highest-end semiconductors needed for 5G.” She added that Taiwan makes top-level semiconductors and is unlikely to give up as a leader in the field.Taiwan factories produce some of the world’s top computer chips. But during the past four years, Taiwan has pushed companies to depend less on the Chinese market.The two countries have been locked in a political dispute for over 70 years.China regards Taiwan as a “breakaway province” and has said that it wouldn’t mind using force to claim it. At the same time, Beijing has also accused Washington and Taipei of promoting independence.China wants to develop the latest telecommunications technology, known as 5G. It also wants to be a powerful force in the technology field worldwide.Technology equipment is Taiwan’s top export to China. Information and communication technology products make up half of Taiwan’s total exports. Between July and September, $27.2 billion of Taiwan’s USD 90 billion in exports went to China. Those numbers come from Taiwan’s Bureau of Foreign Trade.Chinese importers bought more than one-third of the USD 32.9 billion in exports from the grouping of products that include semiconductors.Brady Wang works in Taipei for the market intelligence business Counterpoint Research. He told VOA, “A lot of these goods are being sold in China because China is actually stockpiling inventory...”Wang said the reason for the move was the state of relations between China and the United States. The two sides have been involved in a trade dispute for more than three years. The US government also considers Huawei a security threat.“The reason for stockpiling is the recent state of Sino-US relations -- not just Huawei,” Wang said.Chinese businesses traditionally look to California’s Silicon Valley for the latest in technology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/despite-tensions-china-buying-computer-chips-made-by-taiwan-firms/story-HJPd72uPayDENizfzH6bZM.html
26-11-2020||World||Best EU economy in year of Covid was bloc’s worst-hit after 2008||The European Union’s worst-hit economy in the wake of the global financial crisis is looking like the bloc’s least affected during the coronavirus pandemic.Lithuania suffered the deepest recession in 2009 as it became a testing ground for the harsh austerity that later ravaged Greece. This time, the European Commission reckons it will notch the shallowest contraction of all, with forecasts this month pointing to a dip in gross domestic product of just 2.2%.In some ways, the Baltic country of 2.8 million people got lucky: its economy doesn’t rely on tourists, farmers enjoyed a bumper harvest and logistics companies benefited as shoppers across the continent ramped up online purchases. But the government and companies also learned lessons from the last crash, and were far more prudent in the runup to this one.What’s more, Lithuania was lightening quick to respond to the virus’s first wave, imposing a lockdown with only seven confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country to make it one Europe’s least-affected.“Victories on the health front helped the fast economic turnaround,” said Indre Genyte-Geciene, chief economist at INVL Asset Management in Vilnius. “Businesses had also had a string of successful years. They were at the peak of economic cycle, with large financial buffers that helped them survive.”That cushion was visible in state coffers too. Unlike the chaos after 2008, when Lithuania flirted with a bailout, saw workers flee westward and needed drastic spending cuts to stay afloat and adopt the euro, Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis struck a reassuring tone when announcing March’s lockdown.“There’s no issue with finances -- the state has enough funds accumulated,” he said in a televised address. Consumers took heart: Retail sales returned to pre-lockdown levels after just two months.Indeed, years of budget surpluses saw Lithuania’s credit rating lifted to the same level as Japan’s. The government was able to provide a furlough program, delay corporate tax payments and subsidize self-employed workers. And without things like a national airline to rescue, expensive bailouts weren’t needed.Many industries, on the contrary, thrived. Lithuania has the EU’s fourth-smallest share of sectors at risk from pandemic-related pain, while good weather helped it export the bloc’s second-highest amount of wheat this year.A spike in demand for online services handed information and communications technology companies a second-quarter sales jump of almost 50%. Then there’s transportation.Girteka Logistics, which owns Europe’s largest fleet of trucks and does 98% of its business abroad, saw shipment volumes climb as e-commerce surged.“While Europeans stay at home to slow the coronavirus, Lithuanian trucking companies continue transporting essentials like consumer goods, food and pharmaceuticals for home consumption,” said Kristian Kaas Mortensen, Girteka’s director for strategic partnerships.Despite a second virus wave inflicting greater damage than the first, he says the country’s ready, having endured much worse a decade ago.“In Lithuania, we don’t cry,” Mortensen said. “Nobody’s afraid of a crisis. Everyone’s like, ‘yeah, we’ve been there, seen that. Whatever, let’s do it.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/best-eu-economy-in-year-of-covid-was-bloc-s-worst-hit-after-2008/story-JarJSNf5XeTKUUzt1RCiNI.html

They say they will not move until justice is delivered to them.While all elections in the illegally occupied regions are important to Islamabad, this year’s elections were of uncommon prominence and desperation for Pakistan.Pakistan’s all-weather friend China wants it to gain complete political control over the region for its strategic and ambitious China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).Under its growing pressure and demands only, Khan in the run-up to the polls had declared the status of a provisional province to Gilgit Baltistan (GB).It was reported that both Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslims League-Nawaz have levelled allegations of rigging in the recent GB elections. A winner is yet to be announced from the Pakistan-occupied region.The complete but unofficial results of all 23 constituencies, where polling was held on Sunday, indicate that the PTI has emerged as the single largest party with 10 seats, followed by seven independents.The PPP won three seats, the PML-N two and the Majlis Wahdatul Muslimeen, which had a seat adjustment arrangement with the PTI, got one seat, Dawn reported.

26-11-2020||World||Sudan’s former PM Sadiq al-Mahdi dies from Covid-19 in UAE||Leading Sudanese politician and former prime minister Sadiq al-Mahdi died from a coronavirus infection three weeks after being hospitalised in the United Arab Emirates, according to family sources and a party statement early on Thursday.Mahdi, 84, was Sudan’s last democratically elected prime minister and was overthrown in 1989 in the military coup that brought former president Omar al-Bashir to power. The moderate Umma Party was one of the largest opposition parties under Bashir, and Mahdi remained an influential figure even after Bashir was toppled in 1989.Last month, al-Mahdi’s family said he had tested positive for Covid-19, and was transferred to the UAE for treatment a few days later following a brief hospitalisation in Sudan.In a statement, the Umma Party said Mahdi would be buried on Friday morning in the city of Omdurman in Sudan. Mahdi had returned to Sudan in December 2018, following a year-long self-exile, just as protests over worsening economic conditions and Bashir’s rule gathered steam. His daughter Mariam Sadiq al-Mahdi, deputy leader of the Umma Party, was among those detained during the demonstrations. While a successor to the party head has not yet been announced, she has been the most visible party leader in political negotiations and the media in recent years.Opposition parties were weakened greatly under Bashir’s three-decade regime, and are jostling for power with the military during Sudan’s transition, making the Umma Party’s continued unity crucial to maintaining the balance of power.After the military forced Bashir out from power, Mahdi pushed for a transfer to civilian rule, warning in interviews with Reuters of the risks of a counter-coup and calling for the powerful, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to be integrated.

26-11-2020||World||Xi Jinping seeks to ‘manage differences’ as he congratulates Joe Biden||China’s President Xi Jinping broke his silence on Joe Biden’s election victory, sending the US president-elect a message that he hopes to “manage differences” and focus on cooperation between the world’s two largest economies.The congratulatory note, reported by the official Xinhua News Agency, said China wants to advance a “healthy and stable” relationship and uphold the principles of “no conflict” and “no confrontation.”Biden appreciates the congratulations he’s receiving from world leaders, including Xi, a spokesman for the president-elect’s transition office said.China’s ruling Communist Party leaders had held off on offering extended comments as President Donald Trump pursued unfounded claims of fraud in an effort to overturn the Nov. 3 election. An earlier Foreign Ministry statement sent congratulations and said China respected the American people’s choice.Trump has ratcheted up tensions with Beijing over the course of his administration, hitting China with tariffs in continuing trade disputes, blaming it for the coronavirus pandemic and condemning its treatment of ethnic Uighurs in the Xinjiang region and its crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong.As Biden prepares to take office, the world is watching to see how he handles the relationship between Washington and Beijing, after a campaign in which he faced few questions about how he would handle Beijing more effectively than Trump. Officials have suggested the president-elect would take a less confrontational approach to China than Trump, cooperating on issues such as arms control and climate change.Biden’s team has acknowledged that the Obama-era effort to work more closely with China -- and look past some of its violations of human rights, intellectual property threats and regional expansion -- is over.Trump’s RiftStill, the new administration will inherit -- and be forced to navigate -- the Trump-era rift between the U.S. and China. Trump is planning more hard-line moves against Beijing in the remaining weeks of his term, Bloomberg reported earlier this month, potentially escalating tensions as the Biden administration takes over.Actions being considered include countering illegal fishing and more sanctions against party officials or institutions causing harm in Hong Kong or Xinjiang, Bloomberg reported.The Trump administration is close to issuing a list of 89 Chinese aerospace and other firms that would be unable to access US technology exports because of military ties, Reuters reported this week, a move that could escalate tensions as the Biden administration prepares to take over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-seeks-to-manage-differences-as-he-congratulates-joe-biden/story-LgICfYtzbLmWmDhHtO6GDP.html
26-11-2020||World||US makes last-ditch bid to derail Donald Trump rape accuser case||The US government on Wednesday put forth a last-ditch attempt to derail a defamation lawsuit filed against President Donald Trump by a New York advice columnist who claims he raped her two decades go.The Justice Department is fighting to replace Trump as the defendant in the suit brought by E. Jean Carroll, who went public last year with her claim and sued Trump after he called her a politically motivated liar.US District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in Manhattan last month rejected the Justice Department’s argument that Trump’s statements were made as part of his presidential duties. On Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a notice that it’s appealing the decision.Had Kaplan allowed the substitution, the case would have been dismissed because the government can’t be sued for defamation.It’s unclear what President-elect Joe Biden’s Justice Department and a presumably very different attorney general will do with the legal action when his new administration gets underway in January.Roberta Kaplan, Carroll’s lawyer, said in a statement that she’s confident the US Court of Appeals in New York will uphold the decision so the case can move quickly to the exchange of evidence. The attorney has been pushing to depose Trump under oath and force him to submit a DNA sample to compare to a sample from the dress Carroll says she wore on the day of the attack.“From the very start of this case, Donald Trump’s number one goal has been to avoid discovery and cause delay,” Kaplan said. “It remains to be seen whether the new attorney general will agree that Trump was acting within the scope of his employment as President when he defamed our client.“In the lower court ruling, Kaplan held that Trump isn’t a federal “employee” under a law that allows the U.S. to replace government workers as defendants when they’re sued over actions taken as part of their job. The “undisputed facts” of the case show Trump’s comment about Carroll can’t be considered part of his presidential duties, the judge wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-makes-last-ditch-bid-to-derail-donald-trump-rape-accuser-case/story-Vz3IA0m3EtLuyZkB1LhhDK.html

It has also affected the ability to post updates to its service health dashboard, the company said.“Kinesis has been experiencing increased error rates this morning in our US-East-1 Region that’s impacted some other AWS services. We are working toward resolution,” an AWS spokesperson said in a statement.Amazon Kinesis, a part of its cloud offerings, collects, processes and analyzes real-time data and offers insights. Video-streaming device maker Roku Inc, Adobe’s Spark platform, video-hosting website Flickr and the Baltimore Sun newspaper were among those hit by the outage, according to their recent posts on Twitter.“We are experiencing intermittent issues with our website and publishing system because of the AWS outage,” the newspaper tweeted. Amazon’s cloud service business is thriving on higher demand from companies switching to virtual offices due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Sales from AWS, which sells data storage and computing power in the cloud, rose about 29% in the third quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-s-cloud-service-sees-widespread-outage/story-FLB7lrZXppSu7HsEAj7zxO.html
26-11-2020||World||Rising US weekly jobless claims, Covid-19 cases point to slowing economic recovery||The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits increased further last week, suggesting that an explosion in new Covid-19 infections and business restrictions were boosting layoffs and undermining the labor market recovery.Still, the economy got off to a solid start in the fourth quarter, with consumer spending and business investment in equipment topping analysts’ expectations in October. Businesses also reported a sharp rebound in profits in the third quarter.That was, however, insufficient to lift the heavy cloud over the economy. Personal income dropped last month and could decline further with about 13.6 million Americans due to lose government-funded unemployment benefits a day after Christmas. The benefits, part of a more than $3 trillion government coronavirus relief package which has largely expired, contributed to record economic growth in the third quarter. Another package is expected only after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump is heavily focused on contesting his electoral loss to Biden.Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s Nov. 4-5 meeting showed officials discussed how the US central bank’s asset purchases could be adjusted to provide additional support to the economy.“The question is no longer whether the recovery will slow, it will,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. “The real issue is by how much will it decelerate.”Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 30,000 to a seasonally adjusted 778,000 for the week ended Nov. 21, the Labor Department said. That was the second straight weekly increase in claims and exceeded economists’ expectations for 730,000 applications in a Reuters poll.The weekly claims report, the most timely data on the economy’s health, was published a day early because of Thursday’s Thanksgiving Day holiday. Unadjusted claims jumped 78,372 to 827,710 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number because of earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations due to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.14 million people filed claims last week. There were at least 20.5 million people collecting unemployment benefits in early November.The United States has been slammed by a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, with daily cases exceeding 100,000 since early November. More than 12 million people have been infected in the country, according to a Reuters tally of official data.The respiratory illness has killed more than 259,000 Americans and hospitalizations are soaring, prompting state and local governments to reimpose a host of restrictions on social and economic life in recent weeks, which could keep claims above their 665,000 peak seen during the 2007-09 Great Recession.US stocks were mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. US Treasury prices were lower.EXHAUSTING BENEFITSThough the claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 299,000 to 6.071 million in the week ending Nov. 14, that was because many have exhausted their eligibility, which is limited to six months in most states. A record 4.509 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 7, up 132,437 from the prior week. These benefits as well as those for gig workers and the self-employed will lapse on Dec. 26. That and the ebb in consumer confidence amid the raging pandemic cast doubts on the sustainability of strong spending.In second report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.5% last month after increasing 1.2% in September. But personal income fell 0.7%, reversing a 0.7% gain in September. Economists had forecast spending rising 0.4%.“Were it not for recent virus-related developments, it looks like GDP would be on track for a pretty robust fourth quarter,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. “But given the recent surge in new Covid-19 cases, we think that the data will soften noticeably in November and December.” Solid consumer spending was accompanied by a rise in imports, which pushed the goods trade deficit up 1.2% to $80.3 billion in October, a third report from the department showed. Still, the economy is likely to remain afloat in the fourth quarter, though growing at a moderate pace. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans rose 0.7% in October, the Commerce Department said in a fourth report.A fifth report from the department showed after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, rebounded at a 36.6% annualized rate in the third quarter after two straight quarterly declines. The department also confirmed that the economy grew at a historic 33.1% pace in the July-September quarter. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% rate. Despite encouraging developments on vaccines, spiraling Covid-19 infections and expectations for a smaller stimulus package have prompted economists to slash their GDP growth forecasts for the first quarter of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rising-us-weekly-jobless-claims-covid-19-cases-point-to-slowing-economic-recovery/story-jKpXXLibInJE31cEWTVlFN.html
26-11-2020||World||Australia seeks to break China coal stalemate as tensions rise||Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he’s appointed his “best people” to work on breaking a stalemate that’s seen more than 50 ships laden with Australian coal stranded off Chinese ports, as tensions between the trading partners increase.More than $500 million worth of Australian coal and about 1,000 crew on the ships are stuck after China blacklisted a wide swathe of Australian commodities and foodstuffs, amid what Morrison described on Thursday as an “extraordinary period” in the relationship.“We will work the process through with the Chinese government to get the best possible outcome that we can,” Morrison said in an with Nine Network television. While he said “there are obviously tensions” in the relationship, they wouldn’t be “resolved by Australia surrendering its sovereignty.”Mending ties won’t be easy: Morrison’s ministers have had no direct contact with their counterparts in Beijing since at least April. That’s when Australia exacerbated existing grievances with China by calling for independent investigators to be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus.Also Read | ‘Whoever started the trouble should end it,’ says China amid worsening ties with AustraliaAs well as the deadlock over Australian coal, Beijing has placed crippling tariffs on Australia’s barley exports, halted beef imports from several large meat plants, warned its citizens against holidaying or studying in Australia and ordered traders to stop buying at least seven commodities including copper and wine.China, which said Wednesday that the coal shipments were delayed due to strengthening of examination and testing of the imports, has become increasingly vocal in recent weeks in saying Australia is to blame for strained ties.“The root cause of the deteriorating bilateral ties is Australia’s repeated wrong acts and remarks on issues concerning China’s core interests and major concerns as well as its provocative and confrontational actions,” China’s embassy in Canberra said in a statement posted on its website on Monday. “Those who have caused problems should be the ones to solve problems.”Beijing toned down that rhetoric somewhat this week after a speech by Morrison in which he said that Australia did not seek to contain China economically, and that China had pulled more people out of poverty than any other nation. A Chinese diplomat in Canberra last week gave a document to Australian media outlets outlining 14 grievances and accusing the nation of “poisoning bilateral relations.”“China noticed Prime Minister Morrison’s positive comments on the global influence of China’s economic growth and China’s poverty alleviation efforts,” Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Zhao Lijian said in Beijing Wednesday. “We hope Australia will make independent, objective, sensible choices that serve its own interests.”‘It Is Mistaken’Australia’s top diplomat Frances Adamson said in a speech in Canberra on Wednesday night that “China may have reached a point where it believes that it can largely set the terms of its future engagement with the world.”Also Read | Australia, Japan to bolster defense ties amid China’s rise“If it has, it is mistaken-- and that is because there is far more to be gained for China, and for everyone else, through working constructively and collaboratively within the international system, without resort to pressure or coercion,” said Adamson, who is secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Morrison is seeking to create a buffer against what his government sees as an increasingly assertive China under President Xi Jinping’s leadership by bolstering multilateral forums of “like-minded” liberal democracies in groupings such as the Quad and Five Eyes.“Of course we want happy co-existence and positive relationship with China,” Morrison said on Thursday, adding that it was “not simple” to walk a middle path between China and the US.“But we also have a wonderful alliance with the US and a friendship with them as like-minded countries with a similar outlook with liberal democratic values,” he said. “And then we have our core national interests as well. And we want to see all those managed together.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-seeks-to-break-china-coal-stalemate-as-tensions-rise/story-frq7RHJX9UZ1Rsp0cBpF5K.html
26-11-2020||World||Germany extends partial shutdown to curb virus spread||German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors on Wednesday agreed to extend a partial shutdown well into December in an effort to further reduce the rate of Covid-19 infections ahead of the Christmas period.Germany embarked on a so-called “wave-breaker” shutdown on Nov. 2, closing restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities but leaving schools, shops and hair salons open. It was initially slated to last four weeks.Merkel said the measures will now be extended until at least Dec. 20, with a goal of pushing the number of new coronavirus cases in each region below 50 per 100,000 inhabitants per week.“We have to continue to pursue this goal,” she told reporters in Berlin.Merkel said that while existing measures have succeeded in halting an surge in new coronavirus infections, they have stabilized at a high level.Germany’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 18,633 new cases over the past 24 hours — compared with 17,561 a week earlier.“We can’t be satisfied with this partial success,” she said, noting that health officials on Wednesday also reported 410 deaths linked to Covid-19, the highest single-day total yet.“(This) reminds us in the saddest way that behind the statistics are human fates,” Merkel said.During a seven-hour video call, federal and state officials also agreed on a number of new restrictions.These include:—Limiting private gatherings to five people from up to two households, not counting children under 14. Over the festive period that number will be increased to 10, to allow for small family gatherings.—Traditional New Year’s Eve fireworks will be discouraged, and banned entirely in some popular streets and squares.—Employers will be encouraged to let staff work from home Dec. 23 to Jan. 1.—Masks will be required in front of stores, in parking lots and in most secondary schools.—The number of customers allowed into larger stores will be reduced.The government also plans around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) more in aid to compensate businesses hit by the shutdown, on top of 15 billion euros provided by federal authorities in November.Germany, which has 83 million people, was credited with a relatively good performance in the first phase of the pandemic. It still has a lower death rate than several other European countries, and its current shutdown has been relatively mild.Germany has reported a total of 961,320 virus cases since the pandemic began, including 14,771 deaths.Merkel expressed hope that the arrival of the first vaccines in coming weeks would help turn the corner on the pandemic.“A lot indicates that 2021 will bring us relief,” she said.The country’s disease control agency released a new version of its contact tracing app Wednesday that includes reminders for people to share positive test results with people they were in close proximity to.The app had been downloaded 22.8 million times by Friday. Its decentralized, privacy-focused design has been copied by several other European countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-extends-partial-shutdown-to-curb-virus-spread/story-hN9UR50ixvJUGVx5L59AKJ.html
26-11-2020||World||Trump administration denies nod for planned mine near Alaska fishery||The Trump administration on Wednesday effectively killed a contentious proposed mine in Alaska, a gold and copper prospect once envisioned to be nearly as deep as the Grand Canyon and could produce enough waste to fill an NFL stadium nearly 3,900 times — all near the headwaters of the world’s largest sockeye salmon fishery.The Army Corps of Engineers “concluded that the proposed project is contrary to the public interest” and denied a permit to build the Pebble Mine under both the Clean Water Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act, the agency said in a statement.The rejection was a surprise. It’s at odds with President Donald Trump’s efforts to encourage energy development in Alaska, including opening up part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, and other moves nationwide to roll back environmental protections that would benefit oil and gas and other industries.The Corps of Engineers also seemed to signal just a few months ago that after almost two decades of political wrangling, Pebble Mine was on a fast track to approval, a reversal from what many had expected under the Obama administration.But unlike drilling elsewhere in Alaska, the mine proposed for the southwestern Bristol Bay region could have negatively affected the state’s billion-dollar fishing industry. Conservationists and even Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., sounded the alarm on the project before the administration changed course again.The CEO of the Pebble Limited Partnership, the mine’s developers, said he was dismayed by the decision, especially after the corps had indicated in an environmental impact statement in July that the mine and fishery could coexist.“One of the real tragedies of this decision is the loss of economic opportunities for people living in the area,” CEO John Shively said in a statement. The environmental review “clearly describes those benefits, and now a politically driven decision has taken away the hope that many had for a better life. This is also a lost opportunity for the state’s future economy.”He said they are considering their next steps, which could include an appeal of the corps’ decision.“Today Bristol Bay’s residents and fishermen celebrate the news that Pebble’s permit has been denied; tomorrow we get back to work,” said Katherine Carscallen, executive director of the group Commercial Fishermen for Bristol Bay.The group wants Congress to pass laws protecting the region. “We’ve learned the hard way over the last decade that Pebble is not truly dead until protections are finalized,” Carscallen said.In July, the Corps of Engineers released an environmental review that the mine developer saw as laying the groundwork for key federal approvals. The review said that under normal operations, Pebble Mine “would not be expected to have a measurable effect on fish numbers and result in long-term changes to the health of the commercial fisheries in Bristol Bay.”However, in August, the corps said it had determined that discharges at the mine site would cause “unavoidable adverse impacts to aquatic resources” and laid out required steps to reduce those effects.Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd., which owns Pebble Limited Partnership, said it had submitted a mitigation plan on Nov. 16.Even if the corps had approved the project, there was still no guarantee it would have been built. It would have needed state approval, and President-elect Joe Biden has expressed opposition to the project.Critics saw Pebble Mine as getting a lifeline under the Trump administration. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew restrictions on development that were proposed — but never finalized — under the Obama administration and said it planned to work with the corps to address concerns.However, Trump’s eldest son was among those who voiced opposition earlier this year. After senior Trump campaign adviser Nick Ayers tweeted in August that he hoped the president would direct the EPA to block Pebble Mine, Trump Jr. responded: “As a sportsman who has spent plenty of time in the area I agree 100%. The headwaters of Bristol Bay and the surrounding fishery are too unique and fragile to take any chances with.”The president later said he would “listen to both sides.”“The credit for this victory belongs not to any politician but to Alaskans and Bristol Bay’s Indigenous peoples, as well as to hunters, anglers and wildlife enthusiasts from all across the country who spoke out in opposition to this dangerous and ill-conceived project,” said Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League.Alaska’s two Republican U.S. senators, who support oil and gas development and mining, hailed the rejection of the Pebble Mine permit. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said the decision affirmed her position that it’s the wrong mine in the wrong place.“It will help ensure the continued protection of an irreplaceable resource — Bristol Bay’s world-class salmon fishery,” she said.Sen. Dan Sullivan said he would remain an advocate for good-paying jobs derived from resource development.“However, given the special nature of the Bristol Bay watershed and the fisheries and subsistence resources downstream, Pebble had to meet a high bar so that we do not trade one resource for another,” he said. “Pebble did not meet that bar.”___Associated Press journalist Becky Bohrer in Juneau contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-denies-nod-for-planned-mine-near-alaska-fishery/story-9D3tYZRFDqM9SOYpr2oiMJ.html
26-11-2020||World||AstraZeneca manufacturing error clouds vaccine study results||AstraZeneca and Oxford University on Wednesday acknowledged a manufacturing error that is raising questions about preliminary results of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine.A statement describing the error came days after the company and the university described the shots as “highly effective” and made no mention of why some study participants didn’t receive as much vaccine in the first of two shots as expected.In a surprise, the group of volunteers that got a lower dose seemed to be much better protected than the volunteers who got two full doses. In the low-dose group, AstraZeneca said, the vaccine appeared to be 90% effective. In the group that got two full doses, the vaccine appeared to be 62% effective. Combined, the drugmakers said the vaccine appeared to be 70% effective. But the way in which the results were arrived at and reported by the companies has led to pointed questions from experts.The partial results announced Monday are from large ongoing studies in the U.K. and Brazil designed to determine the optimal dose of vaccine, as well as examine safety and effectiveness. Multiple combinations and doses were tried in the volunteers. They were compared to others who were given a meningitis vaccine or a saline shot.DID RESEARCHERS MEAN TO GIVE A HALF DOSE?Before they begin their research, scientists spell out all the steps they are taking, and how they will analyze the results. Any deviation from that protocol can put the results in question.In a statement Wednesday, Oxford University said some of the vials used in the trial didn’t have the right concentration of vaccine so some volunteers got a half dose. The university said that it discussed the problem with regulators, and agreed to complete the late stage trial with two groups. The manufacturing problem has been corrected, according to the statement.WHAT ABOUT THE RESULTS THEMSELVES?Experts say the relatively small number of people in the low dose group makes it difficult to know if the effectiveness seen in the group is real or a statistical quirk. Some 2,741 people received a half dose of the vaccine followed by a full dose, AstraZeneca said. A total of 8,895 people received two full doses.Another factor: none of the people in the low-dose group were over 55 years old. Younger people tend to mount a stronger immune response than older people, so it could be that the youth of the participants in the low-dose group is why it looked more effective, not the size of the dose.Another point of confusion comes from a decision to pool results from two groups of participants who received different dosing levels to reach an average 70% effectiveness, said David Salisbury, and associate fellow of the global health program at the Chatham House think tank.“You’ve taken two studies for which different doses were used and come up with a composite that doesn’t represent either of the doses,″ he said of the figure. “I think many people are having trouble with that.″WHY WOULD A SMALLER FIRST DOSE BE MORE EFFECTIVE?Oxford researchers say they aren’t certain and they are working to uncover the reason.Sarah Gilbert, one of the Oxford scientists leading the research, said the answer is probably related to providing exactly the right amount of vaccine to trigger the best immune response.“It’s the Goldilocks amount that you want, I think, not too little and not too much. Too much could give you a poor quality response as well,’’ she said. “So you want just the right amount and it’s a bit hit and miss when you’re trying to go quickly to get that perfect first time.”WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS?Details of the trial results will be published in medical journals and provided to U.K. regulators so they can decide whether to authorize distribution of the vaccine. Those reports will include a detailed breakdown that includes demographic and other information about who got sick in each group, and give a more complete picture of how effective the vaccine is.Moncef Slaoui, who leads the U.S. coronavirus vaccine program Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday in a call with reporters that U.S. officials are trying to determine what immune response the vaccine produced, and may decide to modify the AstraZeneca study in the U.S. to include a half dose.“But we want it to be based on data and science,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-manufacturing-error-clouds-vaccine-study-results/story-F54zPoqITCtwb3VM4rWPAO.html
26-11-2020||World||White House considers lifting entry restrictions on Europeans||Several federal agencies have recommended that the White House lift an entry ban on non-US citizens arriving from Europe put in place to slow the spread of Covid-19.The organizations, which participate in the White House Coronavirus Task Force, have signed off on lifting the restrictions, said two people who were briefed on the discussions. The limits have helped lead to a more than 90% reduction in the lucrative trans-Atlantic flight market.The restrictions were imposed by the Homeland Security Department after a presidential proclamation on March 11. It applied to 28 European nations and was expanded to Brazil on May 25. The department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.It’s unclear whether White House officials, including President Donald Trump, will go along with lifting the ban or what the timing of a decision will be, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to discuss the issue. The nation is currently experiencing record high infection rates and growing deaths.The immediate impact of such an action on airlines is also not known. Most European nations have imposed quarantines on arriving passengers, which has severely limited those who want to travel to and from the region.The White House declined to comment. The Department of Transportation, which was said to have signed off on lifting the restrictions, didn’t respond to a request for comment on its position.“The Department stands ready to support the safe resumption of international flights to and from the US,” the DOT said in an emailed statement. “Conversations are ongoing between the federal government, international partners, and industry stakeholders on these matters.”Consideration of such a move was reported earlier by Reuters.Two other people briefed on the discussions, who also asked not to be named, said they were aware of attempts to lift the Homeland Security travel limitations as part of a broader effort to help revive the struggling airline industry.The justification for ending or limiting the restrictions is that infections are now so widespread that travel from one country to another isn’t considered a major source of spread, said one of the persons briefed on discussions.“We have been advocating for the federal government to set a national standard on testing in order to lift travel restrictions,” the trade group for large US carriers, Airlines for America, said in a statement.The airline industry in recent months has been proposing various methods to safely reopen travel markets. They include trials in which passengers would be tested for the coronavirus before boarding and using virus tests after arrival to lower or eliminate quarantines.Carriers have also insisted that it’s safe to fly during the pandemic as a result of aircraft disinfection, air conditioning that removes the virus and mask usage. Scientists caution that the data remains uncertain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-considers-lifting-entry-restrictions-on-europeans/story-bQClXkTQaUgrMdMZrPYn2L.html
26-11-2020||World||TikTok granted one-week extension of forced-sale deadline||UShe Trump administration has given TikTok’s Chinese owner another week to complete a sale of its popular video-sharing app in order to resolve US national security concerns.The new deadline, which had already been extended by 15 days, is Dec. 4, TikTok’s parent ByteDance Ltd. said in a court filing Wednesday.The fate of TikTok, an app that’s been downloaded more than 100 million times in the US, has been caught up for months in US President Donald Trump’s crackdown on Chinese technology companies. The administration has argued that American’s private data gathered through the app could be siphoned off to the authoritarian regime in China, something TikTok has said it would never do. Trump had ordered in August that the app be sold to an American firm or face a ban in the USTo assuage Trump’s concerns, ByteDance forged a deal in September to sell a stake of a spun out TikTok business to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. The deal was never finalized though, because the companies didn’t receive a sign-off from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, known as Cfius, a panel led by the Treasury Department.A Treasury spokesperson said it granted ByteDance a one-week extension to allow time to review a revised submission that Cfius recently received.TikTok has filed multiple challenges against the ban, which are winding their way through the court system, with deadlines in certain proceedings extending past January. Several judges have already blocked the ban from going into effect and the Commerce Department said it would comply with those court rulings as the government appeals.Those cases could lapse when President-Elect Joe Biden takes office in January, unless he decides to enforce the Trump ban and defend the previous administration’s orders in court.The penalties that ByteDance would face if it failed to sell TikTok to a US company by the deadline were never clearly spelled out, though the order said the Justice Department could take “any steps necessary” to enforce the sale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-granted-one-week-extension-of-forced-sale-deadline/story-zK9P72wRWdBfXnXVqoVCdN.html
26-11-2020||World||Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam vows to restore political order||Hong Kong’s leader vowed Wednesday to restore order to the city’s legislature and save its political system from “chaos”, in a key policy speech at a muted gathering of almost exclusively pro-Beijing lawmakers. Chief executive Carrie Lam’s annual policy address to the Legislative Council -- postponed for more than a month after she was ordered to travel to mainland China for meetings with central government officials -- outlines the administration’s plans for the city.Hong Kong is ruled under a “One Country, Two Systems” model that allows it to retain a degree of autonomy and some freedoms that are denied to citizens on the authoritarian mainland.But while last year saw months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests, a strict new national security law imposed by Beijing in June -- as well as anti-pandemic measures limiting public gatherings -- have meant Hong Kong’s streets have remained largely free from unrest.“One of our urgent priorities is to restore Hong Kong’s constitutional order and political system from chaos,” Lam told the legislature, which for the first time had almost no opposition presence after pro-democracy lawmakers were disqualified and supporters resigned en masse in protest.“Hong Kong has experienced multiple blows which are unprecedented,” she added, citing the social unrest, shrinking economy, pandemic and acts that “endangered national security”. Fifteen pro-democracy lawmakers quit earlier this month in protest at the ousting of four colleagues by the government, leaving the legislature a muted gathering of Beijing loyalists.During last year’s demonstrations, the handpicked leader declined to make the speech in the chamber, instead releasing a pre-recorded video after pro-democracy lawmakers heckled her and called for her resignation.This year’s speech went smoothly, with none of the protesting stunts usually seen from opposition lawmakers. Local media captured officials nodding and apparently snoozing during the lengthy speech, while some were seen checking stock prices and playing Sudoku on their phones.Lam said her government would introduce bills to “enhance the oath-taking” by civil servants and to “enhance the electoral system”, though details were unclear.Media reports had suggested that the government might expand voting for Hong Kongers in mainland China, a controversial move criticised by the opposition, although Lam did not offer details on the plans.The leader also said her administration would strengthen patriotic education in the city, part of efforts to foster a sense of greater national identity among youngsters.More than 10,000 people have been arrested during last year’s social unrest, among which 40 percent are students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-vows-to-restore-political-order/story-VWowmqDLO7z2XOGpzFJr8J.html
26-11-2020||World||Trump pardons Michael Flynn, taking direct aim at Russia probe||President Donald Trump pardoned former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Wednesday, taking direct aim in the final days of his administration at a Russia investigation that he has long insisted was motivated by political bias.“It is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon,” Trump tweeted. “Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!”Flynn is the second Trump associate convicted in the Russia probe to be granted clemency by the president. Trump commuted the sentence of longtime confidant Roger Stone just days before he was to report to prison. It is part of a broader effort to undo the results of an investigation that for years has shadowed his administration and yielded criminal charges against a half dozen associates.The action voids the criminal case against Flynn just as a federal judge was weighing, skeptically, whether to grant a Justice Department request to dismiss the prosecution despite Flynn’s own guilty plea to lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts.The move, coming as Trump winds down his single term, is likely to energize supporters who have taken up the case as a cause celebre and rallied around the retired Army lieutenant general as the victim of what they assert is an unfair prosecution. Trump himself has repeatedly spoken warmly about Flynn, even though special counsel Robert Mueller’s prosecutors once praised him as a model cooperator in their probe into ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign.The pardon is the final step in a case defined by twists and turns over the last year after the Justice Department abruptly move to dismiss the case, insisting that Flynn should have never been interviewed by the FBI in the first place, only to have U.S. District Justice Emmet Sullivan refuse the request and appoint a former judge to argue against the federal government’s position.In the months since, a three-judge panel’s decision ordering Sullivan to dismiss the case was overturned by the full appeals court, which sent the matter back to Sullivan. At a hearing in September, Flynn lawyer Sidney Powell told the judge that she had discussed the Flynn case with Trump but also said she did not want a pardon — presumably because she wanted him to be vindicated in the courts.Powell emerged separately in recent weeks as a public face of the Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of his election loss to President-elect Joe Biden, but the Trump legal team ultimately distanced itself from her after she advanced a series of uncorroborated conspiracy claims.The pardon spares Flynn the possibility of any prison sentence, which Sullivan could potentially have imposed had he ultimately decided to reject the Justice Department’s dismissal request. That request was made in May after a review of the case by a federal prosecutor from St. Louis who had been specially appointed by Attorney General William Barr.Flynn acknowledged lying during the FBI interview by saying he had not discussed with the then-Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, sanctions that had just been imposed on Russia for election interference by the outgoing Obama administration. During that conversation, Flynn urged Kislyak for Russia to be “even-keeled” in response to the punitive measures, and assured him “we can have a better conversation” about relations between the two countries after Trump became president.The conversation alarmed the FBI, which at the time was investigating whether the Trump campaign and Russia had coordinated to sway the election’s outcome. In addition, White House officials were stating publicly that Flynn and Kislyak had not discussed sanctions.But last May, the Justice Department abruptly reversed its position in the case. It said the FBI had no basis to interview Flynn about Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States, and that any statements he may have made were not relevant to the FBI’s broader counterintelligence probe. It cited internal FBI notes showing that agents had planned to close out their investigation into Flynn weeks earlier.Flynn was ousted from his position in February 2017 after news broke that he had indeed discussed sanctions with Kislyak, and that former Obama administration administration officials had warned the White House that he could be vulnerable to blackmail.Flynn was among the first of the president’s aides to admit guilt in Mueller’s investigation and cooperated extensively for months. He provided such extensive cooperation that prosecutors did not recommend any prison time and suggested that they would be fine with probation.But on the morning he was to have been sentenced, after a stern rebuke about his behavior from Sullivan, Flynn asked for the hearing to be cut short so that he could continue cooperating and earn credit toward a more lenient sentence.After that, though, he hired new attorneys — including Powell, a conservative commentator and outspoken critic of Mueller’s investigation — who took a far more confrontational stance to the government.The lawyers accused prosecutors of withholding documents and evidence they said was favorable to the case and repeatedly noted that one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn was fired from the FBI for having sent derogatory text messages about Trump during the 2016 campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-pardons-michael-flynn-taking-direct-aim-at-russia-probe/story-L5sCniJImhye2XX5pck5fL.html
26-11-2020||World||Joe Biden appeals for unity in Thanksgiving-eve address||In a time of plague and raw division, President-elect Joe Biden appealed for unity Wednesday in a Thanksgiving-eve address to the nation asking Americans to “steel our spines” for a fight against the coronavirus that he predicted would continue for months.But even as he implored Americans to join in healing and common purpose, President Donald Trump asserted that the election should be overturned, a futile call but one that stokes the divisions Biden is trying to overcome.With Covid-19 cases surging nationwide, Biden called on Americans to take precautions to try to stem the tide of the virus, by wearing masks and practicing social distancing. While he said the federal government has “vast powers” to combat the virus, “the federal government can’t do it alone.”“Each of us has a responsibility in our own lives to do what we can to slow the virus,” he said in remarks in Wilmington.Biden said that, until there’s a vaccine, wearing masks, social distancing and limiting the size of gatherings “are our most effective tools to combat the virus.” But he pledged that from the start of his presidency, “we will take steps that will change the course of the disease,” including increasing testing, providing more protective gear and clearer guidance for businesses and schools to reopen.And he said that he himself was taking precautions around Thanksgiving and eschewing his traditional large family gathering, instead spending the holiday with just his wife, daughter and son in law.“This is the moment when we need to steel our spines, redouble our efforts and recommit ourselves to this fight,” Biden said. “We’re all in this together.”But Trump stoked the embers of his flailing effort to upend the election results as his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and other members of his legal team met Pennsylvania Republican state senators in Gettysburg. There, they again aired grievances about the election and repeated allegations of Democratic malfeasance that have already disintegrated under examination by courts.Trump joined the meeting from the Oval Office, asserting: “This was an election that we won easily. We won it by a lot.” In fact the election gave Biden a clear mandate and no systemic fraud has been uncovered.In his remarks in Wilmington, Biden made passing reference to Trump’s refusal to concede, declaring “our democracy was tested this year” but “the people of this nation are up to the task.”“In America, we have full and fair and free elections, and then we honor the results,” he said. “The people of this nation and the laws of the land won’t stand for anything else.”He also offered an optimistic vision, calling on Americans to “dream again” and predicting that “the 21st century is going to be an American century.”Biden’s remarks came as Covid-19 cases are surging nationwide. Hospitalizations, deaths and the testing positivity rate were also up sharply as the nation approached Thanksgiving, and public health experts have warned that the large family gatherings expected for the holiday are likely to extend and exacerbate the surge.Biden has said turning the tide of the pandemic will be the top priority of his administration once he takes office in January, and he’s made multiple public remarks urging Americans to embrace mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines to combat the spread. The Democratic president-elect formed a coronavirus advisory board of scientists, doctors and public health experts, and he plans to establish a Covid-19 coordinator in the White House to lead his administration’s response.This week, however, Biden focused beyond the crisis stateside and unveiled his national security team on Tuesday, including his nominees for secretary of state, director of national intelligence and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Drawing implicit contrasts with President Donald Trump throughout the event, Biden said that the team “reflects the fact that America is back, ready to lead the world, not retreat from it.” He’s also expected to name Janet Yellen as treasury secretary in the coming weeks.The president-elect’s team has also begun the next phase of its transition preparations after the Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration declared Biden the “apparent winner” of the election, removing a major roadblock to cooperation between Biden’s staff and their counterparts in the Trump administration.Trump has refused to concede the election, and his campaign continues to pursue legal challenges to the vote in some states. But the GSA’s ascertainment of Biden’s win means the transition can proceed regardless of the Republican president’s resistance.For the next few days, Biden plans to spend some time focused on his family. He’s traveling with his wife, Jill, to Rehoboth Beach, the small Delaware beach town where the two have a vacation home. That’s where they’ll host their daughter and son-in-law for Thanksgiving dinner.

26-11-2020||World||Defying warnings, millions in US travel for Thanksgiving amid raging Covid-19||Millions of Americans took to the skies and hit the road ahead of Thanksgiving at the risk of pouring gasoline on the coronavirus fire, disregarding increasingly dire warnings that they stay home and limit their holiday gatherings to members of their own household.Those who are flying witnessed a distinctly 2020 landscape at the nation’s airports during what is traditionally one of the busiest travel periods of the year: plexiglass barriers in front of the ID stations, rapid virus testing sites inside terminals, and paperwork asking them to quarantine upon arrival at their destination.While the number of Americans traveling by air over the past several days was down dramatically from the same time last year, plenty of others pressed ahead with their holiday plans amid skyrocketing deaths, hospitalizations, and confirmed infections across the USMany were tired of more than eight months of social distancing and determined to spend time with loved ones.“I think with the holidays and everything, it’s so important right now, especially because people are so bummed out because of the whole pandemic,” said 25-year-old Cassidy Zerkle of Phoenix, who flew to Kansas City, Missouri, to visit family.She brought snacks and her own hand sanitizer and said the flight was half full. She had a row of seats to herself.“As long as you’re maintaining your distance, you’re not touching stuff and you’re sanitizing your hands, people should see their families right now,” she said.The coronavirus is blamed for more than 12.6 million confirmed infections and over 269,000 deaths in the USMore than 88,000 people in the US— an all-time high — were in the hospital with Covid-19 as of Tuesday, and new cases have soared to an average of over 174,000 per day, the highest level on record. Deaths have surged to more than 1,600 per day, a mark last seen in May, when the crisis in the New York City area was easing.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) and state and local authorities have begged people not to travel and urged them to keep their Thanksgiving celebrations small.“That’ll make sure that your extended family are around to celebrate Christmas and to celebrate the holidays next year,” Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said.About 1 million people per day passed through US airport checkpoints from Friday through Tuesday, a drop-off of around 60% from the same time a year ago. Still, those have been the biggest crowds since the Covid-19 crisis took hold in the US in March.Last year, a record 26 million passengers and crew passed through US airport screening in the 11-day period around Thanksgiving.People tend to drive rather than fly during the holiday, but AAA has projected those numbers also are likely to be lower this year. How much lower the auto club has not said.Many states and cities have adopted precautions. Travelers to Los Angeles — either by plane or train — are being required to fill out an online form acknowledging California’s request that people quarantine for two weeks after arrival in the state.The resurgence of the virus and the refusal of many people to wear masks or keep their distance from others have caused despair among health care officials and front-line workers.“I’ll just to confess to you guys, I’m exhausted trying to convince folks to do stuff. It’s just going nowhere,” said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi’s state health officer.Anne Moore, a 60-year-old woman from Chicago, flew to Albany, New York, to be with her daughter for the holiday. Her daughter is a senior at Dartmouth University, and Moore and her husband were worried about her driving back to Illinois by herself.Before the spike, the family had planned to hold a Thanksgiving gathering of fewer than 10 people. But instead it will be just Moore, her husband and her daughter.“I have friends who are alone. And I’m not inviting them. And I feel badly about that,” she said. “We’ll take a walk or something instead. But yeah, the three of us are isolating.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/defying-warnings-millions-in-us-travel-for-thanksgiving-amid-raging-covid-19/story-bNAJPMOsI9ggF6dPQK3auO.html
26-11-2020||World||Chinese President Xi Jinping congratulates Joe Biden on US election victory||Chinese President Xi Jinping finally joined a growing number of world leaders to congratulate US President-elect Joe Biden on his election victory.It came as Biden introduced members of his foreign policy and national security team on Tuesday with a sharp message for the world - the US was returning to reassert its global leadership to fight terrorism, control the pandemic, and deal with issues such as climate crisis, nuclear proliferation and cyber threats.In a message sent to Biden, Xi said, according to Chinese state news agency, “Promoting healthy and stable development of China-US relations not only serves the fundamental interests of the people in both countries, but also meets the common expectation of the international community.”Xinhua further reported that Xi “hopes that the two sides will uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, focus on cooperation, manage differences, advance the healthy and stable development of China-US ties, and join hands with other countries and the international community to promote the noble cause of world peace and development”.President-elect Biden inherits a tense and testy US-China relationship from President Donald Trump and he will be watched closely at home and abroad how he approaches it as he seeks to return America to playing a larger role on the global stage.“America is back,” Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware. “Ready to lead the world, not retreat from it. Ready to confront our adversaries, not reject our allies.” Biden’s nominee for ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, summed up the new team’s ethos with a similar sentiment, saying, “America is back. Multilateralism is back. Diplomacy is back.”It was a clear repudiation of Trump’s “America First” vision that, the Democrat has said several times before, left “America alone” on the global stage. Former Trump officials such as James Mattis, the defence secretary, have called for the incoming president to eliminate Trump’s “American First” policy.Biden and his team have begun getting access to intelligence and briefings as part of the transition process, but Trump has continued to contest the election outcome, citing polls that show 79% of his supporters believe the elections were rigged. He is expected join his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani in Pennsylvania as he briefs Republican lawmakers on election fraud allegations that have been dismissed by courts.The US president was also reported to be considering granting presidential pardon to Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser convicted of lying.Biden introduced his “incredible team” of incoming officials in both policy and personal terms, talking about his long years of association with them. He called secretary of state Antony Blinker one of “my closest and most trusted advisers”. On Avril Haines, his nominee for director of National Intelligence, he said, “Can talk literature and theoretical physics, fixing cars, flying planes, and running a bookstore cafe, in a single conversation - because she’s done all of that.” The country’s next top spy chief also took the opportunity to tell the president-elect she will not hesitate to tell him something he did not want to hear. “Mr. President-elect, you know that I have never shied away from speaking truth to power, and that will be my charge as director of National Intelligence,” she said.On John Kerry, the special presidential envoy on climate, Biden said he was “one of my closest friends”, and his appointment reflected the importance he accords to combating the climate crisis.On Jake Sullivan, who will be the youngest national security adviser in US history at 43, Biden said he “understands my vision that economic security is national security”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-president-xi-jinping-congratulates-joe-biden-on-us-election-victory/story-NMKKbOpuzEkKfTNFZy24MI.html
