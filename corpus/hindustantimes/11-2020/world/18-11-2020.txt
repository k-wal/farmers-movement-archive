18-11-2020||World||Europe fosters shift to electric cars with subsidies, bans||Europe is taking unprecedented steps to phase out gasoline and diesel cars and bring an end to the almost 150-year-long era of the internal combustion engine.The UK’s 2030 ban on cars lacking a plug and Germany’s four-year extension of subsidies for electric vehicles reflect the carrot-and-stick approach governments are taking to getting auto companies to embrace batteries. Regulatory pressure already has helped EVs seize a greater share of passenger-car sales in Europe than any other developed auto market in the world.The industry has pleaded for the help because sales are sliding again due to the pandemic. There also will be drawbacks: the need for fewer workers to manufacture battery-powered cars will spur tens of thousands of job cuts over the coming years. And while costs are coming down, EVs are still years away from reaching price parity with the gas and diesel cars consumers are used to.“In the long term, the days of the internal combustion engine in Europe are numbered,” Colin McKerracher, head of advanced transport for BloombergNEF, said by phone. “While the policy is driving the supply side, there is also a real demand for these vehicles. The people who are buying EVs love them.”The political pushes and pulls driving Europe’s EV sales momentum are starting to lure battery-manufacturing investments that suppliers have for years been reluctant to make. China’s SVolt Energy Technology Co. said Tuesday it will join larger peer Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. in opening a factory in Germany in the coming years. Tesla Inc. cell supplier Panasonic Corp. also may start up a battery business in Norway.BMW AG also said Wednesday it will spend 400 million euros ($475 million) to add an electric-car assembly at its main plant in Munich. By the end of 2022, each of its German plants will produce at least one fully electric vehicle.While the UK is moving up its gas- and diesel-car ban by a decade, its 10-point plan to foster a “green industrial revolution” doesn’t take an entirely prohibitive approach. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced almost 2.4 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) of subsidies and support for charging infrastructure, EV development and production.That amount of backing will only partially offset Brexit uncertainties gripping the industry and pales in comparison to Germany’s aid. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is offering carmakers and suppliers 5 billion euros to help weather the coronavirus crisis and invest in electric cars.“Germany is developing into the lead market for e-mobility!” Volkswagen AG Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess wrote in a LinkedIn post. “The federal government’s plan to electrify private transport is working,” he said, pointing to electric and plug-in cars seizing 17.5% market share.Others in the industry are less sanguine. Electric vehicles account for only about 5% of sales in the UK, with prohibitive cost and a dearth of charging infrastructure holding back demand, said Mike Hawes, chief executive officer of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.“All the conversations we have with customers, with drivers, all they’re concerned about is availability of charging,” Hawes said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.Automakers similarly pushed back in September after the European Union released plans to set stricter emissions limits for the next decade. To reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 55% from 1990 levels rather than the previously planned 40%, the European Commission sees carmakers needing to gradually phase out combustion engines.While EVs including the Tesla Model 3, VW ID.3 and Renault Zoe are having some success, UK carmaker Jaguar Land Rover has struggled to get much traction with its I-Pace electric crossover. Electric and plug-in hybrid cars were just 6% of sales last quarter.“It’s not our job to defend the internal combustion engine,” BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said at an event Wednesday hosted by the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. “We will make what the customer wants to buy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-fosters-shift-to-electric-cars-with-subsidies-bans/story-TX7jLDsr7ReCziqC0YHEZO.html
18-11-2020||World||Berlin police forcefully disperse protest over Covid-19 restrictions||German police used water cannons and pepper spray Wednesday to disperse people protesting coronavirus restrictions in Berlin’s government district, after crowds ignored calls to wear masks and keep their distance from one another in line with pandemic regulations.As water sprayed from the cannons rained down on protesters outside the landmark Brandenburg Gate, police in riot gear moved through the crowd carrying away some participants. Some demonstrators threw fireworks, flares and other objects in response as police helicopters hovered overhead.Officers avoided shooting the cannons directly at protesters because there were children in the crowd, and they worked slowly and methodically to disperse the crowd, Berlin police spokesman Thilo Cabiltz said. Some protesters popped open umbrellas and held their ground until they were eventually forced back.More than 100 people were arrested, Cabiltz said, and many more temporarily detained. Nine police officers were injured. The protest crowd thinned significantly by late afternoon as many demonstrators marched back to the city’s main train station, chanting and blowing whistles.One protester held a sign saying “Infection Protection Law=Dictatorship.” Another waved one reading “Truth, Freedom, Don’t Touch Our Constitution.”The protests came as German lawmakers debated a bill that would provide legal underpinning for the government to issue social distancing rules, require masks in public and to close stores and other venues to slow the spread of the virus.The bill easily passed both the lower and upper houses of Germany’s parliament and was fast-tracked to the country’s president, who signed it later Wednesday.While the virus-prevention measures are supported by most people in Germany, a vocal minority has staged regular rallies around the country, arguing that the restrictions are unconstitutional.Health Minister Jens Spahn, defended the measures in parliament ahead of the vote, telling lawmakers that authorities “struggle every day in trying to strike the balance” between restrictions and safeguarding democratic freedoms.But he insisted that Germany had found the right path, noting that it has fared much better during the pandemic than many of its European neighbors.“Where would you rather be than in Germany?” he asked lawmakers from the far-right Alternative for Germany party who criticized the lockdown measures.Overall, the country has reported about 833,000 coronavirus cases and more than 13,000 virus-related deaths in the pandemic, a death toll one-fourth the size of Britain’s.Spahn also praised the efforts of German pharmaceutical company BioNTech, which together with Pfizer is leading the race to develop a vaccine against Covid-19. The health minister denied that vaccinations would be compulsory, a claim repeatedly made by those protesting against government measures.German authorities took the rare step Tuesday of banning a series of protests directly outside the parliament building due to security concerns. Fencing was put up around a wide area that included the Bundestag, nearby parliamentary offices, the federal chancellery and the presidential residence and offices.Outside the metal cordons, protesters gathered early Wednesday by the Brandenburg Gate, and on streets and bridges. The demonstrators came from all walks of life, ranging from the far-left to the far-right, and included families and students.“We want our lives back,” read one sign carried by protesters. Another said “Put banks under surveillance, not citizens.” One demonstrator held a flag with a picture of outgoing US President Donald Trump and an image invoking the right-wing conspiracy theory “QAnon.” Another had a placard showing top German virologist Christian Drosten in prison garb with the word “guilty.”Berlin police said they gave out multiple citations at Wednesday’s demonstration for violating mask-wearing regulations, but that their appeals for people to wear protective gear and to keep their distance from one another were largely ignored. The police department warned that officers had received an order to detain people not following the regulations.“If that does not help, the only course that remains is to disperse the gathering,” the department said on Twitter.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas reacted sharply to the accusation from some protesters that the measures were akin to the 1933 “Enabling Act,” which allowed the Nazis to enact laws without parliamentary approval.“Everyone, naturally, has the right to criticize the measures, our democracy thrives through the exchange of different opinions,” he wrote on Twitter. “But whoever relativizes or trivializes the Holocaust has learned nothing from our history.”A demonstration earlier this month in the eastern city of Leipzig ended in chaos when thousands of protesters defied police orders to wear masks and, later, to disperse. Some participants attacked police officers and journalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/berlin-police-forcefully-disperse-protest-over-covid-19-restrictions/story-VsVrTDPuPgyESqgrw3jdiM.html
18-11-2020||World||Indian-origin student leads Oxford University meat-free campus drive||An Indian-origin student is among a group from the University of Oxford Student Union that is leading a drive towards a meat-free campus as part of wider initiatives to cut the university’s greenhouse emissions.Vihan Jain from the university’s Worcester College joined two fellow students to draft a motion mandating the Student Union to lobby for a ban on beef and lamb in university catering services, which was recently passed with 31 votes to 9 and 13 abstentions.“As the UK’s premier university, the nation looks to Oxford for leadership, but Oxford has shown a lack of leadership in addressing climate change,” reads the motion.“The banning of beef and lamb at university-catered events and outlets is a feasible and effective strategy to help the university meet its revised 2030 goal,” it reads.The move means that the Student Union will now actively lobby the university and individual colleges to move towards meat reduction and eventual removal from campus.Responding to criticisms that the beef and lamb ban could affect the local economy, Jain told the ‘The Oxford Student’ publication that “alternative food offerings can be sourced from local enterprises and can therefore contribute to the local economy, but ‘eat local’ can be a deceptive piece of advice”.According to an Oxford-led study published in the journal ‘Science’ this week, what we eat, how much we eat, how much is wasted, and how food is produced need to change drastically by 2050, if we want to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels. “The good news is, there are many achievable ways rapidly to reduce food emissions if they are acted on quickly. These include both raising crop yields and reducing food loss and waste, but the most important is for individuals to shift towards predominantly plant-based diets,” said Dr Michael Clark of the Oxford Martin School and Nuffield Department of Population Health, who is the lead author on the paper. Reducing the carbon emissions and biodiversity impact of the university’s food system is one of the nine priority areas of the University’s Environmental Sustainability Strategy. The Strategy has the ultimate goal of achieving net zero carbon by 2035 and addressing the global challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. “The university is currently consulting on a draft sustainability strategy which will be approved next year and includes proposals to reduce the carbon and ecological impact of the food it supplies. These policies will be further developed in the light of the consultation response,” a spokesperson for Oxford University said.The University of Cambridge has banned beef and lamb and reported a 33 per cent reduction in carbon emissions per kilogram of food purchased and a 28 per cent reduction in land use per kilogramme of food purchased. London School of Economics (LSE), Goldsmiths and the University of London are among other UK institutions to ban the sale of beef or lamb in campus outlets in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-student-leads-oxford-university-meat-free-campus-drive/story-tGdO9ii8fYIsRqvhZh1hLI.html

18-11-2020||World||Biden turns to coronavirus as Trump fights to overturn election||US President-elect Joe Biden will meet with healthcare workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus crisis in a virtual event on Wednesday, as outgoing President Donald Trump expands his campaign to overturn the election results.Trump has refused to concede the Nov. 3 election, blocking the smooth transition to a new administration. Biden has pledged to make the pandemic, which has killed more than 247,000 people in the United States and cost millions their jobs, a top priority when he takes office on Jan. 20.Biden and his senior advisers have said that Trump’s defiance could jeopardize efforts to contain surging Covid-19 cases and inhibit vaccine distribution planning.Also Read: Covid-19: Third American wave breaking all recordsThat sentiment was echoed by three leading U.S. healthcare organizations on Tuesday that addressed the president directly in an open letter, urging him to share critical Covid-19 data with the Biden team.“As providers of care for all Americans, we see the suffering that is occurring in our communities due to Covid-19....It is from this front line human perspective that we urge you to share critical data and information as soon as possible,” said the letter, signed by the heads of the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association and the American Hospitals Association.While Biden participates in the virtual roundtable from his home state of Delaware on Wednesday, Trump again has no public events scheduled.Trump has claimed, without providing evidence, that he was was cheated out of a victory by widespread fraud and he has fired off a flurry of lawsuits that judges have mostly rejected. Biden won the national popular vote by more than 5.6 million votes, or 3.6 percentage points, with some ballots still being counted. In the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner, Biden captured 306 votes to the Republican Trump’s 232.LONG SHOT TO OVERTURN VOTETo remain in office, Trump would need to overturn results in at least three of the most closely contested states in unprecedented fashion to reach the threshold of 270 electoral votes.States face a Dec. 8 deadline to certify election results in time for the official Electoral College vote on Dec. 14.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageCongress is scheduled to count the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, which is normally a formality. But Trump supporters in the Senate and House of Representatives could object to the results in a final, long-shot attempt to deprive Biden of 270 electoral votes and turn the final decision over to House.Trump on Tuesday fired the top U.S. cybersecurity official, who had irked Trump by refusing to support allegations of election fraud. Chris Krebs was removed as head of the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. His work in protecting the election from hackers and combating disinformation about the vote won praise from lawmakers of both parties, as well as election officials around the country. A Biden spokesman praised Krebs, saying he “should be commended for his service in protecting our elections, not fired for telling the truth”.Taking their cue from the president, Republicans across the country have attempted to cast doubt over the results. In Michigan, where Biden won by 145,000 votes, two Republicans on the Wayne County board of canvassers attempted to hold up Biden’s victory in that state on Tuesday, only to relent hours later.In a county that includes the majority-Black city of Detroit and that voted overwhelmingly in favor of Biden, the two board members initially voted to block certification of the results, citing slight inconsistencies in precinct totals. That drew praise from Trump, who said on Twitter that “having courage is a beautiful thing”. But the Republicans reversed their decision after more than two hours of angry public comment and voted to certify the Wayne County results, with the caveat the Michigan secretary of state conduct an audit of precinct tallies.At a federal court hearing in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann appeared skeptical of Trump’s request to block officials from certifying Biden’s win in that state.“At bottom, you are asking this court to invalidate 6.8 million votes, thereby disenfranchising every single voter in the Commonwealth (of Pennsylvania),” Brann said. “Can you tell me how this result can possibly be justified?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-turns-to-coronavirus-as-trump-fights-to-overturn-election/story-ZaGBmlstsLG2L9syLWr1BP.html
18-11-2020||World||Experts says public-private partnership required for providing healthcare to all||The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated that healthcare is not a solely local or national issue, it is a global issue and there is need for public-private partnerships to provide healthcare, experts said on Wednesday. Emphasising the need for both public and private sectors, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Director Randeep Guleria said, “Private and government sectors complement each other. There is no competition between the two sectors.” He added that there are certain areas where the public sector can do better whether it be training, be it having more medical colleges and trying to run them, or providing care as far as preventive medicine is concerned. A lot of programmes, such as child immunisation programme or TB control, can be run only as part of the public sector, he said. “When we are talking of patient care, there has to be a little bit of understanding and that is being rightly said that public-partnership has to be in a way that there is confidence on both sides,” Guleria said. Covid-19 has taught us a lot and we have learnt that we have to work together, he added. Stating that healthcare is a global issue, NHS UK Former Chairman Malcolm Grant said there are four areas where governments have a crucial role to play. First being refocusing the tune of healthcare systems away from investments in hospitals as their primary priority and invest much more in community and populations, he added. The second is to ensure that innovation is well focused, the third area is to ensure clinical governance and clinical standards, the last being to focus on training of healthcare force, Grant said. He was speaking at a session in ‘Asia Health 2020’, organised by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and CII. Emphasising that while their focus is on clinical outcomes, the private players in the healthcare sector are worried about the cost because they need sustainability, Asia Health 2020 Chairperson and Apollo Hospitals MD Suneeta Reddy said. “We hope the governments will make higher allocations towards healthcare and move towards public-private partnerships,” she added. Narayana Hrudalaya Chairman Devi Shetty said no government in the world can have resources and financial capability to offer healthcare to 1.3 billion people from just taxpayers money. Two things that will transform healthcare in the country are financial intermediary for working class people, and a smart digital tool that is available to every hospital, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-says-public-private-partnership-required-for-providing-healthcare-to-all/story-lsGcJHIMaL7EWyO7YHE66H.html
18-11-2020||World||Reclusive billionaire thrives as pandemic shoppers crowd stores||Tomasz Biernacki doesn’t want attention.The Polish businessman, 46, hasn’t done any major media interviews since crashing his Ferrari F430 more than a decade ago. He didn’t show up at the stock exchange when his company went public in 2017, and his management team rejects investor requests to meet in Warsaw, instead asking them to visit the company’s headquarters about 310 kilometers (193 miles) from the capital.But his business, food retailer Dino Polska SA, is generating plenty of interest. The stock has rallied a record 88% this year, among the biggest gainers of the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, while many traditional retailers struggle from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. For Dino, which focuses on rural areas, the lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19 pushed up sales even more.“Dino investors seem unmoved by the fact that they can’t meet the company’s founder,” Wood & Co. analyst Lukasz Wachelko said by phone. “Some of them haven’t even seen a Dino store at all, but the way the company managed through pandemic gives the owner additional credibility.”It has lifted Biernacki’s fortune to $3.6 billion, closing the gap with Poland’s richest person, synthetic-rubber mogul Michal Solowow, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Biernacki is known for his frugality, rejecting appeals for additional staff or spending. His official biographies on the firm’s website and prospectus don’t provide any information about his education or activities before he founded Dino more than two decades ago -- years after the collapse of communism gave entrepreneurs the first opportunity to benefit from the country’s economic transformation.Biernacki turned down a requests to comment for this story in accordance with the company’s information policy, said Grzegorz Urazinski, Dino’s head of investor relations.Dino, founded in 1999, was on a winning streak even before Covid-19 accelerated its growth.Annual profit has more than tripled since 2015 and its store network has grown 12-fold in less than a decade. When the pandemic triggered a lockdown, shoppers flocked to its outlets to stockpile items including canned food, shelf-stable milk, soap and basic cosmetics. The company, which doesn’t offer online-delivery services, said this month it may be able to increase margins as it expands further in Poland.A slower pace of new store openings is the biggest risk for Dino’s valuation, but for now investors are enjoying the fast growth and are willing to pay a premium for the shares, said Piotr Bogusz, an analyst at MBank SA. Dino trades at 36 times earnings estimated for the next year, compared with about 20 times for peers Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA and Eurocash SA, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Biernacki opened his first store in Gostyn, a town in western Poland, and soon realized that he could get ahead with neighborhood locations rather than competing with the giants in the bigger cities. After he bought a meat-processing plant in 2003, Dino became a magnet for clients seeking fresh products.When Poland’s oldest private equity fund, Enterprise Investors, acquired a 49% stake in 2010, the retailer expanded further and invested in new logistics centers. Its local supermarkets provided all the necessary goods and was soon an alternative to large hypermarkets. Dino’s red-and-green logo became ubiquitous in western Poland, and the company gradually entered other regions.Enterprise Investors sold its holding via an initial public offering seven years later, just as Polish retailers were getting a boost from new state subsidies for families. For investors, Dino was the perfect proxy for the nation’s booming consumer-staples market. Jeronimo Martins, which operates the country’s biggest supermarket chain, had exposure to then-ailing Portugal and Colombia, while food wholesaler Eurocash was dealing with structural problems at the smaller, independent stores it supplied.Since its 2017 debut, Dino shares have risen almost eightfold, taking the company’s market value to $7 billion. As of Sept. 30, the retailer had 1,371 stores, up from 775 at the end of 2017, and owns the land where they’re located.“The company is exploiting a niche of less-urbanized areas where the competition is much lower and the customer base is a beneficiary of increasing disposable income supported by minimum wage growth and social-stimulus programs,” said Krzysztof Kawa, an analyst at Ipopema Securities SA.He predicts the number of stores could triple in the long term. “Dino is constantly pushing the boundaries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reclusive-billionaire-thrives-as-pandemic-shoppers-crowd-stores/story-Fm3gKA6fgRWeIeQY9kUeoL.html
18-11-2020||World||US hits Iran with new sanctions as Pompeo defends strategy||The United States hit Iran with new sanctions on Wednesday, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the case that undoing the actions of the Trump administration would be foolish and dangerous.The Treasury and State departments announced they had targeted a leading Iranian charity and numerous of its affiliates for human rights violations. At the same time, Pompeo released a statement titled “The Importance of Sanctions on Iran,” which argued that the Trump administration’s moves against Iran made the world safer and should not be reversed.The sanctions announced Wednesday target Iran’s Mostazafan Foundation and roughly 160 of its subsidiaries, which are alleged to provide material support to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei for malign activities, including the suppression of dissent.“While (it) is ostensibly a charitable organization charged with providing benefits to the poor and oppressed, its holdings are expropriated from the Iranian people and are used by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to enrich his office, reward his political allies, and persecute the regime’s enemies,” Treasury said in a statement.Also targeted was Iran’s Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi, who it said “played a central role in the Iranian regime’s human rights abuses against Iranian citizens.” Many of the sanctions supplement previously announced penalties by simply adding another layer to them. But they come as the administration seeks to ramp up pressure on Iran before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. Biden has said he wants to return to the rapprochement with Iran that started in the Obama administration but was ended by outgoing President Donald Trump.In an apparent nod to the incoming Biden administration’s stated plans to rejoin or renegotiated the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that Trump withdrew from, Pompeo said sanctions imposed against Iran had been “extraordinarily effective” in reducing the threat from the country. He said they had slashed Iran’s revenue by hundreds of billions of dollars since the pullout in 2018.“Sanctions are part of the pressures creating a new Middle East, bringing together countries that suffer the consequences of Iran’s violence and seek a region more peaceful and stable than before,” he said in a statement. “Reducing that pressure is a dangerous choice, bound to weaken new partnerships for peace in the region and strengthen only the Islamic Republic.” Pompeo said that in its remaining time, the Trump administration would continue to impose sanctions on Iran as well as on foreign governments and companies that violate them.“Throughout the coming weeks and months, we will impose new sanctions on Iran, including using our nuclear, counterterrorism, and human rights authorities, each reflecting the wide range of malign behavior that continues to emanate from the Iranian regime,” he said. “These sanctions are a critical tool of national security to preserve the safety of the region and to protect American lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hits-iran-with-new-sanctions-as-pompeo-defends-strategy/story-ZYi4XP5BGYgSNVWUcpP7AO.html
18-11-2020||World||Iran says to meet nuclear commitments if Biden lifts sanctions||Iran will “automatically” return to its nuclear commitments if US President-elect Joe Biden lifts sanctions imposed in the past two years, its foreign minister said Wednesday.Tehran again meeting its commitments “can be done automatically and needs no conditions or even negotiations,” Mohammad Javad Zarif said in comments published in the state-run Iran daily.President Hassan Rouhani meanwhile called President Donald Trump’s administration “unruly”, and said a Biden administration could “bring back the atmosphere” that prevailed when the landmark nuclear deal was struck in 2015.Decades old US-Iranian tensions escalated after Trump unilaterally withdrew from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed, then toughened, crippling sanctions that have hammered Iran’s economy.While Trump has sought to maximise pressure on Iran and isolate it globally, Biden has proposed to offer the Islamic republic a “credible path back to diplomacy”.Zarif argued that “America is obligated to implement Resolution 2231 as a member of the United Nations and its Security Council,” pointing to the UNSC resolution that enshrined the 2015 nuclear deal.“If it does carry out this resolution and sanctions are lifted and there are no obstacles to Iran’s economic activities, then Iran will carry out” its obligations under the deal, he said.The accord offered Tehran relief from international sanctions in exchange for guarantees, verified by the United Nations, that its nuclear programme has no military aims. - ‘Lift the sanctions’ -Iran, which denies it is seeking to build a nuclear bomb, has since May 2019 gradually suspended most of its key obligations under the agreement, including limits to the production and stockpiling of low-enriched uranium.The UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Wednesday Iran had begun operating advanced centrifuges at an underground section of its primary nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz.Under its deal with world powers, it is only meant to enrich uranium with a less sophisticated variety of centrifuges.In its report last week the IAEA said that Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium now stood at over 12 times the limit in the 2015 accord.The New York Times reported Monday that Trump had last week asked top aides about the possibility of striking Iran’s nuclear facilities.Senior officials reportedly “dissuaded the president from moving ahead with a military strike,” warning him that such an attack could escalate into a broader conflict in the last weeks of his presidency.Iran argues it has moved away from its commitments because of the sanctions and the inability of the other parties -- Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia -- to provide it with the deal’s promised economic benefits.Zarif described Biden as a “foreign affairs veteran” whom he has known for 30 years. Once in the White House, Biden could “lift all of these (sanctions) with three executive orders,” Zarif argued.If Biden’s administration does so, Iran’s return to nuclear commitments will be “quick”, the minister added.Washington’s return to the deal, however, could wait, Zarif added.“The next stage that will need negotiating is America’s return... which is not a priority,” he said, adding that “the first priority is America ending its law-breaking”.amh/mj/fzTHE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-to-meet-nuclear-commitments-if-biden-lifts-sanctions/story-ffgoyQaRijCQC6RIuYBaoI.html
18-11-2020||World||Judge orders US to stop expelling children who cross border||A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to stop expelling immigrant children who cross the southern border alone, halting a policy that has resulted in thousands of rapid deportations of minors during the coronavirus pandemic.U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan issued a preliminary injunction sought by legal groups suing on behalf of children whom the government sought to expel before they could request asylum or other protections under federal law.The Trump administration has expelled at least 8,800 unaccompanied children since March, when it issued an emergency declaration citing the coronavirus as grounds for barring most people crossing the border from remaining in the United States.Border agents have forced many people to return to Mexico right away, while detaining others in holding facilities or hotels, sometimes for days or weeks. Meanwhile, government-funded facilities meant to hold children while they are placed with sponsors have thousands of unused beds.Sullivan’s order bars only the expulsion of children who cross the border unaccompanied by a parent. The government has expelled more than 147,000 people since March, including adults, and parents and children traveling together.The Justice Department did not immediately say whether it would appeal. It has appealed another federal judge’s order barring the use of hotels to detain children.The Trump administration has argued in court that it must expel children who have recently crossed the border — whether they had authorization or not — to prevent the infection of border agents and others in immigration custody. The emergency declaration was made by Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Justice Department on Oct. 2 cited the judgment of “the nation’s top public health official” in urging Sullivan not to stop the expulsion of children.The Associated Press reported on Oct. 3 that top CDC officials resisted issuing the declaration because it lacked a public health basis, but that Vice President Mike Pence ordered Redfield to move forward anyway.Opponents of the policy accuse the administration of using the pandemic as a pretext to restrict immigration and say agents can safely screen minors for COVID-19 without denying protections under federal anti-trafficking law and a court settlement that governs the treatment of children.U.S. Magistrate Judge G. Michael Harvey recommended on Sept. 25 that Sullivan grant an injunction barring expulsions of children, saying the government was claiming power that was “breathtakingly broad.”Children and parents who have been expelled have reported believing they would be allowed to reunite with family in the U.S., only to instead be deported to their countries of origin.One mother of 12- and 9-year-olds found out her children had been expelled when she received a call from an official in Honduras asking her to send a relative to collect them.The father of a 1-year-old girl alleged that agents told him and his wife to feed the girl ice in case their temperatures were checked before boarding a flight. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has denied using ice as an artificial cooling measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-orders-us-to-stop-expelling-children-who-cross-border/story-nNxGG8P76QXpW6kxYjceyJ.html

The hard-hit aviation industry has been pushing for the implementation of rapid tests for air passengers to reduce the need for post-arrival quarantines and to give airlines a boost.“To slow down the spread of coronavirus, we need to scale up testing,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.The commission said it is allocating 100 million euros ($119 million) to purchase rapid antigen tests and to deliver them to EU member states. In addition, it plans to allocate 35.5 million euros ($42 million) to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for staff training and equipping the humanitarian network’s testing teams.Also Read: Brexit creates jobs for customs staff in Eastern Europe, IndiaThe European Commission said rapid tests should be used in situations where fast detection is needed to manage an outbreak or for the regular surveillance of high-risk groups and locations, such as medical personnel and in care homes. The commission also recommended the use of the tests for the purpose of triaging patients at healthcare facilities.When PCR tests are not sufficiently available in areas where the proportion of positive cases is greater or equal to 10%, the rapid tests should be used to test people with Covid-19 symptoms, the commission said. They also could be used in locations with a lower proportion of positive cases as part of contact-tracing strategies, it said..EU leaders are expected to discuss the recommendations during a Thursday evening video conference.More than 275,590 virus-related deaths have been reported in Europe since the start of the pandemic, according to the latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-commission-recommends-wide-use-of-rapid-covid-19-tests/story-7j4aV9XTNhv6uF3gQvZcON.html

Boeing was under fire after two 737 MAX aircraft crashed, claiming 346 lives, and was grounded all over the world due to safety concerns. The approval comes after FAA chief Steve Dickson’s two-hour evaluation flight of a Boeing 737 MAX, which was considered as an important milestone for the clearance. However, the approval doesn’t allow the Max aircraft to immediately return to the skies. Also read | Boeing confident in China with thousands of jet orders forecastConditions for Boeing 737 MAX to return to service:FAA has rescinded the order that grounded the aircraft and has published an Airworthiness Directive, which specifies design changes that must be made before the aircraft returns to service.

18-11-2020||World||Taiwan shuts pro-China TV channel in battle over press freedom||Taiwan’s broadcast regulator has ordered the closure of one of the island’s most ardently pro-China cable news networks following a months long battle over journalistic standards and freedom of the press.The National Communications Commission(NCC) will not renew the broadcast license of Chung T’ien News, its chairman Chen Yaw-shyang said at a briefing in Taipei on Wednesday. The station had repeatedly violated broadcast regulations, including frequent failure to fact check news items and the network owner’s involvement in the editorial process, Chen said.“The key issue is its largest shareholder Tsai Eng-meng is directly and indirectly involved in the production of news programs,” Chen said. “We believe it’s unable to improve its poor operations by solving the structural problem of its shareholder’s involvement.”Tsai Eng-meng is Taiwan’s second-richest man with a fortune worth $5.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index. The chairman of Shanghai-based rice cracker and beverage maker Want Want China Holdings, he has long been a vocal advocate of Taiwan’s unification with China.Chung T’ien News, among Taiwan’s most-watched cable news stations, is widely seen as the most vocal supporter of unification with China among the main TV news networks. It is often strongly critical of President Tsai Ing-wen, who views the island as a de facto independent nation.Chinese InfluenceWednesday’s announcement is the latest example of the often fraught relationship between press freedom and concerns over Chinese influence in Taiwan’s fiercely competitive media landscape.Taiwan is Asia’s second highest-ranking market after South Korea on Reporters Without Borders’ World Press Freedom Index. Since the NCC began its review process of Chung T’ien News, the network has claimed a failure to renew its broadcast license would be a politically backed attack.Chung T’ien called Wednesday’s ruling illegal in a statement and vowed to pursue legal action to protect their employees’ rights to work and freedom of the press.The NCC’s Chen insisted the station’s rejection was not politically motivated. Chung T’ien News was the subject of more than 960 public complaints to the regulator last year, accounting for about 30 per cent of all complaints about TV programming, he said.The station was at the center of concerns over Chinese attempts to sway Taiwan’s public opinion in the lead up to Taiwan’s election at the beginning of the year. It was the focus of a public protest last year when tens of thousands gathered outside the Presidential Office in June to voice their opposition to what they called “red media.”China’s Information War on Taiwan Ramps Up as Election NearsChung T’ien News, which employs 475 people, will be able to continue broadcasting until its current license expires on December 11.The NCC granted its affiliated general entertainment channel permission to continue broadcasting under the condition it increases how much it invests in Taiwan and raises the percentage of domestically produced programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-shuts-pro-china-tv-channel-in-battle-over-press-freedom/story-3zeOn8hv49N6Kjp6ZQidWJ.html

The United States and the European Union (EU) are at the first and the second positions, respectively.As Covid-19 vaccines are getting ready...Purchase agreements are being tied up too...Chart courtesy @WSJ pic.twitter.com/aGgJNmRLurThe report is based on Duke University’s Launch and Scale Speedometer initiative, which studies factors that hinder the delivery of health innovations to lower-income countries. According to the Launch and Scale Speedometer initiative, India ranks third in terms of ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Advance Market Commitments by Country’ with the United States and the European Union ahead of it.India’s confirmed dose purchases exceed 1.5 billion which is more than European Union’s 1.2 billion doses and the United States 1 billion doses. But the US and the EU rank ahead because of their potential dose purchases. The United States has signed up for more than 1.5 billion potential dose purchases. The EU has also signed up for more than 760 million potential dose purchases.With over 1.5 billion potential dose purchases and 1 billion confirmed dose purchases, the US alone has signed up for more than 2.6 billion doses, which indicates it could inoculate its entire population more than once.India is already prioritizing identifying people who would receive the coronavirus vaccine before others. The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration is working on a time-bound process to inoculate maximum numbers of people once a fully effective vaccine is released.US drugmaker Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE in its recently released final analysis of clinical-trial data showed that the efficacy of its coronavirus vaccine candidate is 95%.Researchers at Duke University’s Launch and Scale Speedometer initiative say that the numbers show that more than 8 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccine are currently reserved due to advance market commitments before any clear outcome of the effectiveness of any of the vaccine candidates is yet to be released. Researchers also fear that these advanced deals and deals being made to expand the current deals by high-income countries as well as middle-income countries creates a challenge for equal global distribution of coronavirus vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-confirmed-dose-purchases-of-covid-19-vaccine-exceed-1-5-billion-report/story-d044gZcQQh7yTVVXhPbVrM.html

The biotech firms said that the study indicated a vaccine efficacy rate of 95 per cent, close to the efficacy rate found in early trial results of Moderna’s vaccine candidate. The Phase 3 trial of Pfizer’s vaccine candidate began on July 27 and as of November 13, as many as 41,135 volunteers have received its second dose. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement that the study results mark an important step in this journey to bring forward a vaccine capable of helping to end the pandemic.“With hundreds of thousands of people around the globe infected every day, we urgently need to get a safe and effective vaccine to the world,” he added.Also read | Pfizer, BioNTech plan filing for authorisation as Covid-19 vaccine proves 95% effectiveKey takeaways from Pfizer’s announcement:Efficacy: As per the final analysis, the efficacy has remained consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics.

Riot police detained some protesters while firing volleys of water and urging crowds by loudspeaker to disperse.Also Read: Angela Merkel sees German recovery accelerating once coronavirus is tamedDemonstrators were fuming about legislation due to be passed by parliament that could allow the federal government to impose curbs on social contact, rules on mask-wearing, drinking alcohol in public, shutting shops and stopping sports events.Although most Germans accept the latest “lockdown light” to tackle a second wave of the coronavirus, critics say the law gives the national government too much power and endangers citizens’ civil rights without the approval of parliament.Until now, only a few measures have been mandatory and most have been only enforceable at a state or local level. In addition, several restrictions have been overturned by courts. Protesters were neither keeping the required social distance nor wearing face masks. Some held banners with slogans such as “For Enlightenment. Peace and Freedom” and “Stop the corona pandemic lie”. Many people were waving the German flag.

Police were keen to avoid a repeat of an incident in August when, during mass marches against coronavirus curbs, protesters stormed the steps of the Reichstag parliament building, some of them waving the far-right Reichsflagge flag.The images went around the world and were condemned by leading German politicians.Germany, Europe’s largest economy, was widely praised for keeping infection and death rates below those of many of its neighbours in the first phase of the crisis.

The UK exited the EU on January 31 but it has been following bloc’s rules during the ongoing transition period of 11 months. The two sides haven’t been able to resolve the differences over access to fishing waters and state aid to failing companies.What are the sticking points?The 27-member bloc has been demanding access to UK fishing waters but the British government has called it incompatible with Britain’s future status as an independent coastal state. The EU has also expressed displeasure over the internal market bill published by the British government in September. On the other hand, the UK government tabled the controversial bill, calling it an “insurance policy” for no-deal Brexit.Impact of no-deal BrexitIn case of a no-deal Brexit, the UK will not be able to avail the benefit of EU’s single market and customs union, leaving it with no choice but to trade with the bloc on terms similar to non-European markets. Britain will face tariffs and border checks on its exports to the EU and in response, the UK could also impose tariffs on imports from the trading bloc, resulting into increased price of imported goods.Also Read | Brexit creates jobs for customs staff in Eastern Europe, IndiaOn Monday, trade talks began in Brussels but sticking points of the deal remain in place.

Here is everything you need to know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 1.34 million lives worldwide:Other than Pfizer, which companies are in the vaccine race? On Monday, US pharmaceutical company, Moderna Inc, released interim data showing that its vaccine worked in a large, late-stage clinical trial with a 94.5% efficacy rate.Interim late-stage trial results for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine published on Nov. 11 showed the shot is 92% effective.The next data release will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson says it is on track to deliver data this year. Read more | US aims to immunise 20 million in December, WHO says trust in vaccines vitalWhat happens in these trials? The companies are testing their vaccines against a placebo - typically saline solution - in healthy volunteers to see if the rate of Covid-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot. What were pharma companies waiting for to release data?The trials rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with the coronavirus, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where trials are being conducted. Each drugmaker has targeted a specific number of infections to trigger a first analysis of their data. Early in the trials, infection rates were low. With a surge in infections around the globe in October and November, trial participants became infected more quickly.How well are the vaccines supposed to work?The World Health Organization ideally wants to see at least 70% efficacy in trials. The US Food and Drug Administration wants at least 50% - which means there must be at least twice as many infections among volunteers who received a placebo as among those in the vaccine group. The European Medicines Agency has said it may accept a lower efficacy level. Read more | US approves first self-testing kit for detecting Covid-19When will regulators rule on safety and efficacy?Pfizer/BioNTech plan to submit an EUA application in US within days. Moderna aims to file an application in the coming weeks once it has the two months of safety data on half the trial participants, as required by the US Food and Drug Administration. That should happen in the second half of November. That means an FDA decision is unlikely before December. Regulators for Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada are considering data as it becomes available. It is not clear when companies will submit efficacy data or when the agencies would make a decision.Could these be the first widely available coronavirus vaccines?Yes, although China launched an emergency use program in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection that has vaccinated hundreds of thousands of people.

Zeena, 30, was inspired to join the police to help her Muslim community after the Christchurch terror attack last year in which 51 people were killed at two mosques in New Zealand. This week she will not only graduate as a police officer, but will become the first in New Zealand to don a police-issued hijab as part of her uniform, the New Zealand Herald reported. Zeena has worked with police to design a garment that is both functional for her new role and considerate of her religion, it said. “It feels great to be able to go out and show the New Zealand Police uniform hijab because I was able to take part in the design process,” she said, adding that she was “proud” to represent her community - particularly women. Zeena believes that the move will encourage other women to apply to the force as well. “Having a police-branded hijab means women, who may not have previously considered policing, can do so now. It’s great how the police incorporated my religion and culture,” she said. Born in Fiji, Zeena moved to New Zealand with her family when she was a child. She appreciated police for considering her personal needs - both at the Police College and in her role going forward. “At college they had a prayer room and halal meals. When I had to go swimming, they were ok with me wearing long sleeves,” Zeena said.Read more | Thailand approves legislation to pave way to legalize abortions “We need more Muslim women to help in the community, most of them are too scared to talk to the police and would probably shut the front door if a man turned up to talk to them. If we have more women turning up, a more diverse front line, then we can reduce more crime,” she said. Valuing diversity is one of the six core values for New Zealand Police - alongside professionalism, respect, integrity, empathy and commitment to Māori and the Treaty of Waitangi, the report said. “We recognise the value different perspectives and experiences bring to making us better at what we do,” New Zealand Police said. “We need people with a range of skills, backgrounds and experience levels - diversity is essential so that we can effectively serve the needs of New Zealand’s communities now and in the future,” it said.In 2008, New Zealand Police introduced a turban into the uniform, and Nelson Constable Jagmohan Malhi became the first officer to wear it on duty. Until then he had to forgo the turban on duty, despite it being an important part of his Sikh faith. In the UK, the Metropolitan Police in London approved a uniform hijab in 2006 with Police Scotland following in 2016.

Dave Gladen, the firm’s group marketing manager, says the country has a deep pool of expertise in the EU’s customs rules because it only joined the bloc in 2007.“It’s allowed us to get some great expertise, and obviously there’s a lower cost,” Gladen said in a telephone interview. “Salaries for customs clearance representatives in the UK have just escalated crazily.”Britain’s logistics industry is having to find creative ways to be ready for a wave of bureaucracy that will hit on January 1, when commerce between the UK and its largest trading partner will be subject to new paperwork even if the two sides reach a free-trade agreement. Hundreds of millions of extra customs declarations will be required on goods crossing the border annually, at an estimated cost of 13 billion pounds ($17 billion).Metro Shipping Ltd., which moves goods for some of Britain’s largest retailers and automotive companies, has taken on 17 extra staff in Chennai, India in recent weeks specifically to handle Brexit-related work. The Birmingham, England-based firm expects it will have to handle an extra 120,000 customs declarations annually.Read More | UK’s ambitious 10-point plan for ‘Green Industrial Revolution’ to create, support 250,000 jobs“There’s nowhere near enough skill-set here to cover it,” said Grant Liddell, business development director at Metro, which stopped taking on new clients for Brexit in August because it was at capacity. “We have really geared up,” he said, noting he could hire six or seven staff in India for the price of one employee in the UK.For the government, a shortage of customs agents is one of the biggest threats that could disrupt trade with the EU after the end of the Brexit transition period. If companies don’t have the right paperwork, goods risk being held up at the border, potentially causing traffic chaos. Alternatively, businesses may decide not to trade with the EU at all if they cannot file the appropriate documents.Officials are trying to mitigate the problem by offering grants to businesses to train customs staff, though success has been limited: of the 84 million pounds made available, less than a third had been paid out as of October 16, according to the National Audit Office.The Road Haulage Association, a lobby group, has estimated that the UK needs an extra 50,000 customs agents to cope with the added Brexit workload. The government has repeatedly declined to put a figure on how many have been trained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-creates-jobs-for-customs-staff-in-eastern-europe-india/story-9QLW5T6wQE4uzSWqgxYtPN.html

WFP was awarded the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to combat hunger and improving the conditions of conflict-ridden areas.The institute is now considering the possibility of holding a digital award ceremony to present the WFP with the medal and diploma. Citing the current restrictions in Oslo, the Nobel Institute said that it would not be possible to carry out the ceremony “in a good and worthy manner”. The award ceremony is traditionally held in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the death of prize founder Alfred Nobel.Initially, Norway did well to contain the pandemic but the Scandinavian country has also been reporting an exponential rise in overall cases for the last two weeks. Norway has recorded over 30,000 total cases of coronavirus, and 298 related death so far. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has also overwhelmed the frontline workers of the UN agency since the health crisis has spiralled into a humanitarian crisis.Also Read | Nobel UN food agency warns 2021 will be worse than 2020After the prize announcement, the United Nations food relief agency said that WFP’s recognition is a powerful reminder to the world that “peace and zero hunger go hand-in-hand.” The Rome-based United Nations’ food-assistance branch remains the world’s largest humanitarian organisation addressing hunger and promoting food security. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has highlighted WFP’s role in multilateral cooperation on making food security an instrument of peace. The committee had said in a statement that it wishes to turn the eyes of the world towards the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger. It listed WFP’s work in the past few years, including the assistance to close to 100 million people in 88 countries, in 2019, who are victims of acute food insecurity and hunger.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wfp-chief-won-t-pick-up-peace-prize-in-oslo-says-norwegian-nobel-institute/story-BIafmqmkjXbsx1b8QpqjaJ.html

18-11-2020||World||Pakistani workers protest against China’s unequal wages for locals in CPEC project||Thousands of labourers on Wednesday staged a protest against China in Sindh’s Karachi complaining about unequal wages received by them as compared to their Chinese compatriots.Earlier, The News International reported that the Chinese staff recruited by the Punjab Mass Transit Authority for Orange Line Metro Train (OLMT) project was getting huge salaries in comparison to their Pakistani counterparts.The huge disparity in the salaries is impacting the morale of the Pakistani staff, who are also given a different grade system than the Chinese. Besides, even as the Chinese staff is being paid in Yuan, the locals are getting their salaries in Pakistani rupees (PKR).“On Wednesday, the value of 1 CNY against 1 PKR was equal to Rs 24.02. According to the data of the salaries of 93 Chinese working at the OLMT project, the Chinese staff is highly paid. If the salaries of Pakistani officials working on the same/equivalent seats are compared with those of Chinese staff, the Pakistan employees are getting mere peanuts. According to data, a Chinese-origin deputy chief executive officer/CFO/director with grade L2 is being paid 136,000 CNY per month which is equal to over Rs 3.26 million. There were three positions and all were filled with Chinese. No Pakistani was hired on this designation,” The News International stated.Giving another example of the disparity in salaries, The News International said while 12 people of Chinese origin working on the slot of train dispatcher/train crew are getting 57,000 CNY each, equal to Rs 1.36m, the locally recruited employees working on the OLMT project are getting much lower salaries.The Pakistani employees have demanded a salary hike from the government in accordance with the salary of their Chinese counterparts.Meanwhile, Beijing has put a hold on projects that are part of the USD 62 billion The China–Pakistan Economic Corridor(CPEC), a flagship project of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and the Covid-19 pandemic, ongoing political unrest, and foreign debt limits have resulted in a slowing of Chinese investments in Pakistan.According to sources, Pakistan in 2017 had decided to cut the salaries of contractual employees responsible for executing various projects in the CPEC. Pakistan’s finance ministry had refused to pay the employees as per the agreement.Meanwhile, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Planning and Development on Tuesday cleared the CPEC Authority Bill 2020 with majority despite members belonging to opposition parties strongly opposing the bill, reported The News International.Former minister for planning Ahsan Iqbal opposed the bill and presented seven reasons for opposition to the creation of the CPEC authority. However, after conducting a heated debate, the NA panel passed the CPEC authority bill with a majority.“Creation of CPEC authority is superfluous and unnecessary,” he said. “Ministry of planning has discharged the role diligently and effectively in the past.”The national debt of USD 80 billion on account CPEC is bound to pose a danger to the sovereignty of Pakistan in coming years; as has been the CCP methodology in numerous under-developed countries.The incidents clearly depict the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) core motive, which is using the CPEC project to turn Pakistan into a ‘Chinese colony’.As Imran Khan states China as an ‘all-weather’ friend, till then, the CCP will maintain a facade of Pakistan-China friendship whilst continuing to exploit Pakistan and market outdated items from its industries to Pakistan. Pakistan’s debt burden is also being pushed up by the CCP on every available opportunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-workers-protest-against-china-s-unequal-wages-for-locals-in-cpec-funded-project/story-rl8B2TxkMNVymmD0zD9d2N.html

Also Read: Al Qaeda is battered, but don’t rejoice yetAn International Atomic Energy Agency report last week showed Tehran had installed a cascade, an interlinked cluster, of advanced IR-2m machines underground at Natanz, having moved them from an above-ground plant where it was already enriching uranium with advanced centrifuges in breach of the deal.Last week’s report said it had not fed uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas, the feedstock for centrifuges, into that cascade. “On 14 November 2020, the Agency verified that Iran began feeding UF6 into the recently installed cascade of 174 IR-2m centrifuges at the Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) in Natanz,” the IAEA report to member states dated Tuesday said.Also Read: US, Israel worked together to track and kill al-Qaida No. 2Iran has breached many restrictions imposed by the 2015 deal on its atomic activities, including on the purity to which it enriches uranium and its stock of enriched uranium. These breaches came in response to Trump’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal in 2018 and the reimposition of US sanctions against Tehran that had been lifted under the accord.Last week’s IAEA report said Iran had also begun installing a cascade of IR-4 centrifuges at the underground plant but not a planned third cascade of IR-6 machines. It is also operating 5,060 IR-1 machines at the underground plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-feeds-uranium-gas-into-advanced-centrifuges-underground-report/story-3RKD9qzuMK6W9AuDKOnmlN.html

Some came from a “high-priority lane” of firms referred by politicians, health professionals and government officials, which were considered more credible and processed more quickly than others.The auditor said in a sample of cases it studied, “departments failed to document key decisions, such as why they chose a particular supplier or used emergency procurement, and failed to document their consideration of risks, including how they had identified and managed any potential conflicts of interest.”It said in some cases documents to support decisions were missing, or contracts were awarded after the work had already been done.

18-11-2020||World||Thailand approves legislation to pave way to legalize abortions||Thailand’s cabinet has approved amending existing legislation to pave the way to legalizing abortion in the Southeast Asian nation. The change in law, agreed to by the cabinet came in on Tuesday and aims to allow women to seek and have abortions up to 12 weeks into their pregnancy. According to Rachada Dhanadirek, a government spokesperson, any attempts to curtail the termination of pregnancy within the 12 week time-frame would be deemed “an infringement of women’s rights.” How will the amendment in the law help? Rachada said, “The law amendment will support and protect women’s and their unborn children’s rights equally and remove women’s motivations to seek out illegal abortions, which are not safe.” The official statement issued by the government said that the cabinet found the existing laws to be a “restriction on women’s rights” and contradictory to the “the constitution which dictates people have freedom over their lives and bodies.” Read more | Thai Parliament to vote on constitution as protests turn violentWhat are Thailand’s existing laws with respect to abortions? Thailand’s existing laws do not allow terminations at all unless the woman’s life is at risk or the pregnancy is a result of rape. Currently, women seeking a termination can receive a prison sentence of up to three years and a 60,000 baht ($1,980) fine. Under the proposed amendment the punishment for abortions beyond the 12-week limit would also be lower -- up to six months in prison, or a 10,000 baht fine, or both, according to the statement.What will happen next?

18-11-2020||World||CIA, FBI directors could be next on Trump firing line. Here’s why||US President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired a top cybersecurity official who had rejected his baseless claims of electoral fraud. Trump took to Twitter to announce that Chris Krebs has been “terminated” as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) chief for his “highly inaccurate” statement on the security of the elections. “The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 Election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud - including dead people voting,” claimed Trump, which was promptly flagged by the micro-blogging platform as “disputed”.The US president recently fired Mark Esper as Defense Secretary as the duo was at loggerheads over the issues of troops withdrawal from Afghanistan and deployment of the military during Black Lives Matter protests. Trump, through his actions, has made it clear that officials contradicting him on key issues will be shown the door.Also Read | Donald Trump fires US election security official who rejected fraud claimsUS media reports suggest that FBI director Christopher Wray could be the next on Trump’s firing line due to his testimony during congressional hearings on Russian interference and alleged electoral fraud. Wray had confirmed that Russia was using a range of measures to “primarily denigrate” Joe Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia “establishment.” He also denied any evidence indicating widespread voter fraud, a claim regularly repeated by Trump ahead of the elections.Last month, the FBI Agents Association sent open letters to Trump and Biden, urging the next president to allow Wray to continue until his 10-year term ends in 2027. “This country needs stability in leadership of the Bureau during these challenging times, and creating upheavals at the Bureau after the elections can only undermine the goal of protecting the safety and security of our country,” the organisation wrote.According to a CNN report, Trump and his allies have become increasingly frustrated by CIA Director Gina Haspel for constantly pushing back on declassification of documents related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential elections. Haspel was also reportedly not part of Trump’s in-person daily intelligence briefing on Friday, which was organised by the Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cia-fbi-directors-could-be-next-on-trump-firing-line-here-s-why/story-DFO0vw3zRrgyRIfS9OGYcM.html
18-11-2020||World||EU parliamentarians raise concern over violence against women in Pakistan||Several Members of European Parliament (MEP) raised concern regarding cases of violence against women in Pakistan following a brutal motorway rape case in Lahore in September.Several media outlets reported on the ‘motorway case’, where a woman was sexually assaulted in front of her children while waiting for assistance in her car on the highway in Lahore. The Lahore capital city police officer stoked controversy by victim-blaming the woman, causing an international outcry.On Monday, the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (VP/HR), Josep Borrell highlighted that the EU Head of Delegation to Pakistan condemned the specific case raised by the Honourable Members publicly on September 13, 2020, said EU Chronicle in a press release.EU Chronicle stated in the release that on September 28, Members of the European Parliament Samira Rafaela, Karen Melchior, Abir Al-Sahlani, Radka Maxova, Sylvie Brunet, Irene Tolleret, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, Hilde Vautmans, and Susana Solis Perez, all of the Renew Political Group, sent a parliamentary question to the VP/HR Josep Borrell.The Parliamentarians asked Borrell whether he condemned the cases of sexual violence that happened in September 2020 in Pakistan and about the concrete actions he will be planning to take to ensure that any current and future plans to engage with Pakistan are based on the promotion of women’s rights and the elimination of all forms of violence against women.Lastly, the Renew representatives inquired about the steps the Commission and the VP/HR “will take to make all funding programmes for Pakistan conditional on progress in women’s rights by making gender mainstreaming one of its funding objectives?”Read more | Abu Dhabi puts the squeeze on Imran Khan, Pakistanis in UAE feel the heatAccording to EU Chronicle, on November 16, Borrell officially responded on behalf of the European Commission.He stated that ‘human rights, including women’s rights, are raised regularly in the EU’s bilateral dialogue with Pakistan’ and he also reported that the most recent exchange took place at the 6th EU-Pakistan Political Dialogue on 6 October 2020.Borrell further elaborated that violence against women, including rape, was raised by the European Union in the Sub Group of Democracy, Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights to the 10th EU-Pakistan Joint Commission on November 13-14, 2019, adding that measures taken to prevent violence against women will be followed up in the 11th EU-Pakistan Joint Commission.In his closing statements, Borrell stated that gender mainstreaming is integrated in the EU’s projects within Pakistan, including all rural development, education and government projects, and stated that ending violence against women and girls will remain high on the agenda in the next EU Gender Action Plan.The Lahore incident heightened calls for action to address sexual violence in the country. The brutal incident came after a five-year-old in Karachi was raped and then set ablaze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-parliamentarians-raise-concern-over-violence-against-women-in-pakistan/story-7LHT0p7yquZQbLw5ReHMfN.html
18-11-2020||World||North American forum warns against China’s rise, wants India to become UNSC permanent member||North America’s leading strategic and security forum has issued a handbook for democracies aimed at understanding the challenges that China poses to them, and it recommends supporting the inclusion of India as the sixth permanent member of the UN Security Council, strengthening the Quad, and creating a global free-trade zone for democracies.The 101-page handbook, titled China vs. Democracy: The Greatest Game, is also a major topic for discussion at the 2020 edition of the three-day Halifax International Security Forum, which is headquartered in Halifax, Nova Scotia in Canada. The forum is traditionally hosted by Canada’s defence minister, in this case Harjit Sajjan. The handbook was based on feedback from nearly 250 global leaders.“The year 2020 witnessed a paradigm shift in the democratic world’s understanding of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),” said the forum’s president Peter Van Praagh. “(President) Xi Jinping’s China is now the most powerful authoritarian state in history. HFX’s Handbook for Democracies gives policy makers, journalists, businesses, and members of the public a comprehensive guide to what we are up against.”Van Praagh expanded on this theme in the introduction to the handbook, as he noted that the forum had flagged the Chinese challenge for the past decade but it was not till this year “with the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic that began in Wuhan, China, and all the uncertainty that accompanied it, that people around the world began to understand the real threat - to our supply chains, to international organisations, to the open exchange of information, to the protection of confidential information, and to freedom of the seas and skies”.The handbook states that China is “intent on undermining democracy abroad”, including India, and focuses on the role that the Quad - formed in 2007 by the US, India, Japan, and Australia - can play in this regard. It says, “The Quad’s rebirth can be seen as one of the first concrete steps on the road to clarity about Beijing’s intentions and the need to check them.”It also underscores the need for India to get a higher profile on the global stage, including a seat on the UNSC. “India does not have the slightest interest in being a ‘balancing power’ for anybody apart from India. It may well be emerging as a crucial balancer against Chinese power, and this would be in the interests of the entire democratic world… India is looking after its own interests. Fortunately, India’s interests and the rest of the democratic world’s converge in many areas,” the handbook says.It adds that “the world’s democracies should push for India to become the sixth permanent member of the United Nations Security Council”.It also prescribed as a “long-term ambition” the creation of a “global free-trade zone for democracies”. With the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and European Union’s single market as “natural building blocks”, this should be “extended to include the United Kingdom, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and all other Indo-Pacific democracies, as well as democracies in Africa and Central and South America”.The 2020 edition of the forum, which begins on Friday, will feature a plenary of the topic China vs Democracy: The Greatest Game, and while its agenda includes the impact of the new US administration led by President-elect Joe Biden, it will also discuss topics such as Himalayan Heat: Sino-Indian Friction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-american-forum-warns-against-china-s-rise-wants-india-to-become-unsc-permanent-member/story-rvgjA6aFLKk5wZnX82Xc9I.html

Whenever the virus has been detected on frozen packages, China has suspended imports from that particular company for at least a week.It was during a similar check that local Chinese authorities reported two new cases of coronavirus-contaminated cold-chain imports on Wednesday, with two Indian frozen pomfret packages and one Russian frozen salmon packaging sample tested positive for the virus, General Administration of Customs of China said in a statement on Wednesday.The batch of Indian pomfret entered the country at Fuzhou port in eastern China’s Fujian province.A total of 2,500 packages were transported to a cold storage facility on Sunday. According to the Chinese CDC, 2,117 pieces are still in stock, and 383 pieces have been sold.“All related goods have been sealed up and have not entered the terminal market,” a state media report said.The report added that all involved cold storage workers, cold storage staff and related contacts have been put in centralised isolation and medical observation after nucleic acid testing.No details of the exporting Indian company were given in the statement. Also on Wednesday, Chinese customs announced that a nucleic acid test on one frozen salmon packaging sample imported from Russia came back positive.Last week, three frozen cuttlefish packages imported from a Kolkata-based company tested positive for the coronavirus.State media reports said that wasn’t the first time that frozen food imported from India was found to have the virus upon reaching China.Earlier this month, packages of frozen hairtail, a fish, tested positive in Taiyuan the capital of Shanxi province in north China.The coronavirus was also detected on imported seafood and meat packages from other countries, according to state media reports.“China earlier reported two cases of coronavirus-contaminated imported frozen products on Sunday, one in Sishui, East China’s Shandong province, and the other in Xi’an, Northwest China’s Shaanxi province, pushing the number of cold-chain virus contaminations to at least 10 provincial regions in the country since June,” the tabloid Global Times reported on Wednesday.Since June, more than 10 provinces and cities, including Beijing, Liaoning, Anhui, Fujian and Jiangxi, have discovered coronavirus-positive samples taken from imported frozen food or food packaging.China’s State Council issued guidelines on November 9 on cold-chain food disinfection regulating that imported frozen products must be traceable and go through closed-loop management throughout the entire process of export.Until Wednesday, nearly 3,700 imported Covid-19 cases had been reported on the mainland.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases stands at 86,369 while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-detects-coronavirus-on-more-seafood-imports-from-india/story-33VhqWGzZQ3tXaufG1DlJN.html

We’ll continue to work together to bring it to its full potential.”The exchange of views came even as India joined the Canada-led Ministerial Coordination Group on Covid-19 earlier this month, with Champagne appreciating the “critical role” that India is playing with regard to the requirements globally for pharma products needed to combat the coronavirus disease.Also participating in the virtual meet on Wednesday were India’s high commissioner to Ottawam Ajay Bisaria, and his counterpart in New Delhi, Nadir Patel.Discussions at the dialogue included examining “bilateral relations between Canada and India and explore multilateral initiatives in the era of Covid-19 recovery” and “the new geo-economics of the Indo-Pacific region and digital cooperation between Canada and India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jaishankar-and-his-canadian-counterpart-discuss-bilateral-ties-cooperation-on-covid-19-response/story-fr4sEoIi44XnVgmzxvP6qN.html
18-11-2020||World||NATO chief warns of high price if troops leave Afghanistan||NATO could pay a heavy price for leaving Afghanistan too early, its chief warned Tuesday after a US official said President Donald Trump is expected to withdraw a significant number of American troops from the conflict-ravaged country in the coming weeks.NATO has fewer than 12,000 troops from dozens of nations in Afghanistan helping to train and advise the country’s national security forces. More than half are not US troops, but the 30-nation alliance relies heavily on the United States for transport, air support, logistics and other assistance. It’s unlikely that NATO could even wind down its operation without US help.“We now face a difficult decision. We have been in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and no NATO ally wants to stay any longer than necessary. But at the same time, the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement Tuesday.He said Afghanistan still “risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organize attacks on our homelands. And ISIS (Islamic State) could rebuild in Afghanistan the terror caliphate it lost in Syria and Iraq.”The US decision comes just days after Trump installed a new slate of loyalists in top Pentagon positions who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in war zones. The expected plans would cut US troop numbers almost in half by Jan. 15, leaving 2,500 troops in Afghanistan.US officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawal and that an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders.NATO took charge of the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003, two years after a U.S-led coalition ousted the Taliban for harboring former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. In 2014, it began to train and advise Afghan security forces, but has gradually pulled troops out in line with a US-brokered peace deal.Stoltenberg said that “even with further US reductions, NATO will continue its mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces. We are also committed to funding them through 2024.”NATO’s security operation in Afghanistan is its biggest and most ambitious undertaking ever. It was launched after the military alliance activated its mutual defense clause — known as Article 5 — for the first time, mobilizing all the allies in support of the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.“Hundreds of thousands of troops from Europe and beyond have stood shoulder to shoulder with American troops in Afghanistan, and over 1,000 of them have paid the ultimate price,” Stoltenberg said.“We went into Afghanistan together. And when the time is right, we should leave together in a coordinated and orderly way. I count on all NATO allies to live up to this commitment, for our own security,” he said.The United States is by far NATO’s biggest and most influential ally. It spends more on defense than all the other countries combined. But Trump’s term in office has marked a particularly tumultuous time for the organization. He has routinely berated other leaders for not spending enough on defense, and has pulled out of security agreements that European allies and Canada consider important for their security, such as the Iran nuclear deal and the Open Skies aerial surveillance pact.French President Emmanuel Macron said last year that NATO was suffering from “brain death,” in part due to a lack of US leadership.Stoltenberg has refrained from publicly criticizing Trump or his decisions since Trump came to power in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-chief-warns-of-high-price-if-troops-leave-afghanistan/story-JelqT2wYo6x2TJWtcnXnmM.html
18-11-2020||World||US government announces troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, Iraq||The US government on Tuesday announced that the number of American troops stationed in Afghanistan will be cut by half by mid-January, drawing criticism from both Republicans and Democrats who warned that it would be a “mistake” and could imperil peace efforts in the country. By January 15, five days before the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the US, the number of American forces in Afghanistan will come down from the current level of 5,000 to 2,500. The number of soldiers in Iraq will also be reduced, from the existing 3,000 to 2,500.The Trump administration’s decision comes as part of the Republican president’s much debated pledge to bring America’s “endless wars” to an end.Citing US casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq - a total of 6,900 killed and 52,000 wounded - acting secretary of defence Christopher Miller told reporters at the department of defence, “I am formally announcing that we will implement President Trump’s orders to continue our repositioning of forces from those two countries.”Miller was not accompanied at the announcement by Mark Milley, the chairman of joint chiefs of staff, who had earlier dismissed reports about troop reductions as speculation. Miller also did not refer to his predecessor Mark Esper’s objection to the cuts as conveyed to the White House in a confidential memo.Robert O’Brien, the National Security Adviser, told reporters that Trump hoped “that they will all come home safely - and in their entirety” by May.That was an unusual projection to make as president-elect Biden would be in charge then and it would be his administration’s decision. There was no word from Biden or his team yet on the troop withdrawals.Criticism of the move came swiftly, and from both the parties. Even close Republican allies were outraged. “I think it’s extremely important here in the next couple of months not to have any earthshaking changes with regard to defence and foreign policy,” Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the US Senate, told reporters. “I think a precipitous drawdown in either Afghanistan or Iraq would be a mistake.”Tammy Duckworth, a Democratic Senator who has served in Afghanistan and lost both her legs to combat wounds in Iraq, warned of adverse impact of the move on peace efforts. “We all want our troops to be brought home safely, but this announcement is a mistake. At a time when we are finally seeing serious peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, Donald Trump is unilaterally taking one of our best bargaining chips off the table - and getting nothing in return.”Intra-Afghan peace talks started in September as part of a conditions-based agreement signed by the United States with the Taliban in February. But they are currently stalled due to disputes procedural issues.“Trump never paid much attention to advice of experts and is now just trying to do what he thinks his base wants,” said Hussain Haqqani, former Pakistan ambassador to the US and an expert on the region, at Hudson Institute, a think tank, referencing Trump’s campaign promise from 2016 to end “endless wars”. “He sees (troop) withdrawal from Afghanistan not as a national security problem to be resolved in a methodical manner, but just as a talking point at his rallies. Like many of his other decisions, this will not be without cost.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-announces-troop-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-iraq/story-bxqDuBMmmxMxdMwzw7Zd8H.html
18-11-2020||World||Nancy Pelosi likely to be nominated for 2 more years as Speaker||House Democrats seem certain to nominate Nancy Pelosi for two more years as speaker, but she’ll be leading a smaller majority divided along ideological lines as it tries shepherding President-elect Joe Biden’s agenda toward enactment.Click here for full US Election 2020 coveragePelosi, D-Calif., faced no announced rivals for the post Wednesday as the chamber’s Democrats planned their first-ever virtual leadership elections in response to the pandemic. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and No. 3 party leader Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., were also on track to retain their positions.“Let us all be advocates for unity in the Democratic party, where our values are opportunity and community,” Pelosi wrote to Democrats this week.The first female speaker, Pelosi has won wide acclaim among Democrats as a leading foe of outgoing President Donald Trump in battles over impeachment, immigration and health care. She’s given as good as she’s gotten from the insult-prone president, sometimes directly to his face, prompting him to call her “Crazy Nancy” and supporters to create memes and action figures honoring her.But with some votes still being tallied in this month’s elections, 10 incumbent House Democrats have been defeated, dashing expectations of adding seats and damaging party morale. Democrats were on track to have perhaps a 222-213 majority, one of the smallest in decades.This has sparked finger-pointing, with progressives saying the party failed to adequately win over minority and young liberal voters. Moderates say that they were hurt by far-left initiatives like defunding the police and that Pelosi should have struck a preelection stimulus deal with the White House.Besides bitterness over their election setback, many Democrats continue calling for fresh leadership. Pelosi and Hoyer have been No. 1 and 2 House Democrats since 2003, while Clyburn rose to the No. 3 ranks in 2007. Pelosi and Clyburn are 80, Hoyer is 81.Yet with no plausible rival, Pelosi seemed headed to what would be her seventh and eight years as speaker. She served the first four during the 2000s until Republicans recaptured the House majority in the tea party election of 2010, a conservative uprising that presaged the rise of Trump.In one indication of her strength, one conservative Democrat who’s opposed Pelosi before said he expected her to be reelected and said he might support her this time.“I think she gets it,” Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., who said he’s spoken to Pelosi about the need for a moderate agenda, said in an interview. “She may be the bulwark against the extreme far-left.”Schrader said far-left progressives have been “toxic to our brand” by favoring policies he said cost jobs. “We can’t continue to talk down to people and only talk about identity politics,” he said.House Democrats were also voting Wednesday and Thursday on lesser leadership posts.Pelosi needs only a majority of the approximately 222 House Democrats to be renominated as the party’s candidate for speaker. It was possible Wednesday’s vote would be by acclamation, forgoing the secret ballot roll call set by party rules.“I think it’s smooth sailing,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a Pelosi supporter. “We’ve maintained our majority, but it’s slender. But I don’t think anybody would be foolish enough to take advantage of the situation.”When the new Congress convenes in early January and the House elects its new speaker, Pelosi will need the majority of votes cast by both parties. Since nearly all Republicans are expected to back their leader, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Pelosi can afford to lose only a few Democrats.When Pelosi nailed down the support she needed to become speaker in 2018, she said she’d agreed to a proposal limiting her to serving in the job only through 2022. Several lawmakers and aides said memories of that commitment could lessen her opposition this time.Also potentially helping Pelosi is the decision by Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., to step aside as chair of House Democrats’ political arm.Some Democrats have faulted the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for insufficiently protecting moderate Democratic incumbents from swing districts. They’re also unhappy that the committee did not detect the huge numbers of GOP voters Trump drew to the polls — which was missed by Republican and independent pollsters alike.“Having Trump on the ticket in ’20 was very different from not having him on the ticket in ’18,” said Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., another Pelosi supporter.When Democrats won back the House in 2018, 32 of them voted against Pelosi’s nomination as speaker. But that was a larger majority than this one, giving her more margin for error then.By the time the full House elected her in January 2019, she’d whittled down her opposition and just 13 Democrats voted against her or voted “present.”Of the 13 Democrats who opposed Pelosi in 2019, two have been defeated and one, Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, became a Republican. That leaves 10 Democrats who voted against her, though another, New York’s Anthony Brindisi, may still lose his election.Pelosi has pushed bills through the House — they died in the GOP-run Senate — embodying Democratic priorities overhauling ethics and campaign finance laws, lowering health care costs and rebuilding infrastructure. She’s also been a prodigious fundraiser for candidates.To prevent lawmakers from crowding unsafely into one room, Democrats’ leadership candidates were delivering remarks to scattered lawmakers using Zoom, the online meeting platform. Republicans met in a crowded hotel ballroom Tuesday and reelected their current leadership team.Democrats’ votes were being cast on a new app designed to keep the process secure by using encryption.In a test run Tuesday, Democrats voted on their favorite all-time musician. Their choice by a wide margin: the Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nancy-pelosi-likely-to-be-nominated-for-2-more-years-as-speaker/story-JabGjKKE38ZwkcseYJiWsN.html

The Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization to Lucira Health Inc.’s rapid-result All-In-One Test Kit, according to a statement from the government agency Tuesday.What is the Lucira test?The Lucira test is currently authorized for prescription use only, and the FDA said health-care providers are required to report all results to the government. The Lucira test works by swirling the self-collected sample swab in a vial that is then placed in the test unit. The results can be read directly from the test unit’s light-up display. In addition to home use, the product is also authorized for use in doctor’s offices, hospitals and emergency rooms.Read more | Toilet paper limits, empty shelves are back as Covid-19 surgesALSO WATCH | ‘More people may die if…’: Biden urges Trump to coordinate on tackling Covid How is this different from other Covid-19 tests?

The approval comes at a time when the country -- which has the the world’s largest number of total cases, at more than 11 million -- is fighting a fierce resurgence of infections. It could also help take some strain off testing labs that are being overwhelmed by demand.

Lawmakers will vote on how to amend the charter, one of the key demands of pro-democracy groups, who are also calling for monarchy reform and the resignation of Prime minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha. On Tuesday, a rally near the parliament turned violent after the police fired water cannons mixed with irritants to disperse the crowd and some pro-government supporters clashed with the protesters.The youth-led groups have called for another gathering in Bangkok on Wednesday to pressure lawmakers into considering their demand for a major rewrite of the constitution. The clashes point to an escalation in the months-long movement with pro-establishment groups too staging regular demonstrations.“If the parliament doesn’t accept the amendment that the people want, there’d be no more compromise,” Free Youth, one of the protest groups said on Facebook. It said charter should be amended to bring the monarchy under the constitution.Read more | Funds pile into Thailand as vaccine progress boosts tourism hopesThe parliament vote on charter pathway is yet another attempt at placating the protesters, who have broken long-held taboos about publicly criticizing the royal family and questioning laws that stifle discussion of the monarchy. While the lawmakers may vote to amend the charter, political analysts say changes likely won’t address all of the demands from the protesters.Thailand’s current charter has been the point of contention since its inception after Prayuth, a former army chief, took power in a 2014 coup. Protesters and critics viewed it as instrumental in helping the royalist establishment retain its grip on power with Prayuth returning as the leader after the 2019 elections. The charter allows the military-appointed Senate, whose powers protesters want scrapped, to vote for the premier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-parliament-to-vote-on-constitution-as-protests-turn-violent/story-3fwS6i2dWwnJsdORMErHYM.html

Murthy, 43, is currently one of the co-chairs of the Covid-19 advisory board of the transition. He has been a close associate of Biden on coronavirus issues.Similarly, Majumdar, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford who served as the first director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, has been a top advisor to Biden on energy related issues, the reports said.“The office, which is an incubator for nascent energy technologies, has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress, which may bode well for his chances of being confirmed by the Senate,” reported The Washington Post.Among other potential names for energy secretary are Ernest Moniz, former secretary of energy; Dan Reicher, Stanford University scholar and Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, former deputy secretary of energy.For replacing Alex Azar as Secretary of Health and Human Services, two other potential names are Mandy Cohen, secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and Michelle Lujan Grisham, New Mexico governor.Murthy was one of the public health experts who briefed Biden frequently about the pandemic during the campaign, the reports said.Murthy became the 19th US Surgeon General at the end of 2014, slightly more than a year after his nomination by President Barack Obama.His nomination had been held up in the Senate for just over a year, largely because of his view that gun violence poses a public health threat.Read more | Former US surgeon general Vivek Murthy may get key role in Biden administrationDuring his tenure, he issued a landmark report on drug and alcohol addiction, calling it “a moral test for America” and placing it among reports his predecessors had produced to draw attention to other major public health threats, such as tobacco use, AIDS, the need for physical activity.Since leaving the government, he has written and spoken out about loneliness.He was a vice admiral in the US Public Health Service’s commissioned corps and is trained in internal medicine.Majumdar is the Jay Precourt Provostial Chair Professor at Stanford University, a faculty member of the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering (by courtesy) and co-Director of the Precourt Institute for Energy, which integrates and coordinates research and education activities across all seven Schools and the Hoover Institution at Stanford.

After leaving Washington, DC and before joining Stanford, Majumdar was the Vice President for Energy at Google, where he created several energy technology initiatives, especially at the intersection of data, computing and electricity grid.President-elect Joe Biden has said that his Cabinet would be the most diverse ever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-americans-vivek-murthy-arun-majumdar-among-likely-in-biden-s-cabinet-reports/story-BwyUgu5422m26kC6Rd1ZIO.html
18-11-2020||World||South Australia imposes six-day lockdown to curb outbreak||South Australia announced a six-day lockdown to help contain a growing cluster of Covid-19 infections, imposing the nation’s strictest state-wide stay-at-home orders since the pandemic began.From midnight, only one person from each household will be allowed to leave home each day, and only for specific purposes, authorities said. Schools, universities, cafes and restaurants will close and mask-wearing will be mandatory.“Time is of the essence,” state Premier Steven Marshall said Wednesday. “And we must act swiftly and decisively, we cannot wait to see how bad this becomes.”Twenty-two people in the state capital Adelaide have been infected after a cleaner at a quarantine hotel was exposed to the virus, and health authorities say the “circuit breaker” measures are necessary to avoid a wider outbreak.Read more | Australia races to contain Adelaide virus outbreakThe state of 1.7 million people, who are spread out over a landmass five times the size of the UK, had largely eradicated community transmission of the virus after a nationwide lockdown earlier this year. The cluster, and a more severe outbreak in neighboring Victoria state that triggered a three-month lockdown in the city of Melbourne, show that ongoing vigilance is required to control the virus -- even in a nation that has been spared the scale of infections and deaths experienced in Europe and the US.Other parts of the nation have now deemed South Australia a virus hotspot and reimposed state border restrictions. That could prove a further blow to efforts to reinvigorate the tourism industry just as Australia heads into its peak summer holiday season.“There is no second chance to stop a second wave,” Marshall said. “We are at a critical point, but we will get through this.”Read more | China gives explanation for pummeling Australia on tradeFactories other than those producing food and medical products will be closed for six days, as will the construction industry.

South Australia’s economy represents around 5% of national gross domestic product. Victoria’s outbreak was also linked to quarantine hotels, where security guards failed to observe safety protocols and spread the virus back into their communities in Melbourne. Authorities in Adelaide are examining how the cleaner became infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-australia-imposes-six-day-lockdown-to-curb-outbreak/story-hQoRTYgMPmr9e07TYTnGjL.html
18-11-2020||World||Chapare virus: All about the deadly virus that can spread between humans||At a time when countries across the globe are struggling to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced that a deadly virus, which causes haemorrhagic fever like Ebola, can now also be transmitted through people.After the CDC’s announcement, sciencetimes.com quoted experts as saying that even in case of an outbreak, Chapare was unlikely to cause a pandemic on the scale of Covid-19. However, it also warned there were reasons to be alarmed about a potential Chapare outbreak.Here’s all you need to know about the Chapare haemorrhagic fever:1. The Chapare virus was first discovered in 2004 in the Bolivian province of Chapare, from where it gets its name. Though it disappeared in 2004, an outbreak last year infected at least five people.2. Some symptoms of Chapare are fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, bleeding gums, skin rash and pain. Though the virus can be transmitted through bodily fluids and even kill infected people, sciencetimes.com reported that no active cases have been recorded this year.3. In the 2019 outbreak, three out of the five people infected were health workers of whom two died, sciencetimes.com further said.4. The first sign of last year’s outbreak was found in the sample of bodily fluids initially believed by doctors to be dengue. Further tests, however, did not show any signs of dengue. Subsequently, tests were conducted for two other deadly haemorrhagic virus-yellow fever and Machupo. The results, however, were once again negative.5. The virus was finally identified as the Chapare after the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), which was in partnership with CDC, gave it a sample. CDC also developed an RT-PCR test to diagnose the virus in the future.6. It was this outbreak that showed the virus could spread from person-to-person. Additionally, experts say the virus is present in the semen of a survivor for a duration of 24 weeks or 168 days after getting infected.7. Chapare virus was also detected in rodents around the home of the first infected person. Experts, however, noted this doesn’t prove that rodents were the source of the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chapare-virus-all-about-the-deadly-virus-that-can-spread-between-humans/story-B0grsY8R7eGHarP7VQWOQJ.html
18-11-2020||World||Australia, Japan to bolster defense ties amid China’s rise||The leaders of Australia and Japan held in-person talks on Tuesday and reached a basic agreement on a bilateral defense pact that would allow their troops to work more closely, as the two US allies seek to bolster their ties to counter China’s growing assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his Japanese counterpart, Yoshihide Suga, said the legal framework, called a Reciprocal Access Agreement, would allow their troops to visit each other’s countries for training and joint operations. It would also enhance their inter-operability and cooperation, they said.The deal is the first of its kind for Japan since its 1960 status of forces agreement with the United States, which set the terms for the basing of about 50,000 American troops to operate in and around Japan under the Japan-US security pact.The two leaders also agreed to cooperate in tackling climate change, including “working together for a lower emission and zero emission future, Morrison told a joint news conference.He called the defense agreement a “landmark” development for the two countries, which are both allies of the US while maintaining significant trade with China. Australia and Japan also have very strong and positive relations with all countries in the Indo-Pacific, Morrison said.Japan is committed to maintaining and deepening its 60-year-old alliance with the US as the cornerstone of its diplomacy and security, but has in recent years sought to complement its regional defense by stepping up cooperation with others, especially Australia, amid growing Chinese maritime activity.Japan officially limits itself to self-defense and bans first strikes under its post World War II pacifist constitution, but increased its defense role and spending under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Abe pushed for greater military cooperation and weapons compatibility with the US as Japanese forces increasingly work alongside US troops. He also increased purchases of costly American stealth fighters and other weapons.Suga, who took office in September after Abe resigned due to ill health, is continuing his predecessor’s diplomatic and security policies.Japan considers Australia to be a semi-ally and the two countries signed a defense cooperation agreement in 2007, a first for Japan with a country other than the US The two nations agreed on the sharing of military supplies in 2013 and expanded the deal in 2017 to include munitions after Japan eased restrictions on arms equipment transfers.Suga said Japan and Australia are “special strategic partners” that are both committed to fundamental values such as freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and are working together to achieve peace and stability in the region.Suga said the new agreement underpins their determination to contribute to regional peace and will (asterisk)elevate our security cooperation to a new level.”In a joint statement, Suga and Morrison expressed “serious concerns about the situation” in the South and East China Seas and “strong opposition” to militarizing disputed islands and other unilateral attempts to change the status quo, without identifying China — signaling their sensitivity toward their biggest trading partner.Australian and Japanese interests are closely aligned but not identical and their approach to China and other countries in Asia differ, says Shiro Armstrong, director of the Australia-Japan Research Center at the Australian National University.“Deft and strategic diplomacy and cooperation will be needed to manage and navigate the China-US relationship,” he wrote in the East Asia Forum online research platform. “Australia and Japan face challenges that require multilateral solutions.”Japan has initiated a vision of economic and security cooperation called the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” as a counter to China’s influence, and recently hosted talks among the foreign ministers of four countries known as the Quad — Japan, the US, Australia and India.Those four nations are now seeking to add more countries, from Southeast Asia and beyond, that share concerns about China’s growing assertiveness in the region.Tuesday’s basic agreement on a Japan-Australia defense pact comes as the navies of the Quad nations hold a joint exercise in the Northern Arabian Sea seen as part of their regional initiative to counter China.China defends its actions in the regional seas as peaceful and denies violating international rules. It has criticized the Quad as an “Asian NATO” to counter China.Despite its pacifist constitution, Japan’s defense spending ranks among the top 10 in the world, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Australia is among the top 15.At the end of their news conference, Morrison presented Suga with a set of medals from the 2000 Sydney Olympics and wished Japan success with hosting the 2021 Tokyo Games, which were delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-japan-to-bolster-defense-ties-amid-china-s-rise/story-7RmOYiHvMHbMET4mN6lhrJ.html

Urging the Trump administration to ensure a smooth transition of power after a close win by Democrat Joe Biden, Obama asked leaders to honour the electoral process, “just as sitting presidents have done throughout the history.”“I want to urge all Americans, especially our nation’s leaders, regardless of party, to honor the electoral process and do your part to encourage a smooth transition of power, just as sitting presidents have done throughout our history,” she said in an Instagram post. “I was hurt and disappointed—but the votes had been counted and Donald Trump had won,” she wrote referring to Trump’s victory in the last presidential elections. “The American people had spoken. And one of the great responsibilities of the presidency is to listen when they do,” she added. A post shared by Michelle Obama (@michelleobama)Recalling the transition process, she wrote: “My husband and I instructed our staffs to do what George and Laura Bush had done for us: run a respectful, seamless transition of power—one of the hallmarks of American democracy.” “We invited the folks from the president-elect’s team into our offices and prepared detailed memos for them, offering what we’d learned over the past eight years,” she added.Michelle Obama also said that the process was not easy for her as Trump had spread “racist lies” about her husband and the former president Barack Obama and her family which she said, “wasn’t something I was ready to forgive.”Also Read | Donald Trump to nominate bank watchdog in potential blow to Joe Biden“I have to be honest and say that none of this was easy for me. Donald Trump had spread racist lies about my husband that had put my family in danger. That wasn’t something I was ready to forgive.

Our love of country requires us to respect the results of an election even when we don’t like them or wish it had gone differently.” “The presidency doesn’t belong to anyone individual or any one party,” she also said.The criticism by Michelle Obama comes as Trump has refused to concede defeat in the recently held US presidential elections.

18-11-2020||World||Twitter launches disappearing tweets called Fleets that vanish in a day||Twitter is launching tweets that disappear in 24 hours called “Fleets” globally, echoing social media sites like Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram that already have disappearing posts.The company says the ephemeral tweets, which it calls “fleets” because of their fleeting nature, are designed to allay the concerns of new users who might be turned off by the public and permanent nature of normal tweets.Fleets can’t be retweeted and they won’t have “likes.” People can respond to them, but the replies show up as direct messages to the original tweeter, not as a public response, turning any back-and-forth into a private conversation instead of a public discussion.Twitter tested the feature in Brazil, Italy, India, and South Korea, before rolling it out globally.Fleets are a “lower pressure” way to communicate “fleeting thoughts” as opposed to permanent tweets, Twitter executives Joshua Harris, design director, and Sam Haveson, product manager, said in a blog post.The news comes the same day Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced questions from a Senate Judiciary Committee about how they handled disinformation surrounding the presidential election. Both sites have stepped up action taken against disinformation. Zuckerberg and Dorsey promised lawmakers last month that they would aggressively guard their platforms from being manipulated by foreign governments or used to incite violence around the election results — and they followed through with high-profile steps that angered Trump and his supporters.The new “Fleets” feature is reminiscent of Instagram and Facebook “stories” and Snapchat’s snaps, which let users post short-lived photos and messages. Such features are increasingly popular with social media users looking for smaller groups and more private chats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-launches-disappearing-tweets-called-fleets-that-vanish-in-a-day/story-JydlBeBoMivxFURs6z5apL.html

The people familiar with the matter said about 5,000 Pakistani inmates are housed in Al Sweihan Jail in Abu Dhabi alone.It is likely that the UAE could impose tighter visa norms for Pakistani nationals who wish to travel to the Emirates for employment. HT learns that Pakistani residents are finding it difficult to renew Resident Permits, and there has been a buzz about deportation, although no reports of a large-scale exercise to this effect have emerged.ALSO WATCH | After polls, protests erupt in Gilgit-Baltistan against Imran Khan’s PTI HT also learns that the Pakistani Ambassador in Abu Dhabi, Ghulam Dastgir, recently met senior leaders of the ruling establishment of the UAE in this regard — but was told to back off.Also Read: Nawaz Sharif crosses Army’s redline in battle with Imran Khan. Pushback beginsInterestingly, while the immediate trigger may be Khan’s comments, some of the UAE’s moves appear to have been prompted by the findings of its investigation into the 2017 attack in Kandahar in which five UAE diplomats died. The people cited in the first instance said the UAE investigators concluded that the Haqqani Network was behind the attack, and that Pakistan’s all-powerful Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency was also directly involved. Back then, Islamabad’s immediate reaction was to blame Iran for the attack.The developments in the UAE’s relationship with Pakistan also need to be seen in the context of Saudi Arabia’s ties with Pakistan. Islamabad’s efforts to involve West Asian nations in issues concerning its relationship with New Delhi haven’t gone down well in both countries, the people familiar with the matter added.Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi warned the Saudi-led Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in August that if it did not convene a meeting of the OIC’s Council of Foreign Ministers to discuss India’s nullification of Article 370 in J&K, Pakistan would go ahead to call a meeting of Islamic countries that would stand by it on the Kashmir issue. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are also locked in tough negotiations for repayment of debt. In 2018, with Islamabad facing a current accounts crisis, the Saudis had extended Pakistan a $6.2 billion package, which included $3 billion in loans, and oil on deferred payments worth $3.2 billion. In addition to calling in the loans, Riyadh has frozen the oil credit facility extended to Pakistan.Also Read: Pak’s ‘dossier’ on India is a gamble. 4 reasons why Imran Khan took the risk | AnalysisAnd recently, Saudi Arabia asked the Pakistani Embassy in Riyadh to not hold any public event to commemorate what it observes as “Kashmir Black Day” (October 27) .The worsening relationships with the UAE and Saudi Arabia should worry Pakistan, which has for years, survived on support from West Asia. It is this support that has prevented its isolation, despite enough evidence of its involvement in fostering terror groups, and using them to achieve its own ends. Loss of support from these countries will not only hurt Pakistan economically but may also leave it without too many friends even in the Muslim world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-saudi-now-uae-is-tightening-the-screws-on-imran-khan-government/story-zvwG5YEkOQpYicVVXZzfpI.html
18-11-2020||World||A lost dog’s journey across the Canadian border and back||A lost dog’s journey across the Canadian border and back was complicated by coronavirus restrictions limiting movement from a town on one side of the St John River to a Maine town on the other.Diamond, a German shepherd, escaped from her home in New Brunswick on Saturday and crossed a border bridge into Fort Kent, Maine, where coronavirus restrictions prevented her caretakers from following, the Bangor Daily News reported.The owner, Paryse Michaud, was at her daughter’s hockey tournament several hours away when she got the news that the 17-month-old shepherd had escaped from their home in Clair, New Brunswick. Michaud’s father was looking after the dog when she escaped, the newspaper reported.Michaud posted a plea for help on Facebook, saying the dog had crossed the border.Over the next six hours, Michaud received updates from people in Maine tracking the dog, the newspaper reported. A friend found the dog in a garage and coordinated with other friends on the Canadian side for a handoff.Finally, Michaud got a text with a photo of the dog and Annik Sirois, a family friend, in a car on the Canadian side of the border.Diamond was united with Michaud and her family on Sunday after being handed off at a border station, the newspaper reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-lost-dog-s-journey-across-the-canadian-border-and-back/story-XPcxIlykMrK2SulxvDvAnO.html
18-11-2020||World||Donald Trump to nominate bank watchdog in potential blow to Joe Biden||President Donald Trump signaled he intends to nominate the acting Comptroller of the Currency to a new five-year term, potentially complicating plans the Biden administration has to impose tougher regulations on Wall Street banks.In a Tuesday statement, the White House said it intends to submit Brian Brooks’ name to the Senate for confirmation. The highly unusual move -- coming just weeks before what’s likely the end of Trump’s time in office -- could force President-elect Joe Biden to rely on never-used legal authority to try to remove Brooks and replace him with a more aggressive watchdog.Though the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is a division of the Treasury Department, it’s outside of the Treasury secretary’s direct control. Still, the law says a comptroller can be ousted by the president “upon reasons to be communicated by him to the Senate” -- a power that’s gone untested.Most of the major regulations for US banks are written and approved in collaboration among the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the OCC. Having Trump people atop any of those agencies could have a major impact on how much rulemaking could be done by Biden’s apointees.The FDIC is already expected to be run by Chairman Jelena McWilliams, a Trump pick, until 2023, and Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles can stay in his role until late next year. The OCC was thought to be the only slot immediately open for Biden to start remaking banking policy.Brooks wouldn’t have much time to be confirmed before the president-elect is sworn in on Jan. 20. Brooks must face a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee and needs to be approved by that panel before his nomination could be considered by the full Senate.It’s unclear whether Trump and Senate Republicans could organize all of that and marshal enough votes. They’ve already been stymied in the controversial confirmation process of Fed board nominee Judy Shelton, as Republicans concluded Tuesday that they lacked sufficient backing to advance her nomination.Brooks, who became interim head of the OCC in May, has leveraged experience he gained at San Francisco-based cryptocurrency company Coinbase Inc. and other firms to push a financial technology agenda. He was also the former top lawyer and a board member at Fannie Mae.“If confirmed, I will work ceaselessly to ensure the agency continues to fulfill its critical mission,” Brooks said in a Tuesday statement.While the Fed is generally considered the most powerful of Wall Street’s regulators, the OCC has the most on-the-ground examiners working inside major banks. It also imposes some of the biggest sanctions on lenders that are accused of violating rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-nominate-bank-watchdog-in-potential-blow-to-joe-biden/story-NUBNMcb9iKliScgRuLdDzM.html
18-11-2020||World||US to drop drugs case against ex-Mexican defence minister||US prosecutors will drop drug charges against ex-Mexican defence minister Salvador Cienfuegos and turn over the investigation to Mexico, saying “sensitive” foreign policy considerations outweighed the interest in pressing the case.The surprise decision to dismiss the charges in the politically explosive case was announced in a joint statement on Tuesday from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and Mexico’s attorney general’s office.“The United States has determined that sensitive and important foreign policy considerations outweigh the government’s interest in pursuing the prosecution of the defendant,” prosecutors from the US Eastern District of New York said in a court document unsealed on Tuesday.US authorities said the 72-year-old ex-general, accused of using his power to protect a faction of the Beltran-Leyva drugs cartel in Mexico while ordering operations against its rivals, had agreed to voluntarily return to Mexico if the US case against him was thrown out.Cienfuegos, who served as head of the military and was former President Enrique Pena Nieto’s top defense official from 2012 to 2018, pleaded not guilty earlier this month to the charges following his October arrest in the Los Angeles airport.After a hearing on Wednesday in a Brooklyn federal court, where the judge is expected to sign off on the prosecutors’ request, Cienfuegos will likely be transported back to Mexico in the custody of a US Marshal, the court documents show.The arrest of Cienfuegos, who for years worked closely with US counterparts on highly sensitive cross-border criminal matters, put a severe strain on security ties between the two countries.The Mexican government was not forewarned of the investigation or arrest, which angered Mexican sensitivities at the highest level. His arrest shocked Mexico’s security establishment, given his close ties to a range of current senior officials.In retaliation, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador publicly threatened to review cooperation agreements that establish how US Drug Enforcement Administration agents operate in the country.In remarks to reporters shortly after the announcement, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard described the dropping of the US case as unprecedented and a sign of respect for both Mexican sovereignty as well as the Mexican military.Ebrard said the decision meant that security cooperation between the two nations could proceed.He said the Department of Justice had provided Mexican authorities with evidence in the case and committed to support the investigation led by Mexican authorities.Neither US prosecutors or defense lawyers for Cienfuegos could immediately be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-drop-drugs-case-against-ex-mexican-defence-minister/story-PZ3HAGGfoA11YahJ5xzi8J.html
18-11-2020||World||Toilet paper limits, empty shelves are back as Covid-19 surges||Looking for toilet paper? Good luck.A surge of new coronavirus cases in the US is sending people back to stores to stockpile again, leaving shelves bare and forcing retailers to put limits on purchases.Walmart said Tuesday it’s having trouble keeping up with demand for cleaning supplies in some stores. Supermarket chains Kroger and Publix are limiting how much toilet paper and paper towels shoppers can buy after demand spiked recently. And Amazon is sold out of most disinfectant wipes and paper towels.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage A similar scene played out back in March, when the pandemic first hit and people hunkered down in their homes.But Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the Consumer Brands Association, formerly the Grocery Manufacturers Association, said he doesn’t expect things to be as bad this go-around since lockdowns are being handled on a regional basis and everyone is better prepared.“A more informed consumer combined with a more informed manufacturer and a more informed retailer should provide all of us with a greater sense of ease and ensure we can meet this growing demand, “ Freeman said.The biggest supply issue seems to be paper products: 21% of shelves that stock paper towels and toilet paper are empty, the highest level in at least a month, according to market research company IRI. Cleaning supplies have remained level at 16%. Before the pandemic, 5% to 7% of consumer goods were typically out of stock, IRI said.Contributing to the problem is the fact that roughly 10% of the workforce at manufacturing plants where the products are made are calling out sick, mainly because they’ve been in contact with others who were tested positive to Covid-19, Freeman said.Kelly Anderson of Colorado Springs, Colorado, said she needs more supplies now that in-person school in her area was canceled earlier this month and her two children are at home more. She’s noticed others are stocking up, too: Safeway and Walmart were nearly wiped out of bottled water and disinfectant wipes during a recent visit, both of which had been easy to find since the summer.It’s also been harder to find a time slot to get her groceries delivered. Anderson says she’s had to wait as many as two days instead of same-day delivery. But that’s still not as bad as earlier this year“March seems like a million years ago, but I do remember freaking out,” she said. “I couldn’t get groceries delivered for a week.”Walmart said while supplies are stressed in some areas, it thinks it will be able to handle any stockpiling now than earlier this year. Amazon said its working with manufacturers to get items such as disinfecting wipes, paper towels and hand sanitizer in stock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/toilet-paper-limits-empty-shelves-are-back-as-covid-19-surges/story-v7ApLNXIZUR7sygZ2StBNI.html
18-11-2020||World||China gives explanation for pummeling Australia on trade||China gave one of its most detailed explanations yet for souring ties with Australia, calling on the nation to stop trying to impose its will on others.“Looking back on China-Australia relations in the past few years, we see some people in Australia adhere to a Cold War mentality and harbor ideological prejudice, regard China’s development as a threat, and have then made a series of wrong moves related to China,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.“This is the root cause for China-Australia relations worsening to the current difficult situation,” Zhao said.In a sign some senior members of Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government want to find a circuit-breaker to ease the tensions, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will deliver a speech on Wednesday saying his nation is ready to re-engage in dialogue with Beijing after ministerial contacts were put on ice.Frydenberg will say that despite their differences, Australia is committed to maintaining a strong and productive relationship and is ready to engage with the Chinese government in respectful, mutually beneficial dialogue.Ties between the two key trading partners have been strained since 2018 when Canberra barred Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network. But relations have really been in the deep freeze since Morrison’s government in April led calls for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak -- a move that bruised China’s pride and unleashed a torrent of criticism that Australia is a puppet of the US.Zhao rejected comments from Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham that “the ball is very much in China’s court to come to the table for that dialogue,” making clear China expected Australia to act first. He added that the actions of Canberra and some Australians had “seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.”Zhao’s comments came as Morrison was in Tokyo to sign a defense agreement with Japan and strengthen the already close ties between those two nations. Japan and Australia are trying to build a coalition of “like-minded” democracies in the Indo-Pacific to push back against what they view as Beijing’s increasing expansionism in the region.“The current difficulties facing China-Australia relations are not something China wants to see. Responsibility for causing this situation has nothing to do with China,” Zhao said. “We hope the Australian side will admit to the real reason, look at China and China’s development objectively, earnestly handle our relations based on principles of mutual respect and equal treatment and do more to enhance mutual trust and cooperation.”Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Zhao’s statement after work hours on Tuesday. In a radio interview on Wednesday, Birmingham repeated his assertion that the “ball is very much in China’s court.”Zhao also reeled off a list of ways in which the Australian government or its people had damaged relations with Beijing:“These practices have seriously damaged mutual trust between the two countries, poisoned the atmosphere for the development of bilateral relations, and restricted the momentum of cooperation between the two sides,” Zhao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-gives-explanation-for-pummeling-australia-on-trade/story-xSeiECLItUyVwbLuGxpI5I.html
18-11-2020||World||Hurricane Iota roars onto Nicaragua as second blow in two weeks||Hurricane Iota battered Nicaragua with screeching winds and pounding surf Tuesday, chasing tens of thousands of people from their homes along the same stretch of the Caribbean coast that was devastated by an equally powerful hurricane just two weeks ago.The extent of the damage was unclear because much of the affected region was without electricity and phone and internet service, and strong winds hampered radio transmissions.Preliminary reports from the coast included toppled trees and electric poles and roofs stripped from homes and businesses, said Guillermo González, director of Nicaragua’s emergency management agency. More than 40,000 people were in shelters.Later, Nicaragua Vice President and first lady Rosario Murillo said that a brother and sister, ages 11 and 8, had drowned in the community of La Pinuela trying to cross the swollen Solera River. There were reports of others missing in the same area.A day earlier, Iota intensified into a Category 5 storm, but it weakened as it neared the coast and made landfall with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kph). The system came ashore as a Category 4 hurricane about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi. That was just 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of where Hurricane Eta made landfall Nov. 3, also as a Category 4 storm.By Tuesday afternoon, Iota had diminished to a tropical storm and was moving inland over northern Nicaragua. It had maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 kph) and was spinning westward at 12 mph (19 kph). The storm was forecast to cross into southern Honduras late Tuesday.Aid agencies struggled to reach their local contacts, and the government said in a statement that at least 35 towns in the east and north had no phone service. Nicaragua’s telecommunications ministry said phone and broadband provider Columbus Networks was offline because of flooding in Bilwi.Along Honduras’ remote eastern coast Tuesday, people continued evacuating from damaged and flooding homes.Mirna Wood, vice president of the Miskito ethnic group in Honduras’ far east Gracias a Dios region, was in Tegucigalpa collecting donations for her community ravaged by Eta when Iota hit.Some 40,000 people in the area had moved to shelters from low-lying land beside rivers and the sea, but other people remained stranded near the border with Nicaragua. Some were rescued by Nicaraguan authorities, she said.In her last communication with the mayor of the community of Villeda Morales late Monday, he told her Iota was hitting them hard and the community had not completely evacuated.“We are facing an incredible emergency,” Wood said. “There is no food. There is no water.”In the community of Brus Laguna, some 500 people were in a shelter there and another 900 were being moved elsewhere, Mayor Teonela Paisano Wood said.“We’re in danger if it keeps raining,” Paisano Wood said.In mountainous Tegucigalpa, residents of low-lying, flood-prone areas were being evacuated in anticipation of Iota’s rains, as were residents of hillside neighborhoods vulnerable to landslides.Panama reported that one person was killed and another missing in its western indigenous autonomous Ngabe Bugle area near the border with Costa Rica.As the storm moved westward, flooding became a top concern. The Tola River topped its banks, and western Nicaragua, along the Pacific coast, was forecast to receive the most rain. Nicaragua’s meteorology director, Marcio Baca, said areas where the soil was already saturated would receive 6 to 7 inches of additional rain.Eta triggered flash floods and mudslides in parts of Central America and Mexico and killed more than 130 people.“This hurricane is definitely worse” than Eta, Jason Bermúdez, a university student from Bilwi, said as high winds preceded Iota’s arrival. Many houses lost roofs, fences and fruit trees.“We will never forget this year,” Bermúdez said.Even before Iota hit Nicaragua, it scraped over the tiny Colombian island of Providencia, more than 155 miles (250 kilometers) off Nicaragua’s coast. Colombian President Ivan Duque said one person was killed and 98% of the island’s infrastructure was “affected.”Providencia is inhabited almost exclusively by the descendants of African slaves and British colonizers, who speak an English version of Creole as their native language. The island has no direct flights to the continent, but it has become an increasingly popular tourist destination thanks to its quiet beaches and rich marine life. On Tuesday, Colombian officials said they were sending a ship with 15 tons of aid to the island.In the aftermath of Eta, tens of thousands of Hondurans were homeless. The country reported 74 deaths and nearly 57,000 people in shelters, mostly in the north.One of the hardest hit areas was La Lima, a San Pedro Sula suburb that flooded when the Chamelecon river topped its banks. Many people whose homes flooded moved to shelters or stayed with relatives. Some stayed behind in an attempt to protect what few possessions remained. Authorities tried to force most of them to move to shelters ahead of Iota’s arrival.On Monday, Wendy Guadalupe Contreras Paz, 34, was living under a tarp with her four children and seven other relatives along a main boulevard in La Lima.“I lost everything, I couldn’t take anything,” Contreras said. “But my mom and my grandmother have some things, and that’s why we’re living here, to be closer to the house and keep them from stealing the few little things they have left.”Iota is the record 30th named storm of this year’s historically busy Atlantic hurricane season. It’s also the ninth storm to rapidly intensify this season, a dangerous phenomenon that is happening more often. Such activity has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say causes wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.Iota developed later in the season than any other Category 5 storm on record, beating a Nov. 8, 1932, Cuba hurricane, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.The hurricane season officially ends Nov. 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-iota-roars-onto-nicaragua-as-second-blow-in-two-weeks/story-HXb6CdutxbivmosBNJOZVI.html
18-11-2020||World||Turkish parliament approves peacekeepers for Azerbaijan||Turkey’s parliament on Tuesday granted President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government permission to deploy peacekeepers to Azerbaijan to monitor a cease-fire deal between Azerbaijan and Armenia that aims to end the conflict in the region.In a show of hands, legislators voted in favor of a one-year mandate allowing the government to send troops to Azerbaijan, where they would observe possible violations of the truce from a joint Turkish-Russian monitoring center. The cease-fire ended six weeks of intense fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.Erdogan’s government would determine the number of troops to be sent and it wasn’t immediately clear how many the country planned to deploy. The motion states that civilian personnel could also be deployed as part of the peacekeeping mission.Last week, the defense ministers of Russia and Turkey signed a memorandum to create a joint monitoring center in Azerbaijan, although technical details of the mission are still being worked out.Azerbaijan has been pressing for its ally Turkey, which has supported Baku in the conflict, to take an active role in the peace talks and was the first to announce its involvement in the monitoring of the cease-fire agreement.Russian officials have said that Ankara’s involvement will be limited to the work of the monitoring center on Azerbaijani soil, and Turkish peacekeepers wouldn’t go to Nagorno-Karabakh. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said the center will operate remotely, using drones and other technical means to monitor possible violations.The mandate further extends Turkey’s military engagements stretching from the Middle East to Africa. The country, which has been trying to craft itself a role as a regional power, has sent troops to Iraq and Syria to battle Kurdish militants and to Libya where its presence helped change the balance of a conflict there in favor of the Tripoli-based government. Ankara also maintains a military presence in Qatar, Somalia and on Cyprus and has peacekeepers in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Africa and the Balkans.The motion for the deployment in Azerbaijan was backed by four out of five parties in Turkey’s parliament. Erdogan’s government said the Turkish peacekeepers were crucial for the region’s peace and welfare and for Turkey’s national interests.“Turkey and Azerbaijan who regard themselves as one state and two people, will continue to struggle together for their independence and future,” said Ismet Yilmaz, who heads the parliamentary defense committee. “It is our historic and strategic responsibility to ensure that (Turkish troops) take up duty at the joint center to maintain the cease-fire and prevent violations.”Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that Turkey will be involved in the monitoring of the cease-fire alongside Russia per Azerbaijan’s request.“We will do it together with Turkey, given that we have a very good experience of cooperation in the Middle East, including in Syria, where we organize joint patrols both in the Idlib zone and on the border between Syria and Turkey,” Putin told Russia’s Rossiya 24 state TV channel.“There is no need in cooperation of this kind in this case, but we agreed to create a joint center that will use unmanned aerial vehicles, and together we will be monitoring the situation along the separation line with these aircraft,” he said.Russia, which negotiated the cease-fire, is sending about 2,000 peacekeeping troops under a five-year mandate.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkish-parliament-approves-peacekeepers-for-azerbaijan/story-tW560nnE88wJkQvIgaz81I.html

Biden and PM Modi had a telephonic conversation on Tuesday during which the latter congratulated the former vice president for winning the elections. Prime Minister Modi warmly congratulated President-elect Biden on his election, describing “it as a testament to the strength and resilience of democratic traditions in the United States”, according to a statement by Prime Minister’s office.The prime minister also extended his heartiest congratulations and best wishes to Vice President-elect Senator Kamala Harris.The president-elect thanked the prime minister for his congratulations and expressed his desire to strengthen and expand the US-India strategic partnership alongside the first vice president of South Asian descent Kamala Harris, according to a statement by his transition team. “The president-elect noted that he looks forward to working closely with the prime minister on shared global challenges, including containing Covid-19 and defending against future health crises, tackling the threat of climate change, launching the global economic recovery, strengthening democracy at home and abroad, and maintaining a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,” the statement read.The call between the two leaders comes days after former Vice President Biden defeated President Donald Trump in the presidential race.During the telephonic conversation, Prime Minister Modi warmly recalled his earlier interactions with Biden, including during his official visits to the United States in 2014 and in 2016.Biden had chaired the Joint Session of the US Congress that was addressed by the Prime Minister during his 2016 visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-looks-forward-to-working-with-pm-modi-on-shared-global-challenges-transition-team/story-x4kWAFO3xtJ0I5o4mcvkJJ.html
18-11-2020||World||EU must impose sanctions on Turkey, Pakistan amid rising terror attacks: French MEP||Concerned over terrorism emanating from countries like Turkey and Pakistan, French Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Jordan Bardella has called for “real financial or trade sanctions” against Ankara, Islamabad, Kuwait city and Doha in order to make “European solidarity tangible”.The calls for sanctions by Bardella comes as the rift between France and Muslim countries has widened. France in last one month has witnessed several terror attacks after Charlie Hebdo announced the republishing of controversial caricature of Prophet Muhammed and French President Emmanuel Macron refused to criticise it in early October.Protests erupted in Muslims countries over the incident. Social media users in many Muslim countries joined calls to boycott French goods.On October 16, a terrorist beheaded a secondary school teacher Samuel Paty who used controversial cartoons published by Charlie Hebdo in his classes. On the morning of October 30, another terrorist attack occurred when a man stabbed three people to death and wounded several others in a church in Nice.On November 2, an Islamist terrorist went on a deadly rampage in Vienna shooting dead four people and injuring more than 20 others in the city centre before he was killed by police.“Ongoing tragedy and terrorism continues on European soil and Europe struggles to find a common solution to the constant killings of innocent victims at the hand of the terrorists and extremists,” the European Chronicle reported.In light of this, on 28 October 2020, French Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Jordan Bardella posed a parliamentary question to the European Commission. Following his own statement “over and beyond feeble statements concerning the Turkish President’s ‘unacceptable’ comments,” MEP Bardella requested to know if the Commission is “planning to adopt any real financial or trade sanctions against countries such as Turkey, Pakistan, Kuwait and Qatar, in order to reassert our common values and make European solidarity tangible?”Over recent months and weeks, European parliamentarians have raised increasing concerns regarding terrorism and extremism emanating from countries like Turkey and Pakistan.The European Commission is expected to answer the questions of MEP Bardella in the coming weeks.French Member of European Parliament (MEP) Nicolas Bay has also asked European Union (EU) to stop “showering” Ankara and Islamabad with subsidies and customs facilities and instead put sanctions against them.“During the European Parliamentary plenary of November 11, French MEP Nicolas Bay from the Identity and Democracy Group had strong words against European aid to Pakistan and Turkey in light of threats coming from both countries. MEP Bay’s comments were made in the context of a debate on the ‘fight against terrorism, freedom of expression and education’,” a press statement read.Speaking to the European Commissioner Ylva Johansson responsible for Home Affairs, Nicolas Bay was critical of the support being given by the European Commission to the countries of concern.“You are showering countries like Pakistan and Turkey with subsidies and customs facilities. We want to sanction them!”Linking terrorism threats to migration, MEP Bay gave the stark warning that the latest terrorist attacks in Paris had all been committed by migrants arriving in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-must-impose-sanctions-on-turkey-pakistan-amid-rising-terror-attacks-french-mep/story-FgZ5gX0tyZgX2w2R4JpU2J.html
18-11-2020||World||UK announces ban on sale of petrol, diesel cars by 2030||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday night announced a ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 as part of a £12 billion green agenda, including £1.3 billion to rollout charge-points for electric vehicles in homes, streets and on motorways across England.Outlining his 10-point plan for a ‘UK Green Industrial Revolution’, Johnson said £582 million has been allocated as grants for those buying zero or ultra-low emission vehicles to make them cheaper to buy and incentivise more people to make the transition.Nearly £500 million will be spent in the next four years for the development and mass-scale production of electric vehicle batteries, officials said, adding that the ban on sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 had been agreed with car manufacturers and sellers.Johnson said: “Although this year has taken a very different path to the one we expected, the UK is looking to the future and seizing the opportunity to build back greener. The recovery of our planet and of our economies can and must go hand-in-hand”.“As we look ahead to hosting the COP26 climate summit next year, I am setting out an ambitious plan for a green industrial revolution that will transform the way we live in the UK. This is a shared global challenge - every country in the world needs to take action to secure the future of the planet for our children, grandchildren and generations to come,” he added.The agenda covers clean energy, transport, nature and innovative technologies, officials said. The UK is due to co-host the Climate Ambition Summit on December 12 and COP26 in Glasgow next year.The ten-point plan includes making cycling and walking more attractive ways to travel and investing in zero-emission public transport of the future, and producing enough offshore wind to power every home, quadrupling how much the UK produces to 40GW by 2030.It also envisages generating 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 for industry, transport, power and homes, developing the first town powered entirely by hydrogen by the end of the decade.Johnson announced £500 million for the hydrogen-related plan that includes trialling homes using hydrogen for heating and cooking, starting with a Hydrogen Neighbourhood in 2023, moving to a Hydrogen Village by 2025, with an aim for a Hydrogen Town – equivalent to tens of thousands of homes – before the end of the decade.An allocation of £525 million has been made to help develop large and smaller-scale nuclear plants, and research and develop new advanced modular reactors, besides £1 billion next year to make new and existing homes and public buildings more efficient, greener and comfortable.Poornima Prabhakaran of Public Health Foundation of India said: “With the spiking pollution levels again choking large tracts of Northern India, yet another lesson to emulate for India and the capital city in particular, to deal with its perennial problem of polluting vehicles”.“While enhancing public transport and disincentivising private vehicle ownership may work in the interim, a shift to cleaner fuels through a similar policy may just be the right prescription for securing clean air and healthy lungs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-announces-ban-on-sale-of-petrol-diesel-cars-by-2030/story-jdF9OCnCxNq2eQbKwEGVDO.html

18-11-2020||World||Chinese Covid-19 vaccine also found safe, induces immune response||Results from an early-phase randomised clinical trial of a Chinese vaccine candidate based on the inactivated whole SARS-CoV-2 virus (CoronaVac) show that the formulation appears safe and induces an antibody response in health volunteers aged 18 to 59 years.The results, published on Tuesday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases Journal, add to the number of vaccine candidates under trial that have been found safe. The Chinese trial involved more than 700 volunteers recruited in China between April 16 and May 5.“The vaccine appeared to be safe and well tolerated at all tested doses. The most common reported side effect was pain at the injection site. Within 14 days of the final dose, study detected robust antibody responses after two injections of the vaccine candidate were given 14 days apart, even at lowest dose tested (3µg)”, the journal said.The results showed that antibody levels induced by the vaccine were lower than those seen in people who have been infected by and recovered from Covid-19, but researchers said they still expect the vaccine could provide protection from the virus.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAntibody responses could be induced within 28 days of the first immunisation by giving two doses of the vaccine candidate 14 days apart, the results showed. The study also identified the optimum dose to generate the highest antibody responses, while taking account of side effects and production capacity: 3µg.Fengcai Zhu, joint lead author of the study, from the Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Nanjing, China, said: “Our findings show that CoronaVac is capable of inducing a quick antibody response within four weeks of immunisation by giving two doses of the vaccine at a 14 day interval”.“We believe that this makes the vaccine suitable for emergency use during the pandemic. In the longer term, when the risk of Covid-19 is lower, our findings suggest that giving two doses with a one month interval, rather than a two week interval, might be more appropriate for inducing stronger and potentially longer-lasting immune responses. However, further studies are needed to check how long the antibody response remains after either vaccination schedule.”Also Read: India pins hopes on locally-tested Covid-19 vaccines given Pfizer constraintsCoronaVac is a chemically-inactivated whole virus vaccine based on a strain of SARS-CoV-2 that was originally isolated from a patient in China. The phase 1/2 clinical trial was carried out in the Suining County of Jiangsu province in China.Writing in a linked Comment, Naor Bar-Zeev from Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the study, said: “Like all phase 2 trials, the results must be interpreted with caution until phase 3 results are published. But even then, after phase 3 trial completion and after licensure, we should prudently remain cautious.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccine-also-found-safe-induces-immune-response/story-vLzugsWNXgxDMrxyoTchxO.html
18-11-2020||World||UK’s Labour party readmits Jeremy Corbyn after brief suspension||Britain’s main opposition Labour party reinstated former leader Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday, just weeks after he was suspended over his response to a damning watchdog report about anti-Semitism within the party.The disputes panel of Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee met on Tuesday and decided the veteran leftist could be readmitted, numerous UK media outlets reported.Corbyn said on Twitter he was “pleased” with the outcome.“Our movement must now come together to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government,” he added.However, Labour leader Keir Starmer said on Twitter it had been “another painful day for the Jewish community and those Labour members who have fought so hard to tackle antisemitism”. “I will not allow a focus on one individual to prevent us from doing the vital work of tackling antisemitism,” he added.Corbyn’s reinstatement came hours after the ex-Labour leader acknowledged that concerns around anti-Semitism within the party were not “exaggerated” as he had claimed last month.He made the much-criticised assertion following the October 29 release of a report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) which found the party had broken the law in its “inexcusable” handling of anti-Semitism complaints. I am pleased to have been reinstated in the Labour Party and would like to thank party members, trade unionists and all who have offered solidarity.Our movement must now come together to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government.In defiance of the party’s new leadership under Starmer, Corbyn refused to accept all its findings and questioned the motives of the two-year independent probe.He insisted the scale of the problem had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media”.The comments prompted his immediate suspension, pending an internal investigation.‘Broken outcome’ News of his reinstatement prompted fresh fury within the party, as numerous Labour lawmakers decried the decision on social media.“This is a broken outcome from a broken system,” veteran Labour MP Margaret Hodge said on Twitter.“A factional, opaque and dysfunctional complaints process could never reach a fair conclusion.“This is exactly why the EHRC instructed Labour to set up an independent process!”Also Read: UK’s Labour Party suspends Jeremy Corbyn in anti-semitism rowMeanwhile the Jewish Labour Movement said Corbyn’s case appeared to have been “expedited” by a “factionally aligned political committee”.“After his failure of leadership to tackle anti-Semitism, so clearly set out in the EHRC’s report, any reasonable and fair-minded observer would see Jeremy Corbyn’s statement today as insincere and wholly inadequate,” it added.The EHRC found damning instances where Corbyn’s leadership team underplayed, belittled or ignored complaints by Jewish members, and sometimes actively interfered to support favoured allies.That followed a deluge of anti-Semitic abuse online and in party meetings after he became leader in 2015.The report prompted fresh infighting within Labour between Corbyn loyalists and those eager to move away from the controversies of his tumultuous five-year tenure.In one of his first acts after replacing Corbyn in April, Starmer apologised to Britain’s Jewish community, and last month vowed to accept the entirety of the findings from the EHRC’s two-year investigation.On Tuesday, he reiterated the commitment. “That must mean establishing an independent complaints process as soon as possible in the New Year,” Starmer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-labour-party-readmits-jeremy-corbyn-after-brief-suspension/story-NWtc8M7pVnwLbdE6PcRYIO.html
18-11-2020||World||World races to contain coronavirus||Governments around the world scrambled to contain the coronavirus as Australian authorities conducted mass tests on Tuesday, confining about 4,000 people to quarantine in the hope of stifling a new cluster of Covid-19 cases.The state of South Australia reimposed social distancing restrictions after detecting 21 cases of the coronavirus, most of which were acquired locally.The cases were the first local transmissions of the virus in Australia in nine days. South Australia premier Steven Marshall said testing had identified five new cases in the past 24 hours, while 14 people were suspected to be infected and were awaiting test results. Russia has reported record 442 single-day Covid-19 deaths, up from the previous day’s tally of 303 fatalities. The country registered 22,410 cases in the past 24 hours. Moscow reported 5,882 cases, down from 6,360 recorded the previous day. Meanwhile, more than a million children in the United States have tested positive for the coronavirus disease since the beginning of the pandemic, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) said in a statement.“As of November 12, a total of 1,039,464 children have tested positive for Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic,” the AAP said. “In the one-week period ending November 12, there were 111,946 new cases in children, which is substantially larger than any previous week in the pandemic.”In Pakistan, an alliance of the country’s opposition political parties against the Imran Khan government said it will go ahead with a massive protest rally in Peshawar on November 22, defying the government’s order banning large public gatherings citing the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-races-to-contain-coronavirus/story-ZQvIwERnNLAoh982gP9ksK.html
18-11-2020||World||Joe Biden fears more Covid-19 deaths as Donald Trump holds up||US President-elect Joe Biden on Monday said more Americans “may die” because of President Donald Trump’s failure to allow his administration to cooperate and coordinate its response to the Covid-19 pandemic with members of the incoming team - part of his broader refusal to accept the outcome of the election.Biden had run on the promise of according top priority to the battle against Covid-19 if elected, and in his first significant step since the election, he set up an advisory team to start planning his administration’s approach after his inauguration on January 20. It has received no cooperation from Trump’s team yet.“More people may die if we don’t coordinate,” Biden told reporters when asked about the consequences of Trump’s refusal to cooperate with the new administration. “The vaccine is important. But it’s of no use until you’re vaccinated.”He said it would take a massive effort to get all Americans vaccinated - “a huge, huge, huge undertaking” - and pressed for the need to read into the Trump administration’s plan for development, procurement and distribution of vaccine under Operation Warp Speed, saying, “If we have to wait until January 20 to start that planning, it puts us behind.”The virus has killed over 247,000 Americans and infected over 11.2 million. Cases have been surging in recent days with 166,045 new infections reported in the last 24 hours and 995 fatalities, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.“We’re going into a very dark winter. Things are going to get much tougher before they get easier,” Biden said. “That requires sparing no effort to fight Covid, so that we can open our businesses safely, resume our lives and put this pandemic behind us. It’s going to be difficult, but it can be done.” On Trump’s refusal to allow the transition process, Biden said, “I find this more embarrassing for the country than debilitating for my ability to get started.” Trump has refused to publicly acknowledge that Biden beat him in the election, and has launched a flurry of lawsuits challenging the outcome. Also, he has barred his administration from getting started with the routine transition process, denying the president-elect intelligence briefings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-fears-more-covid-19-deaths-as-donald-trump-holds-up/story-BeoyqmETYvrCRvTclEeqCO.html
18-11-2020||World||BRICS countries urge for joint global effort to combat terrorism||BRICS countries on Tuesday called for an expeditious conclusion and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism and strongly condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.In a joint declaration after the 12th summit on Tuesday, the countries emphasized the urgent need to negotiate a legally binding multilateral instrument that could fill the gap in the international legal regime applicable to outer space, including on the prevention of the placement of weapons.“To address the threat of chemical and biological terrorism, we emphasise the need to launch multilateral negotiations on an international convention for the suppression of acts of chemical and biological terrorism, at the Conference on Disarmament. We also call for an expeditious conclusion and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism within the UN framework,” the declaration said.They said terrorism should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group.“We reiterate our strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations whenever, wherever and by whomsoever committed, and that it should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group,” the declaration said.It said that the governments have the primary responsibility in combating terrorism with the United Nations continuing to play central and coordinating role in this area.BRICS countries underlined the importance of ensuring safety and security of outer space activities, use of outer space for peaceful purposes and prevention of an arms race in outer space.They underscored the fundamental importance of the 2010 Russia-US Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms for the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and called on the parties to agree on its extension without delay.The member states also backed renewing talks on the protocol of the convention that bans biological warfare. The protocol in question should, according to the declaration, provide “an efficient verification mechanism.”BRICS countries also welcomed the ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Karabakh region and support political efforts to restore peace there. The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa said they supported further political and diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring peace in the region.The BRICS countries reaffirmed strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic.“We are convinced that there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict,” they said.The countries called for reforms of the principal organs of the United Nations. “We commit to instil new life into discussions on the reform of the UN Security Council and continue the work to revitalize the General Assembly and strengthen the Economic and Social Council.”The BRICS countries said they will continue working towards strengthening and reforming international governance so that “it is more inclusive, representative, democratic with meaningful and greater participation of developing countries in international decision-making and better attuned to the contemporary realities”.They congratulated India on its election as a member of the UN Security Council for 2021-2022.“Brazil, Russia, China and South Africa extend full support to India for its BRICS Chairmanship in 2021 and the holding of the XIII BRICS Summit,” the declaration said.The declaration said that they recognize “the Victory in the Second World War as our common legacy and pay tribute to all those who fought against fascism, tyranny and militarism, colonialism and for liberation of the colonized, for freedom of nations, and stress the importance of preservation and inadmissibility of desecration or destruction of monuments erected in their remembrance”.“We further urge for a resolute stand against the rehabilitation of Nazi ideology, racism, xenophobia, colonialism and the distortion of history,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brics-countries-urge-for-joint-global-effort-to-combat-terrorism/story-N0ISkWuxVvvSVZvNMxTJqI.html
18-11-2020||World||Bad cabling blamed for failed launch of European satellites||Arianespace said Tuesday that wrong cabling was likely to blame for the failed launch of a rocket that was meant to lift two European satellites into orbit.The European Space Agency said the Vega carrier rocket deviated from its trajectory eight minutes after liftoff from Kourou, in French Guiana, late Monday.France-based Arianespace said an initial investigation showed the first stages of the Vega launch vehicle had functioned as planned. When the final stage of the rocket — known as AVUM — ignited, the spacecraft tumbled off course, leading to a “loss of mission,” it said.“A problem related to the integration of the fourth-stage AVUM nozzle activation system is the most likely cause of the loss of control of the launcher,” Arianespace said.The company’s chief technical officer, Roland Lagier, said data indicated the issue was down to wrongly installed cables in a system controlling the thrusters.He blamed quality control and “a series of human errors,” for the problem.“Arianespace expresses its deepest apologies to the clients and the satellite manufacturers involved in this mission,” the company said.The Vega rocket was carrying Spain’s first Earth observation satellite, called SEOSAT-Ingenio, and TARANIS, a French satellite designed to observe events in the upper atmosphere.Vega is Arianespace’s smallest launch vehicle and produced mainly by Italian aerospace company Avio.A previous Vega launch failure, in July 2019, was attributed to a design flaw.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bad-cabling-blamed-for-failed-launch-of-european-satellites/story-7f2a99PWFjMLN9a1WE1pHK.html
18-11-2020||World||‘Impaired organ’: India slams UNSC on slow pace of reforms||India lashed out again on Monday against the slow pace of UN Security Council reforms - calling the current body an “impaired organ” - expressed deep frustration with the change process that has been on for years without any progress, and raised the possibility of exploring alternative routes.Participation in a UN General Assembly debate on “equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council”, TS Tirumurti, India’s permanent representative to the UN, also sought to dismiss Pakistan’s India obsession as “Pavlovian”, in response to remarks by its representative, Munir Akram, that India doesn’t deserve a seat on the UNSC - “permanent or even non-permanent”.“I do not wish to waste the time of this assembly by responding to the irrelevant and irresponsible remarks made by the representative of Pakistan, which has become ‘Pavlovian’ whenever India is mentioned,” Tirumurti said, adding, “This is a forum for serious debate, not frivolous allegations.”India has sought a permanent seat on an expanded and reformed Security Council. Four of the current five permanent members - the US, UK, France and Russia - support its claim. The fifth member is China.The Security Council is the top decision making body for the United Nations and deals with issues ranging from disputes between countries to terrorism and even the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. The 15-member body has five permanent and 10 non-permanent members, each with two-year terms. While the number of permanent members has remained unchanged since the founding of the United Nations 75 years ago in 1945, the number of non-permanent members, on the other hand, grew from the original six to 10 in 1965. While there is a broad consensus for reforming the Security Council, some countries - loosely called the Coffee Club - have opposed it to block the claims of countries that they believe are their regional rivals. Pakistan is a member of this club. Other members are Argentina, which opposes Brazil’s claim; Italy and Spain, who oppose Germany; and Australia, which opposes Japan.Tirumurti did not name them, but blamed a “handful of countries” for holding up the reforms, to India’s mounting frustration.India has called for the Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN), as the process to reform the UN Security Council is called, to show more urgency and move the process from annual discussions - which Tirumurti said had become like university debates - to text-based negotiations. India wants the process to adopt a document for negotiations, which could incorporate proposals for discussion, amendments, rejection or adoption.India calls for “text-based negotiations to start”, Tirumurti said. “A text reflecting all positions and proposals from member states will be necessary to make progress”.Experts have long pressed for change at the UN, and pointed to China as the major hurdle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/impaired-organ-india-slams-unsc-on-slow-pace-of-reforms/story-BeZS7MShepESgc7bSngHZL.html
18-11-2020||World||Financially troubled startup helped power Trump campaign||President Donald Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign was powered by a cell phone app that allowed staff to monitor the movements of his millions of supporters, and offered intimate access to their social networks.While the campaign may be winding down, the data strategy is very much alive, and the digital details the app collected can be put to multiple other uses — to fundraise for the president’s future political ventures, stoke Trump’s base, or even build an audience for a new media empire.The app lets Trump’s team communicate directly with the 2.8 million people who downloaded it — more than any other app in a US presidential campaign — and if they gave permission, with their entire contact list as well.Once installed, it can track their behavior on the app and in the physical world, push out headlines, fundraise, sell MAGA merchandise and sync with mass texting operations, according to the app’s privacy policy and user interface.Yet the enterprise software company that built a tool to propel Trump’s mass movement is in financial distress and has received key support from the administration and the president’s campaign, according to interviews with former employees, financial filings and court documents.Austin-based Phunware Inc., whose stock is trading for pennies, recently agreed to pay Uber $4.5 million as part of a settlement over claims of fraudulent advertising and earlier this year risked being delisted from the Nasdaq. In April, the company got a $2.9 million loan under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act as it was building the Trump campaign app.Campaign watchdogs and former employees alike marvel at how a struggling startup known more for building apps for hospitals and a Manhattan-based astrologer became a juggernaut in Trump’s reelection bid, facilitating an ongoing data and fundraising effort that threw the company a financial lifeline.While activity on the app slowed recently, the enriched data it gathered on Trump’s supporters, which can include everything from their contacts to their IP addresses to their locations, can serve many purposes going forward, said Adav Noti, a former Federal Election Commission attorney now with the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center.Congress and the FEC have not set rules governing how campaigns can use people’s personal data and or to whom the campaign can sell its lists, he added.“You can definitely buy the data and the campaign can sell it to you, the trickier question is how much do you have to pay for it,” Noti said.Phunware declined to respond to questions about the app, the company’s financial status, its internal culture and its relationship to the campaign.“Phunware has absolutely no role in the constitutional processes tied to US elections at any level ... and also has no role in the content created or used by our customers specific to our mobile software or enterprise cloud platform for mobile,” CEO Alan Knitowski said in an email.The campaign declined to answer questions about possible future uses for the supporter data it collected via digital platforms, including the Phunware app.“The data is owned by the campaign and limited whatever hit their servers,” said a senior Trump campaign official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss campaign specifics.As Phunware has hit challenging financial times, it has shed employees, clients and investors, 10 of whom agreed to speak with The Associated Press, some on condition of anonymity because they signed non-disclosure agreements or feared retaliation.Phunware sued its client Uber in 2017, accusing the ride-sharing company of failing to pay its fees, court records show. But after Uber filed suit against Phunware, alleging the software company committed fraud by among other things, allowing ads for the ride-sharing app to show up on porn sites, former employees said the startup looked to diversify its revenue stream.Karl Rove, President George W. Bush’s former advisor, told The Associated Press that he brokered a relationship between Phunware staff and Trump’s 2016 campaign digital director Brad Parscale.“I thought it had lots of implications for politics so in a subsequent conversation I mentioned it to Brad Parscale,” Rove said. “He said ‘interesting’ and that was it, he never told me he had hired them.”Knitowski said in an email that he built the relationship with the campaign.“Phunware met the Trump Campaign through me directly after a 1:1 introduction from a Silicon Valley CEO who requested our consideration and participation in an RFP that also had Salesforce as a finalist,” Knitowski said.By early 2019, after Phunware went public, former colleagues said Knitowski spoke of wanting to court the Trump campaign. In April, 15 percent of Phunware’s staff was laid off under “organizational restructuring and cost reductions,” per a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.In August, there was something new to announce: work with American Made Media Consultants, “otherwise known as the ‘Trump-Pence 2020’ and ‘Keep America Great’ Campaign,” Knitowski said in an earnings call.According to a document filed with Federal Communications Commission two months later, the company’s directors included campaign operations director Sean Dollman and campaign counsel Alex Cannon.Phunware would later reveal more details about its work on the Trump app, which would include location-based tools and other features to help the campaign crowdsource new users. Plus, there would be a gamified loyalty system, where supporters could accumulate points to spend on signed MAGA hats or pose for a picture with Trump.By September 2019, 18 percent of the remaining staff was laid off after client Fox Networks Group left, taking a large percentage of Phunware’s sales with them, according to filings.In April, as coronavirus cases surged, Phunware got a $2.9 million loan from the US Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, a relief fund Congress created to help small businesses keep workers employed.Phunware COO Randall Crowder denied political favoritism netted Phunware the loan in a recorded interview.The next month, Nasdaq notified the company it could be delisted over its finances. To stay listed, firms must meet standards to reassure investors that since the initial public offering, they remain a credible company.SEC records reveal that by July, American Made Media Consultants accounted for one-third of all Phunware’s sales, paying Phunware more than $1.6 million in the first half of 2020.As the pandemic kept people home, Trump’s campaign used the app to acquire new users remotely. By mid-November the app hit 2.8 million downloads, according to online data provider Apptopia.That could give the campaign hundreds of millions of phone numbers, enabling it to reach people whose digits were stored in their friends’ contact lists but didn’t consent to being contacted, Apptopia’s CEO Eliran Sapir estimated. A Carnegie Mellon University researcher, however, estimated the total would be near 27 million due to duplicate phone numbers.In a Thursday SEC filing, Phunware suddenly stopped disclosing its top customers by name. But by matching the accounting figures to past filings, AP derived that American Made Media Consultants is Phunware’s largest customer, and paid Phunware $2.4 million over the first 9 months of 2020, accounting for nearly one-third of Phunware’s revenue.Two former employees concurred. The app developer also disclosed sizable debt and expressed “substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/financially-troubled-startup-helped-power-trump-campaign/story-V2F1uO4Oiil2sYKXAUp01I.html
18-11-2020||World||France mulls ban on police images, alarming rights defenders||French lawmakers start debating a security bill Tuesday that would ban the publication of images of police officers with intent to cause them harm, a measure that has provoked outrage from journalist organizations and rights campaigners.Critics, including the United Nations, France’s human rights ombudsman and Reporters Without Borders, say the proposed law would hurt press freedoms.Over a hundred people from journalists’ unions and human rights groups protested Tuesday afternoon in front of the National Assembly in Paris, ahead of the debate that was scheduled to begin in the evening.The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the United Nations expressed fears in a report that the bill “could lead to significant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular the right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression.”The proposed law is championed by lawmakers of President Emmanuel Macron’s party, which has a majority at the National Assembly.Its most controversial measure would make it a new criminal offence “to disseminate, by whatever means and on whatever media, with the intent of causing physical or psychological harm, an image of the face or any other element that could identify a police officer.”Offenders would face up to one year in prison and a 45,000-euro ($53,000) fine.Speaking Tuesday at the National Assembly, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who is backing the measure, said the bill aims at preventing “calls for rape” and “murders” of police officers who may be identified on videos.He downplayed any impact for journalists.“Will journalists still be able to film? The answer is yes. Will they be able to broadcast? The answer is yes. Will a citizen be able to film police in action? The answer is yes,” he told lawmakers.But France’s human rights ombudsman, Claire Hedon, said the bill involves “significant risks of undermining fundamental rights,” including press freedom.“The publication of images relating to police interventions are legitimate and necessary for democratic functioning,” she said.Critics are warning that the bill will result in “massive” self-censorship and argue that images posted online help expose police blunders and brutality. They say the measure would endanger journalists and other people filming police in action, especially during violent demonstrations. They also worry how courts will determine whether images were posted with intent to harm.The National Assembly is scheduled to vote next week on the bill, which will then go to the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-mulls-ban-on-police-images-alarming-rights-defenders/story-dUMUDCvJ2REhmsKXwALiiK.html
18-11-2020||World||Pandemic politics leave Washington in gridlock as Covid-19 surges||With the nation gripped by a resurgent coronavirus and looking to Washington for help, President Donald Trump and lawmakers in Congress have a message for struggling Americans: Just keep waiting.The urgency of the nationwide surge in virus cases, spiking hospitalizations and increasing death tolls has hardly resonated in the nation’s capital as its leaders are vexed by transition politics and trying to capitalize on the promise of a coming vaccine. The virus has killed more than 247,000 Americans this year and infected at least 11.1 million — some 1 million of them in just the past week.Also Read: Coronavirus curbs return across United StatesYet in Congress, where talks over economic relief bills stalled out months ago, lame-duck approval of aid is hardly front-of-mind. Across town at the White House, Trump is more focused on getting credit for the vaccine development push and blocking President-elect Joe Biden from getting the information needed to ensure the new administration can smoothly take over the fight against the pandemic.“Another Vaccine just announced,” Trump tweeted Monday morning after Moderna announced that its candidate appeared in early testing to be 95% effective against the virus. “For those great ‘historians’, please remember that these great discoveries, which will end the China Plague, all took place on my watch!”On a call Monday with governors, Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, struck a rosy tone and asked states to give their residents comfort that vaccines are coming and that “America and your state has never been more prepared.”That didn’t stop Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards from appealing to Pence and Trump for a more unified message on the importance of social distancing and wearing masks. And Dr. Deborah Birx, the task force coordinator, reported that 27 states were in the “red zone” for widespread transmission of the virus — more widespread and worrisome than spikes seen earlier this year.Biden, who has warned of a “dark winter” ahead on the virus, called for the Trump administration to share its vaccine distribution plans with his own incoming administration, warning that “more people may die if you don’t coordinate.”Saying vaccine plans are vital to repairing the nation’s economy, Biden said, “If we have to wait until Jan. 20 to start that planning, it puts us behind.”Biden said he was hopeful that Trump “will be mildly more enlightened before we get to Jan. 20.” He said he understood Trump’s “reluctance” to admit defeat and share his administration’s plans but called it “a shame.”There’s no progress in Congress yet, either. The split-decision election — in which Democrats absorbed sizable losses in House races despite defeating Trump — hasn’t sparked any progress or prodded House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to move from their pre-election postures.Pelosi wants to go big, say $2 trillion; McConnell wants a smaller package in the $500 billion range that his rightward-tilting colleagues can live with. Moving toward somewhere in the middle would be difficult for both camps.Also Read: US logs one million new Covid-19 cases last week, deaths up 12%Trump is a disruptive factor on Capitol Hill and no deal is possible without his buy-in, or at least his signature. Without a better and more reliable signal of Trump’s intentions, both McConnell and Pelosi could be wary of navigating the turbulence required to forge an agreement.The results of the election have also weakened the negotiating position of Pelosi, who played hardball during the weeks leading up to the election, only to come away empty-handed. But she is not — yet — wavering from her insistence on a sweeping and comprehensive relief bill rather than the more targeted approach favored by Republicans.And for now, Pelosi is devoting her energies to soothing her unhappy Democratic caucus in advance of leadership elections this week. It seems like the wrong moment to telegraph concessions to McConnell and the Republicans.The two longstanding adversaries are formidable when their interests align, but their offices say they have not spoken since the election and don’t know when they will. The sole must-pass legislation for the lame-duck session is a temporary spending bill to avert a government shutdown — or a broader governmentwide omnibus funding bill if negotiations go well. Covid relief could be an add-on to either bill.“Frankly, our best chance to get some Covid relief might be to get a regular funding bill and put the most critical pieces of Covid relief on that,” said Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. “There seems to be more interest in trying to move an omnibus package and more serious discussion about that than I’ve heard so far about a Covid package.”The Biden team would like a down payment of Covid relief now and is standing by Pelosi’s handling of the matter.“We have her back in handling this,” incoming Biden chief of staff Ron Klain said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Our message to Speaker Pelosi is: ‘Keep doing what you’re doing to the Republicans. Let’s get this done.’ I mean, this could be a first example of bipartisan action post the election.”Meanwhile, Trump’s preferred science adviser, Dr. Scott Atlas, stepped up his criticism of governors for moving to reimpose restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus. On Sunday night, Atlas urged people to “rise up” after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced closures to some schools and businesses in the face of the latest wave of cases.Atlas, who is not an infectious disease expert, earned himself a White House appointment by echoing Trump’s skepticism of mask-wearing and support for “reopening” the economy. Trump has urged supporters to push Whitmer to reopen the state following virus restrictions, though many rules had been lifted previously. And 14 men have been charged in connection with an alleged plot to kidnap the governor.“It’s just incredibly reckless considering everything that has happened, everything that is going on,” Whitmer said. “We really all need to be focused on the public health crisis that is ravaging our country and that poses a very real threat to every one of us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-politics-leave-washington-in-gridlock-as-covid-19-surges/story-ZOxuPGOvOwvQ7MhqTbZKjM.html
