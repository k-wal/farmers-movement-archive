It added that the three-day congregation will start on Friday and attendees have started to arrive from across the country. However, no one from outside the country is allowed to participate in the religious gathering, the statement read. The government said the Covid-19 rules will be strictly followed in the congregation. Children and high-risk adults will not be allowed. Pakistan has seen a spike in the number of new coronavirus cases after a brief lull in September. The virus death toll stands at 6,893 with over 3.3 lakh confirmed infections. On Thursday, Pakistan reported 605 new coronavirus recoveries, taking the number of reported cases to 316,665. Earlier in the year, the Tablighi Jamaat members were criticised for congregating in Lahore. Some 80,000 members of the Jamaat had attended the religious congregation at the Raiwind Markaz earlier in March. A number of new coronavirus cases had surfaced from there. Prime Minister Imran Khan was slammed on social media for allowing the congregation on Friday. “On the one hand, we are imposing certain restrictions in the market and educational institutions and on the other we are allowing the Jamaat to gather thousands of people at one place to spread the virus,” PPP Punjab senior leader Usman Malik told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-to-attend-tablighi-jamaat-congregation-in-karachi-despite-uptick-in-covid-19-cases/story-wkM4bmuCJrmWM3W83vrDiP.html
05-11-2020||World||Covid-19 in United States: 751,000 seek jobless benefits as virus hobbles economy||The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell slightly last week to 751,000, still a historically high level that shows that many employers keep cutting jobs in the face of the accelerating pandemic.A surge in viral cases and Congress’ failure so far to provide more aid for struggling individuals and businesses are threatening to deepen Americans’ economic pain. Eight months after the pandemic flattened the economy, weekly jobless claims still point to a stream of layoffs. Before the virus struck in March, the weekly figure had remained below 300,000 for more than five straight years.Thursday’s report from the Labor Department said the number of people who are continuing to receive traditional unemployment benefits declined to 7.3 million. That figure shows that some of the unemployed are being recalled to their old jobs or are finding new ones. But it also indicates that many jobless Americans have used up their state unemployment aid — which typically expires after six months — and have transitioned to a federal extended benefits program that lasts an additional 13 weeks.The job market has been under pressure since the virus paralysed the economy and has regained barely half the 22 million jobs that were lost to the pandemic in early spring. The pace of rehiring has steadily weakened — from 4.8 million added jobs in June to 661,000 in September. On Friday, when the government issues the October jobs report, economists foresee a further slowdown — to 580,000 added jobs — according to a survey by the data firm FactSet.Last week, nearly 363,000 people applied for jobless aid under a new program that extended eligibility for the first time to self-employed and gig workers, up slightly from 359,000 the previous week. That figure isn’t adjusted for seasonal trends, so it’s reported separately.All told, the Labor Department said 21.5 million people are receiving some form of unemployment benefits, though the figure may be inflated by double-counting by states.The financial aid package that Congress enacted in the spring included a $600-a-week federal jobless benefit and $1,200 checks that went to most adults, in addition to assistance for small businesses. All that money has run out. Without additional federal aid, millions of unemployed Americans likely will lose all their jobless benefits in coming weeks and months, probably forcing them to scale back their spending. And many small companies could go out of business.In the meantime, new confirmed viral cases in the United States reached an all-time high of more than 86,000 a day, on average, in a sign of the worsening crisis that lies ahead for the winner of this week’s presidential election. By contrast, just two months ago, according to Johns Hopkins University, the seven-day rolling average for confirmed daily new cases was 34,000.As temperatures fall, restaurants and bars will serve fewer customers outdoors. And many consumers may stay home to avoid infection. Dwindling business could force employers to slash more jobs during the winter.The data firm Womply found that more businesses are shuttering in the face of a Covid resurgence and a potentially deteriorating economy: 21% of small businesses were closed as November began, it says, up from 20% in October, 19% in September and 17% in August. And sales growth is slowing at the companies that are open.“The economy is on its own against the virus,” said Ann Elizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed. “Accelerating cases are an ever-present threat during winter, and a virus surge means economic uncertainty for businesses. Until that uncertainty is eliminated, the labor market will struggle to return to what it used to be.”A series of major corporations have announced layoffs recently. Last week, Exxon Mobil said it was slashing 1,900 jobs from its US workforce. Chevron said it planned to cut a quarter of the employees at its recently acquired Noble Energy, with he pandemic sapping demand for fuel. Charles Schwab announced after completing its purchase of TD Ameritrade that it would cut 1,000 jobs from the combined company.And Boeing said it would make deeper cuts to its workforce than originally planned. It has been losing money because the viral outbreak has depressed demand for new planes. Boeing expects to end the year with about 130,000 employees, down 30,000 from the start of this year — far more than the 19,000 reduction it had announced three months ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-in-united-states-751-000-seek-jobless-benefits-as-virus-hobbles-economy/story-KJlUdIsHL8Ef18Uag9ofQK.html
05-11-2020||World||Saudi Arabia to ease condemned restrictions on foreign workers||Saudi Arabia said Wednesday it will ease key restrictions on millions of foreign workers, under reforms to its labour policy that is blamed for widespread abuses and exploitation.Human rights groups have repeatedly called on the kingdom to abolish its “kafala” sponsorship system, branded by critics as a modern form of slavery that binds workers to their Saudi employers.The Saudi human resources and social development ministry said that from March 14, expatriates will no longer need their employers’ authorisation to change jobs, travel or leave Saudi Arabia, which is home to some 10 million foreigners. “This initiative will improve and increase the efficiency of the work environment,” the ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.The reforms, if fully implemented, could have a big impact on the Saudi labour market and the lives of blue-collar foreign workers who lack effective recourse against overcrowded housing and exploitative employers.Sattam Alharbi, a deputy minister at the ministry, said the changes will abolish “runaway” reports against foreign workers who do not report for duty, which effectively makes criminals at risk of being jailed and deported. “These changes are not small changes -- it’s huge,” Alharbi told Bloomberg News in an interview on Wednesday. “We aim to achieve more inclusion for Saudis, attract talent, improve the working conditions, make Saudi Arabia’s labour market more dynamic and productive.”However, he said the new regulations will not apply to the country’s 3.7 million domestic workers, a highly vulnerable category of employees who are governed by separate regulations which he said are also under review.Human Rights Watch (HRW) only last week said the kingdom had one of the most restrictive kafala systems in the Gulf, which it said facilitates “abuse and exploitation including forced labour, trafficking, and slavery-like conditions”.“Saudi Arabia’s wealth and economy has been built on the backs of millions of migrant workers and it is time for deep-rooted change to accord them the legal protection and guarantees for their rights that they deserve,” it said. The kafala system persists even after Saudi media reported in February that the government would “soon” abolish it.Rothna Begum, a senior researcher at HRW, said the announced reforms are significant but fall short of completely dismantling the system, with employers still able to cancel workers’ residency at any time.“This can mean that workers can still face abuse and exploitation as employers hold this power over them,” she told AFP.The exclusion of migrant domestic workers from the reforms was also problematic given that many are forced to work excessive hours without rest, denied their wages and even subjected to physical and sexual abuse, she said.Foreign workers in Saudi Arabia say they are often vulnerable to extortion from their sponsors, who can demand a portion of their salaries in order to continue working legally after many arrive heavily indebted from their home countries.After the disruption that came with the coronavirus pandemic, campaigners say potentially hundreds of thousands of “illegal” workers -- many of whom have become undocumented through no fault of their own -- remain stranded in Saudi Arabia.Activists have asked the kingdom to offer an amnesty to migrant workers who are trapped by their debts and not allowed to work to pay them off -- a predicament that risks fuelling the pandemic.“The Saudi authorities need to fully abolish the kafala system to ensure that all migrant workers are able to enter, reside and leave the country without being dependent on a single employer or sponsor,” Begum said.Neighbouring Qatar is also scrapping key aspects of its labour rules, including the requirement for some workers to obtain their employer’s permission to change jobs and exit permits to leave the country.It has passed a series of reforms since being selected to host the 2022 World Cup, setting in motion a vast construction programme employing foreign workers that has come under constant fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-to-ease-condemned-restrictions-on-foreign-workers/story-i5BrKK4rcYvSWM9uRrsx5M.html
05-11-2020||World||China suspends special flights from India as Covid-19 cases rise||China on Thursday indefinitely suspended air travel from India, barring non-Chinese flyers to return to the country, following a spike in Covid-19 cases in last week’s Vande Bharat Mission (VBM).While commercial flights between India and China have not resumed, Air India has been operating special rescue flights under the VBM mission to different cities of China.Beijing made similar announcements to bar entry of non-Chinese visitors from Britain, Belgium and the Philippines and demanded travellers from the United States, France and Germany present results of additional health tests as it guards itself against a resurgence in coronavirus cases rising around the world.The new suspension order is a partial reversal of an easing on September 28, when Beijing allowed all foreigners with valid residence permits to enter.China had banned entry of foreigners in response to the epidemic at the end of March. For India, it means the four VBM flights scheduled every week from November 13th onwards now would have to be rescheduled.Officials in Beijing say more than 1,500 Indians had registered to return to China; Beijing’s new announcement makes their return to China uncertain.The Chinese foreign ministry defended the decision, saying it was a “reasonable and fair” measure to tackle the pandemic. “China is drawing on the practices of many countries and adjusting its handling of the entry of the relevant people into China based on the changing pandemic situation,” ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said at the regular ministry briefing on Thursday.The India-specific announcement said that neither the Chinese embassy in New Delhi nor consulates in Mumbai and Kolkata would stamp on health certificates furnished by normal passport holders.“Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it’s hereby announced that China has decided to temporarily suspend the entry into China by foreign nationals in India holding valid Chinese visas or residence permits,” the Chinese government said in an announcement on Thursday.“The Chinese Embassy/ Consulates in India will not stamp the Health Declaration Forms for the holders of the above-mentioned categories of visa or residence permits,” the statement added.The Chinese statement clarified that foreigners holding “…Chinese diplomatic, service, courtesy and C visas are not affected.”“Foreigners with emergency or humanitarian needs to visit China can submit visa application to the Chinese Embassy/ Consulates in India. The entry into China with visas issued after November 3rd, 2020 is not affected.”“The suspension is a temporary measurement that China has to adopt to deal with the current pandemic. China will make further adjustment and announcement in accordance with the ongoing pandemic situation in a timely manner,” the statement added.As many as 23 Covid-19 positive Indians among them 19 asymptomatic carriers of the infection were on board a VBM flight, which landed in the central Chinese city of Wuhan from New Delhi last Friday.The flight had registered the highest number of infected persons on an Indian rescue flight to China so far.The large number of cases on the flight – and the high incidence of the disease in India – prompted the Chinese embassy in New Delhi to change pre-boarding Covid-19 testing rules for Indians coming to China on special flights, November 7 onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suspends-special-flights-from-india-as-covid-19-cases-rise/story-oAhoXF3b1cZ4UeV89jf46M.html
05-11-2020||World||EU clears key hurdle for Euro 1.8 Trillion spending package||European Union negotiators reached a preliminary deal with the bloc’s lawmakers on a mechanism linking recovery funds to abiding by democratic standards, moving a step closer to a broader accord on the bloc’s 1.8 trillion-euro ($2 trillion) budget and stimulus package.“We have witnessed months and even years of rule-of-law talks dragging on without conclusion between EU member states,” said European lawmaker Petri Sarvamaa, who was negotiating on behalf of the Parliameent. “This will not be the case anymore with the new budgetary clause.”The EU is under pressure to finalize the emergency package so that it will be operational next year, as a new set of lockdowns across the continent paints a grim picture of Europe’s economic outlook and dims prospects for a quick rebound.While leaders agreed on the broad outlines of the unprecedented package in July, they left key details to be fleshed out later, including the contentious link between EU funds and rule of law. EU officials are due to set out details of the compromise at a press conference at noon on Thursday.“Introducing this conditionality is a major step and a clear signal that the EU stands ready to protect its citizens’ interest,” EU Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn said.The deal on the rule-of-law mechanism clears the first of two key hurdles in getting an overall deal and allowing the EU’s 750 billion-euro recovery fund to be up and running in January as planned. Still, lawmakers and EU governments remain at odds over increases to the bloc’s budget, with the Parliament asking for a bigger overall package.Potential VetoesWhile the agreement on the rule of law could give fresh impetus on the stalled talks over the spending package, it is still unclear whether it will get the support of all EU nations -- especially Hungary and Poland, the two members of the bloc that are currently the subject of formal rule-of-law probes.At stake is whether the EU can swiftly deliver hundreds of billions in much-needed funds to combat the steepest recession on record, while making sure the money isn’t misappropriated by countries where democratic checks and balances are weak.If a deal is delayed or blocked, that could derail the bloc’s plans to issue debt on the markets to give out to EU nations as grants and loans in order to help their economic recovery.The EU requires only a qualified majority of nations to impose the rule-of-law conditions on the funds, but the European Commission requires the unanimous approval of all member states (and a majority of EU lawmakers) to borrow from the markets. That means that in practice Hungary or Poland could veto the plan if they don’t like the rule-of-law language.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-clears-key-hurdle-for-euro-1-8-trillion-spending-package/story-uLqPCN5gL8LCnPYHFIUdKJ.html
05-11-2020||World||France issues high risk alert for bird flu in many parts||France is putting part of the country on high alert for bird flu after cases of the disease were reported in western Europe since last month, the government announced on Thursday.Around half of France’s administrative departments will be classed as high risk, while the rest of the country will be on medium alert, the government said in a decree published in its official journal.The high alert level notably requires poultry farms to keep animals indoors or install protective netting to prevent contact with wild birds that spread the disease.“The presence of the virus in wild animals near France’s borders, in a migratory channel that crosses national territory, justifies the raising of the risk level,” the government said in the decree.The measure replaces a previous decree from late October that had increased surveillance in wetland zones that attract migrating birds.The Netherlands, Europe’s largest exporter of chicken meat and eggs, has ordered the culling of over 200,000 chickens after highly pathogenic bird flu was found on several farms since late October. Britain on Monday ordered a cull of 13,000 birds at a farm in northwest England after detecting cases there.Germany, meanwhile, last week reported a case of bird flu in a wild bird in the north of the country. Bird flu is not know to be transmitted to humans but certain strains are very contagious among poultry.Outbreaks in France in recent years decimated duck and goose flocks that are reared to produce the pate specialty foie gras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-issues-high-risk-alert-for-bird-flu-in-many-parts/story-ebYwsGn3OVxJEHtkGyYhXI.html

In 1992, George HW Bush failed to win his second term as Democrat Bill Clinton won the election. Since Bush, all three US presidents — Bill Clinton, George W Bush (Junior), and Barack Obama — have won their re-elections. Click here for complete US election coverageOnly four presidents, in the last 100 years, failed to win re-elections.George HW BushThe 1992 presidential election marked the end of a long period of Republican rule in the United States which began in 1968. Bush’s approval ratings were 89% and his re-election was considered very high. But Clinton won 43 per cent of the popular vote along with 370 electoral college votes. Bush won only 37.3 percent of the popular vote and 168 electoral college votes.Jimmy CarterDemocrat Jimmy Carter lost out to Republican Ronald Reagan in 1980 US election. It was a landslide victory for Reagan as he won 50.7 per cent of the popular vote. 69-year-old Reagan was the oldest person to ever be elected for the first term until 70-year-old Donald Trump was elected president in 2016.Gerald FordIn 1976, Republican Gerald Ford lost out to Jimmy Carter who lost it to Ronald Reagan in 1980. When President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, Ford, the vice president, was made the president. Thus he became the only president to have never been elected by the Electoral College. Herbert HooverRepublican Herbert Hoover was defeated by Democratic Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932. It was a landslide win for Roosevelt as the election was overshadowed by the Great Depression. Both Donald Trump and his challenger Joe Biden have claimed to be ahead in the election as the final outcome in four states remain pending. Neither candidate had garnered the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House. But Biden’s chances were better as he had 253 Electoral College votes compared to 213 won by President Trump, according to latest US media projections. The results of Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Nevada are yet to be declared as officials are still counting millions of votes, some that were cast on Tuesday and many more during weeks of early voting amidst the surging pandemic.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-trump-may-become-first-us-president-to-lose-re-election-bid-since-1992/story-QUmNzow7TOdykRJixsLoAL.html

The police labelled the incident a riot and swarmed in.Meanwhile, in Minneapolis, hundreds of protesters blocked Interstate 94 and the police made arrests, with demonstrators taking to social media to say that the officers had “kettled,” or trapped them there, to prevent them from dispersing.On Wednesday night, tensions rose at a ballot-counting centre in Michigan’s largest city Detroit, a critical reservoir of votes for Biden after multiple news outlets began declaring Biden Jr winner of Michigan.President Trump’s supporters and Democratic observers converged on the TCF Center to monitor poll workers as they tried to finish counting more than 170,000 absentee ballots.Observers from both sides were not allowed to enter the ballot-counting center, because the groups had already reached the maximum number of challengers allowed inside.The number of people trying to gain entry grew from five to more than 30, and the situation grew heated, with arguments breaking out between the challengers, elections officials and the Detroit police.Americans cast their votes on November 3 to elect next president of the world oldest democracy.As part of the New York Times tally, Joe Biden is edging towards a victory over incumbent President Donald Trump in the fierce battle of US Presidential elections with 253 projected Electoral College votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-elections-2020-protests-reported-across-america-as-voters-await-results/story-kUbyjkF4A0fFYaRrDaPvVM.html
05-11-2020||World||Renaming Southall road after Guru Nanak in advanced stage||The Ealing Council has given notice of its intention to rename Havelock Road – named after Henry Havelock, general in the colonial army involved in suppressing the 1857 Uprising – as Guru Nanak Road, inviting any objections to the move by November 21.The Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha is located on Havelock Road in Southall, which has long had a significant presence of people of Indian origin. The move announced in June elicited majority support for the proposal from residents who responded to the initial consultation.The plan was announced in the context of the Black Lives Matter campaign, when London mayor Sadiq Khan called for a review of public spaces. The Southall process has now moved to a statutory consultation with the council issuing the notice under the London Building Acts (Amendment) Act, 1939.The notice says: “Notice is hereby given that it is the intention of the council of the London borough of Ealing to make an order to: Assign the name Guru Nanak Road to that part of the highway between King Street and Merrick Road Southall (currently forming part of the highway known as Havelock Road, Southall)”.The council said that the final decision will be taken in accordance with the street naming protocol, which confirms that any change proposal should “respect and balance cultural and historical identities, sensitivities, and heritage”.Local stake-holders such as the Fire Brigade, Royal Mail and businesses directly impacted by the change will also be consulted. The Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha was inaugurated by Prince Charles in March 2003.Labour MP from Ealing Southall, Virendra Sharma, has welcomed the council’s decision: “I welcome the decision by Ealing Council to finally rename Havelock Road - decolonising our streets. As the MP for Ealing Southall and a councillor for 25 years before that I have often been ashamed the names of empire still pervade our streets”.“I have long campaigned for schools to teach more about our Imperial past, not just the great strides made but also the shameful thuggery and violence, names like Havelock belong in books, classrooms and museums, not on the streets to be celebrated”.“The community should come together to decide how we rename this road, but celebrating Guru Nanak Dev Ji in his 551th anniversary, and erasing a white man who killed Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus, would be a sign of our multiculturalism and our diversity,” he added.The consultation document says: “Ealing is home to the largest Sikh population outside of India and sited within Havelock Road, is the largest Sikh Gurdwara in western Europe. This year marks the 551st anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism”.Julian Bell, leader of the Labour-controlled Ealing council, said while launching the initial consultation: “Our diversity is our strength and we need to make sure that our public realm, our statues, our road names, our buildings, reflect our diversity and do not reflect a frozen past where colonialism, racism and the slave trade were present and celebrated.”“Havelock Road is where the largest Sikh gurdwara in western Europe is cited and as part of its 550-year celebrations of the birth of Guru Nanak this year, we want to make this name change to Havelock Road to Guru Nanak Road”.“This will symbolise the huge contribution of our Sikh community in Ealing and also diversity as a borough, and also it will represent our unity as a borough too”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/renaming-southall-road-after-guru-nanak-in-advanced-stage/story-UkI0lnvKlALIpIho2atSMO.html
05-11-2020||World||Canada thanks India for helping world in Covid fight||The Canadian government has underscored the “critical role” that India is playing with regard to the requirements globally for medicines needed to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.This was conveyed by Canada’s foreign affairs minister François-Philippe Champagne to his Indian counterpart external affairs minister S Jaishankar as India joined, for the first time, the Canada-led Ministerial Coordination Group on Covid-19 (MCGC).A readout issued by Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, stated that Champagne “welcomed” India’s participation in the MCGC “noting the recent developments in India and emphasising the critical role India plays in addressing global Covid-19 vaccine and pharmaceutical needs.”Indian officials said that the role the country has played during the pandemic highlights how it can be a relied on for medical supplies during crises. In May this year, India had sent consignments of hydroxychloroquine to Canada, totalling five million tablets, and both ministers were involved in those discussions at the time.The other nations that participated in the 11th iteration of the virtual dialogue for coordination to deal with the coronavirus crisis were Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore and the United Kingdom.The statement noted that the MCGC was a “valuable forum” especially with cases increasing in several countries across the globe, including in Canada, which has recorded new highs in the infection count in recent days, tallying another 2,761 cases to take the total on Wednesday night to 247,439.The ministers at the meeting “reiterated their commitment to ensuring equitable access to successful Covid-19 vaccines”, according to the release. They also agreed that “when conditions permit more international travel, it will be important to learn from each other on how to best manage borders, international travel, testing and contact tracing.”Among the MCGC’s objectives are focusing on the “importance of multilateral vaccine research and development and ensuring equitable vaccine access to developing countries and vulnerable health systems” as well as “the ongoing need for coordination and multilateralism in response to the economic effects of Covid-19.”In an earlier release, Global Affairs Canada said that the MCGC was “proving to be a valuable forum to discuss, coordinate and act together on global challenges related to COVID-19 and beyond” in a “world increasingly characterised by interdependence, speed and complexity”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-thanks-india-for-helping-world-in-covid-fight/story-MWR3ZqPtxTsF7LeBviG3rK.html
05-11-2020||World||Stay at home: England enters Covid Lockdown 2 until December 2||England went into its second lockdown of the year on Thursday after the House of Commons approved the legislation that mentions the period will end on December 2, but the Boris Johnson government has not ruled out extending it if necessary.The basic message of the lockdown is to ‘stay at home’. Unlike the first lockdown that began on March 23, the second lockdown is likely to be enforced more vigorously by the police. Home secretary Priti Patel told the police they are expected to “strengthen enforcement”.All non-essential shops will remain closed, with exemptions for groceries and takeaways. Schools and universities will remain open. People have been told to work home; those unable to do so will be allowed to travel. Financial support has been made available to those who have lost jobs and to struggling companies.The House of Commons approved the second lockdown on Wednesday by 516 votes to 38 with the opposition Labour and other parties backing the move; 34 ruling Conservative MPs voted against the government motion. Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland are already under varying degrees of local lockdowns. Johnson set out the reasons for the second lockdown in England in the House before voting, mentioning ever-rising number of cases and the challenges faced by the National Health Service to deal with Covid and non-Covid patients over the winter when caseload increases.He said: “Of course, this is not something that any of us wanted to do. None of us came into politics to tell people once again to shutter their shops, to furlough their staff, or stay away from their friends and family. And I feel the pain and anxiety that we all share in the month ahead”.“But as prime minister, when I am confronted with data that projects our NHS could even collapse, with deaths in this second wave potentially exceeding those of the first…I can reach only one conclusion: I am not prepared to take the risk with the lives of the British people”.He told MPs that doctors and nurses could be forced to make impossible choices about which patients would live and would die, who would get oxygen and who could not, if the virus were not suppressed soon.For the first time since June, the daily rise in deaths reached 492 on Wednesday evening across the UK, with 25,177 new cases.Johnson said the aim is to make mass and repeated testing available for everyone across the country, adding that there is a genuine possibility of a safe and effective vaccine next year.He said: “But while I am more optimistic now, more optimistic about the medium and long-term future than I have been for many months, there can be no doubt that the situation before us today is grave, and the need for action acute”.“But, while it pains me to call for such restrictions on lives, liberty and business, I have no doubt that these restrictions represent the best and safest path for our country, our people and our economy,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stay-at-home-england-enters-covid-lockdown-2-until-december-2/story-smxbVlugFZ5aOuCtANSJsN.html
05-11-2020||World||2019 Pulwama attack: 4 members of European Parliament demand sanctions on Pak||Brussels [Belgium], November 5 (ANI): Members of the European Parliament (MEP) have condemned the “blatant and brazen” disclosure by a Pakistan minister in its National Assembly about the country’s involvement in the Pulwama terror attacks in India.Four MEPs - Thierry Mariani, Julie Lechanteux, Virginie Joron, and France Jamet - in a strongly worded letter to President of European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, have urged to immediately consider sanctions on Pakistan and seek an investigation into its involvement in other similar attacks of terrorism in Europe.“We call on the European Commission and the European External Action Services to immediately condemn the leadership and government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for its participation in the Pulwama attacks and request the European Union to consider sanctions against those responsible,” the MEPs said in the letter dated November 4.The dastardly terror attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district on February 14, 2019 claimed the lives of 40 personnel. Terrorists rammed an explosive-laden vehicle in the bus. Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) had claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack. Pakistan had repeatedly denied responsibility for the attack.“However, on 29 October 2020 Pakistan’s Federal Minister for Science and Technology, Fawad Chaudhry, stood up in the Pakistan National Assembly and hailed the Pulwama terror attack as a ‘success ‘under Imran Khan’s government. Chaudhry credited Pakistan’s Prime Minister, Imran Khan and the Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party for its great achievement,” the letter by MEPs said. The MEPs said that Pakistan, under the control of successive political regimes and leaders, has been well documented as a country of ‘State Sponsored Terrorism’.“This latest admission from inside the Pakistan parliament, by a serving Minister, comes less than six month after Imran Khan himself gave a eulogy to Osama bin Laden inside the National Assembly calling him a ‘martyr’,” they said. The MEPs pointed out that at a time when then there is rising public insecurity from a global health pandemic, Europe, and France in particular, now face increasing threats of terrorism.“In the face of such threats and horrific violent aggression on innocent people, it is essential that the European Union does not remain silent.

The march was largely peaceful, though police said they made at least 20 arrests after a smaller, rowdier group began protesting police misconduct by blocking traffic and setting fires.Click here for the complete coverage of the US electionsIn Chicago, protesters demanding a complete count marched through downtown and along a street across the river from Trump Tower.Similar protests — sometimes about the election, sometimes about racial inequality — took place in at least a half-dozen cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis and San Diego.In Portland, Oregon, which has been a scene of regular protests for months, Gov. Kate Brown activated the National Guard after demonstrators engaged in what authorities said was widespread violence downtown, including smashing windows. Protesters in Portland were demonstrating about a range of issues, including police brutality and the counting of the vote.Richard March came to an anti-Trump demonstration in Portland despite a heart condition that makes him vulnerable to Covid-19.“To cast doubt on this election has terrible consequences for our democracy,” he said. “I think we are a very polarized society now — and I’m worried about what’s going to come in the next days and weeks and months.”The confrontation in Detroit started shortly before The Associated Press declared that former Vice President Joe Biden had won Michigan.Video shot by local media showed angry people gathered outside the TCF Center and inside the lobby, with police officers lined up to keep them from entering the vote-counting area. They chanted, “Stop the count!” and “Stop the vote!”Earlier, the Republican campaign filed suit in a bid to halt the count, demanding Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state allow in more inspectors. Trump has repeatedly insisted without evidence that there are major problems with the voting and the counting.Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, insisted both parties and the public had been given access to the tallying “using a robust system of checks and balances to ensure that all ballots are counted fairly and accurately.”Michigan has been on edge for months over fears of political violence. Anti-government protesters openly carried guns into the state Capitol during protests over coronavirus restrictions in the spring, and six men were arrested last month on charges of plotting to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen WhitmerOn Election NIght, scattered protests broke after voting ended, stretching from Washington, D.C., to Seattle, but there was no widespread unrest or significant violence.The prolonged task of counting this year’s deluge of mail-in votes raised fears that the lack of clarity in the presidential race could spark unrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-the-count-trump-supporters-descend-upon-counting-center-in-detroit/story-On56eR8PQwlUoYnRm94OfP.html
05-11-2020||World||US sets single-day record of registering more than 100,000 fresh Covid-19 cases||At least 102,591 new infections were recorded in the United States on Thursday as several states reported a spike in hospitalizations with Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin reporting a record one-day spike in the number of cases. The coronavirus pandemic saw the largest number of Americans vote by mailing in their ballots. The pandemic has also become a main issue in the elections - whose outcome remains undecided as several states continue counting - as the nation remains the world’s most affected. Fears of undetected community transmission remain in the minds of healthcare workers as the proportion of tests returning positive is greater in states like South Dakota, Iowa and Wyoming. According to Reuters, the proportion of tests coming back positive has reached over 50% in South Dakota and Iowa and Wyoming has seen the rates remain above 40%. Texas also recorded more than 9,000 new in the last 25-hours which is the steepest increase in the 90 days. Texas has recorded 18,000 deaths so far. The US has recorded 1,130 deaths in the last 24 hours. Wisconsin and Illinois who have reported more than 6,000 cases have seen record hospitalisations which have brought forth an increased stress on medical services as hospitals are filling up faster than usual. Denver is mulling to impose a curfew in order to curb the number of cases. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock’s office is mulling tighter restrictions on gatherings as Pueblo, one of the largest cities in the state, imposed a two-week, overnight curfew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sets-single-day-record-of-registering-more-than-100-000-fresh-covid-19-cases/story-4oNDX7hl1dMbts2kutPbPK.html

Don’t be deceived,” Democratic Party lawyer Marc Elias said on Twitter. “They know they have lost and this is all they have left.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-team-sues-georgia-s-chatham-county-board-of-elections-over-ballot-sorting/story-wsTUt23LpquNpSZzaRCeRM.html

We are not going to be pushed over or keel over and fall backwards. We are not a pushover,” he told reporters, when asked for an update on the border situation on the final day of his tour of Europe.“But at the same time, we are not jingoistic. We are not ready to go to war when you can settle issues through negotiation and diplomacy. We are reasonable but also firm and resolute in ensuring that our sovereignty and territorial integrity is maintained and protected,” he said, in reference to India’s stance over the Chinese aggression on its border earlier this year.Laying out some facts from India’s point of view, the Foreign Secretary pointed out that China is in illegal possession of 38,000 sq km of Indian territory, in addition to which 5,000 sq km was illegally ceded by Pakistan to China of Indian territory in Jammu and Kashmir.“But in recent issues, we have held our own. So, if there are references to territory being lost, that is not true,” he said.Reflecting on a “sensitive time” in the India-China relationship as another round of key negotiations are in the offing, he stressed that it would not serve anyone’s interest to be very vocal on issues despite a strong sense of public sentiment and revulsion at the “assertive attitude” of a “fairly non-transparent” Chinese setup, not just on India’s border but elsewhere in the South China Sea, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and within Hong Kong.“The fact that we have faced a huge crisis on our borders, the fact that it has been unilateral, the fact that it has created public perceptions in India... We will have to take cognisance of these developments,” he said.In the meantime, both sides have agreed on certain steps that are intended to avert so-called “misunderstandings”, which include both sides not crossing the Line of Actual Control (LAC), no night patrols, no untoward activities and a number of other steps at the military level.“At the level of the leaders, there is a clear consensus that both sides should work to sincerely resolve the issues in the border areas. We do believe that on our side we would make the necessary efforts but remain firm and resolute when it comes to ensuring the preservation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will not compromise on that essential aspect of our sovereignty,” he said.In reference to the Quad, or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue which involves the US, Japan, Australia and India, Shringla sought to highlight the wider nature of the forum beyond just security and defence issues to encompass the COVID-19 pandemic related healthcare response and to build resilient secure supply chains.“We do believe we have the foundations for very strong relationships with our own neighbours; we don’t need to see it from the prism of China. As a country, we have always maintained a level of strategic autonomy and have varying and differing circles of interactions,” he noted.Shringla, who is on a seven-day trip to Europe to review bilateral relations and discuss matters of mutual interest with key European nations, earlier told a German news channel India will not compromise on its territorial integrity.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.The Quad works to bolster the capacities and the abilities of the countries in the Indo Pacific within a manner that’s both constructive and cooperative, Shringla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-not-going-to-be-pushed-over-shringla-on-border-issues/story-MKfc4UzMEbiXIxcNFAPGIJ.html

The police said it will continue to use the ‘4 Es’ approach of engaging, explaining the regulations, encouraging people to following them and only enforcing as a last resort while dealing with restrictions under Lockdown 2. Fines can go up to over 6,000 pounds for breaches.Late-stage trial results of a potential Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca could be presented this year as the British government prepares for a possible vaccination roll-out in late December or early 2021.Kashgar in China’s remote northwestern Xinjiang region started an unprecedented fourth round of mass nucleic acid for its 4.75 million residents on Wednesday after two locally transmitted and 116 asymptomatic Covid-19 cases were reported in the past 24 hours.The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) reported two new confirmed Covid-19 cases and 116 asymptomatic cases, all in south Xinjiang’s Kashgar Prefecture, prompting the testing. The first round testing for 4.75 million people in XUAR’s southern prefecture of Kashgar was completed by October 27 – two more rounds were done between October 28 and Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-outbreak-england-begins-fresh-lockdown/story-WNZ3C0FeYm4uH0NrFRtbQL.html

Government attorneys appealed, and the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals put a hold on the ruling the next day, allowing the restrictions to take effect again.USCIS spokesman Matthew Bourke said on Wednesday that the agency would immediately restart applying the rule to pending cases, but not “re-adjudicate any applications or petitions that were approved” in light of Monday’s decision.Under the Trump administration rule, officials can deny permanent residency to legal immigrants over their use of food stamps, Medicaid or other public benefits. Green card applicants must show they would not be burdens to the country or “public charges”.Immigrant rights advocates deemed it a “wealth test”, while health experts warned of poorer health outcomes and rising costs as low-income migrants chose between necessary services and trying to stay in the country legally.The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Cook County filed the lawsuit in Chicago and planned to submit arguments to the appeals court this month.“It is no surprise that Trump’s team is attempting to remove barriers that would not allow enforcement of his unlawful public charge definition, even after the courts clapped back at him earlier this week,” Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx, whose office argued the case, said in a statement on Wednesday. “I have confidence that the law will prevail here and immigrants across America will be treated fairly as human beings while this gets sorted in the appeal process.” Democrat Joe Biden has promised to end the policy if he is elected president.The rule has already been heavily litigated.In January, the US Supreme Court reversed a hold on the policy after lawsuits. However, enforcement was halted by a federal judge in New York because of the coronavirus pandemic. By September, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed that hold and the rule took effect nationwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-immigration-rule-takes-effect-again-during-appeal/story-kspB03SvT8AE3oJ00Vu1yK.html
05-11-2020||World||Chinese President Xi Jinping pledges to import more as pandemic shakes global economy||China will import over $22 trillion worth of goods over the next decade, and the country is accelerating its opening up in spite of the global coronavirus pandemic, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday. Speaking via video message at the opening of the Nov. 5-10 China International Import Expo, or CIIE, an annual import show in Shanghai, he said the world should not let unilateralism and protectionism undermine the international order.“We should take a constructive stance to reform the global economic governance system and promote an open world economy,” he said via video message. “With a population of 1.4 billion and a middle-income group exceeding 400 million, China is the world’s largest market with the greatest potential. China is expected to import an accumulated over $22 trillion worth of goods in the next 10 years.”China is set to be the only major economy to grow this year after largely bringing the epidemic under control, following its emergence in the central city of Wuhan last year. It opted to push ahead with its annual import fair this year, a rare in-person trade event held during the pandemic, albeit with stringent capacity limits and health restrictions. CIIE was first held in 2018 when a trade war between China and the United States was heating up. Analysts said the fair was a signal that the country is open for business, though few, if any, foreign business and political leaders are expected to attend in person, due in part to COVID-19.Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, were among other speakers who delivered video messages at the opening ceremony. Though the exhibition is focused on buying foreign goods, critics say it does little to address structural issues with China’s export-dominant trade practices, such as weak intellectual property protection and the lack of a level playing field for foreign businesses in China.Xi said China would reduce its catalog of restricted goods and technology imports, treat all companies registered in China equally and sign more high quality trade agreements with other countries. His $22 trillion pledge compares with a target he announced in 2018, when he said he expects China to import $30 trillion worth of goods and $10 trillion worth of services in the next 15 years. He did not give a goal at last year’s fair, which took place before the emergence of the coronavirus, but assistant commerce minister Ren Hongbin said that year that China was confident of fulfilling its 2018 CIIE pledges. China’s 2019 imports of goods fell 2.8% to $2.08 trillion as economic growth slowed to near 30-year lows. That compares with a 15.8% surge in imports in 2018 to $2.14 trillion. Xi did not in his speech directly address China’s increasingly difficult relationship with the United States, especially with President Donald Trump, who has launched a raft of sanctions against Beijing, nor the country’s presidential elections. The U.S. presidential election, in which Trump is running against Democratic rival Joe Biden, hung in the balance on Wednesday and has so far proved far closer than polls had predicted.However, Xi said that countries should not “throw punches” at each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-president-xi-jinping-pledges-to-import-more-as-pandemic-shakes-global-economy/story-tSNgZzcV5l8fc40P9IOw8N.html

Called AZD1222, or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.If Oxford’s vaccine works, it would eventually allow the world to return to some measure of normality after the tumult of the pandemic.Asked what success looked like, he said: “I think good is having vaccines that have significant efficacy - so whether, I mean, that is 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, whatever the figure is - is an enormous achievement.“It means from a health system point of view, there are fewer people with COVID going into hospital, that people who develop cancer can have their operations of chemotherapy - its a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points.”But Pollard, one of the world’s top experts on immunology, said the world might not return to normal immediately.“...It takes time to roll out vaccines. Not everyone will take them,” he said. “We will still have people getting this virus because it is just too good at transmitting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-results-due-next-month-raising-hopes-of-2021-rollout/story-Eq29yo3QuRPhUByzOc3oCK.html
05-11-2020||World||Covid-19, Brexit from Jan 1 mean UK set for winter of discontent: Report||Two months before Brexit is due to be completed on January 1, the United Kingdom – grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic – is ill-prepared to deal with preparations for life outside the European Union, an influential think-tank said on Tuesday.Talks on a deal before January 1 are still ongoing with Brussels, but the Institute of Government said in a new report that whether a deal will be in place or not, the scale of the task to prepare business, people and the UK government itself “is huge”.The pandemic has already unsettled companies, who fear more closures and distress due to the second lockdown beginning Thursday, until December 2. One of the biggest impacts of Brexit will be on arrangements of trade and business, which the think-tank said is not ready.It said: “With just eight weeks and counting until the end of the transition period, the government still has a lot to do to get Brexit done…In the four and a half years since the EU referendum, a huge amount of government time and resource has gone into preparing for life outside the EU.”“Although the UK left the political institutions of the EU in January, very little changed in practice”, it said, adding that the UK is ready in some areas but major challenges remained.The UK government, it said, will need to grapple with the economic consequences of Brexit; identifying which businesses will be viable in the longer term outside the single market and customs union, and which will not.“This would be an extremely difficult task at the best of times, but has been made harder still by the devastating economic effect of the Covid crisis. With limited resources and political bandwidth, balancing its Brexit response against the ongoing demands of the pandemic and its domestic policy agenda will be difficult”, the report titled ‘Preparing Brexit: How Ready is the UK?’ said.The Boris Johnson government decided not to extend the one-year transition period that ends of December 31. The decision, the think-tank said, had “effectively gambled” that the UK can withstand the inevitable disruption from its preferred outcome.The report said: “The government will need to be ready to manage the impact of the transition period ending alongside coronavirus. It will need to step up its contingency plans and prepare to make difficult decisions about where to prioritise resources. Unlike its preparations for a possible no deal last year, the government will now need to do this alongside a resurgence of coronavirus”.“This will be difficult, and the government has made its task harder still with its decision not to extend the transition period. Even if the UK civil service has the necessary resources to do so, the devolved administrations, local authorities and businesses may well be overwhelmed,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-brexit-from-jan-1-means-uk-set-for-winter-of-discontent-report/story-bHQskgANh8DV8jzGxZehEO.html

The whole-city testing is part of a new approach to deal with the virus following limitations were revealed in the controversial three-tiered regional alert level.Officials said on Tuesday that Liverpool residents and workers will be tested using a combination of existing swab tests, as well as new lateral flow tests which can rapidly turn around results within an hour without the need to be processed in a lab.The LAMP (Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification) technology that is able to deliver significant volumes of tests is being deployed in Liverpool hospitals for NHS staff.The pilot will help inform a blueprint for how mass testing can be achieved and how fast and reliable Covid-19 testing can be delivered at scale, the officials added.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “These tests will help identify the many thousands of people in the city who don’t have symptoms but can still infect others without knowing. Dependent on their success in Liverpool, we will aim to distribute millions of these new rapid tests between now and Christmas and empower local communities to use them to drive down transmission in their areas.”Defence secretary Ben Wallace added: “We will be deploying 2,000 talented Armed Forces personnel to, once again, rise to the challenges posed by Covid-19 to ensure we go above and beyond for the Liverpool community…The military are uniquely placed to help with the fight against Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/symptoms-or-not-uk-to-pilot-whole-city-testing-in-liverpool/story-FwCiBGIHxmsh3fLvmx3tGP.html
05-11-2020||World||Experts say hope for global climate efforts hinge on US election results||What happens on election day will to some degree determine how much more hot and nasty the world’s climate will likely get, experts say.The day after the presidential election, the United States formally leaves the 2015 Paris agreement to fight climate change. A year ago, President Donald Trump’s administration notified the United Nations that America is exiting the climate agreement. And because of technicalities in the international pact, Nov. 4 is the earliest a country can withdraw.The US, the world’s second biggest carbon polluter, will be the first country to quit the 189-nation agreement, which has countries make voluntary, ever-tighter goals to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases. The only mandatory parts of the agreement cover tracking and reporting of carbon pollution, say US officials who were part of the Paris negotiations.Former Vice President Joe Biden has pledged to put the country immediately back in the Paris agreement, which doesn’t require congressional approval. Experts say three months — from November to the January inauguration — with the US out of the climate pact will not change the world, but four years will.If America pulls back from Paris and stronger carbon cutting efforts, some nations are less likely to cut back too, so the withdrawal’s impact will be magnified, said scientists and climate negotiators.Because the world is so close to feared climate tipping points and on a trajectory to pass a temperature limit goal, climate scientists said the US pullout will have noticeable effects.“Losing most of the world’s coral reefs is something that would be hard to avoid if the US remains out of the Paris process,” said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather of the Breakthrough Institute in Oakland, California. “At the margins, we would see a world of more extreme heat waves.”If the US remains out of the climate pact, today’s children are “going to see big changes that you and I don’t see for ice, coral and weather disasters,” said Stanford University’s Rob Jackson.Because the two presidential candidates have starkly different positions on climate change policy, the election could have profound repercussions for the world’s approach to the problem, according to more than a dozen experts.“That election could be a make or break point for international climate policy,’’ said Niklas Hohne, a climate scientist at Wageningen University in Germany.In pulling out of the agreement, Trump has questioned climate science and has rolled back environmental initiatives that he called too restrictive in cutting future carbon pollution from power plants and cars.American carbon emissions dropped by less than one percent a year from 2016 to 2019, until plunging probably temporarily during the pandemic slowdown, according to the US Department of Energy. More than 60 countries cut emissions by higher percentages than the US in that time period, according to international data.“Other countries around the world are obsessed with the Paris Climate Accord, which shackles economies and has done nothing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in an email. “President Trump understands economic growth and environmental protection do not need to conflict.”“We’ve also done our fair share” to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday in the Maldives, a climate-vulnerable country. “We stand amongst industrialized nations as a beacon, and we did it not through state-driven, forced rulesets, but rather through creativity and innovation and good governance.”In the last debate and on his website, Biden pledged to set a goal of zero net carbon emissions from the US by 2050, meaning the country would not put more greenhouse gases into the air than it takes out through trees and other natural and technological sources. Dozens of nations, including top polluting China, have already made similar pledges.Eleven years ago, the world was on pace to add about another 5 degrees (2.8 degrees Celsius) of warming. But with emission cut pledges from Paris and afterward, the world is facing only about another 2.2 degrees (1.2 degrees Celsius) of warming if countries do what they promise, said Wageningen University’s Hohne.“If Biden wins, the whole world is going to start reorienting toward stepping up its action,” said climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck, dean of the University of Michigan’s environment program.If the US remains out of Paris, countries trying to cut emissions drastically at potentially high costs to local industry may put “border adjustment” fees on climate laggards like America to even the playing field, said Nigel Purvis, a climate negotiator in the Clinton and second Bush administrations. The European Union is already talking about such fees, Purvis said.Trevor Houser, a climate modeler for the independent Rhodium Group, and the computer simulation research group Climate Action Tracker ran calculations comparing a continuation of the Trump administration’s current emission trends to what would happen if Biden worked toward net zero emissions. Houser, who worked briefly in the Obama State Department, found that in the next 10 years a Trump scenario, which includes a moderate economic bounce-back from the pandemic, would emit 6 billion tons (5.4 billion metric tons) more greenhouse gases than the Biden scenario — an 11% difference.Climate Action Tracker calculated that from reduced US emissions alone in a Biden scenario, the world would be two-tenths of a degree (one-tenth of a degree Celsius) cooler.“Every tenth of a degree counts,” said Hohne, a Climate Action Tracker team member. “We are running into a catastrophe if we don’t do anything.”Other nations will do more to limit carbon pollution if the US is doing so and less if America isn’t, said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald. “In terms of leadership, it will make an immense difference,” she said.In Paris, the US was crucial in getting the agreement finished. The rest of the world ended up pledging to reduce roughly five tons of carbon pollution for every ton the US promised to cut, according to Houser and Breakthrough’s Hausfather.Nations also adopted a goal to limit future warming to just a few more tenths of a degree from now. A UN panel of scientists in 2018 said there was only a slim chance of reaching the goal, but said it would likely make a huge difference in helping avert more loss of corals, extreme weather and extinctions.A second Trump win “could remove whatever vanishingly small chance we have of” not shooting past that stringent temperature goal, Hausfather said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/experts-say-hope-for-global-climate-efforts-hinge-on-us-election-results/story-7beA1aW33qZiFCUg5ukZTK.html
