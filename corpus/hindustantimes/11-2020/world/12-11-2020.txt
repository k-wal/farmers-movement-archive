It was the latest in a succession of military takeovers since independence from France in 1946, and there was no reason to think it would be the last.Yet 50 years later, Hafez Assad’s family still rules Syria.The country is in ruins from a decade of civil war that killed a half million people, displaced half the population and wiped out the economy. Entire regions are lost from government control. But Hafez’s son, Bashar Assad, has an unquestioned grip on what remains.His rule, half of it spent in war, is different from his father’s in some ways, dependent on allies like Iran and Russia rather than projecting Arab nationalism, run with a crony kleptocracy rather than socialism. The tools are the same: repression, rejection of compromise, and brutal bloodshed.Like the Castro family in Cuba and North Korea’s Kim dynasty, the Assads have attached their name to their country the way few non-monarchical rulers have done.It wasn’t clear whether the government intended to mark the 50-year milestone this year. While the anniversary has been marked with fanfare in previous years, it has been a more subdued celebration during the war.“There can be no doubt that 50 years of Assad family rule, which has been ruthless, cruel and self-defeating, has left the country what can only be described as broken, failed and almost forgotten,” said Neil Quilliam, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa program.“Ruthless but Brilliant”After his 1970 takeover, Hafez Assad consolidated power. He brought into key positions members of his Alawite sect, a minority in Sunni-majority Syria, and established a Soviet-style single-party police state.His power was absolute. His Mukhabarat, or intelligence officers, were omnipresent.He turned Syria into a Middle East powerhouse. In the Arab world, he gained respect for his uncompromising position on the Golan Heights, the strategic high ground lost to Israel in the 1967 war. He engaged in US -mediated peace talks, sometimes appearing to soften, only to frustrate the Americans by pulling back and asking for more territory.In 1981, in Iraq’s war with Iran, he sided with the Iranians against the entire Arab world backing Saddam Hussein, starting an alliance that would help save his son later. He supported the US-led coalition to liberate Kuwait after Saddam’s 1990 invasion, gaining credit with the Americans.“He was a ruthless but brilliant man who had once wiped out a whole village as a lesson to his opponents,” former US President Bill Clinton, who met with Assad several times, wrote in his memoirs “My Life.”Clinton was referring to the 1982 massacre in Hama, where security forces killed thousands to crush a Muslim Brotherhood uprising.The massacre, one of the most notorious in the modern Middle East, left hatreds that fanned the flames of another uprising against his son years later.“A key element of the Assad regime’s survival has been: No compromise domestically, exploit the geopolitical shifts regionally and globally, and wait your enemies out,” said Sam Dagher, author of the book “Assad or we Burn the Country: How One Family’s Lust for Power Destroyed Syria.”Challenges and OpportunitiesBashar Assad borrowed heavily from that playbook after his father’s death in 2000. Unlike his father, critics say he repeatedly squandered opportunities and went too far.First welcomed as a reformer and modernizer, Bashar, a British-trained eye doctor, opened the country and allowed political debates. He quickly clamped back down, faced with challenges and a rapidly changing world, beginning with the September 11 attacks in America.He opposed the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, worried he would be next. He let foreign fighters enter Iraq from his territory, fuelling an insurgency against the US occupation and enraging the Americans.He was forced to end Syria’s long domination of Lebanon after Damascus was blamed for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Still, he tightened ties with Lebanon’s Hezbollah.Like his father, Bashar Assad elevated family to insulate his power — a younger, more modern generation, but one seen by many Syrians as more rapacious in amassing wealth.The Assad family’s gravest challenge came with the Arab Spring uprisings that swept the region, reaching Syria in March 2011.His response to the initially peaceful protests was to unleash security forces to snuff them out. Instead, protests grew, turning later into an armed insurgency backed by Turkey, the US and Gulf Arab nations. His military fragmented.With his army nearing collapse, Assad opened his territory to Russia’s and Iran’s militaries and their proxies. Cities were pulverized. He was accused of using chemical weapons against his own people and killing or jailing opponents en masse. Millions fled to Europe or beyond.For much of the world, he became a pariah. But Assad masterfully portrayed the war as a choice between his rule and Islamic extremists, including the Islamic State group. Many Syrians and even European states became convinced it was the lesser evil.Eventually, he effectively eliminated the military threat against him. He is all but certain to win presidential elections due next year in the shattered husk that is Syria.Still, Dagher said the war transformed Syrians in irreversible ways. An economic meltdown and mounting hardship may change the calculus.“A whole generation of people has been awakened and will eventually find a way to take back the country and their future,” he said.As US election results rolled in, showing Joe Biden the winner, memes by Syrian opposition trolls mocked how the Assads have now outlasted nine American presidents since Richard Nixon.“In my life, my fellow Syrians had to vote four times for the only president on the ballot, Hafez Assad. His son is still president. After migration to the US, I voted for six different presidents,” wrote Zaher Sahloul, a Chicago-based Syrian-American doctor who left Syria in 1989. “I wish that my homeland will witness free elections one day.”Hafez Assad’s legacy might have looked quite different had he not shoe-horned Bashar into succeeding him, Quilliam said.“It would not have been favorable, but Bashar’s legacy will overshadow Assad’s legacy and make it synonymous with cruelty, willful destruction of a great country, and the brutalization of a beautiful people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-ruins-syria-marks-50-years-of-assad-family-rule/story-rd9Dv4yDJ1TF2QfXM3SvVM.html
12-11-2020||World||Covid-19: States ramp up for biggest vaccination effort in US history||With a Covid-19 vaccine drawing closer, public health officials across the country are gearing up for the biggest vaccination effort in US history — a monumental undertaking that must distribute hundreds of millions of doses, prioritize who’s first in line and ensure that people who get the initial shot return for the necessary second one.The push could begin as early as next month, when federal officials say the first vaccine may be authorized for emergency use and immediately deployed to high-risk groups, such as health care workers.“The cavalry is coming,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” He said he hopes shots will be available to all Americans in April, May and June.Pfizer also boosted hopes this week, saying early data suggests its vaccine is 90% effective. But the good news came in one of the grimmest weeks of the pandemic so far. Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are surging across the US — and turning up the pressure to get the vaccine effort right.In Philadelphia, the health department is counting how many health care workers and others would be among the first in line. In Louisiana, officials are planning a remote exercise this week to play out different scenarios exploring how the process might unfold.“If you get 10,000 doses, what are you going to do, versus 100,000 doses?” said Dr. Frank Welch, director of Louisiana’s immunization program.State and local officials are also planning for the likelihood that the first shipments will not be enough to cover everyone in high-priority groups.Similar preparations are happening at the federal level. Welch listened in last week on a “war gaming” session by the US Department of Health and Human Services.For the vaccination effort to get off the ground, state officials have been readying systems to track supplies and who has been vaccinated. That information will be fed into a national network and will be critical in giving federal health officials an up-to-date picture of vaccinations around the country.Providers such as pharmacies and doctor’s offices will also need to be able to look up records, so people do not have to return to the same place for their second shot. More than one vaccine could also become available, and doses cannot be mixed and matched.“We not only have to bring people back for a second dose, but need to make sure that we have very good records of which vaccine they received the first time,” said Dr. Jinlene Chan of Maryland’s health department.States already have immunization registries, which will be used for Covid-19.To better understand whether at-risk groups are getting vaccinated, the CDC wanted providers to report the race and ethnicity of the people they vaccinate. But pharmacies and other providers that do not always collect that information objected.“We have to be careful not to put too many administrative burdens on providers that are already stressed,” said Mitchel Rothholz of the American Pharmacists Association, an industry group.He said providers have been told they will have the option to leave that information out.Providers will also have to report vaccination information daily, which will be an adjustment for those that typically enter data weekly or every couple of weeks, state officials said.To help people find doses in their area, the CDC wants to put information on a vaccine finder website, which will be updated each day with the latest inventory.Supplying that inventory information might be a staffing strain for some providers, including a hospital in Utah that said it only has one person who currently enters the information, said Jon Reid, who manages state’s immunization registry.“And they don’t do it every day. They do it whenever,” Reid said. State officials in Utah plan to update the inventory, rather than having each provider enter it, he said.States are also working to expand the number of pharmacies, doctor’s offices and other providers that can administer Covid-19 vaccines, to ensure shots are conveniently available.But enrollment can be time-consuming, Reid said, because providers often need help filling out forms, getting technical systems working and going through inspections to ensure they can meet storage requirements. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 F).Given the hurdles, Reid does not expect smaller pharmacies to become Covid-19 vaccine providers.Because of the likely need for two doses given three or four weeks apart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering ways of helping Americans remember the second shot, including issuing cards that people would get with their first shot, akin to the polio immunization cards many older Americans remember carrying.Many people will likely need additional prodding.In a rural part of South Carolina, one community health center is planning multiple reminders, including text messages and calls from health workers.Still, “there will still be some that slip through the cracks,” said Ann Lewis, CEO of CareSouth Carolina, which runs the health centers.Distributing doses is another issue. The Pfizer vaccine, which could be the first to get the green light, comes in shipments of nearly 1,000 doses.“A minimum of 1,000 doses makes it very difficult to get smaller facilities vaccinated,” said Rich Lakin, director of Utah’s immunization program.Shipments might go to a hospital that is easily accessible to health care workers from multiple sites, Lakin said.“They may have to drive to that hospital to get the vaccine,” he said.In North Dakota, providers receiving fewer than 1,000 doses will have them shipped to a state warehouse that can maintain the ultra-cold storage.“We’ll break them down into the smaller quantities and then drive them to the provider,” said Molly Howell, the state’s immunization director.State and local health departments will break up and redistribute shipments of other vaccines, which are expected to require orders of at least 100 doses, for smaller providers that do not need that many. But even if distribution goes smoothly, officials worry people will not want the shots.“If there’s going to be any real challenge, to be honest with you, it’s going to be convincing folks to get the vaccine,” said Patrick Peer, who runs the Good Neighbor Community Health Center in Columbus, Nebraska.So far, states have received far less money than they say they need for vaccine distribution, and it’s unclear if any more federal help is coming. Public health groups estimate that an additional $8.4 billion is needed to pay for staff, data systems and outreach and supply costs.In rural Minnesota this fall, masked nurses in traffic vests reached into cars to give passengers flu shots. The drive-thru clinic was a way to social distance in the pandemic, but it also served as a test run for someday administering a Covid-19 vaccine.Carlton County has purchased mobile vaccination stations to prepare for similar mass clinics for the coronavirus. But county health officials are also suddenly dealing with a spike in cases, and many questions remain unanswered, including when a vaccine might arrive and how many doses there will be“It’s all kind of up in the air,” said Jenny Barta, a public health nurse specialist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-states-ramp-up-for-biggest-vaccination-effort-in-us-history/story-ZErIu9pAi0r56US6XjJJBM.html
12-11-2020||World||White House leaves stimulus to Congress after failed talks||The Trump administration is stepping back from negotiations on a new stimulus package and leaving it to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to revive long-stalled talks with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, according to people familiar with the situation.While the White House probably would consult with GOP lawmakers on details of a Covid-19 relief bill, it’s now unlikely to take the lead on talks, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The White House would only take over if negotiations have to be restarted completely, the people said.The White House didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.The move greatly diminishes the chances of a trillion-dollar or more stimulus for the US economy before January. President Donald Trump had committed to pursuing a large-scale stimulus after the election, even saying he would approve a $2 trillion bill, but has since focused on attempting to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s victories in battleground states.That leaves the negotiations at a stalemate, with neither McConnell nor Pelosi backing away from earlier positions -- even as the further spread of the coronavirus threatens to weaken the recovery from earlier pandemic-induced shutdowns.Powell’s CallFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that fiscal stimulus is “absolutely essential” to the US economic recovery. He has also said that even if spending proved more than necessary, it “will not go to waste.”Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had been leading negotiations with Pelosi, but they hit an impasse before Election Day, with the administration proposing about $1.9 trillion in spending, and Democrats at $2.4 trillion. A welter of policy issues, from aid to state and local governments to a Republican push for liability protections for businesses, had also prevented a deal.McConnell has continued to insist on a much smaller package of about $500 billion, pointing to signs of a continuing recovery including a slide in the unemployment rate. He has also pointed to encouraging news on a coronavirus vaccine.“The level at which the economy is improving further underscores that we need to do something at about the amount that we put on the floor in September and October,” McConnell told reporters. Democratic leaders “still are looking at something dramatically larger. That’s not a place I think we’re willing to go,” he said.‘Same Place’His office declined to comment about the White House role in the talks.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday that the $2.4 trillion House-passed bill must be the starting point to any new stimulus talks, reinforcing the stalemate with the Senate.“We’re at the same place,” Pelosi at a news conference with Schumer. “Even more so with the pandemic because look at these numbers. Look at these numbers. Look at the predictions of the scientific community.”Pelosi didn’t respond to a question about whether she had spoken to anyone from the administration.One vehicle for at least some Covid-19 assistance is a vital spending bill that will be needed to avoid the federal government shutting down after Dec. 11, when current funding runs out. House and Senate negotiators are working on an omnibus package that would include appropriations bills for funding through next September.McConnell said this week he plans to talk to Pelosi about the funding bill soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-leaves-stimulus-to-congress-after-failed-talks/story-14gfru1P7tiOan2seo2ngP.html
12-11-2020||World||Can Marijuana help Joe Biden heal a divided nation?||After five states — Arizona, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota — passed ballot measures for marijuana use last week, the drug will soon be legal in some form for 70% of the U.S. population. A third of the country won’t even need a medical excuse. But that’s not the surprise.What’s more notable is that unlike in the past, all of this happened without much of a public uproar. To be fair, there have been bigger concerns on Americans’ minds these days. But this is the moment that cannabis companies and their investors have been waiting for: to be considered a legitimate industry rather than a hot voting issue. From here, the goal is to make weed every bit as normal as junk food, wine and other vices long found in stores across America.In order for the industry to flourish it needs the federal government’s help, and the prospects of that are suddenly looking better. Two-thirds of US adults are in favor of marijuana legalization — 91% if you include those who support it at a minimum for medicinal purposes, according to Pew Research Center. That’s more than the number of Americans who support abortion rights or who think human activity contributes to climate change.The partisan gap in attitudes toward pot is also shrinking, with more than half of Republicans saying it should be legalized. In the reliably red state of Mississippi, Initiative 65 — the less-restrictive of two medical marijuana proposals that were on its ballot — was criticized by Governor Tate Reeves as too “liberal” for “non-stoners”:And still it passed by 74%. As Joe Biden takes office in January and the makeup of Congress continues to reflect a divided nation, marijuana may end up being the one issue almost everyone can agree on.The increasing support for pot in red states bodes well for a Senate vote on the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act, which would allow financial institutions to legally do business with marijuana companies. It would be one of the most constructive developments for the industry short of legalizing weed at the federal level.Cannabis companies have reason to be hopeful that a new administration will also usher in other changes such as reclassifying or excluding marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act. De-scheduling the drug would leave states to decide how to handle pot, which may be more palatable to conservatives than attempting to change federal laws, Isaac Boltansky and Merrill Ross, analysts for Compass Point Research & Trading LLC, wrote in an Oct. 26 report. Marijuana is currently considered a Schedule 1 drug, right alongside heroin, in a category reserved for narcotics with the highest potential for abuse and dependence and with no accepted medical use. Examples of Schedule 2 substances are cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine and oxycodone — some of them at the root of America’s opioid addiction crisis. For cannabis proponents, that just doesn’t add up. Removing cannabis from the CSA would provide a meaningful benefit to companies’ income statements:In fact, some of the biggest challenges in getting licensed weed businesses off the ground are around the regulatory hurdles and costly process of having to work piecemeal in expanding around the U.S. That’s helped the illicit weed market maintain a competitive advantage by undercutting prices. In California, where marijuana can be legally purchased, illegal transactions are still estimated to make up the overwhelming majority of sales.It’s no wonder that pot stocks — at one point the darlings of the market — have lost their exuberance this year. The so-called cannabis index has dropped 38%. In one example, beleaguered multistate operator MedMen Enterprises Inc. was forced to walk away from Virginia, where a limited but potentially lucrative medical marijuana market is just beginning to open up; its shares have slumped 73% this year.An unintended effect of squelching the market may be to drive cash-strapped cannabis companies into the arms of food and beverage giants, which are preparing to pounce on pot once laws become more lax. For brewers and tobacco companies, it may be the most promising growth avenue. That said, a bunch of upstarts getting swallowed by behemoths would seem to go against Democratic legislators’ efforts to level competitive playing fields through more aggressive antitrust enforcement. Everyday consumer products are a key way for cannabis companies to target a wider customer base than pot smokers. Canada-based Canopy Growth Corp., valued at $9 billion, wants to start selling drinks containing THC — the psychoactive chemical in cannabis — next year to compete with beer. Even though Canopy is backed by liquor conglomerate Constellation Brands Inc., it’ll be tough going up against Anheuser-Busch InBev AB, which controls 42% of the North American beer market.Bit by bit, things are moving in a positive direction for the industry, albeit slowly. Meanwhile, cannabis companies have strategically entered states where medical marijuana is allowed so that they’re ready to roll once recreational use for adults is made legal. For example, the more immediate winners of last week’s ballot measures include Curaleaf Holdings Inc., a $5.9 billion company that holds the No. 1 market share in New Jersey and No. 2 in Arizona, and Harvest Health & Recreation Inc., which gets 50% of its sales from Arizona, according to a Nov. 4 report by Pablo Zuanic, an analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. New York and Pennsylvania are expected to be next, with budget shortfalls caused by Covid-19 potentially incentivizing them to move faster on the issue.At the national level, if Biden is looking for common ground with Republicans, marijuana of all things seems like a reasonable place to start. The year 2020 truly is bizarre. (Corrects third-to-last paragraph to clarify that Canopy is based in Canada, with a U.S.-listed stock. )This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Tara Lachapelle is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering the business of entertainment and telecommunications, as well as broader deals.

12-11-2020||World||Hong Kong row: China has again breached law, says UK||The disqualification of four Hong Kong legislators constitutes another breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on the island’s handover to China in 1997, the Boris Johnson government said on Thursday, and summoned the Chinese envoy to express “deep concern”.The Foreign Office said that the disqualification breaches both China’s commitment that Hong Kong will enjoy a “high degree of autonomy” and the right to freedom of speech guaranteed under Paragraph 3 and Annex I of the declaration.This is the third time since 1997 that China has breached the legally-binding declaration; the first was in 2016; the second in June 2020 when Beijing introduced the Hong Kong National Security Legislation, officials added. Sanctions may be considered with the UK’s allies.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said: “Beijing’s imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong constitutes a clear breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration”.“China has once again broken its promises and undermined Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy. The UK will stand up for the people of Hong Kong, and call out violations of their rights and freedoms. With our international partners, we will hold China to the obligations it freely assumed under international law”, he added.On Wednesday, China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee decided that any Hong Kong legislator who promotes or supports Hong Kong independence, refuses to recognise China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong, seeks foreign countries to interfere in the affairs of Hong Kong, or endangers the national security of Hong Kong, will be in breach of the parliamentary oath and should be disqualified from membership of the Hong Kong Legislative Council.The decision led to the immediate removal of four elected members. All other pro-democracy legislators said they would resign en masse.According to the Foreign Office, Beijing’s move is part of a pattern apparently designed to harass and stifle voices critical of China’s policies; the new rules for disqualification are seen by London as providing a further tool in the campaign, with vague criteria open to wide-ranging interpretation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-row-china-has-again-breached-law-says-uk/story-UsyNcPmMlPhZnmavUF8K5H.html

12-11-2020||World||UK summons China envoy, declares Hong Kong treaty breach||The UK summoned China’s ambassador to protest the disqualification of pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong, a move it said breaks the joint agreement on political and legal conditions in the former British colony.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Beijing’s new law barring any Hong Kong lawmakers who don’t recognize Chinese sovereignty undermines the territory’s “high degree of autonomy” protected in the Sino-British agreement.“The UK will stand up for the people of Hong Kong, and call out violations of their rights and freedoms,” Raab said in emailed statement on Thursday. “With our international partners, we will hold China to the obligations it freely assumed under international law.”The UK said it’s the second time in six months, and the third since the 1997 handover, that it has accused China of breaking the terms of the treaty.It comes against a backdrop of heightened political concerns in Britain about China’s behaviour, ranging from measures to quell dissent in Hong Kong to alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang, at the same time as growing Chinese involvement in key British infrastructure projects.Yet the move is unlikely to alter China’s stance on Hong Kong, especially if the U.K. takes no specific measures against the government. The Hong Kong branch of the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement China “strongly opposes defamatory comments by foreign politicians on the decision on Hong Kong.”Also Read | Xi Jinping challenges Joe Biden with move to snuff out Hong Kong dissentSanctionsUK lawmakers from across the political spectrum again called on the government to impose sanctions on Chinese officials, including against Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, whose government banished four legislators following the Chinese resolution this week.The resolution is the latest sign of China’s push to clamp down on dissent following anti-government protests last year. Beijing has since passed a series of measures asserting greater control over Hong Kong, first targeting democracy activists involved in street protests and now dissenters in democratic institutions set up under British colonial rule.But Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams declined to commit to sanctions on individuals involved in the crackdown.“We are constantly considering designations under our Magnitsky-style regime but it would not be helpful to speculate on the names under consideration,” he told Parliament on Thursday. Ministers are working within the United Nations to hold China to account for its “transgressions,” he said.UK Announces Law to Protect Key Assets From Foreign BuyersStill, China-skeptics in Johnson’s party are having an impact on the British policy toward Beijing. Earlier this year, they pressed the premier to ban Huawei Technologies Co. from the UK’s next-generation wireless networks, reversing an earlier decision to allow the company a role.This week, the government published a draft National Security and Investment Bill that would give ministers sweeping powers to intervene in foreign takeovers of British assets deemed a threat to national security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-summons-china-envoy-declares-hong-kong-treaty-breach/story-9OPwWQJOAqbmLONTql0fjN.html
12-11-2020||World||Study says misinformation could prompt people to turn against Covid-19 vaccines||Conspiracy theories and misinformation fuel mistrust in vaccines and could push levels that potential Covid-19 vaccines are taken in the United States and Britain below the rates needed to protect communities against the disease, a study found on Thursday.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The study of 8,000 people in the two countries found that fewer people would “definitely” take a Covid-19 vaccine than the 55% of the population scientists estimate is needed to provide so-called “herd immunity”.“Vaccines only work if people take them. Misinformation plays into existing anxieties and uncertainty around new (Covid)vaccines, as well as the new platforms that are being used to develop them,” said Heidi Larson, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who co-led the study.“This threatens to undermine the levels of Covid-19 vaccine acceptance,” added Larson, who is also director of the international Vaccine Confidence Project.The study comes as one of the major vaccine efforts showed promising results this week. Pfizer Inc said on Monday its experimental Covid-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on interim data from late stage trials. The data were seen as a crucial step in the battle to contain a pandemic that has killed more than a million people.In the misinformation study, 3,000 respondents in each country were exposed between June and August to widely circulating misinformation on social media about a Covid-19 vaccine. The remaining 1,000 in each country, acting as a control group, were shown factual information about Covid-19 vaccines.Also Read | Brazil resumes trials of Chinese Covid-19 vaccine candidateBefore being exposed to misinformation, 54% of those in the UK said they would “definitely” accept a vaccine, as did 41.2% in the United States. But after being shown the online misinformation, that number fell by 6.4 percentage points in the UK group, and by 2.4 percentage points in the United States.In both countries, people without a college degree, those in low-income groups and non-whites are more likely to reject a Covid-19 vaccine, the study found.Women were more likely than men to refuse a Covid-19 vaccine, but more respondents in both countries said they would accept a vaccine if it meant protecting family, friends, or at-risk groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-says-misinformation-could-prompt-people-to-turn-against-covid-19-vaccines/story-4vrJsiEcrIk0yQPgGkF8BM.html
12-11-2020||World||Google Photos to update pricing policy, caps free storage limit from June 2021||Come June 1, 2021, Google Photos would end their free storage services, as announced by Shimrit Ben-Yair, vice president of Google Photos, in tech giant’s official blog. The product was launched primarily as a picture and video storage cloud service by Google for its smartphone users. It later expanded to encompass a wide range of functionalities, namely, storage, management of pictures and videos, editing and memories of past events. While the free storage would not completely be scrapped, a cap on the maximum free storage space for high quality images and videos would be set at 15 gigabytes per account. This would imply that the users in need of more than 15 GB space for high quality content would be charged as per the costing and storage requirements.Google has also made it clear that the existing high quality content would be independent of this change next year.Considering that this is a big change given the magnitude of the users, Google has also assured that they have to make no decisions about the changes to the app presently. The company also said that the announcement is being made well in advance for the users to be prepared for the new costing policy. When a user, after June 1, 2021, nears their storage limit of 15 GB, Google services would notify the user of the same via the Google Photos application and follow up via email.

Military analyst Ye Jianliang said that it is imperative for China to improve its military might to match its economic strength.The military had to be more proactive in designing how the war was fought, rather than just responding to conflicts, he said.“(China has to) keep pace with the developments of the times and emphasise the use of smart technologies to achieve interdisciplinary innovation,” Xu said.That would involve modernising military theories, formations, personnel and strategic management, he was quoted as saying.“Always bear in mind that (a nation) is in danger if it forgets about war or makes inadequate preparations for war,” Xu said.His comments were echoed in another article in the booklet, which said modernisation was essential to making an intelligent military, the Post report said.“A new round of scientific and technological revolution, industrial revolution and military revolution is evolving rapidly…it’s a global trend to build an intelligent military,” it said.The transformation process should be about creating a fighting force that is less labour-intensive and more focused on new technology, much of it home-grown, it said.Military analyst Ye Jianliang said in his article in the booklet that China’s defence capabilities do not match its status in the international community or its national security needs. “History has repeatedly proven that a strong nation can only be built with both economic and military power … when the ‘sword’ is not sharp enough, a nation may fall,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-military-lays-out-technology-roadmap-to-catch-up-with-us-by-2027-report/story-2AQv4c85AhN45w6rRnnFJM.html

The world’s largest gaming firm by revenue has benefited from healthy growth of paying users for video games in China and international markets. Its flagship game Honor of Kings reported a record 100 million daily active users in the first 10 months of 2020. Tencent made 38.5 billion yuan ($5.8 billion) profit for the three months through September. That was ahead of an analyst average estimate of 30.81 billion yuan, according to data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 29% to 125.4 billion yuan.The Chinese group has a solid pipeline of new games waiting to be released, including a recent testing launch of a mobile version of League of Legends in Asia.The company also saw a return to normalcy in advertising activity following the Covid-19 outbreak, with rapid growth in sectors such as education, internet services and e-commerce platforms.Its shares closed 4.72% up, against a 0.22% decline in the Hang Seng index.They rebounded from a 7% plunge on Wednesday - when Tencent celebrated its 22nd birthday - as investors dumped shares in Chinese tech companies following publication of draft anti-monopoly rules that also wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars off some tech giants including Alibaba.Tencent said revenue from its cloud and other business services, a potential future growth engine, were affected by the lingering impact of the pandemic, such as delays in project deployment and new contract sign-ups. “The year-on-year revenue growth rate was therefore lower than previous quarters, which we expect to be temporary in nature,” Tencent said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tencent-s-profit-surges-89-as-chinese-giant-rides-on-gaming-boom/story-V0GVGIY5uRR9bdRAYZtGSL.html
12-11-2020||World||US envoy insists pressure on Iran will persist under Joe Biden||The US special representative for Iran insisted Thursday a pressure campaign of sanctions targeting Iran would persist into the administration of Joe Biden, even as the president-elect has pledged to potentially return America to Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers.Elliot Abrams, who also serves as the US special representative to Venezuela, said sanctions targeting Iran for human rights violations, its ballistic missile program, and its regional influence would go on.That, as well as continued scrutiny by United Nations inspectors and American partners in the Mideast, would maintain that pressure, he said.Iran now has far more uranium than allowed under the deal since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord in 2018.The Mideast also has been roiled by tensions between Tehran and Washington, which pushed the two countries to the brink of war at the beginning of the year.“Even if you went back to the (deal) and even if the Iranians were willing to return, this newly enriched uranium, you would not have solved these really fundamental questions of whether Iran is going to be permitted to violate long-term commitments it has made to the world community,” Abrams told The Associated Press in an interview at the US Embassy in Abu Dhabi.Iran’s mission to the UN did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Abram’s remarks. Its politicians have increasingly discussed the possibility of the US returning to the deal, which saw Iran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctionsAbrams replaced Brian Hook as America’s envoy on Iran, who announced he’d leave his post in August after serving as the face of Trump’s maximum-pressure campaign.That effort has floundered internationally as the US and its Gulf Arab allies failed to convince the United Nations to stop an arms embargo on Iran from expiring in October. Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile, which would have been under 300 kilograms (660 pounds) in the deal, now stands at over 2,440 kilograms (5,380 pounds) , according to the latest report by UN inspectors.That’s potentially enough material to make at least two nuclear weapons, experts say, if Iran chose to pursue the bomb.Iran also is enriching uranium to as much as 4.5 per cent purity, higher than allowed under the accord but still far lower than weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent. Tehran abandoned all limits on its enrichment months after Trump’s pullout from the agreement, even as the deal’s other international partners China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Germany have tried unsuccessfully to salvage it.Meanwhile, Iran has begun construction at its underground Natanz enrichment site after a fire and explosion it described as “sabotage” struck its advanced centrifuge assembly plant in July.Abrams described the construction as “another Iranian challenge” to the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA), the UN agency that Iran still allows to monitor its nuclear sites. He also criticized Iran for its slow response in allowing the IAEA to investigate a suspicious site outside of Tehran where it discovered particles of uranium of man-made origin.Iran long has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, the IAEA has said Iran “carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device” in a “structured program” through the end of 2003.“Iran denies that it ever had a nuclear weapons program,” Abrams said. “Therefore, it can’t now say, well, things you found from 2003, were part of our old nuclear weapons program. They’re caught in their own lie.”  Abrams mentioned US citizens still imprisoned by Iran, who activists and their families insist are chips in future negotiations. He also said the United Arab Emirates’ normalisation deal with Israel also put new pressure on Iran, especially as the US plans a USD 23 billion arms deal for Emiratis to purchase F-35 stealth fighter jets and drones.“I hope that next year the leverage that we’ve built up through our sanctions program is used (with) any form of pressure including, for example, Iranian fears about a developing relationship between Israel and Arab states in the region,” he stated.  “All of this pressure should be brought to bear to get Iran to change its conduct.” In the 1980s, during the Reagan administration, Abrams worked in the State Department and convinced the sultan of Brunei to deposit USD 10 million in a White House-controlled Swiss bank account to aid Nicaragua’s Contra rebels despite a Congressional ban. But the White House later put the money into the wrong account in a clerical error, as investigators later discovered.Abrams, now 72, ultimately cooperated with those investigating the so-called Iran-Contra Affair and pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges. Then-President George HW Bush pardoned him in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-insists-pressure-on-iran-will-persist-under-joe-biden/story-75V0kQKNoHR1EurLVw0RuO.html
12-11-2020||World||Brexit talks go into next week, with EU and UK divided||Negotiations to secure an EU-UK trade deal will stretch to next week, officials said Thursday, with an EU leaders summit on November 19 perhaps the last chance to strike an accord.“We are working hard for a deal. Talks will continue in London over the weekend and will take place in Brussels next week,” EU spokesman Daniel Ferrie told AFP.Negotiations between London and Brussels have been snagged on the same issues for months, mainly fisheries and ensuring the “level playing field” to maintain fair competition between UK and EU firms.An EU diplomat closely following the talks said that despite their intensity, “nothing has changed” and that the UK had even backtracked on earlier compromise positions.“The deal will have to be done in Brussels next week, otherwise there is no deal,” the diplomat warned, circling an EU video summit next Thursday as the deadline.Read | Brexit, Covid-19 and climate colluding to raise UK food pricesTime is short since both the EU and UK parliaments must ratify the pact by January 1, when a post-Brexit transition period comes to a close.Any deal would have to go through detailed legal drafting in time for a vote of European Parliament on December 16, although this date could theoretically be delayed.“There needs to be something... or there will be nothing at all,” the diplomat insisted, but a European source said that “as of yet”, Brexit was not even on the summit agenda.As talks pressed on in London, senior UK minister Michael Gove told the British parliament that “progress is being made, but divergences remain.”On Saturday, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said that whilst an agreement is likely, “it is quite possible that this could fall apart and we don’t get a deal.“If we can’t get a deal done it will represent an extraordinary failure of politics and diplomacy,” he added.bur-arp/dc/bmm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-talks-go-into-next-week-with-eu-and-uk-divided/story-ISAnXtWqeGMimESH1k54JM.html
12-11-2020||World||UK first country in Europe to cross 50,000 Covid-19 deaths||The UK has become the first country in Europe to cross the grim milestone of 50,000 Covid-19 related deaths as Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, “we mourn everybody who’s gone”.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19As per the official figures released by the government, 1,256,725 people have tested positive for the virus after 22,950 new cases were recorded this week. A further 595 fatalities due to the deadly viral infection on Wednesday took the death toll to 50,365, making the UK the fifth country in the world to cross the 50,000-mark after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. “We’re not out of the woods yet. Every death is a tragedy, we mourn everybody who’s gone and our feelings are with their families and friends,” Johnson said.“It is a global pandemic whose effects, whose treatments, whose implications for the economy, all those have been becoming clearer as the months have gone on,” he said. The grim death toll comes as news of a possible new effective vaccine being ready by the end of the year hit the global headlines earlier this week. However, Johnson has previously warned that it is still “very, very early days” for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. “It is still some way off. And we absolutely cannot rely on this as a solution,” he said, urging people to continue to follow the strict lockdown rules in order to keep the rate of infections in check. Meanwhile, the UK government has been expanding its mass testing capabilities, with an initial pilot in the city of Liverpool being expanded to further cities and also for students on university campuses wanting to travel back home for Christmas after lockdown is lifted from December 2. “We are absolutely committed to using the latest testing technology to make asymptomatic testing available in more areas,” said UK Health Minister Lord James Bethell. “It is right we’ve taken a dual-track approach to evaluating this technology – by piloting them in the field so we can understand how to best make these tests available, and by getting our world-leading academics and clinicians to undertake rigorous evaluation of their ability to detect the virus. I’m delighted that both are already demonstrating that lateral flow tests can be the reliable, highly sensitive technology we need to help get this virus under control, and return to as close to normality as possible,” he said. Lateral flow tests are rapid turnaround tests that can process Covid-19 samples on site without the need for laboratory equipment, with most generating results in under half an hour. As part of the UK government’s strategy for testing the effectiveness of this new technology, these new tests are being piloted across England.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-first-country-in-europe-to-cross-50-000-covid-19-deaths/story-2wEP9EPieM43se8CL9bToJ.html
12-11-2020||World||Italian hospitals face breaking point in fall coronavirus surge||Dr. Luca Cabrini was certain his hospital in the heart of Lombardy‘s lake district would reach its breaking point caring for 300 Covid-19 patients. So far, virus patients fill 500 beds and counting.Italy, which shocked the world and itself when hospitals in the wealthy north were overwhelmed with coronavirus cases last spring, is again facing a systemic crisis, as confirmed positives pass the symbolic threshold of 1 million.“We are very close to not keeping up. I cannot say when we will reach the limit, but that day is not far off,’’ said Cabrini, who runs the intensive care ward at Varese’s Circolo hospital, the largest in the province of 1 million people northwest of Milan.The hospital expanded its 20-bed ICU ward to 45 beds during Italy’s deadly spring peak. It had 38 patients last weekend, and Cabrini was preparing to set up beds in an operating theater this week, “something we would have preferred to avoid.”As dire as Italy’s ICU situation is once again, it’s not critical care that is most worrying doctors during the pandemic’s autumn resurgence. It’s sub-intensive and infectious disease wards caring for less gravely ill patients, who are often younger and sometimes require care for longer periods.The Italian doctors federation called this week for a nationwide lockdown to forestall a collapse of the medical system, marked by the closure of non-emergency procedures. The Government is facing tougher criticism than in the spring, when the health crisis was met with an outpouring of solidarity.As of Wednesday, 52 per cent of Italy’s hospital beds were occupied by Covid-19 patients, above the 40 per cent warning threshold set by the Health Ministry. Nine of Italy’s 21 regions and autonomous provinces are already securely in the red-alert zone, above 50 per cent virus occupancy, with Lombardy at 75 per cent, Piedmont at 92 per cent and South Tyrol at an astonishing 99 per cent.Lombardy, Italy’s most populous and productive region, is again the epicenter of Italy’s pandemic.The region’s hospitals are responding by reorganizing wards in a bid to avoid shutting down ordinary care, as happened spontaneously during Italy’s first deadly coronavirus spike. Still, hospitals in Lombardy and neighbouring Piedmont — designated red zones by the government last week — have closed surgical, pediatric, and geriatric wards to make room for Covid patients. Veneto, still a lowest-tier yellow zone, is preparing to cancel all non-urgent procedures this week.“We must continue to offer at least a minimum of services to all the other pathologies,” Cabrini said. “If we close our emergency room, it means a population of 1 million people will be without urgent care. We cannot let that happen.”Doctors regret that a tougher line wasn’t held this summer, when infections dropped. Instead of consolidating the gains, Italians headed to the beaches, setting the stage for the fall surge. Restrictions like curfews “could have been enacted earlier to try to stem the expansion of the pandemic,” said Filippo Anelli, head of the Italian Doctors’ Federation. But the government waited until the upward curve was irrefutable.The situation has been complicated by the fact that the partial lockdown imposed on five Italian regions allows for more freedoms than during Italy’s near-total 10-week lockdown in March and April. As a result, ordinary maladies and traumas continue to fill emergency rooms, even as the government acknowledged recently that it has lost count of coronavirus outbreaks and is not able to trace the chains of transmission.The average age of coronavirus patients being hospitalized in Italy has gone down this fall, even if the most severe cases winding up in ICU wards are still among the elderly. At the same time, the average hospital stay has lengthened. Dr. Massimo Puoti, head of infectious disease at Milan’s Niguarda hospital, said that was partly due to delays in getting access to tests and a days-long wait for test results, meaning patients often were admitted at a more advanced stage of infection.Nationwide, virus hospitalizations rose 68 per cent from Oct. 19-25, a whopping total of 12,006 admissions over seven days, just as the Italian government moved to close restaurants and bars at 6 p.m., and completely shutter theaters, gyms, and swimming pools.Hospitals are now struggling to find enough trained specialists, especially anesthesiologists for critical care units, and other medical personnel to cover for doctors and nurses under quarantine after falling ill or being exposed.Health officials are especially concerned because the virus is no longer contained to northern Italy but is spreading to the south, with its more fragile health care system. And Italy’s new epicenter, spanning from Varese to Milan, finds itself again getting walloped by the pandemic this fall after only the briefest of respites this summer.“Imagine a narrow and high tsunami that dramatically fractured, as if during a war, the health resources in these provinces,’’ Dr. Puoti said, describing the deadly coronavirus peak that wreaked havoc on Italy’s Bergamo, Cremona and Lodi provinces in March and April.“Now what we are experiencing is a wave that is a little different. A little less tall and more wide, with volumes that risk being even higher than we had in March,” he said.To take pressure off Milan’s main hospital, Niguarda has taken over a module at a field hospital in the city’s old convention center that reopened in late October.Varese’s Circolo Hospital has already distributed less critical patients to two smaller hospitals in the same district — something that wasn’t necessary in the first outbreak — and Dr. Cabrini has appealed to regional authorities to find beds elsewhere so non-virus patients can continue to receive treatment.“There are still people who don’t believe that the second wave has arrived,” Dr. Cabrini said. “But I see the river of people who are arriving in the emergency room. If we don’t turn this around, and if people cannot get treated not only in Varese, but in Turin and Milan, then our backs are to the wall.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-hospitals-face-breaking-point-in-fall-coronavirus-surge/story-LzAN8qEpeDi6YldaZVctBM.html
12-11-2020||World||Dozens of fake Bolsonaros are running in Brazilian elections||Running for office in Brazil’s municipal elections this weekend are, in no particular order, Adilson Bolsonaro, Aldo Bolsonaro, Angela Bolsonaro, Fernanda Bolsonaro, Zezinho Bolsonaro, Junior Bolsonaro, Maclaiten Bolsonaro, Cabo Ramos Bolsonaro, and Wesley Bolsonaro.None of them are related to the Bolsonaro, the president, Jair, and in fact none of them are actually even named Bolsonaro. But in a sign of just how wildly popular his Trump-ian brand of conservative politics is in many parts of the Brazilian hinterland, scores of candidates are tacking Bolsonaro onto their registered names appearing on ballots this Sunday. In all, more than 70 politicians have adopted it.“His popularity is growing every day,” said Jair Sousa Silva, a former evangelical pastor who’s running under the name Jair Bolsonaro for a city council seat in a town in the Amazon. “When I’m asking for votes from my brothers of faith, I’m known as Brother Jair, Pastor Jair, and also Jair Bolsonaro.”The real Jair Bolsonaro is polling better nationally than he ever has before. Yes, his detractors blame him for bungling the medical response to the pandemic, which has claimed more than 160,000 lives, but his administration’s decision to fork over large Covid relief checks to one third of Brazilians has cut into poverty and shored up his support. Sunday’s elections, with all the Bolsonaros and Bolsonaro allies on ballots across the country, will serve as something of a referendum on the president two years before he faces re-election.There’s nothing illegal about borrowing a celebrity’s name to create a political nickname in Brazil. There’s a long tradition of it here, a country where politics often have a certain zany flair to them. Lula -- as the leftist leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was known to everyone, was a popular one years ago, and to this day appears on a smattering of ballots across the country.Even as the government phases out the emergency payments that have boosted Bolsonaro’s popularity this year, many candidates are still trying tag along after the president. Most of them are disputing elections in smaller cities where government financial help has played an outsize role in the economic recovery.The few exceptions are family members who are running in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, including Carlos Bolsonaro, the president’s son who seeks re-election as a Rio councilman.“Bolsonaro’s name is very powerful here, I really believe it will help me get elected,” Joao Claudio “Bolsonaro” Tozzi said in an interview. A construction worker, he is running for the city council of Goioere, a small town in the southern state of Parana which gave the president more than 68 per cent of votes in 2018.In daily live transmissions this week, Bolsonaro has been endorsing some of those candidates, but it’s unclear whether his support will make a meaningful difference or not. While there are few electoral surveys for city counselors, candidates for mayor who have received the president’s explicit support are trailing in opinion polls. Among them are Rio de Janeiro Mayor Marcelo Crivella, running for re-election, and Celso Russomanno, who’s trying to unseat current Sao Paulo Mayor Bruno Covas.‘Ronald Trump’Brazil’s electoral legislation allows candidates to pick a nickname by which they’re widely known. The process is rather subjective, however, making room for unusual ballot names including “Ronald Trump” or “Donald Trump Bolsonaro”, two real candidates this year.“In theory, the electoral court could demand proof of those claims, but as no one disputes them, those types of nicknames are validated,” said Henrique Neves, a former judge with Brazil’s top electoral court.Brazil’s fragmented political system with about 40 different parties, many of them regularly rebranding themselves, also puts emphasis on strong individual contenders or celebrity candidates. Bolsonaro himself got elected by the Social Liberal Party, ditched it months after taking office, and has so far failed to created his own party, the so-called Alliance for Brazil.With his popularity being tested during the municipal elections, the president has said he doesn’t care if someone uses his name in the ballots.“There are more than 550,000 candidates around the country; It’s impossible to keep tabs,” Bolsonaro recently told supporters in front of his official residence. “Some of them are hoping to win votes with my name and that’s OK.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-fake-bolsonaros-are-running-in-brazilian-elections/story-PJybBCsifi0M206m0GiCuN.html
12-11-2020||World||Pakistan’s air force film, featuring a dogfight in ‘eastern sector’, premieres in China||A Pakistani movie showing the JF-17 fighter aircraft jointly developed with China and referencing a dogfight with Mirage-2000s flown by the Indian air force premiered in Beijing on Wednesday.The first Pakistani film to be released in China in decades, Parwaaz Hai Junoon (The Soaring Ambition) will be released in theatres on November 13.Its release comes in the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan in May 1951.China’s official media noted a comparison made in the 2018 movie between the JF-17 – a fourth generation fighter aircraft jointly developed between China and Pakistan – and the French-made Mirage-2000, deployed by the Indian Air Force and used during the Kargil war in 1999.A dogfight early in the movie shows Pakistani air force fighting three Mirage-2000s, which had flown in from the eastern sector.Later in the movie, Pakistani fighter pilots are also shown carrying out strikes against the Taliban.“In one of the film’s highlights a JF-17, a fourth-generation fighter jointly developed by China and Pakistan, makes a surprise appearance,” the nationalistic tabloid Global Times said in a report on the movie premier.“In the movie, a teacher at the air force academy asks students to compare the JF-17 with Mirage 2000 in class. A student answers that the JF-17 has three advantages including flexibility and safety and is complimented by the teacher,” the report said.The movie’s release comes in the backdrop of worsening Sino-India ties amid the ongoing border friction in eastern Ladakh.Chinese official media has hailed the release as a sign of close ties between China and Pakistan.Pakistani ambassador to China Moin ul Haque, who attended the premiere, was quoted as saying that more Pakistani films and TV dramas will be released here to help Chinese people better understand Pakistani culture and strengthen the two countries’ friendship.The agreement to bring the film to the mainland was signed in April 2019 at a China-Pakistan economic and trade cooperation forum during the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.Chinese state media reports highlighted that The Soaring Ambition will be the first Pakistani movie to be released in China in several decades.Bollywood-made Hindi movies, despite strained Sino-India ties, have an audience in China.The Aamir Khan-starrer Dangal, for example, was an unexpected hit in China in 2017, making more than $200 million and becoming the highest-grossing non-English movie here.A handful of low-budget China-Pakistan film collaborations are underway, the entertainment portal, Variety.com, reported in October.The report said that The Journey, announced at a Shanghai Cooperation Organistion (SCO) Film Festival at a ceremony with actor Jackie Chan in attendance, tells the stories of real-life Chinese businesses participating in international trade with Pakistan through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor – part of the Belt and Road Initiative - Beijing’s multi-billion dollar package of infrastructure projects in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-air-force-film-featuring-a-dogfight-in-eastern-sector-premiers-in-china/story-kY4d1OaNUY8BDhYTSEIv8L.html
12-11-2020||World||WhatsApp under scrutiny as Germany probes messaging apps||Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp and other messaging services will be investigated by German regulators, who will check how they handle users’ personal information and whether being able to send messages between different providers could boost privacy.Germany’s Federal Cartel Office said on Thursday it opened a sector inquiry into messenger services, citing possible violations of consumer protection law. It said the probe may also help regulators “gain insight” into whether enabling apps to send messages to each other could prompt users to choose services that do more to protect privacy.“It is questionable whether and to what extent these services protect personal data,” Andreas Mundt, the regulator’s president, said in the statement. The probe will “also examine whether and to what extent improved interoperability could play a role in, for example, the consumers’ choice of suppliers which offer better data protection.”WhatsApp is the most used messaging app for Germans using Android devices with more than 7 million daily users, according to Statista. Facebook’s Messenger follows with 2.8 milion daily users and Microsoft Corp.’s Skype has some 1.8 million daily users.Facebook declined to immediately comment on the investigation.WhatsApp only shares limited information with Facebook companies to help identify users and doesn’t share data that would aid ad targeting on Facebook. The company said it will only share such data if it has approval from Irish privacy regulators, who govern Facebook’s business in Europe.Facebook was last a target of the Federal Cartel Office over an antitrust investigation that focused on how the social network tracks users’ web use. Facebook earlier this year lost a court challenge to the 2019 ruling that ordered it to stop freely collecting and using data and combining it with users’ Facebook accounts without their consent.The authority broke new ground by using antitrust law to tackle data privacy. It has no power under consumer law to order a company to stop certain behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/whatsapp-under-scrutiny-as-germany-probes-messaging-apps/story-XtOZbPFxCa9MKWJVLJ2UgP.html
12-11-2020||World||Xi Jinping challenges Joe Biden with move to snuff out Hong Kong dissent||President Xi Jinping effectively neutered the most democratic institution under China’s rule, sending a message to Joe Biden that no amount of pressure will prompt him to tolerate dissent against the Communist Party.China’s top legislative body on Wednesday passed a resolution allowing for the disqualification of any Hong Kong lawmakers who aren’t deemed sufficiently loyal. Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s government immediately banished four legislators, prompting the remaining 15 in the 70-seat Legislative Council to resign en masse.“This move makes it clear that dictatorship has descended onto Hong Kong and that Chinese Communist Party can eradicate all opposing voices in the legislature,” Fernando Cheung, one of the lawmakers, told Bloomberg News. “There’s no more separation of powers, no more ‘one country, two systems,’ and therefore no more Hong Kong as we know it.”The resolution is the latest sign of China’s determination to rein in dissent in the wake of anti-government protests last year calling for meaningful elections in the semi-autonomous territory. Beijing has since passed a series of measures asserting greater control over Hong Kong, first targeting democracy activists who hit the streets and now going after dissenters in democratic institutions set up under British colonial rule.Lawmakers began tendering their resignations on Thursday, according to Radio Television Hong Kong. Claudia Mo, a prominent pro-democratic voice during last summer’s protests, showed up to resign wearing a black t-shirt -- a garment favored by demonstrators -- and carrying a yellow umbrella, which became the symbol of Occupy protests in 2014.China has already shown disdain for the Legislative Council, bypassing it in June to impose sweeping national security legislation that undercut the “one country, two systems” framework that had long attracted investors to the financial hub. The Group of Seven nations accused China of violating the terms of its handover agreement with the UK, while the Trump administration revoked many special privileges granted to the city and sanctioned more than a dozen senior officials who oversee the territory.Beijing’s latest move was not met by any street protests, which have mostly dissipated amid pandemic-era social distancing restrictions and the enactment of the national security law.Biden’s win presents an opportunity to reset relations between the world’s two biggest economies, even though the former vice president called Xi a “thug” on the campaign trail and has vowed to “fully enforce” laws punishing Beijing for eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy. Yet China’s move on Wednesday doesn’t leave him many options for a detente, particularly given how the city has long sat at the crossroads of Western democracy and Communist rule.Western governments including the UK and Australia condemned China’s move while US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien warned of new sanctions in a statement Wednesday evening. China’s powerful Liaison Office in Hong Kong, however, released a statement saying the opposition’s resignation wouldn’t change the government’s mind.China on Thursday called foreign governments’ criticism “wanton accusations” and said it was normal for public servants to pledge allegiance in other countries.The NPC’s move “is conducive to safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests and Hong Hong’s long-term stability, security and prosperity,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing, saying Beijing firmly supported Hong Kong authorities.A ‘Sad Day’“With this decision, China shows that it doesn’t care about the West, about the U.S.,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University’s government and international studies department, who has written several books on Chinese politics and foreign policy. “It’s going to be very hard for Biden to relax the U.S. policy on China and Hong Kong. How can you relax the sanctions? It’s a very sad day for Hong Kong.”The decision of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee is “conducive to the long-term peace and stability, as well as prosperity and development of Hong Kong,” Chairman Li Zhanshu said at the close of its two-day meeting. Offenses included supporting Hong Kong independence, refusing to recognize China’s sovereignty over the city, asking foreign countries to intervene, failing to uphold the territory’s Basic Law or pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and “engaging in any other acts that endanger national security,” said Lam, Hong Kong’s leader.“We need to have a political body that’s composed of patriots,” Lam said at a briefing on Wednesday, echoing similar statements from China’s top agencies overseeing Hong Kong. She dismissed concerns that Hong Kong would have a “rubber-stamp” legislature if the pro-democracy members resigned, saying she welcomes “diverse opinion.”The lawmakers disqualified Wednesday -- Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung -- were among the body’s more moderate members, and not known proponents of independence. They were among 12 candidates barred in July from seeking election for, among other things, vowing to “indiscriminately” vote down legislative proposals, a reference to the opposition’s plan to exercise a constitutional provision that would force Lam to resign if her budget failed to pass.Pressed on whether she was seeking to ban parliamentary delay tactics common to legislatures around the world, Lam said “it’s all a matter of degree” and pledged to “respect the check-and-balance responsibility” of the body.“They want to turn the Legislative Council into the National People’s Congress,” pro-democracy lawmaker James To said as the opposition vowed to resign at an evening briefing on Wednesday. Lawmakers held hands and chanted protest slogans, including “Hong Kong, add oil -- Together we stand.”Prior to the decision, the Hong Kong government had postponed an election for the Legislative Council for a year citing coronavirus concerns. The decision on Wednesday means that authorities will now be able to effectively oust any lawmakers who stand in the way of Beijing’s agenda, according to Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and author of “City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong.”“It means, effectively, the end of meaningful opposition in Hong Kong and the acceleration of the integration of Hong Kong into the mainland party-state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-challenges-joe-biden-with-move-to-snuff-out-hong-kong-dissent/story-VcKvllFNhu7vxM9FGuxDmM.html
12-11-2020||World||Taiwan reaches out to Joe Biden in hope of repeating 2016 Trump call||Taiwan is hoping to repeat a convention-breaking telephone call with the incoming US president, in defiance of warnings from China.Taiwan’s government is in discussions over arranging a phone call between President Tsai Ing-wen and Joe Biden, foreign minister Joseph Wu told lawmakers in Taipei on Thursday.“On the topic of congratulating the U.S. president-elect, we will do it in the most appropriate way,” Wu said. “We are communicating about this. We are considering various ways, including a phone call, to congratulate the new president.”Four years ago, Donald Trump took a congratulatory call from Tsai, the first time a US president-elect had spoken to a Taiwanese head of state since Washington broke ties with Taipei in 1979. The Communist government in Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory despite never having controlled the island, dismissed the call as a gimmick.Asked by lawmakers if a Biden refusal to take Tsai’s call would represent a diplomatic setback for Taiwan, Wu said any call would have no bearing on the health of ties with the US.Tsai was among the first to congratulate Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on their election victory, saying in a tweet that she looked forward to working together to further strengthen US-Taiwan relations and contributions to international society.Biden’s acceptance or refusal of a phone call with Tsai will go a long way to clarifying whether he plans to continue the Trump administration’s tough stance on China -- or show greater deference to Chinese sensitivities, especially in his dealings with Taipei. While Biden offered to deepen ties with Taiwan in an op-ed in the largest US-based Chinese-language newspaper last month, he has stopped short of offering specifics on which parts of Trump-era China policies he would change.Biden spoke to the leaders of Japan and South Korea on Thursday, reassuring them of his commitment to maintaining security alliances with both countries. While the US doesn’t formally recognize Taiwan as a country, Washington is the democratic island’s main security backstop against Beijing’s ongoing threats of invasion.The Trump administration last week agreed to sell Taiwan four Reaper drones, the latest in almost $5 billion of military sales announced over the past few weeks designed to make Chinese strategists think twice about attempting to capture the island. The sales come as China’s air force continues to pile pressure on Taiwan, with regular sojourns into the island’s Air Defense Identification Zone, or ADIZ.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-reaches-out-to-joe-biden-in-hope-of-repeating-2016-trump-call/story-fnlZAv4L6p02sZ03PUt4zJ.html
12-11-2020||World||US witnessing the longest Covid-19 upsurge and why it will go longer||The United States has been reporting record high coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic, but this time the wave is stronger and longer than what the US witnessed in march-April or in June-July.The trajectory of Covid-19, as experts have projected, will continue moving higher with the onset of winter. Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19As per the Johns Hopkins University data, the US recorded 135,290 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, resulting in a hike in seven-day average to a record 123,448 cases. The average deaths reported in the country has also gone above the seven-day average of 1,000 since August 20 for the first time. The upsurge in the Covid-19 cases in the US began in mid-September and is now running in its ninth week, a wave longer than that of tragical March-April and hard June-July. The situation has been aggravated by pandemic fatigue as Americans are making less effort now to follow social distancing rules. The third wave that began from a higher base of cases has also led to an overwhelming amount of hospitalisations. The rise in Covid-19 related hospitalisations started more than seven weeks ago, which has been the longest in the country uptil now.On Tuesday, states like South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Nebraska and Illinois recorded the highest current hospitalisation per capita. Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico and Colorado reported single-day record cases.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-witnessing-the-longest-covid-19-upsurge-and-why-it-will-go-longer/story-InbvtgxC8C9Vzzh6Gg36AI.html
12-11-2020||World||Study shows why masks with exhalation valves do not slow Covid-19 spread||Scientists have used high-speed videos of air flow to show why masks with exhalation valves do not slow the spread of Covid-19. The researchers from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US created the videos which show airflow patterns through masks with and without exhalation valves.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 “When you compare the videos side by side, the difference is striking,” said NIST research engineer Matthew Staymates, corresponding author of the study published in the journal Physics of Fluids. “These videos show how the valves allow air to leave the mask without filtering it, which defeats the purpose of the mask,” Staymates said. Exhalation valves, which make masks easier to breathe through and more comfortable, are appropriate when the mask is meant to protect the wearer, the researchers said. For instance, valved masks can protect workers from dust at a construction site or hospital workers from infected patients, they said. Staymates created two videos using different flow visualisation techniques. The first video was created using what is known as a schlieren imaging system, which causes differences in air density to show up on camera as patterns of shadow and light. With this system, exhaled breath becomes visible because it is warmer, and therefore less dense, than the surrounding air. Staymates created the second video using a light-scattering technique.Also Read |  Zydus Cadila completes phase 2 clinical trial in Covid-19 patients with Hepatitis C biological therapy PegiHep He built an apparatus that emits air at the same velocity and tempo as a resting adult, then connected that device to a mannequin. As a stand-in for exhaled droplets, the air carries water droplets in a range of sizes typical of the droplets that people emit in their breath when exhaling, speaking and coughing. A high-intensity LED light behind the mannequin illuminates the airborne droplets, causing them to scatter the light and show up brightly on camera. In contrast to the schlieren video, this video shows the movement of droplets in air. The droplets escape unfiltered through the valve of an N95 mask. The use of a mannequin and a mechanical breathing apparatus allowed Staymates to observe airflow patterns while holding steady the breathing rate, air pressure and other variables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-shows-why-masks-with-exhalation-valves-do-not-slow-covid-19-spread/story-IjdVFZGBm1W34Ntl49ZDlJ.html

His crime under Pakistani law? To call himself an Ahmadi Muslim, whose creed is ‘love for all, hatred for none’. Does my right honourable friend agree with me that hatred preached in Pakistan ends up on the streets, and it is in the interest of our own security that His Majesty’s government should make clear to Pakistan that state-supported persecution must end?” asked Ahmad Khan.Pakistan has been slammed for its treatment of minorities, who continue to face persecution in the hands of government authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-urges-pakistan-to-assure-fundamental-rights-of-citizens/story-wZCbX7KTxgD7nyikzYze8O.html

12-11-2020||World||Study reveals smell, taste changes act as early indicators of Covid-19 community spread||Self-reports of smell and taste changes can be earlier markers of the spread of the novel coronavirus than indicators based on hospital emergency room (ER) consultations, according to an international team of researchers.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 The team’s study, published in the journal Nature Communications, noted a decline in self-reports of smell and taste changes as early as five days after lockdown enforcement, with faster declines reported in countries that adopted the most stringent lockdown measures. “In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, many governments have taken drastic measures to prevent their intensive care units from becoming overwhelmed with patients,” said study co-author John Hayes, professor of food science at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in the US. “Our research suggests that an increase in the incidence of sudden smell and taste change in the general population may indicate that Covid-19 is spreading,” Hayes said. The researchers believe the findings could help decision-makers take important measures at the local level, either in catching new outbreaks sooner, or in guiding the relaxation of local lockdowns, given the strong impact of lockdown on economic and social activities.Also Read |  ‘Lockdown’ is Collins Word of the Year 2020 In the study, the scientists used data from the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research survey -- a global, crowd-sourced online study deployed in more than 35 languages. The team also particularly assessed data from the French government -- which beginning on May 7, 2020, has been categorising various geographical areas of the country as red or green, depending on their Covid-19 prevalence. Compared to green areas, they said the red areas were characterised by higher active circulation of the virus, higher levels of pressure on hospitals and reduced capacity to test new cases. The researchers then compared data from France with data from Italy and the UK, each of which implemented lockdown measures at different times and with different levels of stringency. “Our primary aim was to test the association between self-reported smell and taste changes and indicators of pressure in hospitals, such as Covid-related hospitalisations, critical care resuscitation unit admissions and mortality rates, for each French administrative region over the last three months,” said Veronica Pereda-Loth, a study co-author from the Universite Paul Sabatier Toulouse III in France. “Our secondary aim was to examine temporal relationships between the peak of smell and taste changes in the population and the peak of Covid-19 cases and the application of lockdown measures,” Pereda-Loth said.Also Read | Serum Institute completes phase 3 trial recruitment for Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine The study found that smell and taste changes were better correlated with the number of Covid-19 admissions to hospitals than France’s current governmental indicators, which look at the ratio of ER consultations for suspicion of Covid-19 to general ER consultations. According to the scientists, the peak onset of changes in smell/taste appeared four days after lockdown measures were implemented. In contrast, they said the governmental indicator based on ER consultations peaked 11 days after the lockdown. “Our findings are consistent with emerging data showing that Covid-19-related changes in smell and taste occur in the first few days after infection,” Hayes said. “They suggest that self-reports of smell and taste changes are closely associated with hospital overload and are early markers of the spread of infection of SARS-CoV-2,” he added. The scientists believe potential outbreaks and the short-term efficacy of a lockdown could be monitored by tracking changes in smell and taste in the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-reveals-smell-taste-changes-act-as-early-indicators-of-covid-19-community-spread/story-kZbKn0x8DXa5joxQEiaHAJ.html
12-11-2020||World||Japan braces for fresh Covid-19 record amid fears of winter wave||Japan is bracing for a new daily record of coronavirus infections Thursday amid the latest flareup, as authorities began hinting they may take stronger measures to arrest the increase.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister overseeing the country’s coronavirus response, said more stringent steps may be needed amid a clearer rising trend in cases, Jiji reported, the strongest indication yet from the national government that tougher action may be needed in a country that has largely escaped the worst of the pandemic.While numbers are low in absolute terms, a spike in northern Japan, which is seeing colder temperatures compared to the rest of the country, is leading to concern that cases could spread as winter sets in nationwide.The northern island of Hokkaido is already set to hit a daily record of around 230 cases, according to broadcaster FNN. The local government has already asked bars and other establishments to close early in the regional capital’s nightlife district.On Wednesday, Japan reported at least 1,546 new cases, nearing the high in August. Shares of Japanese stay-at-home stocks rose in Tokyo, with videogame and e-commerce stocks gaining while railways declined.‘Large Increase’Parts of the country where the weather remains relatively mild are already seeing upticks. The capital of Tokyo reported the largest figure in nearly three months on Wednesday, while Osaka reached a fresh high.“This could be the beginning of a sharp increase in infections,” said Norio Ohmagari, an infectious disease specialist advising Tokyo authorities, at a local government meeting. “We need to be on alert.”Japan has drawn attention from other nations for its ability to control the spread of the virus without mass-testing or enforced lockdowns. Despite two previous flareups, deaths and serious cases remain low, and hospitals haven’t been pushed to capacity. Life had been returning to normal, with sporting matches resuming, workers returning to offices and a successful campaign encouraging domestic travel.But in recent weeks, officials have expressed concern over the increasing variance of infection clusters, with cases rising in nursing homes, hospitals and schools. Experts have pointed to an increased spread among younger adults tired of social distancing, as well as within foreign communities, which may struggle due to language barriers and more limited access to health services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-braces-for-fresh-covid-19-record-amid-fears-of-winter-wave/story-UhL6bHlm8CV6sYo5wNizIO.html
12-11-2020||World||China Singles Day online sales touches record high||China’s annual Singles Day online shopping festival brings in big numbers every year but even by its own standards, the e-commerce event hit a new high this week, with e-commerce giant Alibaba raking in sales worth 498.2 billion yuan (roughly $75bn).Alibaba said on Thursday its sales marked a 26% increase from last year. The amount includes sales made on November 11 – called Singles Day in China – and during a three-day period between November 1 and 3.Along with JD.com, Alibaba racked up around $115bn in sales across their platforms during the Singles Day shopping event.Official media reported that e-commerce giant JD.com also scored big in the period, with sales topping 243.1bn yuan ($35.76bn) between November 1 and November 11 afternoon.This year’s event comes in the backdrop of the recovering Chinese economy, which had taken a battering because of the Coronavirus pandemic followed by the worst floods in decades.China seems to have broadly controlled the pandemic despite sporadic cases of small Covid-19 clusters that have broken out in cities like Urumqi and Qingdao.State media reported that the massive sales on Singles Day indicate a fast recovering economy.“At the shopping peak, 583,000 orders were made in a single second on Tmall, setting a new online shopping record,” official news agency, Xinhua reported late on Wednesday.More than 800 million shoppers, 250,000 brands and 5 million merchants participated in this year’s shopping spree, according to a statement by Tmall, Alibaba’s international e-commerce arm.“Notably, sales of JD’s fast-delivery grocery business soared a staggering 50-fold compared with the same period last year, while its sales of 5G smartphones spiked 11 folds,” the Xinhua report said.Sales of imported products for new mothers and babies on JD doubled year on year and mobile phones offering optimal gaming experience grew by 160%.“We have found that an increasing number of overseas brands chose to enter the Chinese market by opening their first store on Tmall Global,” said Liu Peng, president of Tmall Import and Export.Expecting a soaring demand for foreign goods, Tmall Global imported a huge variety of products from over 100 overseas farms, ranches, and wineries, including 1,000 tonnes of milk from Uruguay, 2.6 million bottles of French wine, and 2 tonnes of cubilose from Malaysia.About 25,000 overseas businesses from more than 220 countries and regions have participated in this year’s shopping spree on Tmall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-singles-day-online-sales-touches-record-high/story-capyqbfCiUFyUefSFfI9zJ.html
12-11-2020||World||Erdogan’s economy U-turn sparks market euphoria, some doubts||After more than two years of confrontation, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan signaled a cease-fire with international investors, pledging to support his new economic managers with market-friendly policies.Erdogan on Wednesday followed the ouster of the central bank chief and the departure of his son-in-law as economy czar in recent days with a commitment to contain inflation while putting Turkey on a sustainable growth path. Turkish assets soared, as investors saw a possible green light for interest-rate increases to stabilize a currency that has lost almost half its value against the dollar since May 2018.“Evidence has been rapidly accumulating that Turkey is eager to execute a dramatic shift in policy making back toward a more orthodox framework,” said Phoenix Kalen, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in London. “We believe that the central bank will implement a substantial interest-rate hike” next week, possibly as much as 4 percentage points to 14.25%.The currency gained 4.6% against the dollar on Wednesday. It’s headed for its biggest weekly gain in more than a decade even after retreating 0.6% on Thursday. The Borsa Istanbul 100 Index extended its winning streak to a ninth day, led by a surge in banking shares, which helped push Turkey’s benchmark gauge to an all-time high.Erdogan’s remarks mark a dramatic U-turn from an approach that has hammered Turkish markets the past two years. Shortly before he was sworn in under a new constitution with near-total authority in 2018, Erdogan promised to take full control of monetary policy to implement his unorthodox view that lower interest rates promote slower inflation.It didn’t work out, especially under the weight of the global recession spawned by the coronavirus pandemic.Currency InterventionsTo support the sinking lira, Turkish banks sold more than $100 billion this year alone, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. The effort saw net foreign-exchange reserves fall by more than half to $18.4 billion while money borrowed from banks under short-term swaps reached tens of billions of dollars. The lira touched consecutive record lows last week, extending 2020 losses to over 30%.The remarks by the 66-year-old president who has led the country since 2003 reflected those pressures. “Like everywhere else around the world, in our country it is the central bank’s job to determine and implement policies needed to curb inflation,” he told lawmakers from his AK Party.Erdogan’s comments capped a tumultuous stretch that began when he ousted central bank Governor Murat Uysal early Saturday after a series of interest-rate increases failed to stem the lira’s decline. On Sunday evening, Berat Albayrak announced his resignation as treasury and finance minister on Instagram, citing health reasons.Still, there were doubts about Erdogan’s change of heart and how long it will take before his electoral priorities might cause yet another policy reversal.“Can a leopard really change its spots?” said Nigel Rendell, a senior analyst at Medley Global Advisors. “There will be a significant degree of skepticism about what Erdogan has said, which will temper some enthusiasm.”Market ConfrontationErdogan’s battle with markets began in earnest in 2018, a year when he was sworn in with additional powers and appointed Albayrak to the top economy position. The appointment was soon followed by a diplomatic row with U.S. over accusations against an American pastorin Turkey. The president blamed a shadowy “interest-rate lobby” for speculative attacks against the currency as the lira plunged.Erdogan wasn’t completely unaware of the transactions involving Turkey’s foreign reserves, but the crunch came after he sought an explanation from the central bank for its September decision to raise the benchmark one-week repo rate to 10.25%, according to officials familiar with the matter.Ensuing conversations with former Governor Uysal and other top officials including Agbal allowed Erdogan to get a fuller picture of the FX liabilities and how they compared to net reserves, they said, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.Litmus TestThe president’s support is critical for new central bank Governor Naci Agbal, who will face a credibility test at his first Monetary Policy Committee meeting on Nov. 19, and new Treasury and Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan. With Erdogan saying he won’t interfere, optimism has grown that Turkey will allow interest rates to rise to offer a sufficient inflation-adjusted return.Agbal has begun meeting top banking executives to tell them he was appointed with a mandate to lower the inflation rate, which is just under 12%, people familiar with the meetings said, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.Even before Erdogan’s speech, Agbal and Elvan have been doing the rounds to convey market-friendly messages to Turkish businesses while they prepare for the rates decision.To be sure, Erdogan’s career saw previous attempts to appease investors, which proved short-lived. Even in Wednesday’s speech, he repeated his widely discredited view that lowering interest rates will also lead to lower inflation.“Erdogan’s priority is to consolidate support and maintain the popularity of his party,” Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist at the Economic Policy Research Foundation in Ankara, said by phone on Wednesday. “He is a pragmatic leader and the economy management appointed by the president are unlikely to act independently. His arguments are aimed at preventing the economy, which is badly hurt by the pandemic, from deteriorating further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/erdogan-s-economy-u-turn-sparks-market-euphoria-some-doubts/story-rbYBxLzjn0VuU0WgM6oT8J.html
12-11-2020||World||Turkey reaffirms Russian-made defense system plans despite US objections||ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey’s defense minister has reaffirmed the country’s plans to use a Russian-made missile defense system it purchased despite continued objections from the United States.Defense Minister Hulusi Akar told a parliamentary budget commission Thursday the military is continuing its checks and preparations of the S-400s as planned.Washington is strongly against NATO member Turkey’s acquisition of the Russian anti-aircraft system and kicked Turkey out of its F-35 fighter jet program, saying the S-400s are a threat to the stealth fighter jets and wouldn’t be interoperable with NATO systems.Akar said Turkey is prepared to discuss with the US its “anxiety” over the interoperability of the S-400s and the F-35s. “Our offer for a joint working group is still on the table,” he said, in comments carried by the official Anadolu news agency.Turkey was making components for the F-35 and had planned to purchase 100 of the stealth fighters.Also Read: Putin brokers deal to end Karabakh war, brings Turkey into Russian CaucasusThe US has also warned Ankara that it risks US sanctions under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act if the S-400 system is activated. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to take a tougher stance on the issue.Turkey tested the missile defense system in October for the first time. The US Department of Defense condemned the test “in the strongest possible terms.”Ankara argues it was forced to buy the Russian system because the US refused to sell the American-made Patriot system. The Turkish government also points to what it considers a double standard, as NATO member Greece uses Russian-made missiles.“We will use the S-400 system in the same way that other NATO member states with existing S-300 systems use them within the NATO alliance,” the defense minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-reaffirms-russian-made-defense-system-plans-despite-us-objections/story-wP3ItobFNIRoiB1qyyYexK.html
12-11-2020||World||Joe Biden’s path back to the Iran Nuclear Deal won’t be easy or fast||America’s European allies have struggled to keep the Iran nuclear deal alive after President Donald Trump quit the accord more than two years ago. Joe Biden’s election victory won’t provide a quick resuscitation.Biden said during the presidential campaign that Trump’s Iran policy weakened US national security and left Tehran closer than ever to being able to build a nuclear bomb. He vowed to get on the phone with allies on “day one” to begin rebuilding strained ties and said he’d give Iran a “credible path back to diplomacy.”But Iran’s mid-2021 presidential election, as well as likely continued Republican control of the US Senate, will put the brakes on quick, substantive action, according to US and Iranian diplomats and analysts. In addition, Biden has signalled that his priorities starting January 20 will be on the economy and getting the coronavirus pandemic under control.“I am not optimistic at all that in the short term anything significant will happen between Iran and the Americans,” Saeed Laylaz, an economist and former adviser to ex-President Mohammad Khatami, said in an interview. “It’s not impossible, but it will be extremely difficult.”Nuclear watchdogs and security analysts aren’t the only ones focused on what Biden could accomplish: Oil markets are betting on some easing of tensions by summer 2021 that will free the way for Iranian crude to return to global markets by year-end, Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Advisors, said on Bloomberg TV last week.Also Read: Biden will prioritise defence and security partnership with India, says Obama-era officialOn Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani -- who leaves office next year after staking his political legacy and reputation on the nuclear accord reached during the Obama administration -- referred to Biden as “the new man who’s arrived” and had campaigned on returning to the accord. “If they stick to their responsibilities they can choose the new path,” he said.But uncertainty about Rouhani’s successor, and the potential that elections could lead to a much harder-line government, will probably temper Biden’s enthusiasm to get something done quickly.In addition, while presidents generally have some leeway on foreign policy, a Senate under Republican control would mean lawmakers would demand assurances on Biden’s Iran policy before they confirm his nominees, said Richard Goldberg, a former National Security Council official under Trump.“Any effort to rejoin the Iran deal and build on it will be intensely scrutinized in Congress and among domestic critics,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East Fellow at the Alliance for Securing Democracy at the German Marshall Fund.If Biden pursues a rally-the-allies approach to Iran, that will likely include close consultations with everyone from Israel to the U.A.E., which aren’t likely to be as accommodating as European partners.Pressuring Biden to take the first step may be tough after the Trump administration spent four years highlighting the threat from Iran, which the U.S. sees as sowing turmoil across the Mideast and accused of hacking American voter data before the election.Iran’s actions since the US quit the 2015 nuclear deal -- including its decision to ramp up uranium enrichment -- have in some ways bolstered the Trump administration’s arguments.The International Atomic Energy Agency said on Wednesday that Iran’s uranium stockpiles have grown eightfold since the US quit the deal, and it now has enough supply to create three bombs if it enriches the material to weapons grade. Iran says its moves are reversible if the US returns to the accord, and it has continued to host IAEA inspectors and meet the other requirements of the nuclear deal.IIran has signalled its requirements for reviving the multinational deal.Its negotiators would want to see an authentic effort by Biden to not only scrap Trump’s approach but show that the US had a long-term commitment to the accord, said a source close to official foreign policy circles in Tehran who didn’t want to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.An Iranian official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Biden would have to return to the nuclear accord without condition, compensation to Iran would have to be on the table and the US would have to guarantee that it won’t invoke a “snapback” of United Nations sanctions as the Trump administration has tried to do.Biden could take some smaller moves that would reduce the pressure on Tehran without committing the US to a full-fledged detente. He could, for instance, ease the transfer of humanitarian aid to Iran, especially as the coronavirus batters the country’s health-care system, said Naysan Rafati, the International Crisis Group’s Iran analyst.The US can also try to help Iran gain access to a long-sought loan from the International Monetary Fund, he added. But even that would engender heavy scrutiny by Republicans, who are wary of providing funding to a government long listed by the US as a state sponsor of terrorism.That’s especially true now that the first of the accord’s “sunset” provisions, which expire at fixed dates, has already passed. An international ban on Iranian arms purchases lapsed in October and other restrictions built into the accord expire in less than five years.The short time horizon of the 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers prompted Biden to say he wants to expand on the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.Iranian officials, while broadly welcoming Trump’s defeat, have repeatedly said that the original terms of the deal can’t be renegotiated.“I don’t see Iran being willing to walk that path,” said Adnan Tabatabai, co-founder and chief executive officer of the Bonn-based Center for Applied Research in Partnership with the Orient, adding that Iran would be “allergic” to any mention of a “JCPOA-Plus”.A final hurdle could still come from Trump, as his team works to restrict options for the incoming administration. The administration has been working to create a layer of hard-to-reverse sanctions that could initially hobble Biden’s efforts.“The Trump administration’s approach now is to add more and more threads to this spider web and hope the next guy has a hard time washing them away,” said Rafati, the International Crisis Group’s Iran analyst. “There’s very little in here that’s totally irreversible. But these are harder to undo because you have to make the case that terrorism is no longer a concern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-path-back-to-the-iran-nuclear-deal-won-t-be-easy-or-fast/story-oLlZycXDylzgyjklHfwyhN.html
12-11-2020||World||With few legal wins Trump team hunts for proof of fraud||During a Pennsylvania court hearing this week on one of the many election lawsuits brought by President Donald Trump, a judge asked a campaign lawyer whether he had found any signs of fraud from among the 592 ballots challenged.The answer was no.“Accusing people of fraud is a pretty big step,” said the lawyer, Jonathan Goldstein. “We’re all just trying to get an election done.” Trump has not been so cautious, insisting without evidence that the election was stolen from him even when election officials nationwide from both parties say there has been no conspiracy.On Wednesday, Trump took aim at Philadelphia, the Democratic stronghold that helped push President-elect Joe Biden over the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the race. The president accused a local Republican election official Al Schmidt, of ignoring “a mountain of corruption & dishonesty.” Twitter added a label that said the election fraud claim is disputed. Trump loyalists have filed at least 15 legal challenges in Pennsylvania alone in an effort to reclaim the state’s 20 electoral votes. There is action, too, in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and Michigan.Read more | Georgia to re-count presidential election ballots by handIn court, his lawyers must walk a precarious line between advocating for their client and upholding their professional oath. Legal ethicists and pro-democracy activists have questioned the participation of lawyers in this quest, as Trump clings to power and President-elect Joe Biden rolls out his agenda.“This may be an attempt to appease the ego in chief, but there are real world consequences for real people that come out of that,” said Loyola Law School professor Justin Levitt, a former Justice Department elections official.“The attempt to soothe the president’s ego is not a victimless crime.” Schmidt told CBS’ “60 Minutes” that his office has received death threats simply for counting votes.“From the inside looking out, it feels all very deranged,” Schmidt said in an interview that aired Sunday. “Counting votes cast on or before Election Day by eligible voters is not corruption. It is not cheating. It is democracy.” Untold voters, however, are accepting Trump’s claim about a rigged election and are donating to his legal fund.A law firm involved in the election suits, Ohio-based Porter Wright Morris & Arthur, appeared to take down its Twitter feed Tuesday after it was inundated with attacks. The firm declined to address questions from The Associated Press about the feed in a statement issued Wednesday that said it had a long history of election work. A second firm, Jones Day, said it was representing not the Trump campaign but the Pennsylvania GOP, in litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court over the three-day extension to accept mail-in ballots. Nationally, the strategy is being run by Trump allies such as Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney; political operative David Bossie, who is not an attorney; and Jay Sekulow, a lead lawyer during the president’s impeachment trial this year. Bossie recently tested positive for Covid-19.Read more | Joe Biden moves forward without help from Donald Trump’s intel teamElection law expert Rick Hasen said he would expect to see top-drawer Supreme Court litigators involved, such as two former solicitors general, Paul Clement or Theodore Olson, if Trump had a strong case.“There are certain names of elite lawyers that signal to the Supreme Court that something is serious,” said Hasen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. Instead, “the campaign announced that it was putting Rudy Giuliani and David Bossie in charge.” The low point of the effort undoubtedly came Saturday, when Giuliani held a news conference outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia just after the race was called for Biden. Standing in the shadow of a sex shop and a crematorium, just down the road from a state prison, Giuliani called a disgruntled poll watcher to the microphone to discuss the “shenanigans” in the city. Political observers tuning in from nearby Trenton, New Jersey, immediately recognised the man as a convicted sex offender and perennial candidate for office.In another head-scratching moment, as the campaign tried to stop the vote count in Philadelphia last week, a judge tried to get to the bottom of a Republican complaint over observer access in the room where election workers were processing mail-in ballots.Read more | US Presidential Election 2020: Donald Trump wins Alaska, his electoral college tally goes up to 217“I am asking you as a member of the bar of this court, are people representing the Donald J. Trump for president (campaign) … in that room?” US District Judge Paul S. Diamond asked.“There’s a nonzero number of people in the room,” campaign lawyer Jerome Marcus replied. Diamond made the two sides forge an agreement and threatened to charge them with contempt if they didn’t keep the peace. Some of the suits filed on Trump’s behalf appear to be hastily thrown together, with spelling errors (“ballet” for “ballot”), procedural mistakes and little to back up their claims. Judge have been skeptical. In Michigan, Judge Cynthia Stephens dismissed one filing as “inadmissible hearsay within hearsay.” When Trump’s lawyers appealed, the next court kicked the filing back as “defective.” The campaign has so far scored just one small victory, allowing their observers to stand a little closer to election workers processing the mail-in ballots in Philadelphia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-few-legal-wins-trump-team-hunts-for-proof-of-fraud/story-Z8Hmp7NchoEZH4lX4B1AOI.html
12-11-2020||World||Biden names chief of staff, signals reliance on trusted, moderate aides||US President-elect Joe Biden has named Ron Klain, a decades-long associate, as his chief of staff, signalling he will rely on a close circle of known and trusted aides, all moderates.Klain was Biden’s first major personnel announcement as the president-elect forged ahead with putting together his team for taking charge on January 20, undeterred by President Donald Trump’s refusal to acknowledge defeat and extend the incoming administration time-honoured transition protocols.“Ron has been invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together, including as we rescued the American economy from one of the worst downturns in our history in 2009 and later overcame a daunting public health emergency in 2014,” Biden said in a statement.“His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again.”Klain has been with Biden since his days in US Senate. The president-elect was serving his seventh six-year term when he was elected as President Barack Obama’s deputy. A Harvard law school alumnus, Klain served as chief of staff to Biden as vice-president and led the Obama administration’s response to the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic in the US, as the “Ebola Czar”. Klain’s selection was seen as a signal that moderates in the Democratic party, who have been the president-elect’s natural constituency, will have the upper hand in the administration even if progressives were able to wrest major concessions in terms of policy and personnel, as feared by some in India.New Delhi should breathe easy a little, observers said after Klain’s appointment. But they cautioned that a better understanding of the incoming administration’s impact on India will have to await other key appointments such as secretary of state, secretary of defence and the national security advisor.Susan Rice, a former national security adviser and US ambassador to the UN, is a frontrunner for secretary of state as are William Burns, a former deputy secretary of state, and Anthony Blinken, also a former deputy security of state and the Biden campaign’s foremost surrogate on foreign policy.Michele Flournoy, a former deputy secretary of defence, is the top contender for the top defence position in every speculative list of Biden’s cabinet.And Blinken leads every list for NSA.Indian officials have had close and long working relationships with all four, according to many past and present diplomats who have dealt with them, and they look forward to engaging with them, confident of their understanding of and support for ties with India, specially at a fraught time such as this.In an outreach to the Indian American community on the occasion of the Indian Independence Day past August 15, Blinken, who was the Biden campaign’s chief spokesperson on national security and foreign policy issues, had said that cooperation between the two countries should “extend even beyond the region to the world as large”. He had gone on to assert that the Biden administration will support a larger role for India in international institutions — including a permanent seat in a reformed UN Security Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-names-chief-of-staff-signals-reliance-on-trusted-moderate-aides/story-HpCIQ4Tzhs8VfCgsQLlPXN.html
12-11-2020||World||Saudi king points to Iran as top threat in annual speech||Saudi Arabia’s King Salman slammed rival Iran and hailed his country’s efforts at combating the coronavirus and stabilizing oil supplies in an annual speech delivered early Thursday.The speech, which outlined the country’s policy priorities and achievements, was delivered virtually by the 82-year-old monarch to the advisory Shura Council in the presence of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.On foreign policy, he stressed that threats from Iran remain a top concern. He accused Iran of supporting terrorism and fuelling sectarianism in the region.Although the king made no mention of it in his speech, another issue facing the kingdom next year will be its relationship with a new US administration led by President-elect Joe Biden. The Saudi leadership has strongly favoured President Donald Trump’s maximum pressure policy against rival Iran.The king stressed the necessity of “finding a radical solution to ensure Iran does not acquire weapons of mass destruction.”“Saudi Arabia affirms the danger of the Iranian regime’s regional project,” he said.The kingdom is at war with Iranian-backed Houthi fighters in Yemen. The conflict has killed thousands and created the world’s worst humanitarian disaster.During his presidency, Trump blocked a Congressional effort to end US military assistance in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen and defended the Saudi crown prince in the face of scathing criticism over the killing of writer Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in late 2018.A full day after statements began pouring in from world leaders, the king and Crown Prince Mohammed congratulated Biden on his election win in separate cables late Sunday, noting the “deep historical relations” that exist between the two nations — even as Trump refuses to publicly concede.In his remarks, King Salman also reaffirmed his support for an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital, though he also welcomed efforts aimed at bringing an end to the decades-long conflict. He spoke as neighboring UAE and Bahrain are normalizing relations with Israel in moves condemned by the Palestinians.Domestically, Saudi Arabia is in midst of economic recession this year due to the pandemic.Saudi Arabia’s main source of revenue — its oil exports — have plunged significantly due to a drop in crude prices. The government projects the gap between spending and revenue to reach $79.5 billion this year.“The kingdom has worked and is still working to ensure the stability of oil supplies to the world in a way that serves producers and consumers alike ... despite the coronavirus pandemic and its repercussions on global oil markets,” King Salman said.He praised the country’s for its presidency this year of the Group of 20 nations that represent the world’s wealthiest countries, a point of pride the kingdom has stressed repeatedly. Saudi Arabia will host leaders of the G-20 later this month for a virtual summit that is expected to focus heavily on global efforts to fight the coronavirus.The king also thanked the Saudi public for adhering to instructions and mask mandates to curb the spread of the virus as new confirmed cases there have gone down in past weeks. He noted the government has spent $70 billion this year, in part to boost health care and help cover private sector wages. The government is covering all virus-related medical costs for residents of Saudi Arabia, including those in the country illegally.Some 10.6 million lower income Saudi citizens also rely on monthly cash assistance from the government’s so-called “Citizen’s Account.” The average monthly support for a family is around 1,050 riyals, or $280.King Salman’s reign since ascending to the throne in 2015 has been marked by sweeping social transformations, as well as the swift rise to power of his son, the crown prince.In the latest move, the monarch last month appointed a woman as assistant speaker of the 150-member Shura Council for the first time. Women hold 30 seats in the chamber.Ayham Kamel, head of Eurasia Group’s Middle East division, said the change reflects efforts at social liberalization. Kamel said there is also an effort to allow the Shura Council to become a platform for managed debate, although it has limited powers to push for changes without prior blessing from the royal court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-king-points-to-iran-as-top-threat-in-annual-speech/story-wZ8aWobayeN1k5AuwNsrWL.html
12-11-2020||World||US hints at more sanctions on China over Hong Kong||The United States on Wednesday slammed China for the recent disqualification of four Hong Kong opposition lawmakers and said that sanctions will continue to be imposed on “those responsible for extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom”.According to an official statement issued by National Security Advisor Robert C O’Brien, “Beijing’s recent actions disqualifying pro-democracy legislators from Hong Kong’s Legislative Council leave no doubt that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has flagrantly violated its international commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration and its promises to the people of Hong Kong, including those under the Basic Law.” He further said that “One Country, Two Systems” has become merely a “fig leaf covering for the CCP’s expanding one-party dictatorship in Hong Kong”. “The United States will continue to utilize all the powers granted under the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, and the Executive Order on Hong Kong Normalization to identify and sanction those responsible for extinguishing Hong Kong’s freedom,” he added.Earlier, four Hong Kong opposition lawmakers were disqualified with immediate effect after the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) passed the resolution, South China Morning Post reported.Following this, all Hong Kong’s opposition lawmakers resigned together in the protest of China’s top legislative body’s resolution, which gives local authorities power to unseat politicians without having to go through the city’s courts, Hong Kong Free Press reported.Democratic Party lawmaker Wu Chi-wai, convenor of the pro-democracy bloc slammed Beijing resolution as “ridiculous” and said the decision signaled Beijing complete abandonment of the Basic Law.“Hong Kong, from today onward, can no longer tell the world that there is ‘one country, two systems’,” Wu said.The lawmakers unseated on Wednesday were the Civic Party’s Alvin Yeung Ngok-kiu, Kwok Ka-ki and Dennis Kwok, alongside Kenneth Leung of the Professionals Guild, who were previously barred from running in the now-postponed Legislative Council elections, originally slated for September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hints-at-more-sanctions-on-china-over-hong-kong/story-uS9yTFEUQijn4XUSEDUXoM.html

12-11-2020||World||Typhoon-ravaged northeast Philippines pummelled by new storm||A typhoon swelled rivers and flooded low-lying areas as it passed over the storm-battered northeast Philippines, where rescuers were deployed early Thursday to help people flee the rising waters.The typhoon passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, toppling trees and knocking out power. Officials had said previously that nearly 200,000 people had been evacuated, some of them forcibly, from vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas.Rescue teams were deployed to flooded areas in Rizal province near the capital, Adm. George Ursabia, the coast guard chief, told DZBB radio.From the Rizal town of Rodriguez, resident Yolanda Laude called the radio station to ask to be rescued. “We’re all on the roof. The water has risen high and reached our second floor. We’ve been here on the roof since 3 am, there are six families on our roof,” she told DZBB, which asked for details of her location.In Pasig city in metropolitan Manila, Carla May Juico and her family went up to the third and last floor of their house as the waters rose during the night. Now, the water has reached the third floor. “We’re thinking of going to the roof. We’ll asked to be rescued,” she told DZBB by phone.Marikina city Mayor Marcie Teodoro said the fierce winds knocked down power lines overnight, leaving many areas without power and internet connection. Heavy rains also flooded many areas and the Marikina River was swollen.“There are many areas that historically don’t get flooded but now, they are swamped like the city hall,” he told DZBB radio.Typhoon Vamco had maximum winds of 130 kilometres per hour (80 mph) with stronger gusts Thursday morning. It was moving west-northwest at 30 kph (19 mph) and would soon leave the main Luzon Island for the South China Sea.Flooding in 32 villages and a few landslides were already reported on Wednesday from the typhoon, and disaster officials said a man died and three other people were missing, without immediately providing details.The government’s main disaster-response agency had pleaded to the media to relay typhoon alerts in northeastern areas devastated by the earlier Typhoon Goni, saying the agency’s messages could not be sent by cellphones due to damaged telecommunications systems.Goni, one of the strongest tropical cyclones in the world this year, left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed more than 270,000 houses and shanties, many along coastal villages. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and storms each year. It’s also located on the so-called Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/typhoon-ravaged-northeast-philippines-pummelled-by-new-storm/story-oR8FF1J97ikJikQrQxkuhI.html
12-11-2020||World||Moderna expecting to announce results of Covid-19 vaccine by end of month||Moderna expects to have an announcement on the efficacy of its Covid-19 vaccine after it finished accumulating data for a first analysis of the vaccine, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.Moderna is conducting a clinical trial of about 30,000 participants, with half of the participants receiving the vaccine and the other half receiving a placebo, which is a shot of saline that does not seem to have any effect, reported CNN.In order for the vaccine to be considered for authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at least 53 study participants needed to become ill with Covid-19.The trial hit the 53-mark Wednesday, but Moderna doesn’t know if the participants who became ill received the vaccine or the placebo. The company is now preparing data to send to the trial’s Data and Safety Monitoring Board, an independent panel of experts.If a statistically significant number of participants received the placebo, that would mean that the vaccine is effective against the virus.Since cases are rapidly rising in the US, more than 53 participants will become ill with Covid-19 by the time the announcement is made, according to CNN.Meanwhile, Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, said on Wednesday that Pfizer’s promising outcomes are good news for Moderna as well.Fauci mentioned that Pfizer’s results from the never-before-approved mRNA technology were better than expected.This came after the coronavirus vaccine developed by drug giant American Pfizer and German biotechnology firm BioNTech was more than 90 per cent effective at protecting people from infection as compared to placebo saline shot, according to an analysis.This was regarded as a ‘historical moment’ by Kathrin Jensen, head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-expecting-to-announce-results-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-end-of-month/story-QOcReOQI6Dbitr4Ge5W25L.html

12-11-2020||World||President-elect Joe Biden names Ron Klain as White House chief of staff||US President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday announced the appointment of Ron Klain, his longtime aide, as White House chief of staff. In this capacity, Klain will oversee the executive office of the President and serve as a senior advisor. In addition to supporting the president-elect, Klain will work to build a diverse, experienced and talented team to help President-elect Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris meet the urgent challenges facing the country, a media release said. “Ron has been invaluable to me over the many years that we have worked together, including as we rescued the American economy from one of the worst downturns in our history in 2009 and later overcame a daunting public health emergency in 2014,” said Biden. “His deep, varied experience and capacity to work with people all across the political spectrum is precisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we confront this moment of crisis and bring our country together again,” Biden said. Klain was most recently a senior advisor to the Biden for campaign and has previously served Biden in a number of roles including as his chief of staff when he became vice president. Klain is also known for his role as the White House ebola response coordinator at the height of the public health crisis. Klain said, “It’s the honor of a lifetime to serve president-elect Biden in this role, and I am humbled by his confidence. I look forward to helping him and the vice president-elect assemble a talented and diverse team to work in the White House, as we tackle their ambitious agenda for change, and seek to heal the divides in our country.”  At the conclusion of his work coordinating the US response, President Obama said that Klain had taken on “a challenge that many called insurmountable, and, in leading the team responsible for tremendous progress, helped remind the world what makes America exceptional.” Earlier, in addition to his work with then-vice president Biden, Klain served as chief of staff for vice president Al Gore, chief of staff and counsellor to attorney general Janet Reno, and staff director of the senate democratic leadership committee. Klain was also associate counsel to president Clinton and in charge of judicial selection. Through his work on the judiciary committee, and in the executive branch, he has played a role in the selection or confirmation of eight Supreme Court justices. Serving as an advisor on several presidential campaigns, Klain has worked for Obama and Clinton, and democratic presidential nominees Al Gore, John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Klain graduated from Harvard Law School, was an editor of the Harvard Law Review, and won the Sears Prize for highest grade average in 1985. He was a summa cum laude graduate of Georgetown University, where he serves an Adjunct Professor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-elect-joe-biden-names-ron-klain-as-white-house-chief-of-staff/story-S8bHXYvfFkoden2rFTKq6J.html

12-11-2020||World||Nawaz Sharif crosses Army’s redline in battle with Imran Khan. Pushback begins||Pakistan’s army, its most powerful institution that has directly ruled the country for large parts of its seven-decade history, has been coming under sharp attacks from a coalition of opposition parties as they amp up their pitch against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The anti-government alliance, Pakistan Democratic Movement, or PDM, was minted by 11 parties in September that pledged to hit the streets to mobilise people against PM Khan. But the parties, who they accuse of being installed by the military in the 2018 election, soon enough widened its attack to aim at the army also. But it had been hesitant to name the army brass, opting for the more ambivalent term, ‘establishment’ to refer to the military and other institutions who have lent their support to Imran Khan.Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who had adopted a shrill pitch right from the beginning when he famously alluded to the military as the “state above the state”, however, went a step further at last month’s rally in Pakistan’s eastern city of Gujranwala where he directly targeted army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa.“Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, you packed up our government, which was working well, and put the nation and the country at the altar of your wishes,” Sharif told the gathering via a video link from London, according to a Reuters report. It was billed as the largest rally in the country since the 2018 elections, attended by tens of thousands of people. Sharif, Pakistan’s three-time prime minister whose Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is the main opposition party, also named Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the chief of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence handpicked by Gen Bajwa. Also Watch | PM Modi gives stern message to China & Pakistan at SCO summitPakistan watchers in New Delhi believe the army tried to get back at Sharif via his daughter Maryam Sharif’s husband Mohammad Safdar when the military arm-twisted the police to arrest him from his Karachi hotel. But the move backfired after the Karachi police threatened to go on leave to protest the military abducting its chief to force him to order Safdar’s arrest. Gen Bajwa had to order an inquiry.On Tuesday, the military announced that the inquiry had faulted a number of intelligence officers and troops for acting “overzealously”. The military said officers from Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) and ISI sector Headquarters, Karachi were under increasing public pressure to act for the desecration of Mazar-e-Quaid, a reference to the PML-N leader’s visit to the mausoleum of Mohammad Ali Jinnah where he led a crowd in chanting: “Give respect to the vote!” The slogan is viewed as a criticism of the military.Maryam Sharif and her father have rejected the military report. “Inquiry report on Karachi incident is a cover-up scapegoating juniors & shielding the real culprits. Report “Rejected”,” tweeted Nawaz Sharif.That Gen Bajwa had to order an inquiry into the Karachi incident and then release what the army claims were its findings, Pakistan watchers in New Delhi said, indicated the pressure that the army had come under.“The open discussion and criticism of the army’s role in governance have implications for the establishment as it puts the legitimacy of its authority at risk,” said one of them, pointing how Nawaz Sharif and his daughter’s public criticism had brought the debate on civil-military relations on the streets.Indian counter-terror officials who track Pakistan’s security establishment indicate that the pushback from the military appeared to have started. One immediate fallout of the army flexing its muscles was the statement by Bilawal Bhutto, chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party, to distance himself and the PDM from Sharif’s pointed criticism of the army.In an interview to BBC, Bilawal Bhutto said he was “shocked” when he heard Nawaz Sharif name the army chief and the ISI boss in his October speech.“It was a shock for me because, typically, we don’t talk like this at rallies. But Nawaz heads his own party and I can’t control what he says, just like he can’t control what I say,” Bilawal said, according to Pakistani newspaper Dawn. “During the all-parties conference, there was a debate on whether the blame should be laid on one institution or the entire establishment,” Bilawal said, adding that “it was decided that a single institution would not be named, the establishment would.”Analysts, however, point out that the army - even if on a back foot for the moment - still had a few things going for it. For one, it enjoys a far better reputation than all the political parties put together and targeting it could be counter-productive.An Indian counter-terror official said he expected the criticism from the PDM to become more nuanced and milder, particularly since it has over the decades made deep inroads in Pakistan’s political parties. Already, PML-N’s Balochistan chapter leader Lt General Abdul Qadir Baloch and former chief minister Sanaullah Zehri have quit the party and castigated the PDM for targeting the ‘establishment’.Even the hardline religiopolitical parties such as Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) are severely compromised and maintain close links with the establishment. “More importantly, its multitude of terrorist proxies is the ultimate weapon against anyone who crosses the line and doesn’t take corrective steps,” said the counter-terror official.Nawaz Sharif has stood his ground so far but analysts indicate that he faces a serious limitation due to his peculiar circumstances. He was ousted from power in 2017 on the Supreme Court’s orders and has been staying in London after being allowed to receive medical treatment abroad.The mantle of taking the battle to the army has fallen on daughter Maryam Nawaz who is rapidly emerging as the lead face of the opposition, an official said. She can relate well to her constituents, has demonstrated courage in calling a spade a spade and is careful in her public addresses to project that she is shouldering the PML-N’s burden on behalf of her father, a recognition of the country’s patriarchal and feudal society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-battle-with-imran-khan-nawaz-sharif-crosses-army-s-redline-pushback-begins/story-gmSgesCOQ1mXlLOWdxjv9N.html
12-11-2020||World||Texas becomes 1st state to surpass 1 million Covid-19 cases||Texas became America’s first state Wednesday with more than 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, as sporting events were canceled and the border city of El Paso added mobile morgues in anticipation of virus deaths overwhelming hospitals for weeks.Texas leaders gave no indication of forthcoming restrictions as the state passed the grim milestone and recorded more than 10,800 new cases on Tuesday, which set a new daily record and is the highest since July. The virus that is surging throughout the US has been unsparing across Texas: The top county official in Fort Worth is pushing to halt youth and school sports, and medical tents were set up outside hospitals for the first time in the rural Panhandle.“We were certainly hoping we would be in a bubble and not have to go through the things that larger communities were having to deal with because we were in — quote — rural Texas,” said Cory Edmondson, president and CEO of Peterson Health in Kerrville.“But that quickly came to a halt, and we realized we’re not immune to this,” said Edmondson, whose hospital in the Texas Hill Country now often has more than 10 Covid-19 patients admitted, double the usual number.State health officials Wednesday reported 6,779 patients in hospitals, a spike of 609 in one day — one of the highest one-day bumps since the state started keep track.Texas has recorded 1,010,364 coronavirus cases and more than 19,300 confirmed deaths since the pandemic began in early March, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Only Illinois has averaged more new cases than Texas over the past two weeks.Texas recently surpassed California, the most populous state, in recording the highest number of positive coronavirus tests. The true number of infections is likely higher because many people haven’t been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.A spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he was relying on “data-driven hospitalization metrics” and that the state was working to help areas with rising caseloads. Abbott has not held a press briefing about the virus since September, when he announced that he was lifting more restrictions on restaurants and gyms.“The reality is, Covid-19 still exists in Texas and across the globe, and Texans should continue to take this virus seriously and do their part by social distancing, washing their hands, and wearing a mask,” Abbott spokeswoman Renae Eze said.In El Paso, where more than 1,000 virus patients are hospitalized, local officials have shut down tattoo parlors, hair and nail salons and gyms — all steps that are beyond what Abbott has allowed. The state is fighting the move that Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton says is “oppressing” the border county of about 840,000 people, but local officials won a brief reprieve Wednesday when the Texas Supreme Court refused to make an expedited ruling.El Paso County officials this week announced plans to add four additional morgue trailers, bringing the total number there to 10.Disruptions to college football programs in Texas are also mounting, with more games postponed or cancelled. The latest came Tuesday when No. 5 Texas A&M had its game this week against Tennessee rescheduled for Dec. 12 after Texas A&M reported at least three players or staff members tested positive. The University of Texas-El Paso also announced that it would move a Nov. 20 home game against Alabama-Birmingham to Midland — more than 300 miles (480 kilometers) away — because of the surging number of cases along the border.New cases around Dallas climbed above 1,200 for a third consecutive day, prompting the county’s top elected official to urge more residents to work from home.“We are staring down the barrel of the largest spike we have seen to date in Covid cases,” Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said.In rural Kerrville, Edmondson said his 124-bed hospital has been able to manage the uptick in cases but worried that numbers could worsen. He described a fatigue within the nine counties his hospital serves with the virus and restrictions.In Lubbock County, home of Texas Tech University, health officials reported a surge of nearly 3,400 new cases last week. That is nearly 80% of the number of cases reported over the same span in Harris County, which has a population 16 times larger, and hospital tents were being set up in the area, alarming local officials.“’We know how to do this. Please. I can absolutely assure you that never in my career did I think we would be deploying field hospitals to Lubbock, Texas,” Lubbock City Manager Jarrett Atkinson told television station KCBD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-becomes-1st-state-to-surpass-1-million-covid-19-cases/story-u8qG9s6R715zkJqCFEvzaJ.html
12-11-2020||World||Covid-19: With more than 50,000 lives lost, UK records highest death toll in Europe||The number of UK deaths from coronavirus on Wednesday night crossed the grim milestone of 50,000 – the highest in Europe – as health officials prepared for mass vaccination of the Pfizer vaccine from early December if it passes regulatory check in the coming days.There were 595 deaths in UK hospitals and care homes in the last 24 hours, taking the overall death toll to 50,365. By another calculation of coronavirus mentioned as a cause in death certificates (in all settings, including those outside hospitals), the figure has already crossed 60,000.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new milestone indicated that the UK is “not out of the woods”, despite news this week about the Pfizer vaccine: “Every death is a tragedy. I do think we have got now to a different phase in the way that we treat it.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverageThe UK is now the fifth country in the world to register more than 50,000 deaths, after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. The cumulative figure of positive cases in the UK is 1,256,725, with 22,950 registered in the last 24 hours.Labour leader Keir Starmer, who has been critical of the Johnson government’s handling of the pandemic, said the latest death figures were a “grim milestone,” adding that the government owed it to the families of those who have lost their lives “to get on top” of its response to the second wave.New sero survey shows 1 in 4 exposed to Covid-19 in DelhiChaand Nagpaul of the British Medical Association said: “This is a point that should never have been reached. Today’s figure is a terrible indictment of poor preparation, poor organisation by the government, insufficient infection control measures, coupled with late and often confusing messaging for the public.”Meanwhile, the National Health Service is working on a plan to vaccinate on a large scale if the Medicines and Health products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) approves the Pfizer vaccine in the near future. Football stadiums, town halls and conference centres in England are among centres of the mass vaccination plan that includes a priority list of the vaccine recipients.Covid-19: What you need to know todayJune Raine, MHRA chief executive, said: “The safety of the public will always come first. A Covid-19 vaccine will only be approved once it has met robust standards of effectiveness, safety and quality.”Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, added: “This is one of the most important, if not the most important, vaccination programme we’ve done for decades. If I can help with this in some evenings and weekends, doing some extra vaccinations sessions myself, then I’m going to.”Johnson’s spokesman said the prime minister would be happy to receive the vaccine: “Any vaccines which are determined for use will undergo a vigorous series of safety checks, they will be absolutely safe for the public to use. And the prime minister would therefore, of course, be very happy to take the vaccine himself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-with-more-than-50-000-lives-lost-uk-records-highest-death-toll-in-europe/story-OYKrfLpuh28NrmGurzVJFJ.html
12-11-2020||World||‘Covered in blood’: Bomb strikes WWI memorial at Saudi cemetery||A bomb blast struck a World War I commemoration attended by French and other diplomats in the Saudi city of Jeddah Wednesday, wounding at least two people in the second such assault in weeks.The attack at a non-Muslim cemetery comes less than a month after a guard at the French consulate in Jeddah was wounded by a knife-wielding Saudi citizen, amid anger among Muslim nations over satirical cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.Diplomats from France, Greece, Italy, Britain and the United States were in attendance at the Armistice Day commemoration ceremony in the Red Sea port city, according to a joint statement from their embassies that condemned the “cowardly attack”.“The annual ceremony commemorating the end of World War I at the non-Muslim cemetery in Jeddah, attended by several consulates, including that of France, was the target of an IED (improvised explosive device) attack this morning, which injured several people,” France’s foreign ministry said.The bombing, which an eyewitness said left one of the panic-stricken attendees drenched in blood, comes as French President Emmanuel Macron has sought to assuage Muslim anger over the cartoons printed by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.A Greek policeman residing in the kingdom was among those wounded, a Greek diplomatic source told AFP.A British citizen was also believed to have been wounded.A Saudi policeman suffered minor injuries, state-owned Al-Ekhbariya television added, citing the governor of Mecca region, where Jeddah is located.“(Saudi) security services will launch an investigation into an incident of aggression during a gathering of a number of consuls in Jeddah,” Ekhbariya said.- ‘Covered in blood’ -The bomb triggered panic as it went off while the French consul was delivering a speech at the ceremony, according to eyewitness Nadia Chaaya.“At the end of the speech we heard an explosion. We didn’t quite understand it at first, but we then realised that we were the target,” Chaaya told France’s BFMTV.“We were panicking and feared there could be a second explosion. We left the cemetery... and everyone went their separate ways.”Mohammed Belmaziz, another eyewitness, said amid the pandemonium and screams he saw one person whose face was “covered in blood”.Roads leading up to the cemetery in central Jeddah were blocked by Saudi traffic police, according to an AFP photographer at the scene.While condemning the “shameful” attack, the embassies of the countries involved in the commemoration lauded “brave Saudi first responders who assisted those at the scene”.The European Union delegation in the kingdom also thanked Saudi emergency services, while urging local authorities to hold a “prompt and thorough investigation” of the attack.- ‘Extreme vigilance’ -The French embassy in Riyadh has urged its nationals in Saudi Arabia to exercise “extreme vigilance” since the attack at the Jeddah consulate on October 29, the same day a knife-wielding man killed three people at a church in Nice in southern France.Several countries are marking the 102nd anniversary of the armistice signed by Germany and Allied countries to end the war.Macron has vigorously defended the right to publish cartoons viewed as offensive by some, including caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed.The Charlie Hebdo cartoons were shown by French history teacher Samuel Paty to pupils in a class on free speech, leading to his beheading outside Paris on October 16 following an online campaign by parents angry over his choice of lesson material.Macron’s stance angered many Muslims, prompting protests in several countries at which portraits of France’s president were burnt, and a campaign to boycott French products.Regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia -- home to Islam’s holiest sites -- has criticised the cartoons, saying it rejected “any attempt to link Islam and terrorism” but stopped short of condemning the French leadership.Riyadh also “strongly” condemned last month’s attack in Nice.On Tuesday, Macron hosted a summit of European leaders to plot a joint approach on combating Islamist radicalism after four people were killed in a shooting rampage in the heart of Vienna last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covered-in-blood-bomb-strikes-wwi-memorial-at-saudi-cemetery/story-fd37MqwrcGX1jsZMFBHsFI.html
12-11-2020||World||Pak court jails spokesperson of Hafiz Saeed-led JuD for 32 years in terror financing cases||A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Wednesday handed down 32 years imprisonment to the spokesperson of Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed’s Jammat-ud-Dawah (JuD) terror group in two terror financing cases.The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) here also convicted two other JuD leaders, including the brother-in-law of Saeed, in terror financing cases.“ATC Judge Ijaz Ahmad Buttar handed down 32 years imprisonment to JuD spokesperson Yahya Mujahid in two FIRs. Prof Zafar Iqbal and Prof Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki (brother-in-law of Saeed) were awarded 16 and one-year jail terms in two cases,” a court official told PTI.He said that the two other JuD leaders -- Abdul Salam bin Muhammad and Luqman Shah -- were indicted in more terror financing cases.The court directed the prosecution to present its witnesses on November 16.The suspects were presented in the court in high security and media was not allowed to enter the court premises during the case proceedings.Last week, the ATC Lahore convicted JuD’s Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki, Zafar Iqbal and Muhammad Ashraf in two more cases of terror financing registered by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police.Zafar Iqbal and Muhammad Ashraf have been given a collective imprisonment of 16 years each under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Makki has been sentenced to one-year imprisonment in a case with a fine of Rs 170,000.In September last year, the ATC Lahore handed down over 16 years imprisonment to Prof Zafar Iqbal and Hafiz Abdus Salam bin Muhammad and one-and-a-half-year sentence to Makki in a terror financing case.In February last year, Saeed had been sentenced to jail for 11 years on terror finance charges by an ATC in Lahore.The ATC sentenced Saeed and his close aide Zafar Iqbal to five-and-a-half years each in two cases. A total of 11 years sentence will run concurrently. Saeed is serving his term in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. He was arrested in July last year.The CTD of Punjab police had registered 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices on the charges of terror financing in different cities of the province.Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for Lashkar-e-Taiba which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.The US named Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10-million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice.He was listed as a terrorist under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-jails-spokesperson-of-hafiz-saeed-led-jud-for-32-years-in-terror-financing-cases/story-TJozIVYYeLMF7ab9mzXB3N.html

Both sides, despite being longstanding allies, disagreed over key topics from trade and security to the fight against climate change.The EU is expected to invite Biden soon to videoconference talks in an attempt to give new impetus to the trans-Atlantic alliance.“You can rest assured that we are ready to engage fast with the new administration,” Borrell said. But he also alluded to the political problems remaining in the U.S. where Trump has yet to concede defeat. Biden is steadfastly pushing forward with preparations for his presidency.“We still have to wait until (the) 20th of January because as you know very well it is a quite long transition ahead. Let’s hope it is not going to be a bumpy transition,” Borrell said.Trump has variously stunned and disappointed the Europeans — most of them members of the NATO military alliance that America leads — by slapping tariffs on EU exports and pulling out of the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-says-looking-forward-to-better-ties-with-us-under-joe-biden/story-XVhfjQvJMzeOu50Gb4MVaN.html

12-11-2020||World||5 dead, 111 rescued in Mediterranean migrant shipwreck||Five people died after a Europe-bound rubber boat carrying 116 migrants and asylum-seekers fell apart in the central Mediterranean Sea, a Spanish humanitarian group said Wednesday.The Open Arms rescue ship had been searching for the boat in distress for hours before finally locating it Wednesday morning in international waters north of Libya. The NGO had just finished distributing life vests and masks to the passengers to begin transferring them to safety when the flimsy boat split in two, throwing them into cold waters.Rescuers pulled out 111 people, including two infants, alive and recovered five bodies.Open Arms spokesperson Laura Lanuza told The AP that the NGO has asked Italian and Maltese maritime authorities for the immediate evacuation of six people in serious condition, including two babies and their mothers and a pregnant woman. Lanuza said the NGO had already rescued 88 migrants the night before and was headed to a third distress call.Wednesday’s shipwreck was the second recorded this week in waters north of Libya, a key transit point for migrants from Africa and the Middle East. On Tuesday another 13 migrants died, including a child, the UN said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-dead-111-rescued-in-mediterranean-migrant-shipwreck/story-P1RC1aCpQe9RIO8HXBSrbM.html
12-11-2020||World||Brazil resumes trials of Chinese Covid-19 vaccine candidate||Brazil’s health regulator on Wednesday authorized the resumption of large-scale clinical trials on a potential coronavirus vaccine developed by a Chinese company just over a day after shutting the test down.The initial decision by Anvisa led to a storm of complaints that the action was more political than scientific.The agency had cited an “adverse, serious event” that occurred on October 29 as the reason for halting the trials on Monday night, but said Wednesday it now “has sufficient elements to allow vaccination to resume.” The potential CoronaVac vaccine is being developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac and in Brazil would be mostly produced by Sao Paulo’s state-run Butantan Institute.Adversaries of President Jair Bolsonaro said they suspected the suspension was motivated by the president’s oft-stated wariness of China and his political rivalry with Sao Paulo’s governor, though Anvisa officials insisted the decision was based purely on technical issues and complained they hadn’t been given sufficient initial information about the case.Anvisa “continues to monitor the investigation of the outcome of the case in order to define the possible causal relationship between the unexpected event and the vaccine,” its statement added on Wednesday. It did not specify what sort of event had occurred.About 10,000 volunteers are taking part in phase three testing of the Sinovac candidate, one of several potential vaccines under trial in one of the nations hardest hit by Covid-19.Temporary halts of drug and vaccine trials are relatively common; in research involving thousands of participants, some are likely to fall ill. Pausing a study allows researchers to investigate whether an illness is a side effect or a coincidence. Last month, two drugmakers resumed testing of their prospective coronavirus vaccines in the U.S. after they were halted earlier.Bolsonaro has repeatedly cast doubt on CoronaVac’s prospective effectiveness, and last month rejected it, saying Brazilians would not be used as guinea pigs. He celebrated Anvisa’s suspension on Tuesday, saying it showed that “Jair Bolsonaro wins again.” Bolsonaro didn’t immediately comment following Anvisa’s decision on Wednesday to restart the trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-resumes-trials-of-chinese-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/story-bzTXGglVLnk9xHIGa63xdM.html
12-11-2020||World||UK becomes 5th country to exceed 50,000 coronavirus deaths||The United Kingdom on Wednesday became the fifth country in the world to record more than 50,000 coronavirus-related deaths, a level that one of the nation’s leading doctors says “should never have been reached.”Figures from the British government showed that 595 more people in the country died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus, the highest daily number since May. The figure took the U.K.’s total death toll from the pandemic to 50,365.The U.K, which has the highest virus-related death toll in Europe, joins the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico in reporting more than 50,000, according to a tally maintained by Johns Hopkins University.The U.K.’s overall death toll is widely considered to be far higher than that as the total reported only includes those who have tested positive for the virus and doesn’t include those who died of COVID-related symptoms after 28 days.Like other nations in Europe, the U.K. is experiencing a resurgence of the virus and has imposed new restrictions to curb infections over the past few weeks. England is currently in the midst of its second lockdown, which is due to expire on Dec. 2.Following the news about the death toll exceeding 50,000, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.K. is better equipped to handle outbreaks than it was during the first wave in the spring, when the country reported more than 40,000 deaths.In addition to the prospect of a vaccine or vaccines against the coronavirus coming through in the next few months, Johnson cited far more widespread testing. Last week, the government started its first city-wide testing program in the northwest England city of Liverpool. It is planning more widespread testing around the country over the coming weeks, including of university students in early December ahead of their return home for Christmas.“It is a global pandemic whose effects, whose treatments, whose implications for the economy — all those have been becoming clearer and clearer as the months have gone on,” said Johnson, who was hospitalized in April after contracting the virus.In Wednesday’s daily update, the British government also said that another 22,950 people tested positive for the virus. While the number of new cases is much higher than 24-hour statistics recorded in the summer, daily confirmed cases appear to be stabilizing, or at least, growing far more slowly.Because of time lags, most scientists expect the number of people being hospitalized and dying to continue rising for weeks, even after the number of confirmed infections do start going down.“Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue, and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures — and the sacrifices we are all making — is seen and is reflected in the data,” said Dr. Yvonne Doyle, medical director of Public Health England.Under the terms of the current lockdown in England, non-essential places such as pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, golf courses, gyms, swimming pools, entertainment venues and stores selling items like books, clothing and sneakers, must remain closed until at least Dec. 2.Unlike the U.K.’s spring lockdown, schools and universities in England are remaining open this time, as are construction sites and factories.In a visit to a supermarket in southeast London, Johnson said that “hopefully” the four-week lockdown in England will be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is “as normal as possible.”Whatever happens in the near-term, there are calls for a public inquiry to assess a range of issues that many think have led to more deaths in the U.K. than should otherwise have occurred, from problems with the testing program to shortages of personal protective equipment at the outset of the pandemic, as well as the high death rates in care homes and within ethnic minority groups.“Today’s figure is a terrible indictment of poor preparation, poor organization by the government, insufficient infection control measures, coupled with late and often confusing messaging for the public,” said Dr. Chaand Nagpaul, council chair of the British Medical Association, a union for doctors.“This is a point that should never have been reached.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-becomes-5th-country-to-exceed-50-000-coronavirus-deaths/story-ZYoutQ5aBQVdP0pEvZM2eI.html

Its infection rate has declined to 525 cases per 100,000 people from highs of more than 800.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-travelling-to-spain-from-high-risk-nations-to-submit-negative-pcr-test-on-arrival/story-PvA42sqozNoaheMd0s3GFJ.html
12-11-2020||World||America is back, Biden tells world leaders||US President-elect Joe Biden said on Tuesday he told world leaders calling to congratulating him that “America is back”, signalling the country’s return to increased global engagement in a reversal of President Donald Trump’s isolationism driven by his ‘America First’ motto.“I’m letting them know that America is back. We’re going to be back in the game,” Biden said in his first news briefing after his election. These were also Biden’s first remarks aimed at foreign nations, some of whom have welcomed his election such as the UK, France, Germany and India, while others such as China, Brazil and Russia haven’t. Moscow has said it wanted President Trump to exhaust his legal options.Biden repeated his message to the world in a tweet later: “When I’m speaking to foreign leaders, I’m telling them: America is going to be back. We’re going to be back in the game.”Biden has spoken with leaders of five countries over the past two days, all close and traditional allies of the United States: Canada’s Justin Trudeau, France’s Emanuel Macron, Germany’s Angela Merkel and UK’s Boris Johnson and Ireland’s Michael Martin. He will be speaking to more over the coming days.Biden ran on the promise of restoring America’s role and leadership in global affairs. “And in order to lead again, we must restore our credibility and influence,” said his vision statement for his presidential campaign. “From day one of a Biden administration, other countries will once again have reason to trust and respect the word of an American president.”Biden also sought to allay concerns at home about roadblocks being placed by the Trump administration in the smooth transfer of power, as is the tradition.But he said the president’s refusal to concede was an “embarrassment, quite frankly” and it “won’t help his legacy”.Biden’s transition team was already at work and the president-elect said he expected to name “at least a couple” of members of his cabinet before Thanksgiving, November 26.The Trump administration has refused to engage with Biden’s transition team, blocking funds and denying intelligence briefings among other things. And the president has continued to press allegations of election fraud and file lawsuits, none of whom have had any serious impact. He has also insisted in falsely claiming he won the election.Secretary of state Mike Pompeo, a close ally of the president, took it further. “There will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration,” he told reporters at a briefing. He sought to walk it back later, faced with growing blowback. “We’ll have a smooth transition and we’ll see what the people ultimately decided when all the votes have been cast,” he said on Fox News when asked if he was joking earlier.President-elect Biden laughed off Pompeo’s partisan remarks at his own news conference. He had had very reassuring calls with world leaders. He described their response — “very fulsome and energetic” and added “I feel confident that we’re going to be able to put America back in a place of respect that it had before”.Tackling Covid-19 and climate change figured in Biden’s conversations with all leaders, according to a readout issued by the transition team. Under Biden, the US could rejoin the Paris Accord on tackling the climate crisis, though it was not mentioned. US ties with NATO and EU came up in discussions with Macron, Merkel and Johnson.Biden and Macron also discussed Iran’s nuclear programme. No details were available but the French president had personally tried hard to persuade Trump to not leave the Iran deal, which he did.Biden’ vision statement had indicated the possibility of resurrecting the deal. “If Tehran returns to compliance with the deal, President Biden would re-enter the agreement, using hard-nosed diplomacy and support from our allies to strengthen and extend it, while more effectively pushing back against Iran’s other destabilising activities,” it had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/america-is-back-biden-tells-world-leaders/story-ciDMnK9SrPdV6z8jFkBPbP.html
