The reason is simple, he says: “He has no economic plan. I don’t mean that I don’t like it. It doesn’t exist.”Click here for complete coverage of US election 2020Hubbard was chairman of President George W. Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers from 2001 to 2003 and advised the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012, and of Jeb Bush in 2016. He’s a professor at Columbia University and was dean of Columbia Business School from 2004 to 2019.Hubbard says he could “imagine opportunities” for a second Trump term, such as how to fix problems with the health-care system that have been “laid bare” by the Covid-19 pandemic. “Maybe talk about fiscal reform, or trade in a way that engaged our allies,” but he hasn’t done any of that, Hubbard says.“Anybody who says they know what Trump would do in a second term, I don’t know where they’re getting that from,” he says.Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic candidate for president, doesn’t have much of a plan either, according to Hubbard. “His, too, is a little odd,” he says. “I’d have thought, if I was running for president, I would have focused on recovery and then a variety of renewal, recovery issues. There’s not really much there other than nods to the Democratic plan, which is kind of a Christmas tree.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-has-no-economic-plan-says-republican-economist-glenn-hubbard/story-VeVGlXOatPnEzCqvG8oDJP.html
03-11-2020||World||US Justice Barrett’s first major hearing to focus on gay rights||Can a Catholic adoption agency exclude gay and lesbian couples from fostering children in the name of its religious beliefs? The US Supreme Court will hear the case Wednesday, just one day after the country’s presidential election.It is first major hearing to come before Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a devout Catholic appointed by President Donald Trump and sworn in last week over the objection of Democrats.Her appointment eight days before the presidential vote solidified the court’s conservative majority, which now stands at six out of nine justices.The case, LGBT rights advocates say, has implications not just for same-sex couples, but an array of minorities including those practicing other faiths.In March 2018, the city of Philadelphia learned that one of its child welfare providers, Catholic Social Services (CSS), had refused to match foster children with same-sex couples.In the resulting case, CSS alleged that the move violated its First Amendment rights guaranteeing freedom of religion and expression under the US Constitution.“Philadelphia demands that a religious agency, an arm of a church, speak and act according to Philadelphia’s beliefs,” the group said in a court brief.Its case has received support from dozens of churches and lawmakers from Bible Belt states as well as the Trump administration, which says that the northeast US city is acting out of “hostility” towards religion.Philadelphia requires all foster partners to sign a nondiscrimination clause and argued in its own brief that “the Constitution does not grant CSS the right to dictate the terms on which it carries out the government’s work.”The city has received the backing of the liberal American Civil Liberties Union, which warned that the case “could allow private agencies that receive taxpayer-funding to provide government services... to deny services to people who are LGBTQ, Jewish, Muslim or Mormon.”The court will decide on the case in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-justice-barrett-s-first-major-hearing-to-focus-on-gay-rights/story-cQPzwvLTdn6NugFWtAhrON.html

It added that students will be taught how the socialist system with Chinese characteristics helped curb the spread of coronavirus in the country.The focus of the new curriculum is clear from the education ministry’s statement – it will add to the narrative of how the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and the country “...have always put the safety and health of the people first”.The new curriculum on the pandemic will be added for students through first to the ninth grades and content related to it will be included in biology, physical education and health, history, and Chinese literature.“Knowledge of outbreak prevention and control, and content about ‘the spirit of fighting the pandemic’ will be among the points of emphasis,” the Sixthtone news website reported.“Students will learn about key figures who emerged during outbreak prevention and control efforts, as well as their deeds. They will learn to cultivate public service consciousness and dedication and be enriched with knowledge about the advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,” the ministry statement said.The education ministry statement did not give a timeline within which the curriculum will be revised.China has effectively controlled the coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, even as it rages globally, infecting and killing millions.Strict lockdowns combined with effective contact tracing have helped control the pandemic in China though sporadic cluster infections have broken out in Beijing, Qingdao and Urumqi since June.Until Monday, China reported around 86,000 cases with the death toll remaining at 4,634 for months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-change-school-curriculum-to-add-positive-covid-19-narrative/story-wcI9zlzLkQ3DEiFNUDJAAK.html

He said he would adopt the “approach taken in Mallya”.Modi’s lawyer Claire Montgomery, who also appeared for Mallya, raised objections on the admissibility of witness statements made under section 161 of the Indian Penal Code, among others. She also referred to remarks on the admissibility issue by legal expert Martin Lau, who was a witness presented by Modi’s team.Statements of several witnesses to Modi’s alleged fraud are part of India’s documentation in the case, including individuals who alleged that they were threatened at the behest of Modi.Modi, who is lodged in the Wandsworth jail, is the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the other by the Enforcement Directorate.Charges against Modi involve a Mumbai branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB) that extended his companies loans worth over Rs 11,300 crore. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case, relating to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (”criminal intimidation to cause death”).Further hearings are scheduled in early December and on January 7, 8 for final submissions.The magistrates court cleared Mallya’s extradition in December 2018. His appeals in the high court were also turned down, but the extradition currently awaits resolution of a legal process, widely believed to be an application for asylum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-evidence-on-nirav-modi-admissible-uk-court/story-lgUBChHht4toLFozSvjBVP.html

LE Intelligence Agencies have monitored several messages on protesters’ social media sites stating, ‘If you want to throw down come to Washington DC on November 4th,’” reads one of the bullets in the email, as obtained by The Hill.It further reported that the authorities are preparing for the worst, a non-scalable fence has been put around the White House ahead of Election day to create “a buffer” in case protests turn violent. In the DC area and across the country, cities are boarding up their windows as a protection.The chances of violence are expected to rise, irrespective of the result. In New Jersey and New York, pro-Trump demonstrators held up traffic over the weekend, while another group of Trump supporters surrounded a Joe Biden campaign bus in Texas.Three people were shot in Topeka, Kansas, amid a confrontation over individuals allegedly stealing political signs supporting the US President and local Republicans, over the weekend.As many US Citizens in the country voted by mail this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a possibility that the winner of the election may not be declared on November 3, which political observers are scared that tensions could rise as days pass.“We are all looking forward to every vote being counted, no matter how long it takes,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a news conference as quoted by the Hill, adding that they are “preparing to ensure the city’s safety.”“There is no secret that this election is more contentious than in years’ past,” Terence Monahan, the chief of department at the New York Police, said at a press conference last month, according to reports, as per The Hill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-law-enforcement-gears-up-for-possible-unrest-post-election-day/story-4zZEzqrbajKsG69OvMQ7ZL.html
03-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Long lines seen outside polling stations as Americans go to vote||Americans were voting in large numbers on Tuesday in one of the most divisive bitter presidential elections in decades in which incumbent Republican Donald Trump is challenged by Democrat Joe Biden.Click here for complete coverage of US election 2020Amidst a resurgent Covid-19 pandemic, nearly 100 million people have already cast their ballots in early voting, putting the country on course for its highest turnout in a century. Some 239 million people are eligible to vote this year.The mail-in ballots could take days or weeks to be counted in some states - meaning a winner might not be declared in the hours after polls close on Tuesday.There is an estimated four million Indian-American population of which about 2.5 million are potential voters in the November 2020 presidential elections. Over 1.3 million Indian-Americans are voters in key battleground states, including Texas, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania.The timing of the start of the polling differs from State to State, mainly due to the different time zones. People mostly in the East coast started trickling down to the polling stations as many States opened up the polling stations at around 6 am (4.30 pm IST). These States include Virginia, New York, New Jersey, and Maine. Polling in California starts at 7 am (8.30 pm IST).Initial reports indicated an early large turnout. In the battle ground State of Pennsylvania, hundreds of people were seen outside polling booths even before the start of the polling.Also Read | US election 2020: Biden-Harris urge US citizens to cast their ballots as voting gets underwayTrump who returned from campaigning in the wee hours of Tuesday urged Americans to vote for him. “VOTE, VOTE, VOTE!” Trump said in a tweet with a short video of him dancing at election rallies.“Vote like your freedoms, your livelihood, and our future depends on it… Because they do!” said Trump, who is seeking to avoid becoming the first incumbent president to lose a re-election since George HW Bush in 1992.Biden also tweeted urging people to vote. “It’s Election Day. Go vote, America!” he tweeted.“In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in me to help lead this country alongside Barack Obama. Today, I’m asking for your trust once again — this time, in Kamala and me. We can heal the soul of this nation — I promise we won’t let you down,” Biden tweeted.Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris, urged voters to not to “allow anything to come between you and your vote. If you have any questions or concerns about voting, reach out to our voter hotline.” In another tweet, she said, “If you’ve already voted, thank you. But we still need your help. Take 20 minutes to help voters in critical battleground states find their polling location. This election is too important to leave anything to chance.” National polls continue to show Biden leading Trump, by a comfortable 8 percentage points.US elections, however, are not determined by the national popular vote, but rather in the 538-member Electoral College, with each candidate needing a majority of 270 to win the presidency.In all but two of the country’s 50 states, either Trump or Biden will win all the electors from each state by winning the popular vote there, with the most populous states holding the most electors.The coronavirus pandemic is a major topic during this election. The US has recorded more cases and more deaths than any other country worldwide, reporting more than 81,000 new infections on Sunday alone. Some 9.2 million people are also affected by the disease.The US economy saw record-breaking 33 per cent growth in the third financial quarter of this year, following a record 31 per cent contraction in the second.The November 3 presidential election has been billed as one of the most divisive in recent American history.Before the campaign closed, 74-year-old Trump toured the key voting battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania while his 77-year-old rival campaigned in Pennsylvania and Ohio, urging Americans to back them in the race for the White House.“To all of our supporters: thank you from the bottom of my heart. You have been there from the beginning, and I will never let you down. Your hopes are my hopes, your dreams are my dreams, and your future is what I am fighting for every single day!” Trump tweeted past midnight.“A vote for Sleepy Joe Biden is a vote to give control of government over to Globalists, Communists, Socialists, and Wealthy Liberal Hypocrites who want to silence, censor, cancel, and punish you. Get out and VOTE #MAGA tomorrow!,” the president wrote in another tweet, attacking Biden.Also Read | Progressive or moderate: How a Biden cabinet could impact US stocksThe Republican Party in a tweet said, “Let’s Make America Great Again and re-elect our fantastic president!” Biden, the former US vice president, said he was “running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president.” “I will work with Democrats and Republicans, and I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as for those who do.“Because that’s the job of a president,” he wrote.If elected as president, Biden said he will rebuild the infrastructure, combat climate change and create millions of good-paying and union jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-long-lines-seen-outside-polling-stations-as-americans-go-to-vote/story-JugCBI1vHC6ggJujAin95M.html

03-11-2020||World||China suspends Jack Ma’s Ant group Shanghai IPO after warning||China has suspended the Shanghai leg of Ant Group Co.’s $35 billion offering, potentially derailing the world’s biggest initial public offering.The Shanghai stock exchange will suspend the listing amid changes in the regulatory environment, it said in a statement Tuesday without providing further details. The debut was expected for Thursday, the same day as the Hong Kong portion.The shock move comes after China’s regulators warned that Jack Ma’s firm faces increased scrutiny and will be subject to the same restrictions on capital and leverage as banks. Ma, Ant’s billionaire co-founder, was summoned to a rare joint meeting on Monday with the country’s central bank and three other top financial regulators.Ant’s decision to list on the Star board, a market launched in Shanghai last year, was seen as a major win for mainland exchanges. The IPO had sparked a frenzy among individual investors, with about $2.8 trillion worth of subscriptions for the Shanghai leg alone. In the preliminary price consultation of its Shanghai IPO, institutional investors subscribed for over 76 billion shares, more than 284 times the initial offering tranche.Ant has faced scrutiny in Chinese state media in recent days after Ma criticized local and global regulators for stifling innovation and not paying sufficient heed to development and opportunities for the young. At a Shanghai conference late last month, he compared the Basel Accords, which set out capital requirements for banks, to a club for the elderly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suspends-jack-ma-s-ant-group-shanghai-ipo-after-warning/story-4LXPivcOSO23409l69ZGhJ.html
03-11-2020||World||US polls: Election Day shadowed by threats of legal challenges||Even before Election Day, the 2020 race was the most litigated in memory. President Donald Trump is promising more to come.The candidates and parties have enlisted prominent lawyers with ties to Democratic and Republican administrations should that litigation take on a new urgency if a narrow margin in a battleground state becomes the difference between another four years for Trump or Biden.Since the 2000 presidential election, which was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, both parties have enlisted legal teams to prepare for the unlikely event that voting wouldn’t settle the contest. But this year, there is a near presumption that legal fights will ensue and that only a definitive outcome is likely to forestall them.A Pennsylvania case at the Supreme Court pits Donald Verrilli, who was President Barack Obama’s top Supreme Court lawyer, against John Gore, a onetime high-ranking Trump Justice Department official.Trump said this weekend he was headed to court to prevent Pennsylvania from counting mailed ballots that are received in the three days after the election. An extension was ordered by Pennsylvania’s top court. The Supreme Court left that order in place in response to a Republican effort to block it.Trump is unhappy over the decision, even though Pennsylvania will keep those ballots separate from the rest in case of renewed court interest. He spent much of his final days of campaigning railing against it, often employing inaccurate characterizations of the decision as allowing “rampant and unchecked cheating” as well as undermining the law and including street violence. No evidence supports that view.On Sunday, Trump said that as soon as the polls close, “We’re going in with our lawyers.”Aside from what Trump’s telegraphed, though, it’s not clear what other issues may emerge as voters cast their ballots Tuesday, especially since early voting numbers have already eclipsed 2016 figures.There’s already been roughly 300 lawsuits over the election filed in dozens of states across the country, many involving changes to normal procedures because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 230,000 people in the U.S. and sickened more than 9 million. Legal battles ensued over signature matches, drop boxes and secrecy envelopes.Like Pennsylvania, North Carolina also has seen a court fight between Democrats who support extending the deadline for absentee ballots and Republicans who oppose it. The six-day extension was approved by a state court.In Minnesota, late-arriving ballots also will be segregated from the rest of the vote because of ongoing legal proceedings, under a federal appeals court order.Republican lawsuits have also challenged local decisions that could take on national significance in a close election.In Texas, Republicans asked state and federal courts to order election officials in the Houston area not to count ballots dropped off at drive-in locations. The Texas Supreme Court on Sunday denied the GOP’s plea. On Monday, a federal judge also turned away the effort to invalidate the nearly 127,000 votes. Appeals were planned.In Nevada, a state court judge rejected a bid by the Trump campaign and state Republicans to stop the count of mail-in ballots in Las Vegas, the state’s most populous and Democratic-leaning county, though an appeal to the state Supreme Court is being considered.Most of the potential legal challenges are likely to stem from the huge increase in absentee balloting brought on by the pandemic. In Pennsylvania, elections officials won’t start processing those ballots until Election Day, and some counties have said they won’t begin counting those votes until the following day. Mailed ballots that don’t come inside a secrecy envelope have to be discarded, under a state Supreme Court ruling.“I still can’t figure how counting and verifying absentee ballots is going to go in some of the battleground states like Pennsylvania,” said Ohio State University law professor Edward Foley, an election law expert.Trump’s threat of legal action comes as he has been delivering a chaotic closing message during the waning days of the campaign as he lags behind Biden nationally and by narrow margins in key states. The president has made a flurry of last-minute campaign stops trying to hold onto states he won in 2016, including Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina.Over the weekend, he railed against absentee ballots, frustrated by a Supreme Court ruling that didn’t deliver a clear GOP win, continuing a monthslong push to sow unfounded doubt about potential voter fraud.But several conservative justices indicated they’d be open to taking the issue up after the election, especially if those late-arriving ballots could mean the difference in the state.The legal issue is whether the extension ordered by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, relying on voter protections in the Pennsylvania constitution, violated the U.S. Constitution. The argument advanced by Republicans is that the Constitution gives state legislatures — not state courts — the power to decide how electoral votes are awarded, inclu ding whether absentee ballots received after Election Day can be counted.Roughly 20 states allow for late-arriving ballots, but Pennsylvania’s Republican-controlled legislature did not authorize an extension, even with the huge increase in mailed ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic.The Supreme Court generally does not second guess state courts when they rely on their own constitutions. But Democrats were alarmed by Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s reference to the court’s 2000 Bush v. Gore decision that effectively decided the presidential election in favour of George W. Bush. Although it was not the majority opinion in the case, an opinion joined by three conservative justices in 2000 would have ruled for Bush because the Florida Supreme Court’s recount order usurped the legislature’s authority.The Supreme Court has never cited Bush v. Gore as the basis for a decision of the court. Kavanaugh is one of three justices who worked for Bush in the Florida case 20 years ago. Chief Justice John Roberts and new Justice Amy Coney Barrett are the others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-polls-election-day-shadowed-by-threats-of-legal-challenges/story-WYIidC0BSGSryAglZMZFGP.html
03-11-2020||World||Germany to implement antigen tests to keep elderly safe from coronavirus second wave||As Europe tries to break a surge in coronavirus infections, Germany is counting on a new type of test to avoid closing nursing homes to visitors, a move that caused considerable anguish among residents and relatives in the spring.So-called antigen tests, which look for a specific protein on the virus, were first launched months ago. They are cheap and fast, but experts said at the time they are also less accurate than the standard PCR test, which detects even the tiniest genetic trace of the virus.Still, Germany — which has managed to contain the spread of the outbreak better than many of its neighbours — announced recently that it is bulk-buying millions of antigen tests each month.“We have a new strategy,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters Monday. “We can now basically perform rapid tests on visitors to nursing and care homes.”Nursing homes will receive up to 20 free monthly tests per resident. These can be used to test patients, staff and — crucially — visiting relatives, who might be unwitting carriers of Covid-19, posing a potentially devastating threat.“Health insurers will cover the costs for a certain number of visitors each month,” Merkel said. “That’s huge progress in terms of protection.”Germany has one of the world’s oldest populations. More than 24 million people are 60 or older and about 900,000 people live in nursing homes. A further 2.5 million younger people have serious disabilities.That means almost 30% of Germany’s population of 83 million are particularly vulnerable to the virus, Merkel said.“Almost everyone knows somebody they don’t want to infect,” she said.Germany has reported about 550,000 coronavirus cases — less than half the number recorded in Britain, Spain and France. Germany’s confirmed virus death toll of 10,669 is also one-fourth of Britain’s.A Health Ministry spokeswoman told The Associated Press that manufacturers have agreed to supply Germany with 9 million antigen tests in November and 11.5 million tests in December.Experts caution that while antigen tests have become more accurate, they should not be seen as a replacement for the standard PCR method.Scientists in Switzerland recently scrutinized two widely available antigen tests, sold by Chicago-based Abbott Laboratories and Swiss pharma giant Roche. The researchers concluded that out of 100 people infected with the virus, only between 85 and 89 tested positive using the antigen method.“It does fulfill the criteria that are published by the (World Health Organization), which should be more than 80% sensitivity,” said Isabella Eckerle, who heads the Center for Emerging Viral Diseases at the University of Geneva, where the tests were validated.While the tests are less accurate, they provide quick results, she noted.“One big advantage of these tests would be that you, for example, can build up a decentralized testing center,” Eckerle told The AP. “So you build up a tent, let’s say, in front of a school or in a park, and then people can come. And then after 15 minutes, they will know if they are positive or not.”The tests still need to be carried out by a person qualified to take a nasal swab, however.“This test is not a home test,” she said. “It’s nothing that you can do in your home before you visit your grandmother.”Sandra Ciesek, who heads the Institute of Medical Virology at the University Hospital in Frankfurt, says the PCR test remains the “gold standard” for now.But Christian Drosten, one of Germany’s most prominent virologists who developed one the first PCR tests for Covid-19, has suggested that the antigen method has its uses if people take into account its limitations.One distinct feature of the new coronavirus is its ability to multiply rapidly in the throat of newly infected hosts, causing them to spread the virus days before they show symptoms. By the time most people are diagnosed, the amount of virus they are expelling when they speak or even breathe has dropped significantly.While only the PCR tests can determine with near-absolute certainty if someone is infected, argues Drosten, the antigen tests can indicate whether a person is infectious — and therefore a risk to others.Some experts say a negative result from an antigen test could therefore be sufficient to allow people without symptoms to leave quarantine or return to school or work, giving greater freedoms particularly to children and young adults who are less at risk from serious illness.Eckerle, of the University of Geneva, was hesitant.“I would not call them a game changer,” she said. “They are a very nice and very important addition that comes exactly at the right time. But because they are less sensitive than our standard tests, we know that we would probably still miss a small proportion of infectious cases.”That’s a risk some countries may be willing to take as the pandemic drags on and the availability of PCR tests reaches its limits.Antigen tests are already used at nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the United States. Spain warned of faulty tests early in the pandemic, but the World Health Organization has since touted them as an effective tool for low- and middle-income countries.Roche says it can provide over 40 million antigen tests per month worldwide and aims to more than double that by the end of the year. The company declined to disclose the price of its tests but said that “in pandemic situations like this, cost should not be a barrier to accessing diagnostics.”Abbott said it is providing “tens of millions” of its $5 antigen test per month and is working to ramp up capacity.As new restrictions came into force in Germany on Monday with no certainty that they will effectively flatten the curve of infections, Merkel said the country might be able to get as many as 20 million antigen tests in January, offering some prospect of freedom.“Then we can (...) start thinking about whether we can do this for visits to grandparents, not just care homes,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-to-implement-antigen-tests-to-keep-elderly-safe-from-coronavirus-second-wave/story-MMzmJLv1MeEL3TxK53YFKN.html

Among the cabinet posts that are most likely to have an effect on stock prices are secretary of the Treasury, which could oversee a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill backed by House Democrats, and Transportation, which will likely oversee a broad infrastructure package to hasten the development of electric vehicles as part of Biden’s $2 trillion climate change plan.Progressive lawmakers are pushing him to exclude any corporate executives or lobbyists from potential positions, people involved told Reuters. Biden has said he would consider Republicans for his cabinet as well, though that is unlikely for Treasury chief because it would set up a major fight with progressives who have their eye on that role in particular, according to people close to the campaign.Overall, the former vice president leads by 10 points in national polls, although his lead is narrower in the battleground states that will likely tip the election. “A cabinet that is not dominated by the progressive end of the Democratic spectrum would be more favorably viewed by the market” and dampen fears of increasing regulations under a Biden Administration, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. The Covid related recession and the so-called “K-shaped” recovery’s divergence of fortunes between the wealthy and everyone else, have boosted a fundamental progressive argument that American capitalism grossly favours the rich and needs to be reformed.Progressive policies tilt toward more government-run healthcare, providing subsidies for college tuition and increasing worker wages, while moderates support privately run healthcare plans and are less inclined to support government spending on large projects like the Green New Deal. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a progressive who is seen as one of Biden’s possible picks to lead the Treasury, has called for strengthening the walls between commercial and investment banks, boosting consumer protections and allowing the US Postal Service to partner with credit unions to provide basic consumer banking services. Fed Governor Lael Brainard and former Treasury deputy secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin are also seen among the most likely selections for the Treasury post. Another possible pick is Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo, according to the Washington Post. The Biden campaign and representatives for Warren, Raimondo and Brainard did not respond to requests for comment. “Brainard would be a strong and safe choice for a Biden administration,” said Kevin Gallagher, director of the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University. He cited her experience working at the Treasury under the Obama administration, a previous role at the White House under former President Bill Clinton and her current role as a member of the Federal Reserve Board. “The question is whether she is seen enough in tune with the more progressive wing of Biden’s coalition,” Gallagher said.While Warren and Brainard are qualified, “the foundation of Warren’s career has been attacking the banking industry,” Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said in a September research note, and that would “likely rattle investor confidence.” Amy Wu Silverman, Equity Derivatives Strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said in a recent research note that the market appeared to be underpricing the possibility of cabinet picks like Warren who would be negative for the market. The S&P 500 financial sector is down 1% since the first Trump-Biden debate on Sept. 29, compared with a 2.8% decline in the S&P 500 index as a whole, according to Refinitiv data. A Warren selection would likely come only with a blue wave that gives Democrats at least a two or three seat advantage in the Senate so as not to allow Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican, to select Warren’s replacement, said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. Biden’s “margins in the Senate are going to be the really important thing to watch here”, he said. A lower-profile pick that may have wide market implications will be the secretary of Transportation, which Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama both filled with a member of the opposing party in a show of bipartisanship. Shares of clean energy companies and electric vehicle stocks have jumped over the last month in anticipation of a Biden victory.“In an environment where you could see major infrastructure spending and additional regulation in terms of electric vehicles and fuel standards, this may be a relatively important economic position,” Chiavarone said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/progressive-or-moderate-how-a-biden-cabinet-could-impact-us-stocks/story-cwZMWvVVHXJHVOUdKIPmSM.html
03-11-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden cede stage to voters for Election Day verdict||After a campaign marked by rancor and fear, Americans on Tuesday decide between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, selecting a leader to steer a nation battered by a surging pandemic that has killed more than 231,000 people, cost millions their jobs and reshaped daily life.Nearly 100 million Americans voted early, and now it falls to Election Day voters to finish the job, ending a campaign that was upended by the coronavirus and defined by tensions over who could best address it. Each candidate declared the other fundamentally unfit to lead a nation grappling with Covid-19 and facing foundational questions about racial justice and economic fairness.Biden entered Election Day with multiple paths to victory while Trump, playing catch-up in a number of battleground states, had a narrower but still feasible road to clinch 270 Electoral College votes. Control of the Senate was at stake, too: Democrats needed to net three seats if Biden captured the White House to gain control of all of Washington for the first time in a decade. The House was expected to remain under Democratic control.Voters braved long lines and the threat of the virus to cast ballots as they chose between two starkly different visions of America for the next four years. The record-setting early vote — and legal skirmishing over how it will be counted — drew unsupported allegations of fraud from Trump, who refused to guarantee he would honor the election’s result.Fighting to the end for every vote, Biden was headed to Philadelphia and his native Scranton on Tuesday as part of a closing get-out-the-vote effort before awaiting election results in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, was visiting Detroit, a heavily Black city in battleground Michigan. Both of their spouses were headed out, too, as the Democrats reached for a clear victory.Trump, after a morning appearance on his favoured network, Fox News Channel, planned to visit his campaign headquarters in Virginia. He invited hundreds of supporters to an election night party in the East Room of the White House.The hard-fought campaign left voters on both sides eager to move on.“I just want it to be done,” said Starlet Holden, a 26-year-old medical biller from New York City, who planned to vote for Biden but spoke for many on both sides of the campaign.On their final full day on the campaign trail, Trump and Biden broke sharply over the mechanics of the vote itself while visiting the most fiercely contested battleground, Pennsylvania.The Republican president threatened legal action to block the counting of ballots received after Election Day. If Pennsylvania ballot counting takes several days, as is allowed, Trump claimed without evidence that “cheating can happen like you have never seen.”In fact, there are roughly 20 states that allow mail-in ballots received after Election Day to be counted — up to nine days and longer in some states. Litigation has centered on just a few where states have made changes in large part due to the coronavirus.Biden told voters in Pennsylvania that the very fabric of the nation was at stake and offered his own election as the firmest rebuke possible to a president who he said had spent “four years dividing us at every turn.”“Tomorrow’s the beginning of a new day. Tomorrow we can put an end to a president that’s left hardworking Americans out in the cold!” Biden said in Pittsburgh. “If you elect me as president, I’m gonna act to heal this country.”Trump argued, at a stop in Wisconsin, that Biden was “not what our country needs.” He added: “This isn’t about — yeah, it is about me, I guess, when you think about it.”For Trump, the election stood as a judgment on his four years in office, a term in which he bent Washington to his will, challenged faith in its institutions and changed how America was viewed across the globe. In a country divided along lines of race and class, he often acted as an insurgent against the very government he led, undercutting its scientists and bureaucracy and doing battle with the media.The nation braced for what was to come — and a result that might not be known for days.A new anti-scale fence was erected around the White House. And in downtowns ranging from New York to Denver to Minneapolis, workers boarded up businesses lest the vote lead to unrest of the sort that broke out earlier this year amid protests over racial inequality.Just a short walk from the White House, for block after block, stores had their windows and doors covered. Some kept just a front door open, hoping to attract a little business.Both candidates voted early, but first lady Melania Trump was set to cast her ballot Tuesday near Mar-a-Lago, the couple’s estate in Palm Beach, Florida.The candidates blitzed through the battleground states on Monday, with Biden also pushing into Ohio, a state once thought to be safe for Trump. The president, for his part, packed in five rallies, Air Force One streaking across the sky as he drew crowds in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and then back in Michigan again.His finale stretched past midnight in Grand Rapids, where he had also held his last rally in 2016. It marked the end of an era in American politics, one in part defined by the massive and exuberant gatherings that the president continued to hold despite warnings from his government’s own public health experts to avoid crowds during the pandemic.The next president will inherit an anxious nation, reeling from a once-in-a-century heath crisis that has closed schools and businesses and that is worsening as the weather turns cold.Trump in Grand Rapids insisted anew that the nation was “rounding the turn” on the virus. But Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, broke with the president and joined a chorus of Trump administration scientists sounding the alarm about the current spike in infections.“We are entering the most concerning and most deadly phase of this pandemic,” Birx wrote in a memo distributed to top administration officials. She added that the nation was not implementing “balanced” measures needed to slow the spread of the virus. One recipient confirmed the contents that were initially reported Monday by The Washington Post.The pandemic has shadowed the campaign, which has largely been a referendum of Trump’s handling of the virus.In Concord, New Hampshire, 70-year-old Linda Eastman said she was giving her vote to Trump, saying, “Maybe he wasn’t perfect with the coronavirus, but I think he did the best that he could with what he had.”In Virginia Beach, it was a vote for Biden from 54-year-old Gabriella Cochrane, who said she thought the former vice president would “surround himself with the brightest and the best” to fight the pandemic.The challenge of counting a record-setting early vote added a layer of uncertainty to an election marked by suspicions fueled by an incumbent who has consistently trailed in the polls.Trump, in Pennsylvania, zeroed in on the state’s process to count mail-in votes that arrive after Election Day, vowing that “we’re going in with our lawyers” as soon as the polls close. He tweeted — without evidence — that “violence in the street” could follow the Supreme Court’s decision to grant an extension to count the votes arriving after Tuesday.Trump offered himself to voters as the same outsider he first pitched to voters four years ago, insisting he’s still not a politician. Presenting himself as the last barrier protecting an American way of life under siege from radical forces, he repeatedly tried to portray Biden, who is considered a moderate Democrat, as a tool of extreme leftists.Biden, for his part, cast Trump as an incompetent leader in a time of crisis, trying to connect what he saw as the president’s failures in containing the virus and on other matters to the everyday lives of Americans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-cede-stage-to-voters-for-election-day-verdict/story-A2z8Eo9pvY72IulwEtyj9O.html
03-11-2020||World||‘Why are you killing us?’: Afghans mourn those killed in IS attack in Kabul University||Afghanistan declared a national day of mourning Tuesday to honor the 22 people killed in a horrific attack a day earlier on Kabul University, which was claimed by the Islamic State group. Most of those killed were students and another 27 people were injured, some of them critically.Monday’s brutal, hours-long assault was the second attack on an educational institution in the Afghan capital in as many weeks amid a soaring rise in violence and chaos across Afghanistan, even as Taliban insurgents and government negotiators hold peace talks in the Gulf state of Qatar.The Islamic State affiliate also claimed the earlier attack on Oct. 24 that killed 24 students at a tutoring center. The attack occurred in the mostly Shiite neighborhood of Dasht-e-Barchi.The IS affiliate has declared war on the country’s minority Shiites and has claimed a number of vicious attacks since emerging in eastern Afghanistan in 2014.Outside Kabul University Tuesday a small group of demonstrators gathered demanding a cease-fire and urging the government to withdraw from the peace talks until a permanent end to hostilities is declared. Some held signs reading “why are you killing us?”Mohammad Rahed, a policy and public administration student killed in the attack, posted a video to social media just days before the assault, where he urged people to live each moment and to “live with a smile.” The video was widely shared after the attack.His father told local media his son wanted to be president of Afghanistan and “honestly serve my people.”Meanwhile, President Ashraf Ghani warned that the perpetrators would be pursued.“We will not remain silent. We will take the revenge,” he said in a video message Tuesday. “Our brave forces are after you everywhere and they will eliminate you.”The brutal assault on the university was condemned by the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Human rights groups have expressed their outrage and Torek Farhadi, a political commentator in Kabul and former government advisor called for a “transparent investigation” into security in the Afghan capital to determine how heavily armed gunmen gained access to the country’s largest educational institution.The Islamic State is not part of peace talks and despite their claims of responsibility, the government has blamed Taliban for the attacks. Taliban, like the Afghan security forces, are fighting the Islamic State and under an agreement signed with the US, the Taliban have committed to fighting militancy, specifically the Islamic State.The government’s lead negotiator in peace talks, Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, called for an immediate cease-fire announcement from the Taliban.“If Taliban is committed to end brutal killing of people then should accept ceasefire,” Stanekzai tweeted Tuesday.The Taliban, which condemned the attack on the university and denied involvement within hours of its start, have refused to declare a cease-fire saying it would be part of the negotiations.But if not a cease-fire, then a significant reduction in violence has taken on increasing importance as Washington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Monday made a surprise visit to Pakistan urging Islamabad to urge the insurgent movement to reduce violence.Pakistan has been critical in pushing Taliban into talks. Even as the Islamic insurgent group ousted by the U.S.-led coalition in 2001 maintains its political office in Doha, where talks are being held, its leadership councils are located in Pakistan.Khalilzad brokered a peace pact with the Taliban that was signed in February and seen at the time as the country’s best chance at peace in more than 40 years of war. The peace agreement which is to allow U.S. and NATO troops withdraw from Afghanistan after 19 years, it also paved the way for the peace talks currently underway.In a series of tweets Tuesday Khalilzad condemned the attack but also warned “this barbaric attack is NOT an opportunity for the government and the Taliban to score points against each other. There is a common enemy here.”Family members of the victims mourned their loved ones on local TV and called for the government to investigate security lapses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-are-you-killing-us-afghans-mourn-those-killed-in-is-attack-in-kabul-university/story-VY6kKLEDzQfF7XWSrTxzYL.html

The Interior Ministry will specify the details later in the day and an edict will be issued,” Attal told BFM TV.France reported a record 52,518 new Covid-19 cases on Monday and the number hospitalised rose by more than a 1,000 for the fourth time in eight days, as the pandemic shows no signs of abating despite the new lockdown.France’s Covid-19 death toll rose by 416 to 37,435, compared with an increase of 231 on Sunday and a months-high seven-day moving average of 345.Health Minister Olivier Veran told RTL radio that one Parisian was becoming infected with Covid-19 every 30 seconds, while a Parisian is admitted to hospital with the disease every 15 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-reinstate-paris-evening-curfew-as-covid-19-worsens/story-LRrH5ANCRGm2TDxFOI1KmM.html

She cannot ignore the fact that every 30 seconds, there is a Parisian who has been contaminated,” said Veran.“We want to save the Parisians and the French people and we do that with determination and consistency,” he added.France reported a record 52,518 new Covid-19 on Monday, while the country’s Covid-19 death toll rose by 416 to 37,435.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-parisian-infected-with-covid-19-every-30-seconds-says-official/story-PhwCRHQF7fIhA0kW9topyL.html
03-11-2020||World||Iran’s supreme leader mocks US election using Donald Trump’s words||Iran’s supreme leader mocked America’s presidential election Tuesday in a televised address, quoting President Donald Trump’s own baseless claims about voter fraud to criticize the vote as Tehran marked the 1979 US Embassy hostage crisis.Click here for complete coverage of US elections 2020Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated a long-standing Iranian position that it didn’t matter whether Trump or Joe Biden wins the vote, but the stakes couldn’t be higher for the Islamic Republic.Another four years could see Trump’s maximum-pressure campaigns further expand as it crushes the Iranian economy and stops Tehran from openly selling its crude oil abroad. Biden meanwhile has said he would consider re-entering Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, providing possible relief to the beleaguered Iranian rial.“If you look at their own situation, it’s interesting to watch. The incumbent president, who is supposed to hold the elections, says this is the most-rigged US election throughout history,” Khamenei said, not acknowledging that individual US states run the vote. “Who says this? The sitting president who is arranging the elections himself. His opponent says Trump intends to widely cheat. This is American democracy.”Khamenei added that the result of the vote “is none of our business, meaning it won’t influence our policy at all. Our policy is clear and well-calculated and people coming and going will have no impact on it.”Khamenei, 81, as supreme leader has final say on all matters of state in Iran. He approved the efforts at reaching the nuclear deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.But Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, complaining it didn’t address Iran’s ballistic missile program nor its regional policies. Iran later withdrew from all the deal’s limits, though Tehran still allows UN inspectors access to nuclear sites. Satellite photos show it is now starting new construction work at its Natanz nuclear site, which was targeted in a reported sabotage attack in July.Also Read | Iran accused of hacking US voter data before election dayKhamenei spoke as the coronavirus pandemic forced authorities to cancel a planned commemoration of the Nov 4, 1979 takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran. That started a 444-day hostage crisis that transfixed America and still affects relations between Washington and Iran today.Anti-Americanism remains a cornerstone of Iranian policy, over four decades after the takeover.“Such an empire will not last long. It’s obvious that when a regime reaches this point, it will not live for much longer and will be destroyed,” Khamenei said of America. “Of course, some of them if they take office will destroy America sooner, and some others if elected will cause America to be destroyed a bit later.”Khamenei’s speech was marking the birth of Prophet Muhammad based on the Iranian calendar and he began his remarks with comments deeply critical of French President Emmanuel Macron over his defense of caricatures of the prophet, which has sparked protests by Muslims across the world amid two attacks in France. The supreme leader accused France of harboring “terrorist” groups targeting the Islamic Republic after earlier supporting Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during his 1980s war against Iran.He also called for an end of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, calling it a “bitter incident.”“The lands that were occupied by Armenia should be returned to Azerbaijan and security of Armenians of their lands should be provided,” Khamenei said. “There should be no violation of international borders and terrorists should not come close to our borders. If they get close, there will be an encounter” with Iran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-supreme-leader-mocks-us-election-using-donald-trump-s-words/story-RMdk8vzjFtU9feWGzv5i0N.html

03-11-2020||World||China rejects report it had seized territory from Nepal as ‘unfounded, rumour’||China on Tuesday dismissed a media report which said it had seized territory from Nepal as “completely unfounded” and “pure rumour”.The foreign ministry’s spokesperson Wang Wenbin was reacting to a report in the Daily Telegraph published on Tuesday that quoted Nepalese politicians as saying that Beijing had surreptitiously annexed more than 150 hectares on the Nepal-Tibet border, on the Nepalese side.“I want to point out that the report is completely unfounded rumour,” Wang said when asked to comment on the news report.The report “is not based on fact. It is a pure rumour,” Wang repeated when he was pressed further for a response.In October, Chinese state media had denied similar reports that said China had encroached Nepalese land in the Humla district.“The buildings that some in Nepal have accused China of encroaching on its land in Humla district falls within Chinese territory and is actually a newly-built village in Burang county in Ali, southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region,” the nationalist tabloid Global Times had said in a report on October 16.The report had blamed India for “hyping” the incident and accused the Nepalese opposition of making the allegations at the behest of New Delhi.“The main opposition Nepalese Congress, which has been hyping the incident, is considered as a pro-India force,” the Global Times report said.It then went to refer to the issue of India-Nepal territorial dispute.“India actually has a long-running territorial dispute with Nepal. The Indian government included a disputed area with Nepal to its new territory map in 2019, triggering conflicts between the two countries. In response, Nepal published a new map, which included Kalapani and other areas into its territory,” the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rejects-report-it-had-seized-territory-from-nepal-as-unfounded-rumour/story-XTn6FLihehGW3qWtCWsPhK.html
03-11-2020||World||Study finds ‘7 forms of disease’ in mild Covid-19, may help in developing vaccine||Scientists have shown that there are seven “forms of disease” in mild Covid-19, and that the novel coronavirus infection leaves behind significant changes in the immune system even after 10 weeks, findings which may aid in the treatment of patients, and in the development of a potent vaccine.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The study, published in the journal Allergy, involving 109 recovered Covid-19 patients and 98 healthy individuals in the control group, showed that various symptoms related to Covid-19 occur in groups. In the research, scientists, including those from the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, identified seven groups of symptoms including “flu-like symptoms” with fever, chills, fatigue and cough, “common cold-like symptoms” with rhinitis, sneezing, dry throat and nasal congestion, and “joint and muscle pain”. They said patients may also experience “eye and mucosal inflammation” symptoms, “lung problems” with pneumonia and shortness of breath, “gastrointestinal problems” including diarrhoea, nausea and headache, and “loss of sense of smell and taste and other symptoms”. “In the latter group we found that loss of smell and taste predominantly affects individuals with a ‘young immune system,’ measured by the number of immune cells -- T lymphocytes -- that have recently emigrated from the thymus gland,” said Winfried F. Pickl, a co-author of the study from the Medical University of Vienna. “This means that we were able to clearly distinguish systemic (groups one and three) from organ-specific forms (groups six and seven) of primary Covid-19 disease,” Pickl said. From the analysis, the scientists established that Covid-19 leaves behind long detectable changes in the blood of recovered patients, very similar to a fingerprint. Citing an example, they said the number of granulocytes, which are otherwise responsible in the immune system for fighting bacterial pathogens, is significantly lower than normal in the Covid-19 group. “However, both the CD4 and CD8 T cell compartment developed memory cells and CD8 T cells remained strongly activated. This indicates that the immune system is still intensively engaged with the disease several weeks after initial infection,” Pickl explained. According to the researchers, increased levels of antibody-producing immune cells were detected in the blood of recovered patients. The higher the fever of the affected patient during the mild course of the disease, the higher were the antibody levels against the virus, they said. “Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the disease and help us in the development of potential vaccines, since we now have access to promising biomarkers and can perform even better monitoring,” the scientists said. “Above all, the study shows that the human immune system “doubles up” when defending against Covid-19 with the combined action of immune cells and antibodies,” they noted. According to the study, the immune cells are also able to memorise certain “moves” on the part of the virus and respond to them. “Now it is a matter of implementing these findings and using them for the development of highly-effective Covid-19 vaccines,” the researchers said.

The exercise was an “important opportunity to work in concert with like-minded nations to support a secure, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-backed-quad-alliance-starts-joint-naval-exercises-in-indian-waters/story-ypskD9Xk6d57vnO2sHOq2L.html
03-11-2020||World||China to halt key Australian imports in sweeping retaliation||China has ordered traders to stop purchasing at least seven categories of Australian commodities, ratcheting up tensions with a key trading partner in its most sweeping retaliation yet. Commodities traders in China won’t be able to import products including coal, barley, copper ore and concentrate, sugar, timber, wine and lobster, according to people familiar with the situation. The government has ordered the halt to begin on Friday, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is sensitive.The notice was verbally relayed to major traders in meetings in recent weeks, one of the people said. Iron ore, Australia’s biggest export to China, won’t be included in the halt, the people said. The order represents a dramatic deterioration in ties, which have been strained since Australia barred Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network in 2018 on national security grounds. Relations have been in free fall since Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government in April called for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus.“China seems determined to punish Australia and make it an example to other countries,” said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at Sydney-based think tank the Lowy Institute. “They want to show there’s a cost for political disagreements.”China has already barred meat imports from four Australian slaughterhouses, delayed lobster shipments from clearing customs, slapped tariffs of more than 80% on barley, and said it won’t allow timber from Queensland state because of pests. Wine is also under an anti-dumping investigation while Chinese power stations and steel mills have been told to stop using Australian coal. Cotton purchases have also been suspended.Read more | China shops for graphene clothes for PLA soldiers at Ladakh border, flaunts itChina’s relevant departments conducted inspection and general quarantine measures on certain Australian goods according to laws and regulations, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing Tuesday in Beijing. China hopes Australia will do more so that bilateral relations can get back to normal soon, he said. China’s customs authority and Ministry of Commerce didn’t respond to faxes seeking comment. At least one customs clearance company started halting shipments across the seven types of products on Tuesday, a person said. China will also ban shipments of Australian wheat from a yet-to-be-disclosed date, according to the South China Morning Post, which earlier reported the impending bans on other Australian commodities.Australia’s government is working with domestic industry and making enquiries with the Chinese authorities about the reports, according to an emailed statement from Trade Minister Simon Birmingham. “China has consistently denied any targeting of Australia and spoken about its commitment to trade rules,” the statement said. “In the spirit of their statements, we urge relevant Chinese authorities to address concerns of sectors like the seafood trade to ensure their goods can enter the Chinese market free of disruptions.”China is Australia’s most important trading partner, with agricultural shipments alone totaling about A$16 billion ($11.3 billion) in 2018-19. With Australia in the midst of its first recession in almost 30 years, the widespread trade measures from Beijing couldn’t come at a worse time for Morrison’s government.Read more | From BRICS to SCO: India, China leaders to have face time at 5 summits in NovemberAustralia is the world’s most China-dependent developed economy and finalized a comprehensive free-trade agreement with Beijing in 2015, a year after President Xi Jinping made a state visit. But the Huawei ban, and anti-foreign interference laws that Canberra said were designed to reduce Beijing’s “meddling” in its internal affairs, marked the end of such cordial ties. Australia’s former treasurer Joe Hockey, who helped oversee the trade deal, on Tuesday accused Beijing of bullying and immature behavior.“The problem is China just doesn’t want to talk,” Hockey, who until January served as Australia’s ambassador to the U.S., said in a Bloomberg Television interview from Washington. “Instead they just want to react aggressively and try to bully us. And bullying never works with Australia.”McGregor, who said he doesn’t know the veracity or specific details of all the recent trade reprisals, called Morrison’s demand for a coronavirus probe a miscalculation.“Australia and China were always going to be edging toward separate paths,” he said. “But the call for the inquiry quickly turned the relationship into a very ugly divorce.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-halt-key-australian-imports-in-sweeping-retaliation/story-KS6VeSJvFVgG2ZAmICNVGK.html
03-11-2020||World||Vienna attacker was convicted for terrorism previously, says top Austrian official||Austria’s top security official says the attacker killed in Vienna was a 20-year-old dual citizen of Austria and North Macedonia who had a previous terrorism conviction.Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told Austria’s APA news agency that 15 house searches have taken place and several people have been arrested.Five people have died, including an assailant, and 17 others were wounded in a shooting in the heart of Vienna hours before a coronavirus lockdown started, Austrian authorities said Tuesday.Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said two men and two women have died from their injuries in the attack Monday evening. A suspected attacker, who was carrying an assault rifle and a fake suicide vest, was also shot and killed by police.Vienna’s hospital service said seven people were in life-threatening condition Tuesday after the attack, the Austrian news agency APA reported. In total, 17 people were being treated in hospitals, with gunshot wounds but also cuts.Nehammer said that initial investigations indicate the suspect who was killed had sympathized with the Islamic State group. Police searched his apartment and other premises as well, APA reported.“We experienced an attack last night by at least one Islamist terrorist,” Nehammer told reporters. He declined to elaborate, citing the ongoing investigation.Authorities were still trying to determine whether further attackers may be on the run, he said. People in Vienna were urged to stay at home if possible on Tuesday and children did not have to go to school. Some 1,000 police officers were on duty in Vienna on Tuesday morning.Among those wounded in the attack was a police officer, said Nehammer. The 28-year-old officer was in the hospital but was no longer in a life-threatening condition.The shooting began shortly after 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) Monday near Vienna’s main synagogue as many people were enjoying a last night of open restaurants and bars before a month-long coronavirus lockdown, which started at midnight.Vienna police chief Gerhard Puerstl said the attacker was killed at 8:09 p.m.Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said that “we are victims of a despicable terror attack in the federal capital.”Unverified footage posted on social media showed a gunman walking through the streets, apparently shooting at people at random, wounding several. It was unclear whether the person seen shooting was the same individual in each video.Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least one person shoot at people sitting outside at bars in the street below his window near the city’s main synagogue.“They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,” Hofmeister said. “All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown.”Authorities said residents have uploaded 20,000 videos of the attack to police.The attack drew swift condemnation and assurances of support from leaders around Europe, including from French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country has experienced three Islamist attacks in recent weeks, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.“The Islamist terror is our common enemy,” Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted. “The battle against these murderers and their instigators is our common fight.”U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted Monday night as he prepared for his final rally ahead of Election Day: “Our prayers are with the people of Vienna after yet another vile act of terrorism in Europe.”“These evil attacks against innocent people must stop,” Trump added. “The U.S. stands with Austria, France, and all of Europe in the fight against terrorists, including radical Islamic terrorists.”Austria’s military has provided 75 soldiers to guard key sites in Vienna, freeing up police to continue the investigation. Germany and Hungary have also offered to send tactical police units to support their Austrian colleagues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vienna-attacker-was-convicted-for-terrorism-previously-says-top-austrian-official/story-ndsS2SU8yP3xjBru15nOdI.html
03-11-2020||World||Budapest airport’s access to Covid-19 funds blocked by Hungary||The Hungarian government blocked Budapest Airport from accessing emergency Covid-19 funding, according to two people familiar with the matter.Due to a dramatic drop in air traffic related to the coronavirus pandemic, the airport had applied for a 50 million-euro ($58 million) short-term loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development through its “Solidarity Package” program.The request for support came amid job cuts at the international hub as air traffic collapsed by more than 99% this spring. Last month, Bloomberg reported that Budapest Airport Zrt. was the subject of an unsolicited purchase offer by allies of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.The funding, requested to stabilize the airport’s financial situation, ensure business continuity and pay obligations such as salaries, was vetoed by the Hungarian government in May, when it instructed the decision-making body of the EBRD to remove the application from the agenda, one of the people said.The second person said it was “extraordinary” for a government to block investment into its own country and may have the affect of pushing down the valuation of a strategic asset. The EBRD has provided lending support to other airports in the region.When asked about the airport’s request for support being blocked by Hungary, the development bank said “no comment.” The Hungarian government didn’t respond to a request for comment.A consortium including partially state-owned oil refiner Mol Nyrt. mandated Daniel Jellinek, the head of a local real-estate development company Indotek that did business with Orban’s family this year, to approach the airport’s owners.Jellinek acknowledged the talks after Bloomberg published its report on the offer, without providing further details. No details about the amount offered nor Orban’s exact role in the process have been disclosed.Orban has made no secret of his interest in returning the international flight hub, which was first sold to private owners in 2005, to state control. But its high valuation has long kept it out of the government’s reach.The pandemic has changed that. The airport said in April that it had lost almost all of its air traffic that month compared to the previous year and a reduction in headcount was “inevitable.” In September it announced 236 job cuts.The airport’s three owners -- GIC, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, a Canadian pension fund and AviAlliance, an airport management company that in turn is owned by another Canadian fund -- have no current plans to sell the airport, which was one of the world’s fastest-growing mid-size hubs before the pandemic.Jellinek’s Indotek, which this year bought the stake of Orban’s son-in-law, Istvan Tiborcz, in a listed real-estate company, has recently been expanding its portfolio. Last month the company bought a 24% stake in the road haulage firm Waberer’s International.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/budapest-airport-s-access-to-covid-19-funds-blocked-by-hungary/story-g6XrpQBSjSAbURB6d5e7LN.html
03-11-2020||World||China seized 150 hectares of Nepal, hint at rising anger along border: Report||China has annexed 150 hectares of Nepal, alleged the Himalayan nation’s politicians, adding that the annexations of Nepalese land are just the beginning of heightened Chinese aggression along the border. According to a report by the UK-based Telegraph, Chinese allegedly began seizing Nepali land in five frontier districts in May, sending members of its People’s Liberation Army (PLA) across undefended areas of the border.In Humla districts, PLA troops crossed the border into the Limi Valley and Hilsa, moving stone pillars which had previously demarcated the boundary further into Nepalese territory before constructing alleged military bases. The Daily Telegraph has seen images of the bases.PLA soldiers also allegedly moved border pillars further into Nepalese territory in the district of Gorkha.Further annexations occurred in the Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Sankuwasabha districts after Chinese engineers in the Tibet Autonomous Region diverted the flow of rivers acting as a natural boundary and claimed the previously submerged Nepalese territory.“Why should China come over into Nepal, when China is already sixty times the size of our small country?” Telegraph quoted Jivan Bahadur Shahi, a lawmaker in the Nepali Congress Party as saying.Nepali politicians have accused the government of staying silent for fear of angering their most important trading partner and regional ally.The Telegraph reported that China has pursued a more aggressive foreign policy under President Xi Jinping whose signature Belt and Road projects aim to construct trade and transport links from the country across Asia and into Europe.The land grab in Humla district appears to be motivated by the strategic view the district’s mountain peaks offer over the Himalayas, according to Nepalese politicians.In 2009, Chinese troops first crossed over into the undefended district and constructed a veterinary centre for livestock.Shahi objected to the construction but was told by the Nepali government the building would have a positive impact on the livelihoods of impoverished local residents who typically make a living by herding yak and goats.Shahi said around 30 hectares of Nepali territory have been seized in the Limi Valley. Chinese troops constructing an additional nine buildings, including military bases, according to Shahi.He said China annexed more land in the Humla district in June, in Hilsa, taking the total allegedly seized in these districts to 70 hectares.“The local people are very scared, particularly because they previously depended on Chinese traders to buy commodities like rice, bread and salt,” explained Shahi.“They are worried that if they raise their voices on the issue then it will disturb everything for them,” he added. In the first week of May, China had moved the pillars in the remote mountainous village of Rui awoke incorporating part of it into the Tibet Autonomous Region, according to Rakesh Kumar Mishra, a committee member of the opposition Janta Samajh Party.Mishra said around 60 hectares of land were annexed.Mishra and Shahi both accused the Nepalese government of inaction.The Nepalese Surveying and Mapping Department, which claimed China had purposefully altered the course of rivers acting as a natural border with Nepal to claim 33 hectares of land was quickly dismissed by Nepalese government sources.Nepal is currently ruled by the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), which sees the Communist Party of China (CCP), as an ideological brother, The Telegraph reported.China also contributes to the majority of vital foreign direct investment into Nepal, which is one of Asia’s poorest nations.“The people of Nepal need other countries to help them and protect its territory since it is such a small, landlocked country,” said Mishra.The Chinese side has built buildings at a distance of around two kilometres from border in the Lapcha Limi area of the Humla District. China in recent years has been carrying out construction works near the border with Nepal for several years.While the Government of Nepal has remained mum over the issue, the Chinese Mission in Nepal has issued a release claiming the building is built in their side and asked Nepali authorities to verify the border points.“The buildings mentioned in the media have been verified to be on the Chinese side of the China-Nepal border. The Nepali side may make verification again,” a Chinese Embassy spokesperson said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seized-150-hectares-of-nepal-hint-at-rising-anger-along-border-report/story-HbjI9ojCPwOV7c2CAKYXCP.html
03-11-2020||World||US judge strikes down Trump immigration rule denying green card to immigrants||A federal judge in Chicago struck down a key immigration rule Monday that would deny green cards to immigrants who use food stamps or other public benefits, a blow to the Trump administration on the eve of the election.In a decision that applies nationwide, US District Judge Gary Feinerman rejected the rule that had taken effect recently after the US Supreme Court reversed a hold on the policy following lawsuits. Among other things, Feinerman said the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which makes federal agencies accountable to the public by outlining a detailed process for enacting regulations.The decision marked the latest turn in a complex legal battle over the rule that has been among President Donald Trump’s most aggressive steps in overhauling the nation’s immigration system. The Chicago lawsuit, filed by the Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights and Cook County, was among numerous legal challenges.Under the Trump administration policy, immigration officials could deny permanent residency to legal immigrants over their use of food stamps, Medicaid, housing vouchers or other public benefits. Green card applicants had to show they wouldn’t be burdens to the country or “public charges.”Federal law already required those seeking permanent residency or legal status to prove they wouldn’t be a “public charge.” But the Trump administration rule included a wider range of programs that could disqualify them.Immigrant rights advocates deemed it a “wealth test,” while public health experts said it would mean poorer health outcomes and rising costs as low-income migrants chose between needed services and their bid to stay in the country legally. Several cities said such a chilling effect was already evident.Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel for ICIRR, called the rule an “attack” on legal immigration and criticized the way the Trump administration has instituted policies.“We may or may not get a new administration,” he said. “If we do, we’d like to see a lot of this damage undone and hopefully some legislative changes that will actually benefit immigrants instead of scaring them away.”Officials in Cook County, which runs one of the nation’s largest public health systems, argued that when people lack health care coverage, they’re less likely to seek preventative care and rely on more expensive emergency care. That also would increase the risk of communicable diseases.“As we all continue to be impacted by Covid-19, it is vital that no one is fearful of accessing health care. The court’s decision to block enforcement of the Public Charge Rule re-opens doors for immigrants to access vital services like health care,” Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle said in a statement.The US Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 vote in January that the rule could take effect, but enforcement was halted by a federal judge in New York because of the coronavirus pandemic. But by September, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed that hold and the rule took effect nationwide.The Trump administration has touted the rule as a way to ensure only those who are self-sufficient come to the US, one of many steps to try to move the country toward a system that focuses on immigrants’ skills instead of emphasizing the reunification of families.US Immigration and Citizenship Services ceased applying the rule to pending applications and petitions after the ruling in Chicago, agency spokesman Dan Hetlage said in a statement issued Monday evening.“USCIS will fully comply with the decision and issue additional forthcoming guidance while the agency reviews the decision,” he said.If there are further appeals, there could be another legal wrinkle in the case.In June, the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Feinerman’s decision blocking enforcement of the rule in Illinois while the merits of the case could be decided. It was a 2-1 decision, with then-Circuit Judge Amy Coney Barrett dissenting. Barrett was confirmed as a Supreme Court justice last month and would have to recuse herself if the case reached the nation’s highest court.___Follow Sophia Tareen on Twitter: https://twitter.com/sophiatareen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-judge-strikes-down-trump-immigration-rule-denying-green-card-to-immigrants/story-qJeAFnzQpsXpjGGfpOeTKL.html

03-11-2020||World||China adds new test for Indians after 23 test Covid +ve on flight to Wuhan||As many as 23 Covid-19 positive Indians, 19 of them asymptomatic, were on board a Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flight that landed in the central Chinese city of Wuhan from New Delhi last Friday, Chinese health authorities said on Tuesday.The flight registered the highest number of infected persons on an Indian rescue flight to China so far.Asymptomatic carriers are those who are infected but do not show symptoms of the disease but could infect others.The large number of cases on the flight – and the high incidence of the disease in India – seemed to have prompted the Chinese embassy in New Delhi to change pre-boarding Covid-19 testing rules for Indians coming to China on special flights from November 7 onwards.The embassy announced on Monday that the Covid-19 IgG (immunoglobulin) antibody test will now be required for Indians planning to come to China. If a person has been exposed to the coronavirus that causes Covid-19, she or he will typically produce IgG antibodies as part of the immune response to the virus.“All passengers taking the charter flights or special flights from India to China arranged by the government of China or India, are required to take double nucleic acid tests and one IgM antibody test of Covid-19, in the labs authorised by the Indian Council of Medical Research (hereinafter referred to as ICMR) , with the samples of the first nucleic acid test collected within 72 hours (3 days) before boarding, and the samples of the second nucleic acid test and the IgM antibody test collected within 36 hours before boarding,” the Chinese embassy said in a statement published on its website on Monday.The statement added: “For passengers of the Indian charter flights or special flights, the certificates of negative results of the three said tests along with the personally signed Health Declaration Form shall be sent through the Ministry of External Affairs of the Republic of India to the Chinese Embassy in India for verification and stamping at least 24 hours before boarding.”As Covid-19 cases rebound globally, Beijing is scrambling to put in place more stringent testing for those planning to come to China.Several Chinese embassies including in the US, Russia and UK now require both Chinese and foreigners flying to China to take the IgG test in addition to the nucleic acid test.Meanwhile, the Wuhan municipal health commission said in its daily bulletin on Tuesday that all 23 Covid-19 positive persons on the VBM flight were sent to Jinyintan hospital for isolation, diagnosis, and treatment.“The 19 imported asymptomatic infections from abroad were all Indian nationals. After quarantine and sampling, the nucleic acid test report was positive, and all were transferred to the Jinyintan Hospital for isolation, diagnosis and treatment,” the commission said.The commission added that after “comprehensive epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, laboratory test and imaging examination results, etc (and) after consultation with experts, it is determined as an imported asymptomatic infection from abroad”.The commission added that after investigation, close contacts of the confirmed cases and the asymptomatic infected persons were found to be “254 people on the same flight. They were all isolated at designated isolation points for medical observation.”Air India, on its part, said all passengers who boarded the flight from New Delhi were carrying valid health certificates. “All our passengers to Wuhan had boarded the flight from Delhi with Covid-19 negative reports from certified labs. Air India strictly adheres to all safety protocols laid down by regulatory bodies and conforms to requirements at destination airports. There is no question of pax (passengers) boarding any of our flights without valid Covid-19 negative reports,” an Air India spokesperson said in New Delhi on Monday.It was not immediately clear what impact the cases in the Wuhan VBM flight will have on the ones planned ahead for China.Flights are scheduled for November 6, 13, 20, 27 and December 4.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Tuesday said the two sides are engaging in communication regarding follow-up arrangements for temporary flights.More than 1,500 Indians are waiting to return to China in upcoming VBM flights expected over the coming weeks.The Friday flight was the sixth VBM flight by Air India to China to help Indians stranded in both the countries to travel back to their destinations.More than 1,500 Indians are waiting to return to China in upcoming VBM flights expected over the coming weeks.There is still no word from China when nearly 23,000 Indian students studying here will be able to return.The Delhi-Wuhan-Delhi flight was announced after the cancellation of the October 23 flight to Guangzhou in south China.China’s civil aviation administration hasn’t permitted Air India’s VBM flights to land in Beijing as a precaution against what Beijing calls “imported cases” of Covid-19.The coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province, in late December before spreading across the country and then globally, triggering the worst pandemic in decades.India had dispatched three flights to Wuhan to airlift Indians stranded in the city when the virus was at its peak in the city in February this year.China has brought the pandemic under control though local clusters have broken out in cities like Dalian, Qingdao, Urumqi and Kashgar in past weeks, triggering partial lockdowns and mass nucleic acid testing.It has also placed strict measures to control imported cases including cancelling flights on routes where Covid-19 cases were reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-adds-new-test-for-indians-after-23-test-covid-ve-on-flight-to-wuhan/story-ItY7rb10W2Z2f3naGLitrO.html
03-11-2020||World||US elections 2020: Veteran Republican operative leads Trump’s ‘army’ of poll watchers||A veteran Republican operative who got his start in politics by helping to persuade a judge to throw out hundreds of mail-in ballots is organizing an “army” of volunteers for President Donald Trump’s campaign to monitor voting in Democratic-leaning areas on Tuesday.Click here for full US elections 2020 coverageMike Roman, Trump’s director of Election Day Operations, is a former White House aide from Pennsylvania who gathered claims in 1993 of voter fraud, resulting in a court ruling overturning election results and getting his candidate seated in the Pennsylvania State Senate.It’s a strategy that Trump has been advocating on Twitter and on the stump.For months the president has been trying to undercut the validity of mail-in ballots, a long-used method of voting that was up this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the last week, Trump has also suggested that any votes tabulated after Election Day are suspect, even as his campaign has opposed plans by elections officials to start counting mail-in ballots early.Roman, who previously ran the secretive in-house intelligence unit for the political network led by GOP mega-donors Charles and David Koch, has organized what the campaign claims is 50,000 poll watchers. Many many of them registered through an “Army For Trump” website that asks his supporters to “enlist” in his reelection fight. The campaign also has hired full-time staff in at least 11 battleground states to organize the effort, several of them young lawyers.“Our Elections Day Operations are designed to make sure that everyone that is legally entitled to vote has the opportunity to vote, once,” Erin Perrine, the Trump 2020 director of press communications, says in a video aimed at recruiting volunteers. “We all know that the Democrats will be up to their old dirty tricks on Election Day to make sure President Trump doesn’t win. We cannot let that happen.”The Trump campaign portrays its Election Day Operations effort as traditional poll-watching long carried out by both parties. But Democrats and some Republicans who have followed Roman’s political career are worried that Trump’s team is interested more in sowing doubt about the vote than safeguarding it.“Mike Roman has made many unsubstantiated allegations of fraud and rigging, he has a history and general reputation as someone who stirs things up, so his presence in any Election Day issues gives me pause,” said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who studies elections law.Trump 2020 spokeswoman Thea McDonald called such assertions “laughable.” She said the campaign’s “rule-abiding poll watchers” are simply trying to “ensure a fair election.”Both campaigns have zeroed in on Pennsylvania as the battleground state that might decide the election. Speaking about the Keystone State on Sunday, Trump said that when election night is over, “We’re going in with our lawyers.”“I don’t think it’s fair that we have to wait a long period of time,” Trump said. “They should have put their ballots in.”Roman, who declined to comment for this story, has experience doing what Trump describes.He got his political start running ballot security operations in Philadelphia for Republican Bruce Marks, who campaigned for the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1993 and lost narrowly to his Democratic opponent.As Roman and Marks tell it in a June blog post on Marks’ website, control of the Pennsylvania State Senate turned on the race, and “the Democratic machine’s operatives descended on the District to steal the election.” Their legal team later convinced a federal judge that there were so many ballots in Latino neighborhoods with irregularities that he threw out hundreds of ballots, overturning the result and sending Marks to a State Senate seat.Marks, who has made his legal career representing wealthy Ukrainian and Russian clients and briefly defended Trump’s 2016 campaign, said Roman’s working-class background gave him an innate understanding of ballot-box politics.“He is not some Ivy leaguer with a bow tie, he learned what it is like to be exposed to elections and face voter fraud on the street,” said Marks, adding that Roman grew up in a rowhouse. “If there are problems on Election Day and after, I am ready and willing to help. Mike is a great guy.”In the 2008 presidential election, Roman made a splash by promoting a video of two members of the New Black Panther Party standing outside a polling place in Philadelphia, one of them holding a billy club. Though no violence occurred, the video was hyped nationally by those on the right as evidence of Democratic voter intimidation, while those on the left criticized it as an attempt to stoke racial divisions during the election of the nation’s first black president, Barack Obama.The New Black Panther video raised Roman’s profile within the Republican Party, and he soon landed a job at the Koch network investigating Democrats, environmental activists and others on the left. A 2014 tax return for the Koch-supported Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce Inc. lists Roman’s title as vice president of research, and says he was paid more than $285,000 in annual salary and benefits.In 2016, the Kochs disbanded the intelligence unit and Roman went to work for the Trump campaign organizing poll-watching operations. After Trump won, Roman landed a job in the office of then-White House counsel Don McGahn as director of special projects and research, though it is not immediately clear what his duties entailed.Roman left the White House in 2018 and soon shifted back to Trump’s campaign. There he has led an aggressive effort that hasn’t waited for Election Day to begin challenging the voting process.In Pennsylvania last month, a Trump campaign lawyer submitted surveillance photos of three voters who appeared to be depositing more than one ballot in an elections drop box. Under state law, voters must return their own ballots unless they are disabled or otherwise unable to do so for themselves. However, elections officials said the Trump campaign produced insufficient evidence to prove the voters in the photos were violating the law.The Pennsylvania complaint appears to be part of a wider national strategy by Trump and his allies to raise accusations of voter fraud and challenge ballots in areas with high rates of registered Democrats.In Texas, Republicans sought to toss out almost 127,000 votes cast from drive-thru lanes in the Democratic stronghold of Harris County, which includes Houston. Both the GOP-dominated Texas Supreme Court and a federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush rejected claims that drive-thru voting is illegal.And some Democrats and election watchers also worry that Trump allies may seek to intimidate voters headed to the polls.In Minnesota last week, the head of the Minneapolis police union forwarded an email to members seeking 20 to 30 retired officers to help serve as “poll challengers” at precincts in “problem” areas of the city. The message was signed by William Willingham, whose email signature identified him as a senior legal adviser and state director of Election Day operations for the Trump campaign.“Poll Challengers do not ‘stop’ people, per se, but act as our eyes and ears in the field and call our hotline to document fraud,” said the email, a copy of which was obtained by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. “We don’t necessarily want our Poll Challengers to look intimidating, they cannot carry a weapon in the polls due to state law. … We just want people who won’t be afraid in rough neighborhoods or intimidating situations.”The Trump campaign later tried to distance itself from the request for retired cops, but the email reinforced fears among voting-rights advocates that the Trump campaign could revive old voter-suppression tactics.In 1981, the Democratic Party sued the Republican Party after a disputed state election in New Jersey where GOP officials hired off-duty police officers to patrol Black and Latino neighborhoods wearing armbands that read “National Ballot Security Task Force.” Without admitting any wrongdoing, the Republican Party agreed to a national consent decree the following year to forgo such tactics. However, at the behest of the GOP a federal judge allowed that agreement to expire in 2017.In August, Trump himself suggested his campaign might send law enforcement officials to voting sites.“We’re going to have sheriffs, and we’re going to have law enforcement, and we’re going to have, hopefully, U.S. attorneys, and we’re going to have everybody and attorney generals,” Trump said during an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News.Federal law prohibits intimidation at the polls and makes it illegal for any federal officer to order “troops or armed men” to polling places, unless needed to “repel armed enemies of the United States.” But such statements from the president have stoked concerns among voting-rights advocates that some Trump supporters may take it upon themselves to show up outside polling sites in military style-gear, brandishing semi-automatic weapons.Reed Galen, a veteran political consultant who worked for John McCain’s presidential bid before leaving the GOP after Trump’s nomination, said he was concerned about Roman’s involvement with Trump’s Elections Day Operations after hearing about his reputation as a local operative in Philadelphia.“Here you have the Army for Trump that might be official, enrolling people through the texting mechanism, but there might be tens of thousands of other people taking their own initiative” and may become violent, said Galen.“This is what this guy does and it is bad news,” he said.___Burke reported from San Francisco.

03-11-2020||World||French airstrikes kill over 50 Al Qaeda-linked jihadists in Mali||The French government said Monday its forces had killed more than 50 jihadists aligned to Al-Qaeda in air strikes in central Mali.The offensive took place on Friday in an area near the borders of Burkina Faso and Niger, where government troops are struggling to rout an Islamic insurgency, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said after meeting members of Mali’s transitional government.“On October 30 in Mali, the Barkhane force conducted an operation that neutralised more than 50 jihadists and confiscated arms and material,” Parly said, referring to the French-led anti-jihadist Operation Barkhane. She added that around 30 motorcycles were destroyed.Parly, who earlier met Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou and her Nigerien counterpart Issoufou Katambe before heading to Bamako, said the operation was launched after a drone detected a “very large” motorcycle caravan in the “three borders” area.When the jihadists moved under trees to try and escape surveillance, the French force sent in two Mirage jets and a drone to launch missiles, leading to the “neutralisation” of the insurgents, Parly said.Military spokesman Colonel Frederic Barbry said that “four terrorists have been captured”.Explosives and a suicide vest had been found, he told a reporters in a conference call, saying that the group had been “about to attack (an army) position in the region”.Barbry also said that another operation, this time targeting the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, was also underway, with a total of 3,000 soldiers.The results of the operation, launched about a month ago, would be announced in the coming days, he said. Significant blow Parly said the action marked a “significant blow” to the Ansarul Islam group which she said was linked to Al-Qaeda via the GSIM alliance led by Iyad Ag Ghaly.Ghaly has emerged as a top jihadist leader in the Sahel since the death of the Qaeda commander Abdelmalek Droukdel, who was killed by French forces in Mali in June. The United Nations has some 13,000 troops deployed in Mali as part of its peacekeeping mission, known as MINUSMA, while France has 5,100 deployed in the Sahel region.Mali has been struggling to contain a brutal jihadist insurgency which first emerged in the north of the country in 2012, overtaking a rebellion by mostly ethnic Tuareg separatists.Former colonial power France launched a military operation to drive back the Islamists in 2013, but fighting has spread to central Mali, and to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger, leaving thousands dead and hundreds of thousands forced to flee their homes. Vast swathes of Mali lie outside effective government control. Frustration over the seemingly endless conflict contributed to mass protests against president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita this year, culminating in his ousting in a military coup on August 18. Many analysts argue that engaging in dialogue with jihadists is one of the few escape routes from Mali’s cycle of violence, and government leaders in Bamako increasingly view the option favourably. Mali’s new interim government, which was appointed to rule for 18 months before staging elections, appears willing to engage in dialogue. Last month, it secured the release of four hostages held by Islamist groups -- including 75-year-old Sophie Petronin, the last remaining French hostage in the world -- in exchange for about 200 prisoners, some of whom are thought to have been jihadists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-airstrikes-kill-over-50-al-qaeda-linked-jihadists-in-mali/story-cVF27kPzlQC3hgzSy23R1J.html

He also said India was with Austria “in this tragic time.”Read: Two dead, including one suspect, 15 injured in ‘terror’ attack Vienna“Deeply shocked and saddened by the dastardly terror attacks in Vienna.

My thoughts are with the victims and their families,” PM Modi said in a tweet on Tuesday. Deeply shocked and saddened by the dastardly terror attacks in Vienna. India stands with Austria during this tragic time. My thoughts are with the victims and their families.Gunmen attacked six locations in Vienna on Monday, starting outside the city’s main synagogue, in what Austria’s government has called a “repulsive terror attack.” While Vienna Police shot dead one of the attackers, Austria’s interior minister Karl Nehammer said at least one perpetrator is still on the run.Speaking at a news conference Nehammer further said, “It’s the hardest day for Austria in many years. We’re dealing with a terror attack the severity of which, thank God, we’ve not experienced in Austria in many years.”As a precaution, the interior ministry has reinforced border checks and children are not required to attend school on Tuesday. Though people have been urged to stay at home, Vienna mayor Michael Ludwig said the city would “run normally” on Tuesday. However, there will be tougher police presence on the city’s streets.Monday’s attack took place on what was the last evening before a nationwide curfew was to come in effect due to the Covid-19 pandemic, across Austria.The attack also comes on the back of recent stabbing incidents in France-- in capital Paris and Nice. In a statement, French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been the subject of outrage of several Muslim-majority countries in recent days, said, “This is our Europe. Our enemies must know with whom they are dealing. We will not retreat.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-shocked-and-saddened-by-dastardly-terror-attacks-in-vienna-pm-modi-tweets-his-condolences-to-austria/story-ssJ5FyhDKQobEgxj2USDZM.html

However, unfortunately it is not possible for the GA to go ahead as planned”. He added: “Despite the postponement of the GA, the daily work of supporting our 194-member countries combat all forms of transnational crime and terrorism remains unaffected.”The new dates for GA have not been announced yet. India is slated to host the 91st GA of Interpol in 2022. It is yet to be ascertained, if the postponement will affect the future annual meets. The postponement implies that besides the budget, which exceptionally can be approved by the executive committee, all other statutory items would remain pending until the next session of the GA, Interpol said. This includes elections for the executive committee and the Commission for the Control (CCC) of Interpol’s files. The CCC is a key exercise to decide the cases of red notices after analysing the presentations made by fugitives. Any accused, who has fled his homeland, can petition Interpol on grounds of being targeted for political and religious reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-interpol-postpones-its-194-member-general-assembly-for-the-first-time/story-UasYPmuyXBAr6m84uZtqgN.html

Since March, residents in mainland China and Hong Kong have been required to quarantine for two weeks when they cross the border due to the pandemic.“That is very important to economic activities, from the provision of professional services, visiting relatives and going to schools,” Lam said.Lam’s trip to Beijing comes after she postponed her annual policy address two days before it was scheduled to take place last month, saying that support from Beijing would allow her to give a speech later that would boost confidence in Hong Kong’s economic future.Read more | First step to beating coronavirus is defeating Donald Trump: Joe BidenConfidence in Hong Kong’s semi-autonomous status, promised to the city when Beijing took back control of the former British colony in 1997, has been shaken since mainland authorities imposed a national security law over the territory this summer. The city’s economy has also taken a hit due to the pandemic, with its borders closed to tourists since the end of March.With regards to the US presidential election, Lam said she expects the next president to evaluate the importance of Hong Kong within China-US relations.“I hope that the new US administration will handle relations with Hong Kong in a comprehensive way, taking into account the interests of the many US businesses in Hong Kong that employ a lot of people, and will not thoughtlessly allow political considerations to have an unwarranted effect on Hong Kong,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-leader-to-travel-to-beijing-to-seek-economic-aid/story-nrBjZB4FBTjPnFVFI25cpK.html

Two teenagers also died on the Greek island of Samos, authorities said. It was the deadliest quake to hit Turkey in nearly a decade. The quake injured 994 people in Izmir, with 147 still being treated, the Disaster and Emergency Management Authority (AFAD) said on Tuesday, adding that rescuers were still combing five buildings in the search effort.More than 3,500 tents and 13,000 beds are being used for temporary shelters in Turkey, where relief efforts have drawn in nearly 8,000 personnel and 25 rescue dogs, the agency said. Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. More than 500 people were killed in a 2011 quake in the eastern city of Van, while another in January this year killed 41 people in the eastern province of Elazig.In 1999, two powerful quakes killed 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. AFAD said Friday’s earthquake had a magnitude of 6.6, with some 1,400 aftershocks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-from-turkey-earthquake-reaches-100-disaster-authority/story-wBiuGvC3IOSKCvV1eClIHN.html
03-11-2020||World||Not easy to fire Anthony Fauci despite Donald Trump’s indication||As a career civil servant, Anthony Fauci is not an easy man to fire, despite the pleas of a crowd of Donald Trump supporters chanting at a weekend rally.Read: Trump hints at firing Dr Anthony Fauci after presidential pollsThe latest tiff between Fauci and the president came following Trump’s campaign statements that the US has “turned the corner” on the pandemic. Fauci, in a Washington Post interview on Saturday, said America “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” as it heads into the winter. The US recorded nearly 100,000 new cases Friday, the most at any point in the pandemic.Fauci also offered praise for the campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden, saying it was taking the coronavirus “seriously from a public health perspective.” Then came the “fire Fauci” chants from the crowd at a Sunday evening rally for the president in Florida, mirroring the “lock her up” rally chants targeting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.“Don’t tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election. I appreciate the advice, I appreciate it,” Trump replied to the crowd. “No, he’s been wrong on a lot. He’s a nice man, though. He’s been wrong on a lot.”Fauci, a member of the Trump’s Coronavirus Task Force, has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since being named in 1984 under then-President Ronald Reagan. Trump routinely muses about things in his rallies, and it isn’t clear whether he is considering firing Fauci. The president, though, has all but frozen out Fauci, who has lost influence to Scott Atlas, an adviser who downplays the risk of the virus.It’s not the first time the issue of firing Fauci has surfaced. Speaking to reporters on Oct. 19, Trump said he didn’t want to fire Fauci. “I don’t want to, I don’t want to hurt him.” Trump said. “He’s been there for about 350 years.”Biden, meanwhile, had a different message at a rally in Ohio. “Elect me and I’m going to hire Dr. Fauci,” Biden said.Fauci is a Title 42 senior-level federal employee, covered under the performance management system for members of the Senior Executive Service. The White House declined comment Monday on whether it believes it has the authority to fire him.But Diane Seltzer Torre of the Bethesda, Maryland-based Seltzer Law Firm, which concentrates on employment law, said that under Fauci’s current status, Trump can’t fire him directly.Fauci can only be fired by Francis Collins, his supervisor as the head of the National Institutes of Health, or Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services Secretary, for cause such as poor performance or misconduct, Seltzer Torre said.“Even if that was proposed, it would have to be in writing and give specifics, and then Dr. Fauci would have an opportunity to respond orally and in writing,” according to Seltzer Torre. If a decision is made to go through with the firing, Fauci would have appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and ultimately to federal court, she added.Collins, in a CNN interview in July, said, “I could not imagine doing something of that sort, no” when asked if he would fire Fauci if ordered by the president.Calling Fauci “a national treasure,” Collins said in the interview that there is “nobody I know on this planet who is more knowledgeable about infectious disease, and has more experience over 50 years of his career.”Being praised on CNN by your boss could be seen as evidence Fauci is doing a good job, if there was a move to fire him by Azar without Collins’s involvement. Collins didn’t directly answer whether he would resign rather than fire Fauci himself.“Francis would never fire Tony,” said Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law, referring to Collins and Fauci. “The only way the president could fire Tony would be to fire the NIH director and appoint a yes man in his place.”If Trump is re-elected, though, “all bets are off,” Gostin said.Executive OrderThe question of whether Fauci’s status could be changed under a executive order affecting the status of civil-service workers -- and thus be fired more quickly -- likely will be resolved no later than Jan. 19, when a preliminary review from federal agencies of eligible policy making positions is due.Based on the text of the executive order and initial guidance from the Office of Personnel Management, it’s unclear that Fauci’s status can be changed, said Deborah Hopkins, president of the Federal Employment Law Training Group, which provides employment law training to federal managers.“It remains to be seen” whether the application of the executive order “will be narrow or broad,” Hopkins said. The guidance, she added, “indicates a lot of flexibility.”Tim Stretton, a policy analyst at the Project on Government Oversight, said the order could well make it easier to fire Fauci. Under the order, Stretton said, agencies would identify employees who work on policy, including directly making it or influencing it in some way.Those workers would not receive the same protections as civil servants do today. Given Fauci’s role in the coronavirus response, it’s “not hard” to see how he could be deemed as a person with a hand in shaping policy, Stretton said.Taking the HammerTo Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, this situation embodies the purpose of protecting career government employees: So the U.S. can hire workers and they can speak freely without fear of political retribution.”President Trump is taking the hammer to career civil servants and the purpose of it,” Stier said of the recent executive order.Fauci has been a frequent Trump foil since early in the pandemic when he urged caution about ending social-distancing measures in testimony before Congress in early May. Additionally, he would sometimes push back against claims made by Trump about drugs or science.‘Real Risk’When Trump began pushing for reopening the country, Fauci warned a Senate panel in early May that doing so too soon could lead to new outbreaks. “There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you might not be able to control,” Fauci testified on May 12.Last week, 14 states spanning the Rocky Mountain West to Pennsylvania recorded all-time highs in cases, the most of the pandemic.Even if Fauci’s status isn’t changed, scientists who work for him easily could be, said Diane Seltzer Torre of the Seltzer Law Firm in Bethesda, Md. “Why are we targeting these people?” she asked.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-easy-to-fire-anthony-fauci-despite-donald-trump-s-indication/story-sCkhNqBuoL2aEQKM0SNfnI.html
03-11-2020||World||Flood and landslide warning as Hurricane Eta approaches Central America||Hurricane Eta erupted quickly into a potentially catastrophic major hurricane Monday as it headed for Central America, where forecasters warned of massive flooding and landslides across a vulnerable region.Eta had maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 kph) and was centered about 70 miles (110 kilometers) east-southest of the Nicaragua-Honduras border in early evening, the US National Hurricane Center said. It was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph).It said the Category 4 hurricane was likely to strengthen further before running ashore by early Tuesday in Nicaragua, where it could bring rains measured in feet rather than inches.Forecasters said central and northern Nicaragua into much of Honduras could get 15 to 25 inches (380 to 635 millimeters) of rain, with 35 inches (890 millimeters) in isolated areas. Heavy rains also were likely in eastern Guatemala, southern Belize and Jamaica.Storm surge up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) above normal tides was possible for the coast of Nicaragua.Nicaragua’s navy carried families in open boats, mostly women and children with the possessions they could carry from outer islands to the mainland under a low grey sky. It prohibited the launching any boats along the stretch of coastline expected to receive Eta.Offshore residents were taken to shelters in Bilwi, also known as Puerto Cabezas, the primary city of the Northern Caribbean Autonomous Region that is home to some 66,000 people, according to Guillermo González, director of the Nicaragua’s national emergency management agency.By evening, much of Bilwi was already without power. Approximately 3,000 families from surrounding areas had been moved into shelters.Northeastern Nicaragua is sparsely populated, home to small coastal villages and a large nature reserve.González said that 88 tons of rice, oil, corn and other food basics had been to the area. The flood-prone Rio Coco, which makes up part of the border with Honduras, is home to many Indigenous communities.Traffic filled the streets of Bilwi on Monday morning as residents scrambled to stock up before Eta’s arrival. Long lines snaked away from cash machines.“We’re in a race against time,” said Limborth Bucardo, who waited in line at a hardware store. “We need to reinforce our houses to dampen the impact of the winds a little.” Heavy black plastic, garbage bags, nails and rope were in high demand.The outer bounds of forecast potential rainfall from Eta were close to the prodigious amounts of water dumped by 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history.A National Hurricane Center archive report says more than 9,000 people died as Mitch’s rains caused widespread flooding during a weeklong slog across the region. At one point its winds reached nearly 180 mph (285 kph), though it weakened while meandering off the Honduran coast before making landfall on Oct 29, 1998.In Honduras, much of the country was placed on red alert for Eta’s eventual passage through the country. It had been raining since Sunday in some areas.Julissa Mercado, spokeswoman for the national emergency management agency, said firefighters had started evacuating areas most at risk and mandatory evacuations would be ordered soon.Eta would have arrived in Honduras just as the country prepared to go on vacation in an effort to bolster the tourism sector and pump some money into the pandemic-battered economy. The extra-long weekend was to begin Wednesday, but late Monday the government cancelled it because of the risk posed by Eta.In the city of Tela, on Honduras’ Caribbean coast, heavy rains had already sent two rivers spilling over their banks. Rescuers moved people from riverside communities to six shelters in the city, said Capt. David Velásquez of the city’s fire department. Some 20 people whose homes flooded were moved to a sports complex in the city. Each evacuee was subjected to a rapid coronavirus test.The Guaymón river between Tela and El Progreso also threatened to top its banks as people living nearby filled sandbags hoping to protect their communities. The Honduran air force began flying supplies to areas expected to be hardest hit by the storm.Eta tripled in strength in about 24 hours, rapidly intensifying from a 40 mph (65 kph) storm Sunday morning to a 120 mph (190 kph) hurricane around midday Monday, and forecasters said it could grow further, into a Category 4 storm before hitting land.Eta is the eighth Atlantic storm this season to hit the meteorologists’ definition for rapid intensification — a gain of 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in just 24 hours. It’s also the fifth to reach major hurricane status.Over the past couple decades, meteorologists have been increasingly worried about storms that just blow up in strength, like Eta.Earlier this year, Hannah, Laura, Sally, Teddy, Gamma, Delta and Zeta all rapidly intensified. An eighth storm, Marco, just missed the mark. Laura and Delta tied or set records for rapid intensification.National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration climate and hurricane scientist Jim Kossin studied the effect and found storms now are more likely to rapidly intensify than they did in the 1980s and “a lot of that has to do with human-caused climate change.”Eta is the 28th named Atlantic storm this season, tying the 2005 record for named storms. It’s the first time the Greek letter Eta has been used as a storm name because after the 2005 season ended, meteorologists went back and determined a storm that should have been named wasn’t.Hurricane season still has a month to go, ending Nov. 30. And in 2005, Zeta formed toward the end of December.___Associated Press writer Marlon González in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, and AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flood-and-landslide-warning-as-hurricane-eta-approaches-central-america/story-gU0LjPXNizlNo0b5Zlb75K.html
03-11-2020||World||First step to beating coronavirus is defeating Donald Trump: Joe Biden||The first step to beating the coronavirus that has had a devastating impact on the US is to ensure President Donald Trump’s electoral defeat, his Democratic challenger Joe Biden said on Monday.Making a passionate plea, Biden, in his closing argument from the city of Pittsburgh, urged his countrymen to defeat Trump as he has failed to deliver in the last four years.“The first step to beating the virus is defeating Donald Trump,” Biden said in his second address of the day. With almost over 10 crore Americans having already voted and millions more to exercise their franchise on Tuesday, the former vice president urged people to get out and vote in large numbers.“My message is simple. The power to change this country is in your hands. And I do not care how hard Donald Trump tries, there is nothing he can do to stop the people of this nation from voting, no matter how he tries,” he said.“There was a press article last week and it read as follows -- never before in modern presidential history has a candidate been so reliant on widescale efforts to repress the vote as Trump,” Biden said.“Trump does not want you all voting. He does not want Americans voting. He thinks only wealthy folks should vote. And when America votes though, America will be heard.“When America is heard, the message is going to be out loud and clear. It is time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. Go home,” he said.“Look, we are done with the chaos. We are done with the racism. We are done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the irresponsibility. But we have got a lot of work to do, folks. If I am elected president, we are going to act. On day one, we are going to act to get Covid under control,” Biden said.He alleged that Trump has done more to harm black America than any president in modern history. “This is the same man who started the birther movement against my buddy, Barack Obama. This is the man who when -- the first black woman running for vice president -- he looks at her and he calls her monster,” the former vice president said.Biden closed out the day with a drive-in rally in Pittsburgh, the city where he launched his campaign 18 months ago. In his closing message, he said this election is a battle for “the soul of our nation” and that he is the leader the “country needs to recover from the pandemic and build back better than before”.In a tweet later in the night, Biden described this as an election of a lifetime. “In less than 12 hours, voters will head to the polls for the most important election in our lifetimes. It all comes down to this,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-step-to-beating-coronavirus-is-defeating-donald-trump-joe-biden/story-UnSnnajPLE0jcaN0rmpBSI.html

As the world waits with bated breath for a Covid-19 vaccine, amid a wave of fresh cases in Europe, German biotech firm CureVac has claimed its vaccine candidate triggered an immune response in humans.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHere are the latest updates in the worldwide search for a Covid-19 vaccine:1. German biotech firm CureVac on Monday claimed its vaccine candidate triggered an immune response in humans, a development described by its CEO Franz-Werner Haas as “encouraging.” For its potential vaccine, CureVac is using the messenger RNA (mRNA) approach, the same as Moderna, as well as BioNtech and its partner Pfizer. The German firm has named its vaccine candidate ‘CVnCoV’ and plans to launch the final stage of testing, which will involve 30,000 participants, before the end of the year.2. South African pharmaceutical firm Aspen Pharmacare has struck a deal with US firm Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine if it is approved in the African country, as well as globally. In a statement, Aspen said the vaccine would be produced at its manufacturing facility in Port Elizabeth in South Africa’s Eastern Cape province. The company also said its manufacturing facility can develop more than 300 million vaccine doses every year. J&J’s vaccine candidate -- Ad26.COV3-S -- is among four different vaccines currently undergoing trials in South Africa.3. A survey in Russia shows an increasing number of Russians are unwilling to be inoculated against Covid-19 once a vaccine becomes available. The poll, conducted by the country’s only major independent pollster, the Levada Centre, said as of October 20, 59% Russians would decline a vaccine, up from 54% two months ago. Russia has claimed to have developed the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine, called Sputnik V, despite the fact the vaccine is still undergoing a late stage of trials.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-from-curevac-candidate-s-immune-response-in-humans-to-unwilling-russians/story-iLXt2pStA0dq74ve4IrMzH.html

The first family along with Vice President Mike Pence have collectively held more than 40 rallies in the last three days of the election.Biden, his running mate Senator Kamala Harris, along with the former president Barack Obama too have ramped up their public appearances in the last few days, but its no where matching to that of the Trump campaign. On the eve of the election, Biden was in Ohio, while Obama was campaigning in Florida. Harris was in Pennsylvania.Trump was holding five rallies in five key battleground States – North Carolina, Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan.Nationally, Trump as per Real Clear Politics on an average was trailing by 6.5 percentage points against Biden.

On Monday both the Trump and Biden Campaigns exuded confidence of winning the race on Tuesday night.Also Read: US Presidential Election 2020: Who will it be, America?A majority of the mainstream media, however, said Monday that Trump has an uphill task to win the elections, given that he continues to trail in polls in key States like Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin. A few outlets are saying that Texas, which has traditionally remained a GOP bastion is also in play this year.Trump supporters argue that poll do not reflect the ground realities and like the 2016, the president would win the election with much stronger mandate.Nate Silver from the important FiveThirtyEight.Com on Monday said that Trump has about 10 percent chance of winning the elections. Notably, he had gone wrong in 2016.“As in 2016, Trump could potentially benefit from the Electoral College. Projected margins in the tipping-point states are considerably tighter than the margins in the national popular vote. More specifically, Joe Biden’s lead in Pennsylvania — the most likely tipping-point state, according to our forecast — is solid but not spectacular: about 5 points in our polling average,” Silver wrote.Nate Silver said that if Biden wins the popular vote by 2 to 3 percentage points, the Electoral College is roughly a toss-up. But if Biden wins the popular vote by less than 2 points, Trump is a fairly heavy favourite to win the election, he wrote.“Even popular vote margins of up to 6 points are not entirely safe for Biden if his votes are distributed in exactly the wrong way. So you can see why an 8- or 9-point lead in the popular vote shouldn’t make Biden feel that secure; despite being a landslide margin, it’s also only a few points removed from the inflection point where the Electoral College starts to become competitive,” he argued.According to The New York Times, if the polls are right, Joe Biden could post the most decisive victory in a presidential election in three and a half decades, surpassing Bill Clinton’s win in 1996. “That’s a big “if.”,” it said.“The indelible memory of 2016’s polling misfire, when Donald J. Trump trailed in virtually every pre-election poll and yet swept the battleground states and won the Electoral College, has hovered over the 2020 campaign. Mr. Biden’s unusually persistent lead has done little to dispel questions about whether the polls could be off again,” said the daily.“President Trump needs a very large polling error to have a hope of winning the White House. Joe Biden would win even if polls were off by as much as they were in 2016,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-presidential-elections-headed-for-a-tight-finish-polls/story-Q186UaeD5mcm3e5tAqphOO.html

If the health service is allowed to be overwhelmed “doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die,” he told lawmakers.‘Coercive State’But he faced anger from some of his own Conservative colleagues over the plan, which will be subject to a vote on Wednesday. Veteran MP Charles Walker warned the UK is drifting “further into an authoritarian coercive state” under the measures. “The people of this country will never, ever forgive the political class for criminalizing parents seeing children and children seeing parents,” he told Johnson.Ministers have been working to defuse tensions among Tory lawmakers ahead of the vote, and Johnson spoke with his party’s MPs over the weekend. The premier sought to address some of their concerns Monday, saying the measures will be strictly time-limited to Dec. 2, when Parliament will get a vote on the way forward.Johnson underlined the government’s new focus on mass testing, pointing to “cheap, reliable, rapid turnaround tests” that could be used in schools and elsewhere to allow the economy to keep moving before the much-anticipated roll-out of a vaccine next year.Liverpool TrialHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said testing capacity had met Johnson’s target of half a million a day by the end of October and mass checks will be trialled in the city of Liverpool, northwest England, as ministers step-up efforts to identify carriers of the disease.“These tests will help identify the many thousands of people in the city who don’t have symptoms but can still infect others without knowing,” Johnson said in a statement. “Dependent on their success in Liverpool, we will aim to distribute millions of these new rapid tests between now and Christmas and empower local communities to use them to drive down transmission.”Also Read: The deepening of economic bond between India, UK | OpinionThe new lockdown is likely to be approved in the House of Commons after Labour and other opposition parties said they will vote for the plan. But Labour leader Keir Starmer said “the human cost will be higher” because Johnson ignored the advice of his own scientists to impose a short lockdown in September.Senior Tory MP Graham Brady called for a “full impact assessment” of the cost of the lockdown, including the toll on people’s mental health, before the vote. Former minister Mike Penning confirmed in a telephone interview he will vote against the government.Johnson and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak unveiled additional financial support for businesses and workers to add to the month-long extension of the government’s flagship furlough program that was announced Saturday.During November, the state will double support for self-employed workers to 80% of their usual trading profits, in line with furlough payments. The Treasury also extended the deadline for businesses to apply for state-backed loans until the end of January, and said those that have them already will be able to top them up.The extra support came too late for many people laid-off by companies last week, ahead of the furlough program’s scheduled end. Sunak defended his decision to stick with his original time-frame, telling the BBC it was only the changing health data and subsequent lockdown that forced a rethink.Bloomberg Economics said the second lockdown will mean the economy contracts in the fourth quarter and that the Bank of England will increase its asset purchase target this week by possibly more than the 100 billion pounds ($129 billion) previously forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-boosts-testing-as-pm-johnson-sees-no-alternative-to-covid-19-lockdown/story-sHclgHjo94J4wZejAAtsSI.html

I am therefore not limiting it to an area of Vienna because these are mobile perpetrators,” Nehammer told broadcaster ORF, urging the public to stay indoors until the all-clear is given.At least one person was killed and several wounded in central Vienna in exchanges of gunfire late on Monday, in what the Austrian interior minister said was believed to be a terrorist attack near the central synagogue.Vienna police said on Twitter there were multiple suspects and six different locations involved.A large area of central Vienna was cordoned off and police said a significant deployment was under way.Also read | Six crime scenes in Vienna attack; 1 suspect killed, several injured including a copInterior Minister Karl Nehammer told Austrian broadcaster ORF that the attack was believed to have been carried out by several people and that all six locations were in the immediate vicinity of the street housing the central synagogue.“At the moment I can confirm we believe this is an apparent terror attack,” he said.“We believe there are several perpetrators.

Gunshots were fired at around 8:00 pm local time (1900 GMT), beginning at the Seitenstettengasse in the city’s centrally-located first district.Also read | Six crime scenes in Vienna attack; 1 suspect killed, several injured including a copThe shooting began just hours before Austria was to re-impose a coronavirus lockdown to try to slow the spread of Covid-19, and bars and restaurants were packed as people enjoyed a final night of relative freedom.Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told public broadcaster ORF that the incident “appeared to be a terrorist attack” and urged Viennese to remain in their homes.Nehammer repeated police appeals to residents to keep away from all public places or public transport, and frequent sirens and helicopters could be heard in the city centre as emergency services responded to the incident.An AFP photographer said that large numbers of police were guarding an area near the city’s world-famous opera house.The location of the incident is close to a major synagogue.The president of Vienna’s Jewish community Oskar Deutsch said that shots had been fired “in the immediate vicinity” of the Stadttempel synagogue, but added that it was currently unknown whether the synagogue itself had been the target of an attack.He said that the synagogue and office buildings at the same address had been closed at the time of the attack.- ‘Cowardly act’ -“It sounded like firecrackers, then we realised it was shots,” said one eyewitness quoted by public broadcaster ORF.A shooter had “shot wildly with an automatic weapon” before the police arrived and opened fire, the witness added.Austria had until now been spared the sort of major attacks that have hit other European countries.French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that “we French share the shock and sorrow of the Austrian people”.“After France, it’s a friendly nation that has been attacked,” he added, referring to the killing on Thursday of three people by a knife-armed attacker in southern city Nice and the beheading of a schoolteacher by a suspected Islamist outside Paris several days before.EU Council chief Charles Michel tweeted that the bloc “strongly condemns this cowardly act”.And Germany’s foreign ministry tweeted that the reports from Austria were “horrifying and disturbing”.“We can’t give in to hatred that is aimed at dividing our societies,” the ministry added.Czech police said they had started random checks on the border with Austria. “Police are carrying out random checks of vehicles and passengers on border crossings with Austria as a preventive measure in relation to the terror attack in Vienna,” Czech police tweeted.Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said in a tweet Czech police were in touch with Austrian colleagues following the “dreadful news from Vienna”.Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte also “strongly condemned” the shootings. “There is no room for hatred and violence in our common European home,” he said on Twitter in Italian and German.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sounded-like-firecrackers-eyewitness-recounts-terror-attack-in-central-vienna/story-2X8rGsz0qG43Qz3nYF9wyO.html

An official later clarified that two people were dead, a civilian and a suspected attacker. “We have brought several special forces units together that are now searching for the presumed terrorists. I am therefore not limiting it to an area of Vienna, because these are mobile perpetrators,” Nehammer earlier told broadcaster ORF.Kurz said the army would protect sites in the capital so the police could focus on anti-terror operations. Speaking to ORF, he said the attackers “were very well equipped with automatic weapons” and had “prepared professionally”.Police said on Twitter that at least one person had been killed and that the injured included a police officer. Vienna mayor Michael Ludwig told ORF that 15 people were being treated in Vienna hospitals, and that seven were in a serious condition.Police also said they had shot dead one of the attackers.Nehammer said all six locations in the attack were near the street housing the central synagogue.Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch said on Twitter it was not clear whether the Vienna synagogue and adjoining offices had been the target and said they were closed at the time.Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister told London’s LBC radio he was living in the compound of the synagogue. “Upon hearing shots, we looked down (from) the windows and saw the gunmen shooting at the guests of the various bars and pubs,” he said.

03-11-2020||World||Donald Trump threatens to fire Fauci in rift with disease expert amid Covid-19 outbreak in US||President Donald Trump is suggesting that he will fire Dr. Anthony Fauci after Tuesday’s election, as his rift with the nation’s top infectious disease expert widens while the nation sees its most alarming outbreak of the coronavirus since the spring.Speaking at a campaign rally in Opa-locka, Florida, Trump expressed frustration that the surging cases of the virus that has killed more than 231,000 people in the United States this year remains prominent in the news. That sparked his supporters to begin chanting “Fire Fauci.”“Don’t tell anybody but let me wait until a little bit after the election,” Trump replied to thousands of supporters early Monday, adding he appreciated their “advice.”Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden tweeted later Monday in response: “We need a president who actually listens to experts like Dr. Fauci.”Biden has sought to keep the campaign focused on what he says is a disastrous federal response to the pandemic. Trump is countering by using the race’s final hours to accuse Biden of wanting to force the country back into a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus.Still, Trump’s comments on Fauci less than 48 hours before polls close likely ensure the pandemic will remain front and center heading into Election Day.It’s the most direct Trump has been in suggesting he was serious about trying to remove Fauci from his position. He has previously expressed that he was concerned about the political blowback of removing the popular and respected doctor before the election.Trump cannot directly fire Fauci, who is not a presidential appointee. Theoretically, Trump could pressure Fauci’s boss, Dr. Francis Collins, or Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar to do so. Even discounting Fauci’s scientific legacy, taking that step would be politically extraordinary considering a Republican president, George W. Bush, awarded Fauci the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Fauci also has considerable bipartisan support in Congress.Former President Barack Obama defended Fauci while campaigning in Atlanta for Biden. Obama praised Fauci’s public service and remarked that Trump’s “second-term plan is to fire that guy, the one person who could actually help them contain the pandemic.”The latest flare-up follows Fauci making his sharpest criticism yet of the White House’s response to the coronavirus and Trump’s public assertion that the nation is “rounding the turn.”Fauci has grown outspoken that Trump has ignored his advice for containing the virus, saying he hasn’t spoken with Trump in more than a month. He has raised alarm that the nation was heading for a challenging winter if more isn’t done soon to slow the spread of the disease.In an interview with The Washington Post this weekend, Fauci cautioned that the U.S. will have to deal with “a whole lot of hurt” in the weeks ahead due to surging coronavirus cases.Fauci said the U.S. “could not possibly be positioned more poorly” to stem rising cases as more people gather indoors during the colder fall and winter months. He says the U.S. will need to make an “abrupt change” in public health precautions.Fauci added that he believed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden “is taking it seriously from a public health perspective,” while Trump is “looking at it from a different perspective.” Fauci, who’s on the White House coronavirus task force, said that perspective emphasizes “the economy and reopening the country.”In response, White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump always puts people’s well-being first charged that Fauci had decided “to play politics” right before Tuesday’s election. Deere said Fauci “has a duty to express concerns or push for a change in strategy” but instead is “choosing to criticize the president in the media and make his political leanings known.”Trump had already stepped up his attacks on Biden in recent days for pledging to heed the advice of scientists in responding to the pandemic. As Trump charges that Biden’s measures to slow the pandemic could keep Americans home and hurt the economy, the former vice president has countered that the only way out of the health crisis is to heed the warnings of Fauci and other medical professionals. Biden has also been careful not to endorse another national lockdown.Trump has recently relied on the advice of Stanford doctor Scott Atlas, who has no prior background in infectious diseases or public health, as his lead science adviser on the pandemic. Atlas has been a public skeptic about mask wearing and other measures widely accepted by the scientific community to slow the spread of the virus.Other members of the White House coronavirus task force have grown increasingly vocal about what they see as a dangerous fall spike in the virus.Trump’s aggressive approach to Fauci carries some risks.A Kaiser Family Foundation poll in September showed 68% of Americans have a great deal or a fair amount of trust in Fauci to provide reliable information on the coronavirus. That compares with 52% of Americans who trusted Biden to do that and just 40% for Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-threatens-to-fire-fauci-in-rift-with-disease-expert-amid-covid-19-outbreak-in-us/story-6j307x87mkw9cNVLyegwnI.html

So they were very well prepared.”Police said that several shots were fired shortly after 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) on a lively street in the city center and that there were six shooting locations. Unverified footage posted on social media showed gunmen walking through the streets, apparently shooting at people at random, wounding several.The motive was under investigation, but Kurz said the possibility that it was an anti-Semitic attack cannot be ruled out, given that the shooting began outside Vienna’s main synagogue. The synagogue was closed at the time.Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told public broadcaster ORF that the army had been asked to guard key locations in the city to allow police to pursue the gunmen.Kurz praised police for killing one of the attackers and vowed: “We will not never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism and will fight these attacks with all means.”Vienna Mayor Michael Ludwig said 15 people were hospitalized, seven with serious injuries.Oskar Deutsch, the head of the Jewish community in Vienna, said it was not clear whether the main synagogue had been targeted.Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least one person shoot at people sitting outside at bars in the street below his window.“They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,” Hofmeister said.“All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown,” he added. “As of midnight, all bars and restaurants will be closed in Austria for the next month, and a lot of people probably wanted to use that evening to be able to go out.”French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that the French “share the shock and grief of the Austrian people hit by an attack tonight.”“After France, this is a friendly country that has been attacked. This is our Europe. ... We will not give in,” he wrote.France has endured three attacks blamed on Muslim extremists in recent weeks: the wounding of two people outside satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo’s old headquarters; the beheading of a schoolteacher who showed students caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad; and a deadly knife attack Thursday in a church in the Mediterranean city of Nice.All of the attacks were strongly condemned at the time by Austria’s chancellor.Authorities in Vienna urged people to avoid all open spaces and public transportation.

03-11-2020||World||Biden, Trump make last-mile dash of swing states before Election Day||President Donald Trump undertook a whirlwind tour of five battleground states on Sunday amid speculation that he planned to declare victory prematurely on Tuesday night even before all the votes had been counted, especially the millions of mail-in ballots that will typically take time.Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, focused on just one battleground state on his penultimate day of campaigning: Pennsylvania, where he, his wife Jill Biden and vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her husband Dug Emhoff will be carpet-covering on Monday.“My message to you is simple: Pennsylvania is critical in this election,” Biden said at a drive-in rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. “Last time, Donald Trump won by just 44,000 votes. Every single vote will matter. The power to change this country is in your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries. There is nothing — NOTHING — that is going to stop the people of this nation from voting.”President Trump and Republicans have through rhetoric, local administrative choices and lawsuits tried to curtail voting, challenging and obstructing widely accepted electoral practices.President Trump sought to push back on an Axios news article that he planned to declare victory on Tuesday night if he was “ahead”, even though the outcome would depend on the counting of large numbers of mail-in ballots, nearly 60 million already returned, with 31 million more expected.“That was a false report,” he told reporters between rallies. “We’ll look at what happened. I think it’s a terrible thing when ballots can be collected after an election. I think it’s a terrible thing when people or states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over because it can only lead to one thing, and that’s very bad.”Jason Miller, a senior Trump campaign aide, expressed similar reservations about counting continuing well past election night saying in an interview to ABC News that Trump will be “ahead” in electoral college votes on Tuesday night and then, he suggested wrongly, the Democrats will “try to steal it back after the election”.The Trump campaign is pushing a misleading narrative that the outcome of the elections must be known and declared on election night. That has happened in past elections, but it’s a practice driven completely by the situation on the ground, not by law. His 2016 election was declared past 3 am the next day and the winner of the 2000 election was declared more than a month after.Tuesday night is expected to be messy, by all accounts, with the possibility of violence forecast.Tensions and tempers are already rising. A group of Trump supporters in cars — called the “Trump Train” group — surrounded a Biden campaign bus and forced it slow down in the middle of a highway in Texas, a solidly Republican state that Democrats hoping to flip this election. FBI is investigating the incident.Trump supporters in cars blocked traffic on two major highways in the New York-New Jersey area on Sunday. Business establishments in Washington DC and other have begun boarding up their windows in anticipation of violence on election night and after with memories still fresh of looting and violence past summer.With two days left for close of polling, Trump and Biden, along with their surrogates are making their closing arguments in battleground states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Minnesota, Florida, Arizona and Nevada; democrats are also taking a shot at Texas and Georgia.Trump’s final arguments are chiefly a defence of his handling of the Covid-19 epidemic and a reminder of the booming economy before the virus hit the country and the promise of more of that if elected. At a rally on Sunday night, he attacked Anthony Fauci, the epidemiologist who has contested Trump’s claims, and suggested he might fire him after election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-trump-make-last-mile-dash-of-swing-states-before-election-day/story-1MWJqBbixKSSsculGYyckN.html
