Report “Rejected”,” the ousted premier tweeted, reported Dawn.No other PML-N leader has commented on the party’s official stance on the report, although Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) spokesperson Mian Iftikhar Hussain termed the inquiry as “a victory of the democratic forces.”“Now those responsible should be brought to justice. PDM will hold further consultations in this regard,” he added.Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had also welcomed the development as “good news”, reported Dawn.While addressing a public meeting in Gulmit, Gilgit-Baltistan, Bilawal said: “I have received good news that the chief of army staff [ordered] an inquiry, that inquiry has been completed and action has also been taken. We should welcome this step.”The Pakistan Army on Tuesday said that it has found officials of secret intel agency, ISI, and Rangers guilty of the “abduction” of Sindh IGP Mushtaq Mehr and the “overzealous” arrest of Capt Awan in a desecration case, adding that they have been removed from their posts.In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) -- the military media affairs wing -- said that the court of inquiry, constituted to redress the grievances of the Sindh inspector general on the orders of Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa, has been completed.Last month, the ISPR said the Army chief had taken notice of and ordered an immediate inquiry into the “Karachi incident”, minutes after PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari called on General Bajwa and ISI Director General Faiz Hameed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Awam, husband of PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz, from his hotel room on October 19.Almost all police officers in Sindh applied for leave in protest against the humiliation meted out to IGP Mehr.PML-N spokesman Muhammad Zubair, who is also a former Sindh governor, said that the IGP Sindh was “kidnapped” by the Rangers who forced him to file an FIR for Safdar’s arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-inquiry-into-safdar-awan-s-arrest-a-cover-up-says-pml-n-chief-nawaz-sharif/story-vVr7JO9q9LJYlKMQR5UJYK.html
11-11-2020||World||Trump campaign files another lawsuit in Michigan challenging election results||President Donald Trump’s campaign has filed another lawsuit in Michigan challenging the election results.The federal lawsuit, which the campaign said it filed late Tuesday, seeks to stop the state from certifying results that show Democrat Joe Biden leading by almost 146,000 votes.The campaign asked a judge to stop Michigan from certifying fraudulent ballots, those received after Election Day, those processed when observers weren’t present, and any counted with defective tabulating machines or software. At least two prior suits contesting the state’s election results have already been rejected by Michigan judges.Trump has said he doesn’t accept results showing that Biden won and his campaign and Republican supporters have sued in at least four states. Legal experts say the suits will fail to substantially change the vote tally or provide enough votes to give Trump a win in the electoral college.Trump’s campaign has provided no evidence of widespread voter fraud.Trump sued Monday to block Pennsylvania from certifying its election results, claiming that voting irregularities justify keeping the winner undeclared while the case proceeds. Biden leads in Pennsylvania, which has 20 electoral votes, by nearly 46,000 votes, according to the Associated Press.The campaign supplied a copy of the 31-page complaint, which couldn’t immediately be verified in federal court in the Western District of Michigan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-files-another-lawsuit-in-michigan-challenging-election-results/story-swUXpOFCGp0bLU4bPyZ9NJ.html

Landlords and capitalists dominate Pakistan’s 342-member National Assembly -- the lower legislative house -- with the majority of members possessing huge pieces of land and massive investments in stocks, shares and industrial units, it said, citing the statement of assets of the lawmakers for year 2019 released by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).As many as 12 out of the total 342 members of the National Assembly have declared that they own assets worth over a billion rupees. Five of the declared billionaires are from Punjab, another five from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and two from Sindh, the report said.While five of the billionaire lawmakers are from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) of Prime Minister Imran Khan, two are from its ally Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), three from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and one each from Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Awami National Party (ANP).Interestingly, many other leaders -- including Prime Minister Khan, former premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi of the PML-N and PTI’s Khayal Zaman Orakzai -- who in the previous years had put the worth of their assets at over a billion rupees, opted to mention the cost of their assets this time, which is less than a billion.Prime Minister Khan owns assets worth over Rs 80 million, though this does not include the value of his 300-kanal villa in Bani Gala that he says was a gift. Almost all other properties including a house in Lahore’s Zaman Park, around 600 acres (4,800 kanals) of agricultural land besides non-agricultural land, too, are stated to be inherited.However, this year he has not mentioned two properties, which he had listed in the statement of assets filed last year, measuring around 15 acres in the Bhakkar area.While Khan continues to possess four goats valued at Rs 200,000, he does not own any vehicle. He has Rs 77.53 million cash in hand and in the bank accounts. Khan also has 518 pounds in a foreign currency account and USD 331,230 in two other accounts. He has also given Rs 11.97 million in advance for a flat. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who happens to be one of the 12 declared billionaires, has more assets in the UAE than in Pakistan. He has extended over Rs 1.24 billion loan to four companies from the money he inherited from his mother and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto after her assassination. The total value of his shares in the four companies forms only a small fraction of the amount he has lent to them.He has shares in two villas in Dubai, but their value has not been mentioned in the statement. The total worth of his assets comes to Rs 1.58 billion. He owns 19 properties in Pakistan including over 200 acres of land, most of which are inherited or gifted. He also owns weapons worth Rs 3 million.Former president Asif Ali Zardari owns thousands of acres of agricultural land besides properties in Dubai. The total worth of his assets has been stated to be Rs 676.87 million out of which he has Rs 316.70 million cash in hand. He owns over a dozen properties in Pakistan besides his share in the five properties that he inherited from his spouse Benazir Bhutto.Leader of the Opposition Shehbaz Sharif has more than 83 acres of agricultural land. In Pakistan, he owns four non-agricultural properties, while he also has a house in London. Besides, he has two vehicles and Rs 21.9 million in bank accounts.The value of his assets in Pakistan and abroad is Rs 247.49 million, but at the same time, he has liabilities worth Rs 146.67 million in terms of loans and mortgages in Pakistan and the UK, leaving his net worth at Rs 100.71 million.Considering his liabilities, his first wife, Nusrat Shehbaz, with net wealth of Rs 235.21 million is richer. She has two houses — one each in Lahore and Dunga Gali, Hazara division, KP valued at Rs 186.58 million — besides shares in several agricultural properties, industrial units. She also has around Rs 30.67 million in cash and bank accounts. She does not own any vehicle. The wealth of Shehbaz Sharif’s his second wife, Tehmina Shehbaz, remains around Rs 5.76 million, including Rs 4 million in terms of jewellery and household furniture, while her car is valued at Rs 500,000.Ihsan Bajwa, PML-N member from Bahawalnagar, is the richest among the lawmakers with total assets worth over Rs 4 billion, excluding liabilities in the UAE. PTI lawmaker from Peshawar, Noor Alam Khan, is second in the line. He owns assets worth Rs 3.20 billion.Another PTI lawmaker from Peshawar, Arbab Umar Amir Ayub, owns assets worth over Rs 2.56 billion. Chaudhry Salik Hussain of the PML-Q, son of former premier Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, has declared the worth of his assets as Rs 1.60 billion. PTI lawmaker Najib Haroon from Karachi is also a billionaire. He owns assets worth Rs 1.54 billion. The other billionaires include Moonis Elahi (PML-Q), Mohammad Yaqoob Sheikh (PTI), A H Azam Khan Hoti (ANP), Noorul Hasan Tanveer (PML-N) and Minister for Power Omar Ayub.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-billionaires-among-pakistan-s-national-assembly-members/story-Je93CQYlmmpyf5KrKdtyvK.html
11-11-2020||World||In blow to WHO, EU seeks powers to declare health emergencies||The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday proposed rules which would give the European Union(EU) the power to declare a health emergency and stress test national plans to tackle pandemics, in a potential blow to the World Health Organization(WHO).The move follows an often uncoordinated reaction by the 27 EU governments to the Covid-19 pandemic, which at the beginning of the crisis led to competition on vital medical gear and export bans on medicines.It also comes after the WHO was criticised for having declared the pandemic, which first emerged in China at the end of last year, too late.The UN agency has repeatedly denied the accusation. Under the proposals, the EU would be able to declare an EU-level public health emergency, which would in turn trigger more coordination among EU states.Currently, the EU relies on the WHO to declare such an emergency.“The new rules will enable the activation of EU emergency response mechanisms without making it contingent upon the WHO’s own declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” an EU document says, adding that such a move would be coordinated with the WHO.If adopted, the overhaul would partly take away a major power from the WHO, as EU states call for reform of the organisation to address shortfalls in emergencies.“We relied too much on the WHO for the Covid-19 pandemic,” Peter Liese, a top EU lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, said. “Under pressure from China, the WHO declared the health emergency too late. It is therefore very important to have the possibility to act at European level in future similar situations.”The WHO, which the Trump administration has labelled a puppet of China, was not immediately available to comment.Coordination on vaccinesUnder the commission’s proposals, the EU would help governments prepare pandemic plans and would audit and stress test them, an EU document says.EU states have traditionally been reluctant to give more powers to Brussels on the matter.During the pandemic, they have applied different national measures on a series of issues, including testing policies for Covid-19 cases, quarantine rules and travel restrictions. But they have shown good coordination on procuring vaccines.If approved by EU governments and EU lawmakers, the commission said the proposals would be immediately applicable and could strengthen EU powers to tackle the current pandemic, in which most European countries are seeing a surge in cases.Brussels wants to strengthen the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, whose non-binding advice, such as on the length of quarantine after contact with an infected person, has often been ignored.It also wants more power for the EU Medicines Agency to prevent risks of shortages of medicines and medical devices.Brussels also said it would unveil by the end of next year plans for a new health authority modelled after the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which has played a vital role in procuring experimental dugs and vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-blow-to-who-eu-seeks-powers-to-declare-health-emergencies/story-aH667HTAjPBUvHAdVZ2wzL.html

Biden has indicated he’s willing to extend it for 5 years as permitted under the treaty, which was signed in 2010.President Vladimir Putin won’t congratulate Biden until all legal challenges by Trump have been exhausted and the Democrat is officially declared the winner, the Kremlin said earlier this week. Putin is one of a dwindling number of leaders who haven’t recognized Biden as the next US head of state, along with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Ryabkov declined to comment on the controversy over the election outcome in the US, saying Moscow would work with whatever administration takes office on January 20.Russia, which was accused by US intelligence agencies of intervening in 2016 to help get Trump elected, has been wary of Biden, fearing an increase in sanctions pressure and clashes over human rights and the post-Soviet space. Still, Moscow could find Biden easier to engage on some issues including arms control, climate change and the Iranian nuclear program, analysts close to the Kremlin say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-isn-t-planning-any-contacts-with-biden-yet-says-official/story-EWzk7Q72glUDxkOOJ8BogJ.html
11-11-2020||World||Thousands in Armenia protest Nagorno-Karabakh truce terms||Thousands of people gathered in the capital of Armenia on Wednesday to protest the country’s agreement with Azerbaijan to halt weeks of fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh. The deal calls for the deployment of nearly 2,000 Russian peacekeepers and territorial concessions.Participants at the rally, which Armenia’s opposition parties promoted, demanded the resignation of the country’s Prime Minister, who signed the peace agreement along with the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Russia. Some of the protesters in Yerevan clashed with police, and scores were detained.The truce between the two ex-Soviet nations, brokered by Moscow and announced early Tuesday, came after significant advances by Azerbaijani forces that the Armenia-backed leader of Nagorno-Karabakh said made it impossible for his side to carry on.The agreement was celebrated in Azerbaijan, but it angered Armenians, who immediately took to the streets demanding that the pact be invalidated.Armenia and Azerbaijan have been locked in a conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh for decades. The region lies within Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. Heavy fighting erupted in late September, the biggest escalation of the conflict in a quarter-century, and has left hundreds, possibly thousands, dead.Several cease-fires announced over the past six weeks crumbled almost immediately, but the current agreement appeared to be holding, with neither side reporting any more fighting since it came into force.It came days after Azerbaijan pressed its offensive deeper into Nagorno-Karabakh and took control of the city of Shushi, which is strategically positioned on heights overlooking the regional capital of Stepanakert.Nagorno-Karabakh’s separatist leader, Arayik Harutyunyan, acknowledged Tuesday that “had the hostilities continued at the same pace, we would have lost all of Artsakh (an Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh) within days.”Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said it was “extremely painful for me personally and for our people,” calling the situation a “catastrophe” and adding that he had no choice but to sign the peace agreement.The agreement calls for Armenia to turn over control of some areas its holds outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. They include the Lachin region, which the main road leading from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia passes through. The agreement calls for the road, the so-called Lachin Corridor, to remain open and to be protected by Russian peacekeepers.The deal also calls for transport links to be established through Armenia that would connect Azerbaijan and its western exclave of Nakhchivan, which is surrounded by Armenia, Iran, and Turkey.Armenian opposition politicians on Wednesday called the agreement “treacherous” and demanded that Pashinian step down.“We need to save Armenia and Artsakh from Pashinian,” Ishkhan Saghatelyan, member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Dashnaktsutyun political party, said at a rally that drew up to 10,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-in-armenia-protest-nagorno-karabakh-truce-terms/story-iDm0q0WOl8zs5MU1W1iKjK.html

He shall be shown the way out soon Inshallah (God willing),” Iqbal had tweeted, without directly mentioning Khan.The US embassy account on Tuesday evening retweeted this, causing an uproar among the local Twitterati. On Tuesday, #ApologiseUS_Embassy trended on Twitter. The embassy clarified on Wednesday that the tweet from its handle was unauthorised.“Dear Followers: The US Embassy Islamabad Twitter account was accessed last night without authorisation. The US Embassy does not endorse the posting or retweeting of political messages. We apologise for any confusion that may have resulted from the unauthorised post,” it said.That should have settled the issue. But human rights minister Shireen Mazari and Sindh governor Imran Ismael demanded an apology from the US embassy on Wednesday.Mazari tweeted: “This not good enough esp after great delay! Account was clearly not hacked so someone who had access to it used it “without authorisation”. Unacceptable that someone working in US Embassy pushing a particular pol party’s agenda - has serious consequences incl staff visas scrutiny.”Mazari has not only suggested that the US Embassy was lying that their account was hacked and that in fact it was an embassy staffer who had retweeted, she also threatened that the move could impede issuance of staff visas to embassy personnel. It is believed that this issue will escalate in days to come.“US embassy is still working in Trumpian mode in support of convicted absconder and intervening brazenly in our internal politics,” Mazari said, referring to former prime minister and PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif.“Monroe doctrine also died centuries ago! US embassy must observe norms of diplomacy,” she said.Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Shahbaz Gill said that for the first time ever, an embassy was seen “insulting” its own lawfully elected president. “We expect some heads to roll. This is unacceptable!” he said.The latest development came after many Pakistanis welcomed President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over Trump, who had friendly relations with Khan and had publicly praised him for his help in paving the way for the US-Taliban peace deal.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-embassy-in-soup-over-retweet-of-pak-leader-s-post-targeting-imran-khan/story-BmJOsuLvYUhA2CceGWkMJP.html
11-11-2020||World||Bangladesh orders significant cuts in 2 China-funded railway projects||The Bangladesh Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has issued directions to significantly reduce the cost of two China-funded railway projects after carrying out a review, with authorities describing it as the first such action taken for ventures backed by Beijing. The PMO directed the railway ministry to reduce the cost of the project to convert the metre-gauge line between Akhaura and Sylhet to dual-gauge line by 3,354.31 crore takas or 20.8% of the total cost, according to a report by The Daily Star newspaper. The ministry was also directed to cut the cost of the project for upgrading the Joydebpur-Ishwardi dual-gauge line to dual-gauge double line by 1,495.52 crore takas, or 12.91% of the total cost. The directives were issued by a special committee reviewing the costs of three China-funded projects. Such a directive from the PMO is “not only rare, but I think this is the first”, an unnamed Bangladesh railway official was quoted as saying by the daily. The PMO had formed the special committee on September 30 to review three railway projects to be implemented with Chinese finance and by Chinese companies. The committee submitted its report within seven days. Following the submission of the report, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued the directive. The committee also made several observations and suggestions and the PMO asked for “necessary changes in the projects”, the report said. Of the three projects studied by the committee, the Akhaura-Sylhet and Joydebpur-Ishwardi projects had been approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec). Chinese companies had been selected to implement these projects and contract costs had been negotiated. The final loan and commercial deals were yet to be signed, the report said. The Ecnec had approved the project to convert the Akhaura-Sylhet railway line in April last year at a cost of 16,104 crore takas. The contract cost negotiated with China Railway Construction Bridge Engineering Bureau Group Co Ltd was 12,079 crore takas. However, questions were raised about the cost. The Joydebpur-Ishwardi railway project was taken up in January last year at a cost of 14,250 crore takas. It was scheduled to be completed by December 2024. The negotiated contract cost for this project was 9,839 crore takas and the selected company was the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation. The Bangladesh government’s move comes at a time when questions have been raised in several South Asian countries about the cost and implementation of several infrastructure and connectivity projects by China. In 2018, Nepal had scrapped an agreement with China’s Three Georges Corporation for building the $1.5-billion West Seti hydropower project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-orders-significant-cuts-in-2-china-funded-railway-projects/story-1eamW4E24G5Um4kLyQ8VxI.html

The case has caused a diplomatic chill between Canada and China, which soon after Meng’s arrest detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on espionage charges.“We don’t believe in coercive diplomacy and ... we actually deeply believe that if you start giving into that kind of pressure, you’ll leave yourself worse off for the long term,” Trudeau said in an interview during an FT online conference.“China continues to think that they can just put enough pressure on us and we will ... give in, but that’s exactly the opposite of our position,” he said.

11-11-2020||World||-70° celsius: Deep-freeze hurdle makes Pfizer’s vaccine one for the rich||When Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine rolls off production lines, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. will be waiting to distribute it through a complex and costly system of deep-freeze airport warehouses, refrigerated vehicles and inoculation points across China. After they reach vaccination centers, the shots must be thawed from -70 degrees celsius and injected within five days, if not they go bad.Then the herculean journey from warehouse freezer to rolled-up sleeve must be undertaken all over again -- to deliver the second booster shot a month later. The roadmap sketched out by the company, which has licensed the vaccine for Greater China, offers a glimpse into the enormous and daunting logistical challenges faced by those looking to deliver Pfizer’s experimental vaccine after it showed “extraordinary” early results from final stage trials, raising hopes of a potential end to the nearly year-long pandemic.That euphoria is now being diluted by the realization that no currently used vaccine has ever been made from the messenger RNA technology deployed in Pfizer’s shot, which instructs the human body to produce proteins that then develop protective antibodies.That means that countries will need to build from scratch the deep-freeze production, storage and transportation networks needed for the vaccine to survive. The massive investment and coordination required all but ensures that only rich nations are guaranteed access -- and even then perhaps only their urban populations.Read more | Keeping Pfizer vaccine at minus 70 degree Celsius tough, says AIIMS chiefWhere Things Stand in the Race for a Covid-19 Vaccine: QuickTake“Its production is costly, its component is unstable, it also requires cold-chain transportation and has a short shelf life,” said Ding Sheng, director of the Beijing-based Global Health Drug Discovery Institute, which has received funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.The expense of deploying the Pfizer shot will likely heighten existing fears that wealthier nations will get the best vaccines first, despite a World Health Organization-backed effort called Covax that aims to raise $18 billion to purchase vaccines for poorer countries.It also presents a choice now faced across the developing world: to pay for the expensive construction of subzero cold-chain infrastructure for what seems like a sure bet, or wait for a slower, more conventional vaccine that brews batches of protein or inactivated viral particles in living cells, and can be delivered through existing health-care networks.“If there is a protein-based vaccine that could achieve the same effect as an mRNA vaccine does and there’s the need to vaccinate billions of people every year, I’d go for the protein-based shots in the long run,” Ding said.Even for rich countries that have pre-ordered doses, including Japan, the U.S. and the U.K., delivering Pfizer’s vaccine will involve considerable hurdles as long as trucks break down, electricity cuts out, essential workers get sick and ice melts.Safe DeliveryTo safely deliver shots in mainland China and Hong Kong, Fosun will partner with the state-owned Sinopharm Group Co., a pharmaceutical distributor with well-established networks across the country. One of Sinopharm’s subsidiaries has also been developing Covid-19 vaccines. Packed into cold storage trucks, those vials will arrive at inoculation sites where they can thaw and be stacked in fridges at 2 to 8 degrees celsius for a maximum five days before going bad. “The requirement for extremely cold temperatures is likely to cause spoilage of a lot of vaccine,” said Michael Kinch, a vaccine specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. It’s also likely to cost Fosun tens of millions yuan, according to the company’s Chairman Wu Yifang. Fosun is considering importing the vaccine in bulk and filling them into vials at a local plant. That will also require further investment in production and storage.Read more | How Pfizer vaccine could be cold comfort for some Asian nationsThe Vaccine Cargo Cavalry Sizes Up Readiness of Historic AirliftThe resulting price tag may be too hefty for many developing nations, including neighboring India, which has struggled to contain the world’s second-largest coronavius outbreak and currently has no agreement to purchase the Pfizer vaccine.‘Forget It’Many working in the country’s public health and the pharmaceutical industry have already voiced concern that India lacks the necessary capacity and capability to deliver a vaccine across its vast rural hinterland and population of over 1.3 billion people at the breakneck speed now expected.“Most of these vaccines need minus 70 degrees, which we just can’t do in India, just forget it,” said T. Sundararaman, a New Delhi-based global coordinator of the People’s Health Movement, an organization that brings together local activists, academics and civil society groups working on public health.“Our current cold chains are not able to cope with some districts’ need for measles vaccines, and that’s only for children below the age of 3,” he said. “That’s a really trivial number of people compared to the numbers that will need a Covid-19 vaccine.”When asked at a Tuesday briefing if India’s government would look to buy any of the Pfizer vaccine, Rajesh Bhushan, the secretary at the health ministry, said New Delhi is in talks with all vaccine manufacturers. He added that India was in a position to “augment and strengthen” its existing cold-chain capacity, but declined to release any purchase details immediately. Pfizer already has orders from some developing countries like Peru, Ecuador and Costa Rica. It’s unclear how widely those nations plan to distribute the shots, but their small orders of less than ten million doses suggest limited deployment. After the release of their positive preliminary data, some governments have rushed to finalize orders and start negotiations with Pfizer and BioNTech. The European Union confirmed an order of up to 300 million doses on Tuesday, while the Philippines, Singapore and Brazil said they were in talks.Read more | Fauci says he will take new Pfizer vaccine if FDA approves it‘Last Mile’Even without the subzero issue, rolling out a vaccine in a short space of time will be a “major challenge” requiring mass paramedical training to administer two-shot doses, said Pankaj Patel, chairman of Indian drugmaker Cadila Healthcare Ltd., which is developing its own experimental plasmid DNA Covid-19 shot.This is especially so in areas where people are not easily contactable or have to travel long distances to reach vaccination centers. Past vaccination campaigns show that many simply never show up for the second shot, said public health experts. The mounting obstacles mean that some developing countries may pass on the Pfizer vaccine, despite early signs of its exceptional efficacy.“If we were to wait an extra year and have something that’s feasible for us to deliver to as many people as possible in this country, would that be a bad trade-off?” asked Gagandeep Kang, professor of microbiology at the Vellore, India-based Christian Medical College and a member of the WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.“Based on the cost of the Pfizer vaccine, the logistics of an ultra-cold storage -- I don’t think we are ready and I think this is something that we need to weigh the benefits and the costs very, very carefully,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/70-celsius-deep-freeze-hurdle-makes-pfizer-s-vaccine-one-for-the-rich/story-jX5WOpwR8AEaEXpYDDVF9J.html

The National Security and Investment Bill would require businesses to notify the government about deals in sensitive industries, including defense, transportation, communications and artificial intelligence. The government will then have 30 days to review the transactions and impose conditions on those deemed to pose a risk to national security. The legislation, which applies to technology and intellectual property as well corporate takeovers, follows similar moves by the US and Australia amid increasing concern about investment from potentially hostile countries such as China. “The UK remains one of the most attractive investment destinations in the world and we want to keep it that way,” Business Secretary Alok Sharma said in a statement. “But hostile actors should be in no doubt – there is no back door into the UK.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-increase-powers-to-block-foreign-investments/story-4qkm95qVNyc8NIqYF2oehL.html
11-11-2020||World||Scientists detect two-way transmission of coronavirus on mink farms||An analysis of outbreaks of the novel coronavirus on 16 mink farms in the Netherlands has revealed that the Covid-19 virus is capable of transmission between humans to minks, as well as from these mammals to people.While the virus was initially introduced from humans to the minks, the researchers, including Bas B. Oude Munnink from the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, said it has since evolved. “More research in minks and other mustelid species is important to understand if these species are at risk of becoming a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,” they wrote in the study, published in the journal Science. According to the scientists, the virus was first diagnosed on two mink farms in late April of 2020 in the Netherlands. In response, they said an extensive surveillance system was set up. The researchers performed an in-depth investigation among the first 16 infected mink farms in the Netherlands using a combination of coronavirus diagnostics, whole-genome sequencing, and in-depth interviews with farm workers. By the end of June, they found that 66 of 97 of the mink farm residents, employees and/or contacts tested had evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to the study, the mink virus genome analysis revealed a diversity of sequences. These large clusters of infection were initiated by Covid-19 cases with viruses that bear the “D614G mutation”, which has come to dominate human infections in several parts of the world, the scientists said. They also found that some people were infected with strains of the virus with an animal sequence signature, providing evidence of animal to human transmission. However, they did not find any evidence of spillover to people living in close proximity to mink farms. “It is imperative that fur production and trading sector should not become a reservoir for future spillover of SARS-CoV-2 to humans,” the scientists wrote in the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-detect-two-way-transmission-of-coronavirus-on-mink-farms/story-gYfzgx5HYmTbN9180TseyK.html
11-11-2020||World||Several wounded in WWI memorial attack at Jeddah cemetery for non-Muslims: France||Several people were wounded Wednesday in a bomb attack at a World War I(WWI) commemoration ceremony attended by European diplomats at a non-Muslim cemetery in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, France’s foreign ministry said.“The annual ceremony commemorating the end of World War I at the non-Muslim cemetery in Jeddah, attended by several consulates, including that of France, was the target of an IED attack this morning, which injured several people,” the ministry said.“France strongly condemns this cowardly, unjustifiable attack.”Last month, a Saudi citizen with a knife injured a guard at the French consulate in Jeddah on the same day that a knife-wielding man killed three people in a church in Nice in southern France.Wednesday’s blast came as French President Emmanuel Macron, the target of ire in much of the Muslim world for vowing to confront Islamist radicalism following a spate of attacks, attended a WWI memorial ceremony in Paris.Several countries are marking the 102nd anniversary of the armistice signed by Germany and Allied countries to end the war.Macron has vigorously defended the right to publish cartoons viewed as offensive by some, including caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed printed by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.The same cartoons were shown by French history teacher Samuel Paty to pupils in a class on free speech, leading to his beheading outside Paris on October 16 following an online campaign by parents angry over his choice of lesson material. Macron’s stance angered many Muslims, prompting protests in several countries at which portraits of the French president were burnt, and a campaign to boycott French products.Saudi Arabia, home to Islam’s holiest sites, has criticised the cartoons, but “strongly” condemned last month’s attack in Nice.On Tuesday, Macron hosted a summit of European leaders to plot a joint approach to combating Islamist radicalism after four people were killed in a shooting rampage in the heart of Vienna last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-wounded-in-wwi-memorial-attack-at-jeddah-cemetery-for-non-muslims-france/story-seJcIS4x2tIqKyMceGJlAM.html
11-11-2020||World||Myanmar’s opposition party demands re-election as Aung San Suu Kyi heads for victory||Myanmar’s biggest opposition party on Wednesday said it would not recognise this week’s general election and urged authorities to hold another vote, with the help of the powerful military. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) urged a re-run of Sunday’s vote as soon as possible, with the military’s cooperation, “in order to have an election that is free, fair,unbiased and free from unfair campaigning”.The USDP call came as Aung San Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party looked on course for its second successive election sweep, after partial results on Wednesday indicated a commanding lead and wins in more than 80% of the parliamentary seats that have been declared. The NLD has claimed a resounding based on its own unofficial tally.Nearly a third of the contests have been formally announced and the latest official results take the NLD’s seats in the bicameral legislature to 130 of the 158 declared, compared with 15 for the USDP.The NLD won by a similar margin in the last election in 2015, which was the first vote since the end of nearly 50 years of strict military rule and quasi-military rule.The NLD needs 322 seats to be sure of forming the next government.The USDP alleged irregularities like poor-quality ballot boxes and envelopes, problems with advanced voting and government cash handouts it said amounted to NLD bribes.It also complained about celebratory gatherings by NLD supporters it said breached novel coronavirus restrictions.The NLD said such complaints were to be expected but it demanded proof of any wrongdoing.“There will always be some people who say it is not fair,” said NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt. “They must present evidence for their accusations.” The election commission was not immediately available but it was scheduled to hold a news conference later on Wednesday. The election was seen as a referendum on Suu Kyi’s fledgling democratic government, which is hugely popular at home but its reputation abroad has collapsed due to accusations of genocide against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority, which it denies. Despite the emergence of new parties, experts saw the election as a straight choice between the NLD and the USDP, the political juggernaut created by the military junta before it started the transition towards a civilian-led democratic system.International and local observers have said the election went smoothly without major irregularities. The US-based Carter Center said on Tuesday that voting was conducted positively in 94% of stations visited. The election commission, which is appointed by the president, was criticized before the vote over alleged errors in voter lists, censorship of broadcasts by opposition parties, and the cancellation of voting in areas affected by insurgencies.Among the critics was the military’s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who said there were “unacceptable mistakes” ahead of the polls, underlining tension between the civilian government and the military, which has a quota of house seats and control of several ministries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-s-opposition-party-demands-re-election-as-aung-san-suu-kyi-heads-for-victory/story-uz7EEl0p1xIK0HuQjkXZeI.html
11-11-2020||World||Trump appoints loyalists to top Pentagon jobs after Esper firing||A day after President Donald Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper, three staunch loyalists to the president were named to top defense jobs. Among them was a former Fox News commentator who failed to get through Senate confirmation because of offensive remarks he made, including about Islam.The abrupt changes sent reverberations through the Pentagon as nervous civilian and military personnel waited for the next shoe to drop. And they fuelled worries of a wider effort to drum out anyone considered not loyal enough to Trump.The unease was palpable inside the building throughout the day over concerns about what the Trump administration may do in the months before President-elect Joe Biden takes office and whether there will be a greater effort to politicize the historically apolitical military. While radical policy shifts seem unlikely before the January 20 inauguration, the changes could further damage prospects for a smooth transition already hampered by Trump’s refusal to concede his election loss.James Anderson, who had been acting undersecretary for policy, resigned Tuesday morning and he was quickly replaced by Anthony Tata, a retired Army one-star general. A short time later, Joseph Kernan, a retired Navy vice admiral, stepped down as undersecretary for intelligence, hastening what had been an already planned post-election departure. Kernan was replaced by Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who becomes acting undersecretary for intelligence.Also Read: Republicans searching for problems with Wisconsin electionThe departures came on Christopher Miller’s second day on the job as defense chief. Miller also brought in his own chief of staff, Kash Patel, to replace Jen Stewart, who had worked in that job for Esper. Patel and Cohen-Watnick are both considered staunchly loyal to Trump and previously worked at the National Security Council.Patel was among the small group of aides who travelled with Trump extensively during the final stretch of the campaign. He also is a former prosecutor in the national security division of the Department of Justice and former staff member on the House Intelligence Committee. In that post, he was a top aide to Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.Patel was linked in media accounts to efforts to discredit the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. He moved to the National Security Council in February 2019, and earlier this year, he travelled to Syria for rare high-level talks aimed at securing the release of two Americans who have been missing for years, including journalist Austin Tice.Cohen-Watnick was a protégé of Trump’s initial national security adviser, Michael Flynn, but was replaced in the summer of 2017 by Flynn’s successor, H.R. McMaster, as part of a string of shakeups at the White House and National Security Council.While the personnel changes added to the tumult in the wake of Esper’s departure, it’s not clear how much impact they could have on the massive Pentagon bureaucracy. The department is anchored by the tenet of civilian control of the military, and much of the day-to-day activities are conducted by career policy experts and military leaders in the U.S. and around the globe who adhere to a strict chain of command.Also, many of Trump’s policies and defense priorities have already been put in motion by Esper and his predecessors, guided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including the chairman, Army Gen. Mark Milley. All of those military leaders remain in place.This is Trump’s second attempt to secure the policy job for Tata. Earlier this year, Trump appointed Tata to the post, but the Senate cancelled a hearing on the nomination when it became clear that it would be difficult if not impossible to get him confirmed. Tata withdrew his name from consideration for the job, which is the third-highest position in the department. Trump then appointed Tata to serve in the job of deputy undersecretary.There has been continuing tumult in the Pentagon’s policy shop. John Rood was forced to resign as undersecretary for policy in February after he drew White House ire for warning against the US withholding aid to Ukraine, the issue that led to the president’s impeachment.Tata will be “performing the duties of” the undersecretary job, rather than holding the “acting” title. Officials who carry the “acting” title have more authority than those who are “performing the duties of” the job.According to reports, Tata posted tweets in 2018 calling Islam the “most oppressive violent religion I know of,” and he called former President Barack Obama a “terrorist leader” and referred to him as Muslim. The tweets were later taken down.At the time of the Senate hearing, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash. and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Trump must not prioritize loyalty over competence and install someone in a job if the “appointee cannot gain the support of the Senate, as is clearly the case with Tata.”Defense officials said Miller, who previously was director of the National Counterterrorism Center, continues meeting with staff and becoming familiar with the Pentagon and its wide range of complex and critical national security issues and mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-appoints-loyalists-to-top-pentagon-jobs-after-esper-firing/story-wqoxivTCpuJV1xtm5IvJrM.html

11-11-2020||World||Hong Kong opposition to quit as China moves to quash dissent||Hong Kong’s opposition bloc planned to resign on Wednesday after China moved to disqualify lawmakers who aren’t deemed sufficiently loyal, one of Beijing’s strongest moves yet to quash dissent in the territory.More than a dozen members of the pro-democracy camp of the 70-seat Legislative Council will quit at a press conference later Wednesday following the disqualification of four members under Beijing’s new rules, democratic politician Fernando Cheung said by phone.“This move makes it clear that dictatorship has descended on to Hong Kong and that Chinese Communist Party can eradicate all opposing voices in the legislature,” Cheung said. “There’s no more separation of powers, no more ‘one country, two systems,’ and therefore no more Hong Kong as we know it.”China’s top legislative body earlier passed a measure requiring Hong Kong lawmakers to demonstrate loyalty to the central government, curbing debate in a democratic institution that has endured more than two decades after the former British colony’s return. The decision of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee is “conducive to the long-term peace and stability, as well as prosperity and development of Hong Kong,” Chairman Li Zhanshu said at the close of its two-day meeting.Offences included supporting Hong Kong independence, refusing to recognize China’s sovereignty over the city, asking foreign countries to intervene, failing to uphold the territory’s Basic Law or pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and “engaging in any other acts that endanger national security,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said.“We need to have a political body that’s composed of patriots,” Lam said at a briefing on Wednesday, echoing similar statements from China’s top agencies overseeing Hong Kong. She dismissed concerns that Hong Kong would have a “rubber-stamp” legislature if the pro-democracy members resigned, saying she welcomes “diverse opinion.”Hong Kong Ousts Four Lawmakers After China Passes Patriotism LawThe resolution is the latest sign of China’s determination to rein in dissent in the wake of anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong last year. Beijing bypassed the Legislative Council to impose controversial national security legislation in June, causing the Group of Seven nations to accuse China of violating the terms of its handover agreement with the UK and prompting the Trump administration to sanction more than a dozen senior officials who oversee the city.A mass resignation would highlight international concerns about China’s human rights practices just as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on a promise to defend democratic values around the world. He has vowed to “fully enforce” legislation signed by President Donald Trump that punishes Beijing for eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Wednesday called the matter “purely China’s internal affairs,” and warned foreign governments to avoid “interference or wanton comments.”The ability to purge opposition lawmakers would make it easier for Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed politicians to control the Legislative Council if they win an unprecedented majority in elections that the government has postponed -- citing coronavirus concerns -- over the protests of democracy advocates.The move by Beijing will demolish any opposition in the legislature and allow the Hong Kong government to ram through even more restrictive measures in the coming years, said Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.‘Beijing is trying to eradicate any political opposition’“The situation is quite clear in Hong Kong that Beijing is trying to eradicate any political opposition, whether it’s the moderate or the radical wing,” Choy said. “In the next two years, I think they’ll do even more nasty things to strengthen their draconian rule.”The disqualified lawmakers on Wednesday were Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung, Hong Kong’s government said in a statement. The four lawmakers had been criticized by authorities for using delay tactics common in democratic legislatures around the world.“The people of Hong Kong should not give up,” Kwok Ka-ki said as opposition members briefed Wednesday. “We can’t give up.”The move will raise new questions about the future of the legislature, perhaps the most high-profile platform for open debate left under Beijing’s rule. After several “localist” activists were among a record 29 opposition lawmakers elected in 2016, China handed down a ruling that led to the disqualification of a half dozen lawmakers.Several remaining lawmakers are also facing criminal charges related to various protests against the government, including seven charged in recent months with participating in a May scuffle at the Legislative Council.“It means, effectively, the end of meaningful opposition in Hong Kong and the acceleration of the integration of Hong Kong into the mainland party state,” said Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and author of “City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong.” “Going forward, Legco will only be comprised of Beijing-friendly people and the scope for opposition figures, even if they get into Legco, to do anything meaningful will be constrained to the extent that the Legco becomes like the NPC: a rubber-stamp parliament.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-opposition-to-quit-as-china-moves-to-quash-dissent/story-YCixOokISTbs2yFwMWLGrJ.html
11-11-2020||World||Myanmar’s army-backed party alleges ‘contentious events’ during election||Myanmar’s military-backed opposition said on Tuesday there had been “many contentious events” during a parliamentary election two days ago which the ruling party says it won by a landslide, but offered no immediate evidence of violations. Than Htay, leader of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), said in a video on the party’s official Facebook page that it was pursuing legal options and urged viewers to send in evidence of “illegal acts”.“There were many contentious events during the whole voting process, whether in line with the law or not, and more facts are coming out,” he said, without specifying. “We will continue to work according to the law to receive the result our supporters want.”Sunday’s election was seen as a referendum on the fledgling democratic government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD), which remains very popular at home but has seen its overseas reputation battered by accusations of genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority, which it denies. The NLD has said it won more than the 322 seats in parliament needed to form a government based on data compiled from reports by party agents at polling stations nationwide. The election commission is yet to announce a final tally, but the several dozen seats it has announced so far put the NLD comfortably ahead.The commission, which is appointed by the president, was criticized in the run-up to the vote over alleged errors in voter lists, censorship of broadcasts by opposition parties, and the cancellation of voting in areas affected by insurgencies. A commission spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. The NLD said it was ready to cooperate if any reliable evidence of violations was provided.“We are also ready to resolve it according to the law,” party spokesman Myo Nyunt said by phone. International and local observers have said the election went smoothly without major irregularities. The U.S-based Carter Center said on Tuesday entry for observers was restricted in three centres where votes were being tabulated but that voting was conducted positively in 94% of stations visited. Candidates can file objections within 45 days of the results to tribunals appointed by the election commission, but cannot appeal the judgments at an independent court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-s-army-backed-party-alleges-contentious-events-during-election/story-t2S0g4PfRS9hTDvP9NlgZO.html
11-11-2020||World||Hong Kong disqualifies 4 pro-democracy legislators||Hong Kong has moved to disqualify four pro-democracy legislators, after Beijing passed a resolution that would allow the local government to remove lawmakers from their positions if they’re deemed to threaten national security.The disqualification came after the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, which held meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, passed a resolution stating that those who support the city’s independence or refuse to acknowledge China’s sovereignty over the city, as well as commit acts that threaten national security or ask external forces to interfere in the city’s affairs should be disqualified, according to the state-owned Xinhua News Agency.The four lawmakers – Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung – confirmed that they were disqualified in a news conference with the press.“In terms of legality and constitutionality, obviously from our point of view this is clearly in breach of basic law and our rights to participate in public affairs, and a failure to observe due process,” said Kwok.On Monday, 19 lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp said they would resign en masse if Beijing moved to disqualify any pro-democracy lawmakers.A mass resignation by the pro-democracy camp would leave Hong Kong’s legislature with only pro-Beijing lawmakers. The pro-Beijing camp already makes up a majority of the city’s legislature, and would allow lawmakers to pass bills favored by Beijing without opposition.Earlier in the year, the four now-disqualified pro-democracy lawmakers were barred from running for legislative elections originally scheduled for September, prior to the government stating that it would postpone the elections by a year due to the coronavirus situation. The four lawmakers later remained in their posts following the postponement.The elections postponement was criticized by the pro-democracy camp as an attempt to block them from taking a majority of seats in the legislature, after they had held an unofficial pro-democracy primary participated in by over 600,000 voters to decide which candidates to field.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam is expected to hold a news conference later Wednesday to address the disqualifications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-disqualifies-4-pro-democracy-legislators/story-EMsxc1z7Kw0DcN6JIJE2UP.html

Biden spoke later to Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, and again made a point of emphasizing his backing for peace in the region.The exchange with Johnson marks an uncomfortable start to the newest incarnation of the so-called special relationship between the UK and the US and suggests Biden will not be an unequivocal backer of Johnson’s Brexit project in the way President Donald Trump has been.The two men have never met in person, and Biden has shown himself to be fiercely proud of his Irish roots. His transition to power comes at a delicate phase in the UK’s divorce from the European Union. Unlike Trump, Biden was opposed to Brexit and has aired his views on it.Also Read | UK govt defiant after House of Lords rejects Brexit billKnown HistoryBack in September, Biden raised his concerns over Johnson’s plan to break international law by reneging on parts of the Brexit divorce agreement he struck with the EU relating to trade with Northern Ireland. President Barack Obama, who Biden served under, famously weighed in on the 2016 referendum to say that if the UK opted out of the EU the US would be put at the “back of the queue” when it came to trade talks.Those talks, begun under Trump, will now likely be followed up by a Biden administration in a process that could take years, judging by the length of previous trade negotiations.Biden had said in September that any US trade deal with the UK must be “contingent” on respecting the Northern Ireland peace agreement and avoiding a return to a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.A British official said the call was friendly and good. The UK has always insisted its plans do not compromise peace in the region and are intended to safeguard stability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-warns-johnson-of-brexit-not-to-disturb-peace-in-northern-ireland/story-wcNpxODv3Q7318PMKtH3FL.html

The new Host Nation Support agreement will replace the existing agreement which expires on March 31, 2021,” a statement on the Foreign Ministry’s website read.The delegations were led by Yutaka Arima, Deputy Director-General at Japan’s North American Affairs Bureau and Donna Welton, Senior Advisor at the US State Department’s Political-Military Bureau, according to the statement. High-ranking defense officials were also part of both sides.A day prior, Japanese defense minister Nobuo Kishi said that Tokyo would seek a stopgap one-year funding deal, instead of the usual five-year agreement. This holds out hope that the upcoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden would reverse Trump’s demands to increase spending.The current agreement on sharing the cost burden of maintaining the military bases runs out at the end of the fiscal year, in March 2021. Preparatory talks between the two sides have so far taken place virtually at a lower level of diplomats in October.Japan last year shelled out over USD 1.8 billion to sustain numerous US military bases, airfields and installations. Trump’s Pentagon has been pushing to increase the spending to about USD 8 billion per year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-washington-conclude-first-round-of-formal-talks-on-us-military-base-spending/story-zNiLO4lHOxGzN9ijZrJ81K.html

Beijing, meanwhile, has placed tariffs on Australian barley imports, banned some other imports and ordered traders to stop buying at least seven commodities including coal, copper and wine -- actions which Australian ministers have labeled “economic coercion.”China Turns to Lobsters, Wine and Coal to ‘Punish’ AustraliaLi’s comments were similar to a statement last week from China’s Foreign Ministry, which also urged Australia to act first.“Mutual respect is the basis and prerequisite for state-to-state cooperation,” ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said then. “Once again we urge some in Australia to reflect upon their deeds, do more things that are conducive to mutual trust, cooperation and the China-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership, and create favourable conditions and atmosphere for bilateral practical cooperation across the board.”Also Read: Xi says SCO member states should resolve disputes, differences through dialogueThe Australian government needs to calm down and see the huge potential of China’s market, according to a former senior Commerce Ministry official.To improve ties, “first of all, Australia has to stop making irresponsible remarks,” Wei Jianguo, a former vice commerce minister, said Wednesday. “Second, you have to import Chinese products based on WTO principles, especially 5G and digital products, rather than using security grounds at will.”“Third, and I think this is very important, we should strengthen mutual trust,” he said, adding that the situation would worsen if things weren’t corrected. Wei denied that any ban had placed placed on imports from Australia, calling this “rumors by Australian media.”Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham declined to comment to Bloomberg about Li’s remarks.In an interview Monday with Sky News, Birmingham said the government was still unable to make contact with China at a ministerial level -- a stalemate that has been in place since Australia called for independent investigators to be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the pandemic.“There are problems, and there are deeply troubling and concerning aspects, to some elements of that trade relationship at present,” Birmingham told Sky News. “So we are continuing to closely monitor that and trying to work out all diplomatic and government-to-government levels that we can to secure a better understanding and resolution of some of those concerns.”Ties between the key trading partners have grown increasingly strained in recent years, with Canberra barring Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network, and amid accusations of Chinese interference in Australia’s internal politics. Beijing’s retaliatory moves come as Australia -- whose economy is the most dependent in the world on China -- tries to pull out of its first recession in almost three decades.The Chinese pressure came from many sides, with an editorial Tuesday in the state-backed China Daily also calling on the Australian government to resolve contentious issues.“Australia should see clearly the bright prospect of the bilateral cooperation and meet China halfway to push the bilateral relationship back on track at an early date,” China Daily said.Earlier this week, in an interview with an Australian newspaper, a researcher at a Chinese government-connected think tank said Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government needed to act to improve ties.Researcher Mei Xinyu, who works at a think tank under China’s Commerce Ministry, suggested Australia should offer to send government ministers to China and should express interest in Beijing’s new five-year economic plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-australia-knows-what-is-needed-to-improve-ties-amid-strained-relations/story-4q2PTid1gvLAPXIAKZ1T9K.html
11-11-2020||World||ASEAN nations to sign China-backed trade deal amid US presidential uncertainty||Southeast Asian leaders start meetings on Thursday that are expected to lead to an ambitious China-backed trade deal at a time the still uncertain election result in the United States leaves questions over its engagement in the region.Leaders of the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand are scheduled to conclude talks on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) this Sunday.The deal, which is expected to be signed later on Sunday on the sidelines of a mostly online, four-day ASEAN summit in Hanoi, will take years to complete but will progressively lower tariffs across many areas and could become the world’s biggest trade agreement. The 15 participating RCEP countries make up nearly a third of the world’s people and account for 29% of global gross domestic product. China is already the biggest source of imports and destination for exports for would-be RCEP members.“The signing of RCEP will provide momentum for regional trade, particularly between signatories,” said Nguyen Quoc Dung, deputy foreign minister of Vietnam, which is chairing ASEAN meetings this year.Also Read: Chinese proxies systematically threatening expats living in Canada: ReportThe summit comes while the result of the US presidential election has yet to be declared despite Democrat Joe Biden projected to have comfortably won the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. Biden, who was vice president during President Barack Obama’s “Asian pivot”, is expected to steer away from Trump’s “America First” agenda and re-engage more actively in the region. But legal challenges to the election result and the firing of the US defense secretary by Trump risk raising concerns among US allies at a time that China’s influence is growing.Trump’s tariff-raising trade war with China has given extra impetus in recent years to push ahead with the RCEP, which had otherwise progressed only sluggishly since negotiations began in 2012.The deal, which is expected to be the most significant agreement at this year’s ASEAN summit, will likely cement China’s position more firmly as an economic partner with Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea, and put it in a better position to shape the region’s trade rules.“The uncertainty regarding the US election raises questions regarding US participation in relevant meetings and may give China a chance to influence the narrative about America’s engagement with the region,” said Le Hong Hiep, a fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asean-nations-to-sign-china-backed-trade-deal-amid-us-presidential-uncertainty/story-O9uJLafix4i6Txye6oxIvL.html
11-11-2020||World||Bahrain Prime minister, world’s longest-serving, dies At 84||Bahrain’s Prime minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al Khalifa has died, the royal palace announced on Wednesday on Twitter. He was a dominant figure in the Gulf island’s politics for much of his near half century in power. He passed away on Wednesday morning at Mayo clinic hospital in the United States, Bahrain’s state news agency said. Khalifa, 84, the uncle of King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, had served as prime minister since the Sunni Muslim-led island kingdom declared independence from Britain in 1971, almost half a century. The al-Khalifa family has ruled since 1783.Born on November 24,1935, he was a Bahraini royal and politician who has served as the Prime minister of Bahrain since 1970, taking office over a year before Bahrain’s independence on 15 August 1971.He was the longest-serving Prime minister of any government in the world although under the 2002 constitution he lost some of his powers, with the King having the authority to appoint and (along with the Bahraini parliament) dismiss ministers. His stern response to pro-democracy protests in Bahrain in 2011 -- and criticism of similar unrest across the Arab world -- underlined what for many was the defining characteristic of his career, namely a stalwart defence of dynastic rule.In August last year, Sheikh Kahlifa left the kingdom for what official media called at the time “a private visit abroad”. Earlier this year he spent time in Germany for unspecified medical treatment, returning to Bahrain in March. The burial ceremony will take place upon the repatriation of his body and the funeral will be limited to a specific number of relatives, Bahrain’s state news agency said. Official mourning has been declared for a week and government ministries and departments will close for three days starting Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bahrain-prime-minister-has-died-royal-palace-says/story-zXxSfyK6qQGIO2mgsAi9aJ.html

11-11-2020||World||Singapore, Hong Kong to resume flights with special air travel bubble||Hong Kong and Singapore will start an air travel bubble that will replace quarantine with Covid-19 testing from Nov. 22, officials said in separate media briefings Wednesday.There will be several flights a week on Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. from that date, rising to daily from Dec. 7. A maximum of 200 people will be permitted on each flight and details of the arrangement, released nearly a month after the two Asian hubs first announced they’d reopen their borders to one another, will be reviewed after one month.Singapore Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung said at a news briefing that this was the first travel bubble of its type and may be used as a template for other countries, if successful. The travel bubble will help ensure a brighter future for the city-state’s Changi Airport and Singapore Airlines, he said.Travel bubbles are seen as key to reopening borders ahead of the rollout of an effective and internationally recognized vaccine. But they’ve been hard to put into practice as the coronavirus continues to spread or flare again in much of the world. Cases globally have surpassed 51 million while deaths are nearing 1.3 million.Even the Singapore-Hong Kong arrangement comes with a long list of requirements and some restrictions. Ong said the waiting time for a Covid test would likely be about four hours and fares would be a commercial decision for the two airlines.“I suspect travelers might well be quite careful in the beginning before they gradually become more confident,” Ong said. “I suspect that many Singaporeans and Hong Kongers will take a wait-and-see attitude until after awhile you can do one test less perhaps.”Medical CostsFlying on the travel bubble between the two cities will also require a degree of paperwork. Tests should be taken within 72 hours prior to departure and applications for travel approval should be done online at least seven days ahead of time. Should travelers become Covid positive in either city, they would need to bear the full cost of any medical treatment provided to them.Shares in Singapore Airlines dipped after the announcement, down 0.3%. Cathay rose 1.4%. Both carriers rose sharply on Tuesday after a study showing a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE protects most people from the coronavirus.Having brought their Covid-19 outbreaks largely under control, Hong Kong and Singapore are eager to prise open their borders and get their economies ticking back to life again. Hong Kong’s total reported infections stand at 5,389, while Singapore’s tally is just over 58,000. That contrasts with many nations in Europe, as well as the US, which is now reporting over 100,000 cases a day.“Both Singapore and Hong Kong rely a lot on the success of the airlines and airports for their economies,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics.Officials from Hong Kong and Singapore said on Oct. 15 that quarantine would be replaced by coronavirus testing and that the two cities were hoping to start it in November. Travelers must have been in Hong Kong or Singapore for 14 days before departure and need to take and pass mutually recognized virus tests.On Nov. 3, Hong Kong announced new rules stating that arrivals from anywhere other than mainland China would have to quarantine in a hotel for 14 days. But visitors from Singapore will be exempted from this under the travel bubble agreement.Affordable TestingSingapore already allows people from five countries for general travel without having to serve quarantine, though they still have to isolate when they return home. The city-state is also assessing the risk travelers pose based on where they are arriving from. The priority is to have effective tests to replace the quarantine requirements that deter people from flying overseas.“Affordable testing will be the key to reviving travel,” said Mayur Patel, OAG Aviation Worldwide Ltd.’s regional sales director for Japan and Asia Pacific. “If the cost of testing is too expensive, it’s not going to drive demand.”“We are obviously very keen to make the travel bubble a success,” Lee Lik Hsin, Singapore Airlines’ executive vice president of commercial, said on Monday. “Of course we do have to take into account the various considerations that the government, the regulators will have in approving such a bubble and being experimental, you can expect some level of conservatism.”The pressure is on for places like Hong Kong and Singapore, which depend on international trade and tourism. Ong has warned that Singapore’s future is at stake.Opening borders is also important for flag carriers Singapore Airlines and Cathay as they’ve been reduced to flying at just skeleton capacity because they have no domestic market in which to operate. Last year, the Hong Kong-Singapore route was the 10th busiest internationally in Asia, according to OAG. Both airlines have suffered record losses this year.Ticket prices have risen in anticipation of the Hong Kong-Singapore bubble. The lowest fares on Singapore Airlines economy class rose to S$678 ($500) for return flights in December, up from S$557 earlier this month, according to the carrier’s website. The airline doesn’t plan to use its Airbus SE A380 superjumbos for flights to and from Hong Kong when an agreement on opening up is reached, Lee said.Hopes for travel bubbles elsewhere have hit snags. Australia and New Zealand eventually formed a corridor after some setbacks due to virus flareups, only for it to transpire that some passengers flying into Sydney subsequently broke the rules by connecting to other places. The quarantine-free agreement only covers parts of Australia and isn’t reciprocated in kind in New Zealand, meaning it falls far short of initial hopes.“Singapore is probably among the most pro-active nations in the world when it comes to looking at ways to open up and reduce travel restrictions,” Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong said at a post-results briefing on Monday. “This will serve as a very good pilot and example of how we can actually open up travel in a safe manner for everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-hong-kong-to-resume-flights-with-special-air-travel-bubble/story-mRCXQ7bH22KF9AjCUxmu1H.html
11-11-2020||World||Indian-origin Canadian MP quits over breach of ethics||An Indian-origin member of Canada’s House of Commons has resigned from the ruling Liberal Party of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after revelations that she had breached ethics norms by hiring her sister for a public job in her constituency office.Yasmin Ratansi, who was born in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and has roots in Kutch, Gujarat, is an MP from the Toronto riding of Don Valley East. Interestingly, Ratansi had recently moved a petition in the House of Commons to criticise the Indian government over its actions in Jammu & Kashmir.She had presented a petition in parliament in late September protesting the revocation of Article 370 and seeking the appointment of a fact-finding mission. Pro-Pakistan groups in Canada had welcomed the petition which asked the Government of Canada to “condemn the siege of Kashmir.” Ratansi claimed an “error in judgement” in employing her sister for the taxpayer-funded job. “I have remedied the situation, but this does not excuse the error I made,” she said in a statement posted on social media. The case is being reviewed by Canada’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described her action as “unacceptable.” During a media interaction, Trudeau said, according to the outet Global News, “I am deeply disappointed by the news I learned yesterday from Ms Ratansi and how she handled the office. It is unacceptable and I expect there will be a thorough follow up by administration on this.”Meanwhile, the national broadcaster CBC reported that four of Ratansi’s employees alleged the MP mistreated them and created a “toxic and verbally abusive” environment in the office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-canadian-mp-quits-over-breach-of-ethics/story-rJiugb4SK4fsIwAoeGXrFL.html
11-11-2020||World||Chinese proxies systematically threatening expats living in Canada: Report||The Chinese government deploys “trusted agents” or proxies for its state agencies in Canada to threaten and intimidate members of its diaspora community into refraining from criticism of the regime, using tactics such as retributive action against family and friends in the mainland, a media report said.This strategy employed by Beijing has now been recognised by Canada’s spy agency, Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), according to a report in the national daily, Globe and Mail.While these tactics may be used to force fugitives to return to China, a CSIS spokesperson told the daily that they could also be utilised “for silencing dissent, pressuring political opponents and instilling a general fear of state power no matter where a person is located.”“Certain foreign states routinely attempt to threaten and intimidate individuals around the world through various state entities and non-state proxies. These states, such as the People’s Republic of China, may use a combination of their intelligence and security services as well as trusted agents to assist them in conducting various forms of threat activities,” the spokesperson said.In the strongest public denunciation of China’s bullying of its expat community in Canada, the CSIS spokesperson also added that the “fear of state-backed or state-linked retribution targeting both them and their loved ones, in Canada and abroad, can force individuals to submit to foreign interference”. Taken together, such activities “constitute a threat to Canada’s sovereignty and to the safety of Canadians,” he said, while asking Chinese-Canadians to report such coercion to Canadian law enforcement.Such actions of the Chinese government echo those occurring in the United States, under the name of Operation Fox Hunt, which the Federal Bureau of Investigation director Christopher Wray had said was launched under the direction of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2014 through the Ministry of Public Security to “target Chinese nationals who he sees as threats and who live outside China, around the world.”These revelations come even as protests against Beijing have burgeoned in Canada. Multiple marches and other events have been jointly organised by community groups with their roots in Hong Kong, Tibet and also Uighurs, to protest Chinese Government measures including a controversial security law in Hong Kong and persecution of minorities. Reacting to the report, Shuvaloy Majumdar, Program Director and Munk Senior Fellow for Foreign Policy at the Ottawa-based Macdonald Laurier Institute, told the Hindustan Times, “It is now apparent through many reports that the CCP pursues a systematic campaign of intimidation against Canadians - in Hong Kong, and across Canada. They underestimate the strength of this country and what binds all Canadians together.”The Canadian spy agency’s statement also comes as relations between China and Canada have cratered after the arrest of two Canadians, including a diplomat, in China in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described as “hostage diplomacy”. The Canadian government has asserted those arrests were taken in retaliation to the detention of a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei in Vancouver in late 2018 on charges of defrauding a bank to bypass sanctions against Iran. Critics of China’s interference in Canadian matters have also pointed to the role of other State-backed outfits such as the Confucius Institutes and the United Front Work Department, which is part of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee apparatus.Last month, China’s ambassador Cong Peiwu had riled the Canadian government by saying that Canada should stop giving asylum to “violent criminals” from Hong Kong, the pro-democracy activists, if it “really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and a large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong.” That veiled threat received a rebuke from Trudeau, as he said, “We will stand up loudly and clearly for human rights, all around the world, whether it’s talking about the situation faced by the Uighurs, whether it’s talking about the very concerning situation in Hong Kong, whether it’s calling out China for its coercive diplomacy.” Opposition leaders had then asked Ottawa to withdraw the diplomatic credentials of the envoy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-proxies-systematically-threatening-expats-living-in-canada-report/story-H36CyqYobJfhu6tuuCyqhM.html

Kang said she conveyed the South Korean government’s commitment to advance the alliance and work together on North Korea issues, while hearing about Biden’s views on foreign policy issues during the meetings. “I highlighted the need to reinforce diplomatic efforts to achieve the goal of completely denuclearising the Korean peninsula given the urgency of the North Korean nuclear issue,” she told reporters. “I put a particular emphasis on the importance of a swift restart of US-North Korea dialogue ... as an issue that requires a priority, summit-level interests.” The office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in said separately on Wednesday it was arranging a phone call between Moon and Biden for Thursday. Kang said she was looking forward to having early formal discussions after Biden is sworn in, building on past experiences working with Democratic administrations. Kang also met incumbent White House National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien. They discussed bilateral, regional and global issues including the election for chief of the World Trade Organisation and agreed to maintain close cooperation until the new administration comes in, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-pushes-for-us-north-korea-summit-level-talks-in-meeting-with-biden/story-qV3pAZPGXmXXbWhZ74vGGK.html
11-11-2020||World||Philippine authorities evacuate thousands as Typhoon Vamco approaches||Philippine authorities have ordered thousands of residents in eastern coastal communities to evacuate ahead of the landfall of Typhoon Vamco on Wednesday, only weeks after the country was battered by the strongest cyclone so far this year.Vamco, which carries sustained winds of 125 kph (78 mph) and gusts of up to 155 kph, is the 21st tropical storm to hit the Philippines this year. “We are just 1% into our recovery and then here comes another typhoon. We’re now feeling strong wind and rain,” Joseph Cua, the governor of Catanduanes province, told DZMM radio. The island province of Catanduanes and nearby Albay, both southeast of the capital Manila, bore the brunt of Typhoon Goni in late October, a category 5 typhoon that killed 25 people and left six people missing.Vamco is due to make landfall in Polilio Island on Wednesday evening and hit rice-producing provinces north of the capital before exiting the Philippines’ main island of Luzon on Thursday, Chris Perez, a state weather forecaster, told DZMM. Residents in coastal communities, who are expecting up to a three-metre (nine foot) storm surge, were ordered to leave their homes, said Cristina Bosque, mayor of Polilio. But ensuring the prevention of the spread of Covid-19 in evacuation centres remained a challenge, she said.The Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, sees around 20 tropical storms annually. After lashing the Philippines, Vamco is forecast to head towards Vietnam. Vietnam’s weather agency is expecting Vamco to arrive in its central region on Sunday, bringing intense rains.Floods and mudslides over the past month have killed at least 160 people in central Vietnam, left dozens missing and damaged 390,000 houses, official data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippine-authorities-evacuate-thousands-as-typhoon-vamco-approaches/story-lSsmlMRCJKbvNcmSwwXEGI.html

But the latest body blow to the industry was just delivered courtesy of Covid-19, via a mutation of the virus found in mink.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The animals have emerged as highly efficient spreaders of the coronavirus, potentially complicating efforts to control a pandemic that’s already claimed more than a million human lives. Last week, Denmark revealed it had found a variant of the virus that officials fear could be so disruptive that it justified ordering the extermination of the country’s entire mink population -- 17 million animals.Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has acknowledged that wiping out all breeding mink means the industry may not recover in Denmark, which is among the world’s biggest producers of the fur.“My position remains that the mink have to be culled, because they pose a risk to human health,” she said in Copenhagen on Tuesday.As the prospects grow that mink farming could derail efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, the future of Europe’s fur industry seems less certain than ever. Outside Denmark, other mink producing nations are watching closely as they figure out their next steps.“We are alarmed by the news from Denmark,” said Nadezhda Zubkova, executive director for Russia’s National Association of Fur Animal Breeders. “But so far it’s about scientists’ assumptions.”In Sweden, authorities say they have transmission of the virus among mink under control. But roughly a quarter of Swedish mink farms have had outbreaks, and the industry realizes it can’t ignore the risks. Jorgen Martinsson, the head of Swedish Mink, said in a Facebook post that “we must never hide from the difficult questions.”The Luxury IndustryThe real shift might come from within the luxury industry itself. Diana Verde Nieto, co-founder of Positive Luxury, which rates the social and environmental impact of high-end brands, says that the “spread of the virus among the mink population in Denmark is likely to be another wake-up call.”“The world as a whole has to re-think our relationship with nature,” she said.LVMH established a supply charter last year that aims to protect biodiversity. While the world’s largest luxury conglomerate lets its brands decide whether or not to use fur, one of the goals of the new policy is to make it possible to trace pelts back to the breeding farms.Also Read | Covid-19 raises serious questions for Denmark’s mink farmersEven before mink became associated with coronavirus mutations, the industry was facing a bleak future. Global mink production has dropped to about 45 million pelts, almost half the all-time high of 87 million in 2014, according to Fur Europe, a lobby group for the industry in Brussels.A Perfect StormThe organization has defended the industry, and says fur trade has played “no significant role” in spreading the disease and that mink farmers have increased screening since the pandemic began in the spring. It argues that there’s still room in the world for fur.“The fundamental demand for natural fur is strong,” Fur Europe said in a statement last week. It says the key is renewable products, rather than “today’s ‘buy and throw away’ culture.”The fur industry is well versed in battling negative campaigns and is gearing up for another fight. But the science may be hard to ignore.As Kare Molbak, Denmark’s top epidemiologist, put it in an interview with Politiken, “Mink are very easily infected by the coronavirus, and once it’s there, it spreads at the speed of light,” he said. “We’ve seen how that then spreads to humans. That makes it practically impossible to handle the spread during a pandemic.”“It’s a perfect storm,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mutant-covid-19-in-mink-raises-questions-about-the-future-of-fur/story-65N9sTPmWMshZOz0zTV0yK.html
11-11-2020||World||Democrats clinch thin majority in House but lead likely to shrink more||Democrats clinched two more years of controlling the House on Tuesday but with a potentially razor-thin majority, a bittersweet finale to last week’s elections that has left them divided and with scant margin for error for advancing their agenda.The party has now nailed down at least 218 seats, according to The Associated Press, and could win a few others when more votes are counted. While that assures command of the 435-member chamber, blindsided Democrats were all but certain to see their current 232-seat majority shrink after an unforeseen surge of Republican voters transformed expected gains of perhaps 15 seats into losses potentially approaching that amount.“We have the gavel, we have the gavel,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who seems all but certain to continue in that role. While she bemoaned Democrats’ losses in districts where GOP votes proved “almost insurmountable,” she told reporters last week, “We’ve lost some battles but we’ve won the war.”By retaining the House, Democrats will control the chamber for four consecutive years for only the second time since 1995, when Republicans ended 40 years of Democratic dominance.Yet though Joe Biden won the presidential election, there was a strong chance Republicans would keep Senate control. That would force Democrats to scale back their dreams of sweeping health care, infrastructure and other initiatives, instead needing compromises with the GOP.As the bad news sunk in, Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., who led House Democrats’ campaign committee, announced Monday she wouldn’t seek another term leading that organization. Democrats said privately she would have lost had she again sought the post, for which the party’s lawmakers vote.Republicans have been heartened by the House results, which many believe position them for a strong run for the majority in the 2022 elections. They also bolstered their distressingly low number of women representatives from 13 to at least 26, a record for the GOP, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, and were adding new ethnic minority lawmakers as well.“The Republican coalition is bigger, more diverse, more energetic than ever before,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the day after the election.Democrats went into Election Day with a 232-197 House advantage, plus an independent and five open seats. With some races remaining undecided, it was possible that in the new Congress that convenes in January they’ll have the smallest majority since Republicans had just 221 seats two decades ago.Democrats secured the majority after The Associated Press declared three winners late Tuesday: incumbents Kim Schrier in Washington, Tom O’Halleran in Arizona and Jimmy Gomez in California.A tight majority could cause headaches for Pelosi, empowering any determined group of lawmakers to pressure her on what bills should be considered or look like. But sometimes, a slender margin can help unify a party because its members know they must stick together to achieve anything.Democratic moderates and progressives clash periodically, and while the moderates are more numerous, the progressives’ ranks include influential social media stars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NYUnderscoring that tension, House Democrats vented during a three-hour conference call last week in which both factions blamed the other for rhetoric and policies they said proved costly in the campaign.“We should be honest that this was not a good outcome,” Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-NJ, a moderate freshman, said in an interview. He said terms like “defunding the police” hurt Democrats by making it sound like they oppose law enforcement, and said they shouldn’t speak “as if we were talking to woke progressives in neighborhoods where 90% of the votes are for Democrats.”Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a progressive leader, said in an interview that Democrats need to discuss “how we talk about some of these issues that are critical to different parts of our base.” But with moderates complaining that the GOP hurt Democrats by repeatedly accusing them of pushing socialism, Jayapal said such accusations “will be used against us no matter what we say.”Democrats believed they’d pick up seats, especially in suburbs, because of a decisive fundraising edge, President Donald Trump’s unpopularity and exasperation over the pandemic. Many Republicans and independent polls supported that expectation.But with some races still uncalled, Democrats haven’t defeated a single GOP incumbent and failed to capture open GOP-held seats in Texas, Missouri and Indiana they thought they’d win.Instead, they’ve lost at least seven incumbents: six freshmen from states including Florida, Oklahoma and South Carolina plus 30-year veteran Rep. Collin Peterson from rural Minnesota. And while they successfully defended most of their 29 districts that Trump carried in his 2016 victory, they saw stronger than expected performances by GOP candidates all around the country.“With President Trump on the ballot, it just drove enormous turnout that was almost impossible to surmount,” said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a reelected freshman.“ The country has become more polarized and divided,” said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. “If you’re running in alien territory, you’re always at risk of failure.”So far, Democrats’ only pickups were three open seats from which Republicans retired. Two were in North Carolina, where court-ordered remapping made the districts strongly Democratic, and one was outside Atlanta.Going into the election, Democrats envisioned strengthening their moderate wing, since most districts they seemed likely to capture were closely divided between GOP and Democratic voters. But they ended up suffering losses in those same type of districts, meaning it was mostly moderates who lost.“In electoral politics, moderates are the beachfront property,” said Jim Kessler, an official with Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. “And if there’s flooding, they’re the ones that get washed away.”Illustrating that, the Blue Dog Coalition of the most conservative House Democrats, whose membership has dwindled in recent years, lost at least six of its roughly two dozen members.On the other hand, a handful of hard-left progressive freshmen will be coming to Congress, including Democrats Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri, who each won seats in overwhelmingly blue districts.On the Republican side, the conservative House Freedom Caucus was hoping to grow from its roughly 30 members.The group has tried pushing GOP leaders to the right over the years and was a consistent source of trouble for the past two Republican speakers, John Boehner of Ohio and Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-clinch-thin-majority-in-house-but-lead-likely-to-shrink-more/story-kAgueNy9Ils2gkbCKa0uQO.html
11-11-2020||World||UK to spend up to $57 billion on ‘Moonshot’ mass coronavirus Testing||The UK government is set to hand more than 40 billion pounds to companies that can help in its drive to ramp up mass coronavirus testing.Public Health England put out a 22 billion-pound ($29 billion) contract to tender last week for a new “national microbiology framework agreement,” which includes the manufacture and development of tests for two years, with the option to extend for another two years.A separate tender worth 20 billion pounds from the National Health Service Supply Chain, which manages the sourcing and supply of healthcare products, involves on-the-spot tests and diagnostic equipment.The government has also issued a third tender worth 912 million pounds for the supply of rapid turnaround lateral flow tests. The total scale of the contracts -- bigger than the annual budgets of some government departments -- was revealed by the Financial Times on Tuesday.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “As part of an unprecedented response to this global pandemic we have drawn on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners to support our testing program.”The total represented the maximum value of the contracts and not necessarily the final amount that will be spent, the DHSC said.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told in September of his hopes for millions of Covid-19 tests to be processed daily -- a plan dubbed “Operation Moonshot” -- in a bid to help Britain to return to normal life as soon as possible.Liverpool in northwest England became the first city to undertake a mass testing program last week, and the government said Tuesday this could be rolled out to 66 other local areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-spend-up-to-57-billion-on-moonshot-mass-coronavirus-testing/story-TRiyCtOmCZumQheVWzss1K.html
11-11-2020||World||US has a plan to start Pfizer vaccine shots in December: Health secretary||If Pfizer Inc submits the positive initial data from its Covid-19 vaccine trial to health regulators as quickly as expected, the US government plans to begin vaccinating Americans in December, health secretary Alex Azar said on Tuesday. Pfizer on Monday said the vaccine it has been developing with German partner BioNTech SE was 90% effective against Covid-19, based on an early look at results from its large, late-stage trial.The US drugmaker said it expects to have safety data as soon as next week that it needs to apply for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the US Food and Drug Administration.Upon FDA authorization, the United States would receive about 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine per month, Azar said on a call with reporters, noting that HHS could being procuring supplies at the end of this month. The United States has a $1.95 billion contract for 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough to inoculate 50 million people - with an option to acquire 500 million more.Earlier on Tuesday, Azar said on CNBC that final decisions are subject to a close look at the vaccine efficacy data.Based on recommendations to the government, it will likely start with inoculations of the elderly in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, healthcare workers and first responders, with a goal to complete those shots by the end of January.Top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci also said in an interview with MSNBC that he expects the doses of the vaccine to be available for certain high priority groups in December.Azar said he anticipates there will soon be more vaccines to protect against Covid-19 from other companies, including Moderna Inc, which is expected to announce interim results of a large trial of its experimental vaccine at the end of the month. “By the end of March, early April, we expect to have enough for every American who would like to be vaccinated,” Azar told CBNC.Antibody drug distribution Azar also said the US government would begin distribution of Eli Lilly and Co’s antibody treatment this week, starting first in areas with the highest numbers of hospitalized Covid-19 patients and overall cases.The treatment, which is administered by infusion, received an EUA on Monday.“We’ll ensure equitable distribution, and we’ll work tightly with our governors,” Azar said. He said the government will use the same process employed to distribute remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences Inc used to treat people hospitalized with Covid-19.According to the Health and Human Services website, the agency will ship more than 79,000 doses of the antibody therapy this week, with the largest number going to Wisconsin, Texas, California, and Illinois. The United States has purchased 300,000 doses of the treatment for this year and has an option to buy an additional 650,000 doses next year.Azar said health officials and Eli Lilly were exploring ways to provide the treatment outside of hospitals, including through outpatient infusion centers. Fauci described the Lilly treatment as “an important first step in the development and distribution of interventions that are given early in the course of disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-a-plan-to-start-pfizer-vaccine-shots-in-december-health-secretary/story-xObY3TxhGYMrBtugdsfXyH.html
11-11-2020||World||Fauci says he will take new Pfizer vaccine if FDA approves it||US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said he will take Pfizer Inc’s new coronavirus vaccine if the Food and Drug Administration approves it and that he has confidence in the company and the government agency.Asked on MSNBC if he would take the vaccine, Fauci said: “I’m going to look at the data, but I trust Pfizer. I trust the FDA. These are colleagues of mine for decades, the career scientists. If they look at this data, and they say this data is solid, let’s go ahead and approve it, I promise you, I will take the vaccine, and I will recommend that my family take the vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-says-he-will-take-new-pfizer-vaccine-if-fda-approves-it/story-F0l2N8Tn4y0CEPPikL6p2J.html
11-11-2020||World||US surpasses 1 million Covid-19 cases in November||The US has surpassed 1 million new confirmed coronavirus cases in just the first 10 days of November, with more than 100,000 infections each day becoming the norm in a surge that shows no signs of slowing. The 1 million milestone came as governors across the nation are making increasingly desperate pleas with the public to take the fight against the virus more seriously. The Wisconsin governor planned to take the unusual step of delivering a live address to the state Tuesday, urging unity and cooperation to fight Covid-19. Minnesota’s governor ordered bars and restaurants to close at 10 p.m., and Iowa’s governor said she will require masks at indoor gatherings of 25 or more people, inching toward more stringent measures after months of holding out. The alarming wave of cases across the US looks bigger and is more widespread than the surges that happened in the spring, mainly in the Northeast, and then in the summer, primarily in the Sun Belt. But experts say there are also reasons to think the nation is better able to deal with the virus this time around. “We’re definitely in a better place” when it comes to improved medical tools and knowledge, said William Hanage, a Harvard University infectious-disease researcher. Newly confirmed infections in the US are running at all-time highs of well over 100,000 per day, pushing the running total to more than 10 million and eclipsing 1 million since Halloween. Several states posted records Tuesday, including more than 12,000 new cases in Illinois, 7,000 in Wisconsin and 6,500 in Ohio. Deaths — a lagging indicator, since it takes time for people to get sick and die — are climbing again, reaching an average of more than 930 a day.Hospitals are getting slammed. And unlike the earlier outbreaks, this one is not confined to a region or two. Cases are on the rise in 49 states. “The virus is spreading in a largely uncontrolled fashion across the vast majority of the country,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease expert at Vanderbilt University. While deaths are still well below the U.S. peak of about 2,200 per day back in April, some researchers estimate the nation’s overall toll will hit about 400,000 by Feb. 1, up from about 240,000 now.But there is also some good news.Doctors now better know how to treat severe cases, meaning higher percentages of the COVID-19 patients who go into intensive care units are coming out alive. Patients have the benefit of new treatments, namely remdesivir, the steroid dexamethasone and an antibody drug that won emergency-use approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Monday. Also, testing is more widely available. In addition, a vaccine appears to be on the horizon, perhaps around the end of the year, with Pfizer this week reporting early results showing that its experimental shots are a surprising 90% effective at preventing the disease. And there’s a change pending in the White House, with President-elect Joe Biden vowing to rely on a highly respected set of medical advisers and carry out a detailed coronavirus plan that experts say includes the kind of measures that will be necessary to bring the surge under control. Biden pledged during the campaign to be guided by science, make testing free and widely available, hire thousands of health workers to undertake contact-tracing, and instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide clear, expert advice. “We are already seeing encouraging signs from President-elect Biden with regard to his handling of COVID-19,” said Dr. Kelly Henning, a veteran epidemiologist who heads the Bloomberg Philanthropies’ public health programs. “I am relieved to see he’s already put some of the smartest scientific minds on his new coronavirus task force and that they are acting urgently to try and get the pandemic under control as quickly as possible.” While the first surge in the Northeast caught many Americans unprepared and cut an especially deadly swath through nursing homes, the second crest along the nation’s Southern and Western rim was attributed mostly to heedless behavior, particularly among young adults over Memorial Day and July Fourth, and hot weather that sent people indoors, where the virus spreads more easily. The fall surge similarly has been blamed largely on cold weather driving people inside and disdain for masks and social distancing, stoked by President Donald Trump and other politicians. Even in parts of the country that have been through coronavirus surges before, “you see people breaking out of it” and letting their guard down, Schaffner said. “There really is COVID fatigue that is blending into COVID annoyance,” he said.The short-term outlook is grim, with colder weather and Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s ahead. Generations of family members gathering indoors for meals for extended periods “is not a recipe for anything good,” Hanage said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-surpasses-1-million-covid-19-cases-in-november/story-VslapCFM6yo1qBbSIL4HhM.html
11-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson, Joe Biden pledge to work together closely in 1st phone call||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Joe Biden on Tuesday during their first official phone call since the US President-elect won the November 3 election against incumbent Donald Trump. It is believed that Biden chose to telephone Johnson ahead of other leaders in Europe as Downing Street said the two leaders pledged to work closely together. “In a call this afternoon, the Prime Minister warmly congratulated Joe Biden on his election as President of the United States. The Prime Minister also conveyed his congratulations to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on her historic achievement,” a Downing Street spokesperson said. “They discussed the close and long-standing relationship between our countries and committed to building on this partnership in the years ahead, in areas such as trade and security – including through NATO. The Prime Minister and President-elect also looked forward to working closely together on their shared priorities, from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy, and building back better from the coronavirus pandemic,” the spokesperson said. During the conversation, Johnson is said to have formally invited Biden to attend the COP26 climate change summit that the UK is hosting in Glasgow next year. “They also looked forward to seeing each other in person, including when the UK hosts the G7 Summit in 2021,” the spokesperson added. Biden was declared the winner on Saturday as he edged passed the 270 electoral college votes mark. However, counting is ongoing on in some states, with President Donald Trump disputing the result. Soon after his phone call, Johnson also issued a Twitter statement to say that he is looking forward to “strengthening the partnership” between our countries and to working with him on our shared priorities – from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy and building back better from the pandemic.

11-11-2020||World||‘Lockdown’ is Collins Dictionary’s word of the year||In its original hyphenated avatar, the word meant a piece of wood used to nail pieces of a raft together. In the 1970s, it is believed that the prison systems of some US states gave it a meaning close to its current one -- restricting inmates to their cells, especially in the wake of or to prevent violence. On Sunday, it was named the word of the year 2020 by Collins English Dictionary. The word? Lockdown. The word, which, in its current context means measures implemented by governments around the world to restrict movement of people to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease, Covid-19, was chosen for its “unifying experience for billions” and for being one that “sums up the year” for most people. The dictionary defines lockdown as “the imposition of stringent restrictions on travel, social interaction, and access to public spaces”. “Our lexicographers chose lockdown as Word of the Year because it is a unifying experience for billions of people across the world, who have had, collectively, to play their part in combating the spread of COVID-19,” Collins said.“Lockdown has affected the way we work, study, shop, and socialise. With many countries entering a second lockdown, it is not a word of the year to celebrate but it is, perhaps, one that sums up the year for most of the world,” she said. The dictionary said it registered over a quarter of a million usages of the word during 2020, against only 4,000 the previous year.Several other words related to the pandemic are included in Collins’s list of the top 10 words of the year: “furlough” -- the practice of temporarily laying off employees -- and “self-isolate”. The word “coronavirus” features in the list too, with an extraordinary 35,000-fold increase in use year-on-year. But social impacts – the changes to behaviour and the human way of life – dominate the list for the year. “The restrictions placed on how we move about and interact with one another arguably had the most impact,” Collins notes.Interestingly, the dictionary points out that 2020 was not all about the pandemic. “Megxit”, or Prince Harry and actor Meghan Meghan’s decision to stand down as members of the UK royal family, was among the top words of the year. Anti-racism movement Black Lives Matter was one of the other key words, as was “mukbang” , the Korean word that refers to a video or webcast in which the host noisily eats a large quantity of food for the entertainment of viewers. There’s no explaining tastes. (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-is-collins-dictionary-s-word-of-the-year/story-BifnztCPBFwf2T51QtvCbP.html
11-11-2020||World||US attorney general Barr allows probes into voter ‘fraud’, top official resigns in protest||President Donald Trump will push ahead on Tuesday with legal challenges to the results of last week’s election after US attorney general William Barr told federal prosecutors to look into any “substantial” allegations of voting irregularities.Barr’s directive to prosecutors prompted the top lawyer overseeing voter fraud investigations to resign in protest. It came after days of attacks on the integrity of the election by Trump and Republican allies, who have alleged widespread voter fraud, without providing evidence.Trump has not conceded the election to Democrat Joe Biden, who on Saturday secured the more than the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to win the presidency.The Trump campaign has filed several lawsuits claiming the election results were flawed. Judges have tossed out lawsuits in Michigan and Georgia, and experts say Trump’s legal efforts have little chance of changing the election result.Barr told prosecutors on Monday that “fanciful or far-fetched claims” should not be a basis for investigation and his letter did not indicate the Justice Department had uncovered voting irregularities affecting the outcome of the election.But he did say he was authorising prosecutors to “pursue substantial allegations” of irregularities of voting and the counting of ballots. Richard Pilger, who for years has served as director of the Election Crimes Branch, announced in an internal email he was resigning from his post after he read “the new policy and its ramifications”. The previous Justice Department policy, designed to avoid interjecting the federal government into election campaigns, had discouraged overt investigations “until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded”.Biden’s campaign said Barr was fueling Trump’s far-fetched allegations of fraud. “Those are the very kind of claims that the President and his lawyers are making unsuccessfully every day, as their lawsuits are laughed out of one court after another,” said Bob Bauer, a senior adviser to Biden.On Monday, Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit to block Pennsylvania officials from certifying Biden’s victory in the battleground state. It alleged the state’s mail-in voting system violated the US Constitution by creating “an illegal two-tiered voting system” where voting in person was subject to more oversight than voting by mail.Judges have already tossed out Trump campaign’s lawsuits in Michigan and Georgia, and experts say these legal efforts have little chance of changing the election result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-attorney-general-barr-allows-probes-into-voter-fraud-top-official-resigns-in-protest/story-J6XORyvznzqBCPyZUXsAAJ.html
