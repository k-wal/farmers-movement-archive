That is lower than last week’s estimate of 1.1-1.3, which means the virus is still spreading exponentially but at a slower rate.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage England is currently under its second national lockdown, with non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants closed for four weeks until Dec 2, in order to curb the spread of the virus.The latest figures offer a glimmer of hope that the most stringent restrictions will be eased for Christmas, in welcome news for shuttered businesses as well as for politicians. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to avoid another lockdown and held out against one until modeling projected the health service would be overwhelmed without action.The Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE), which advises the government on pandemic strategy, warned levels of coronavirus remain “very high.” The panel said “significant levels of healthcare demand and mortality will persist until R is reduced to and remains well below 1 for an extended period of time.”SAGE said the R rate is lowest in the north-west of England, at 0.9-1.1, where some areas such as Manchester and Liverpool were already under tight restrictions due to a surge in cases before the nationwide lockdown was enforced on Nov 5.A separate study from the Office for National Statistics on Friday appeared to echo SAGE’s findings. The proportion of people testing positive for coronavirus in England has continued to rise, but more slowly than in the past, the ONS said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-19-infections-are-now-slowing-say-govt-scientists/story-4RWk7uIsDVvnhTO4AHjIgK.html
13-11-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine could make social divisions worse||The Pfizer vaccine, along with its likely successors, is a very good thing for the US and the world. Yet it’s also likely to reshape America in some unsettling ways, segregating society more tightly into rational and irrational responders, especially in the short run.The first issue will be how Americans respond over the course of the next few months. Simple logic suggests that when a good vaccine is pending, you should play it much safer. Instead of putting off that vacation indefinitely, just wait until you’re vaccinated, possibly as soon as next summer. In theory that should be an easier adjustment to make, as indicated by what economists call “intertemporal substitution”: waiting for a short time is easier and less costly than waiting for a long time.Many people will behave in such a rational fashion. But many will instead take more risk. As the prospect of a post-Covid America becomes more vivid, the temptations of going out and socializing now will become more powerful. Once people start thinking about the imminent prospect of partying and fine dining, they might find it harder to resist the idea of just going ahead with it now, despite the higher risk. The giddiness occasioned by a vaccine might have some counterintuitive and negative effects.Of course, some truly rational and forward-looking people will realize that some of their friends and contacts will behave in this less responsible manner. The more rational among us thus will take greater care to avoid those whom they do not trust, as well as those who have front-line service jobs and thus cannot avoid contact with these less responsible individuals. The rationalists will cocoon themselves more, most of all from strangers and known irrationalists. Another possibility is that norms of social scorn will weaken, and confusion will reign for a while. Currently, if you shop without a mask or hog the middle of the jogging path in the park, you will be asked to leave or given dirty looks. These are healthy social reactions that help to keep the virus under control.Will that remain the case once 10% or 20% of the population has been vaccinated? Furthermore, by then a higher percentage of the population already will have had Covid-19. You could imagine that, by February or March, 30% to 40% of the American population either will have had Covid (a form of vaccination in fact, albeit a dangerous one), or have received a proper vaccine. Many of them will take off their masks in public spaces.Will you still be so inclined to give non-mask-wearers dirty looks? Their behavior might be just fine and pose no risk to others or you. And the vaccinated will themselves be less likely to give dirty looks to other non-mask-wearers, because they will not personally feel so threatened.In other words, some highly useful norms may end up weaker during the transition phase. People who remain unvaccinated and vulnerable may temporarily face higher rather than lower risks.Or what if three vaccinated family members or friends propose going to a movie with a fourth unvaccinated person? Will she so readily say no? The possibility of such situations — the fear of the unknown — will make rational, unvaccinated people all the more determined to limit their social interactions, at least for a while.These forms of segregation will be reinforced by the economics of the vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine requires extreme cold storage at about minus 70 degrees Celsius. Many rural hospitals cannot afford that expense, and so many communities will receive the vaccine much more slowly. Covid-19 might persist as a largely rural phenomenon.Or how about colleges and universities? Students should be back on campus by the fall semester, and they will demand that all students and faculty and staff be vaccinated —and they may also help supply the vaccine. Thus a vaccine divide will form between educated and non-educated young Americans. And given that no vaccine is likely to prove 100% effective, many educated Americans will remain risk-averse and avoid contact with rural, lower-income, less-educated Americans.It almost goes without saying, of course, that a partially vaccinated population is far better than no vaccine at all. So celebration is entirely appropriate. But along the way we are going to face a new set of problems, and now is the time to start thinking about them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-could-make-social-divisions-worse/story-8xpMcRa2ait0lmf0dwn81J.html
13-11-2020||World||EU threatens more Belarus sanctions after protester’s death||The European Union threatened to add sanctions against Belarus over the “outrageous” death of a 31-year-old man died following his detention by the police in the capital, Minsk.Raman Bandarenka was taken away by police on Wednesday following a clash between locals hanging ribbons on a park fence in support of the opposition, and a group tearing them down, news website Tut.by reported, citing unidentified eye witnesses. An hour and a half later he was hospitalized, and he died Thursday evening, according to the site.“This is an outrageous and shameful result of the actions by the Belarusian authorities,” the European Union’s diplomatic service said in a statement Friday. “The European Union has already imposed sanctions on 55 individuals responsible for violent repression and intimidation, and stands ready to impose additional sanctions.”The country’s Investigative Committee said Bandarenka was injured during the fight.The death threatens to escalate a standoff between the authorities and the protesters that has continued since President Alexander Lukashenko claimed to win by a landslide on August 9 in a vote the opposition says was rigged. The opposition has called for a national minute of silence Friday and for people to attend Sunday protests that regularly attract over 100,000 people in Minsk. Police crackdowns have intensified in recent weeks damping the size of the weekend meetings.The political crisis is the worst of Lukashenko’s 26 years in power and has forced him closer to Russia, which has provided financial support as the protests and coronavirus pandemic have slowed the economy. The US and the European Union have not recognized the election’s result.The EU last week added Lukashenko to a blacklist of Belarusian authorities implicated in ballot fraud and a subsequent crackdown on protesters. The penalties involve asset freezes and travel bans.The opposition has rallied around Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko’s main challenger in the election. A former English teacher who joined the race after her husband was jailed and barred from running, Tsikhanouskaya has since fled to Lithuania and was awarded the European Union’s top human rights prize last month.The Russian leadership has refused to meet with Tsikhanouskaya, although the country’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, said he attended an informal meeting with her, organized by Estonia, according to RIA Novosti.Russia’s position has not changed in regards to Tsikhanouskaya, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-threatens-more-belarus-sanctions-after-protester-s-death/story-M11lnevtqa0CrnzKzwMTsM.html

The beef was delivered from another Chinese city.Control and management of resources will be strengthened, Bi Kexin, head of the import and export food safety bureau of the General Administration of Customs, was quoted as saying.The Chinese customs will further enhance their inspection of cold-chain imported foods in a bid to prevent the risk of imported coronavirus infections, Bi said.China has communicated with the authorities of 109 countries that export cold-chain food products to the country, with suggestions and requirements receiving active responses from the respective departments, Bi said, adding that 140 cold-chain food producers from 50 countries have been inspected, and 22 companies have been dealt with regarding unqualified products.It has been estimated that there have been over 25 novel coronavirus cases detected in imported food cold chains since the first case was found in July, mostly from major frozen food exporting countries including Ecuador, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, and Norway, the report said. The novel coronavirus, which originated from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, has claimed nearly 1.3 million lives and infected over 52 million people globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-halts-imports-of-seafood-products-from-indian-firm/story-vHbi0MCtgxqFo8Vka6TLaK.html

Amnesty International said scores and possibly hundreds of civilians were stabbed and hacked to death in the region on November 9, citing witnesses.“If confirmed as having been deliberately carried out by a party to the current fighting, these killings of civilians would amount to war crimes, and there must be an independent investigation and full accountability for what has happened,” she said.Colville added that there were concerns that the killings which he described as “really, really horrific” were done along ethnic lines, although said it was too early to say this was the case.A spokesman for the UN refugee agency Babar Baloch said that the number of refugees seeking safety in neighbouring Sudan are increasing rapidly, with over 4,000 crossing the border in one day.There are also concerns that the violence will cause the mass displacement of thousands of Eritrean refugees in a camp in Ethiopia, he added, saying that aid agencies were overwhelmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-of-ethiopian-conflict-spiralling-into-war-crimes/story-7rGOlzvGjucJagcyJCmJVP.html

Debt transparency is extremely important,” Aso told reporters after a G20 conference call.The new framework also goes further than the debt freeze by requiring all public creditors to participate, after China was criticised by G20 partners for not including debt owed to its state-owned banks.China has become a major creditor to developing countries in recent years, often by lending through institutions like China Development Bank and China EXIM.But China is wary about debt write-offs and Beijing has defined the state-owned China Development Bank as a private institution, resisting calls for full participation in debt reliefThe Paris Club, which is organised by the French Finance Ministry, and G20 countries already agreed last month to extend this year’s debt freeze under which they deferred $5 billion in debt servicing to help the world’s poorest countries cope with the coronavirus crisis.G20 leaders are expected to endorse the common framework at a virtual summit meeting next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-finance-ministers-accept-debt-framework-for-countries-in-need-of-covid-19-deep-relief/story-KUFncaTBE98rkPAYYiZ2SK.html

Breton brought up the leaked document and showed it to Pichai during the call and said that there was no need to use old century tactics and to play one unit at the Commission against another, a person familiar with the call said.Pichai apologised for the way the document came out, a paper which he had not seen nor signed off, saying that he would engage directly with Breton if he sees language and policy that specifically targets Google, another person familiar with the call said.Google said the two had a frank but open conversation.“Our online tools have been a lifeline to many people and businesses through lockdown, and Google is committed to continuing to innovate and build services that can contribute to Europe’s economic recovery post-COVID,” spokesman Al Verney said in a statement.The incident underlines the intense lobbying by tech companies against the proposed EU rules, which could impede their businesses and force changes in how they operate.Breton will announce new draft rules known as the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act together with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager on Dec. 2.The rules will set out a list of do’s and don’ts for gatekeepers - online companies with market power - forcing them to share data with rivals and regulators and not to promote their services and products unfairly. “The Internet cannot remain a ‘Wild West’: we need clear and transparent rules, a predictable environment and balanced rights and obligations,” Breton told Pichai.“Everything that is allowed offline should be authorised online; and everything that is forbidden offline should be banned online,” he said.Breton told Pichai that he would increase the EU’s power to curb unfair behaviour by gatekeeping platforms, so that the Internet doesn’t just benefit a handful of companies but also Europe’s small- and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs.“Europe’s position is clear: everyone is welcome on our continent – as long as they respect our rules,” he told Pichai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sundar-pichai-apologises-to-eu-industry-chief-for-leaked-secret-document/story-22RGiOBfBM4KWBsgesI01K.html

He was 94.Koshiba, a distinguished professor at the University of Tokyo, died at a Tokyo hospital on Thursday, the university announced Friday. It didn’t provide a cause of death.Koshiba devised the construction of giant underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from the sun.Neutrinos offer a unique view of the sun’s inner workings because they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes the sun to shine.He shared the prize with two other scientists — the late Raymond Davis Jr. of the University of Pennsylvania, who also worked on neutrino detectors, and the late Italian-born scientist Riccardo Giacconi, who was cited for X-ray telescopes that provide sharper images of the universe.Also Read | Nobel laureate Carol Greider’s inspiring journey to success with dyslexiaKoshiba worked at the Kamiokande neutrino detector, a huge facility built in the mountains in central Japan. He confirmed and extended Davis’ work, and also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of the brightest objects in the universe.Koshiba’s contribution led to subsequent discoveries. His student, Takaaki Kajita, won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2015 for research at the Super-Kamiokande facility that found neutrinos have mass.Koshiba was active in science education for young people, and established a basic science foundation using his Nobel Prize award to provide learning experiences for high school and college students.A native of Toyohashi in central Japan, Koshiba graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1951 and studied in the United States before returning to Japan in 1958 to pursue his research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-nobel-laureate-koshiba-who-found-neutrinos-dies-at-94/story-Ezw4kJeLkviv9crujEEuQI.html
13-11-2020||World||World’s top intensive care body advises against remdesivir for sickest Covid patients||Antiviral remdesivir should not be used as a routine treatment for Covid-19 patients in critical care wards, the head of one of the world’s top bodies representing intensive care doctors said, in a blow to the drug developed by US firm Gilead.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Remdesivir, also known as Veklury, and steroid dexamethasone are the only drugs authorised to treat Covid-19 patients across the world. But the largest study on remdesivir’s efficacy, run by the World Health Organization (WHO), showed on Oct 15 it had little or no impact, contradicting previous trials.In light of the new interim data from the WHO’s Solidarity trial “remdesivir is now classified as a drug you should not use routinely in Covid-19 patients,” the President of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), Jozef Kesecioglu, said in an interview with Reuters. Kesecioglu said the recommendation would be discussed in a scientific paper on Covid therapies that ESICM is preparing with the Society of Critical Care Medicine, another intensive care body, expected to be published by January.The first version of the paper, released in March, said there was not enough information to recommend the use of remdesivir and other antivirals in critically ill Covid-19 patients.Gilead, which has questioned the WHO’s findings, said in an emailed statement: “We are confident that doctors on the front lines recognise the clinical benefit of Veklury based on robust evidence from multiple randomized, controlled studies.” ESICM represents thousands of anaesthesiologists, respiratory physicians, nurses and other critical care professionals in more than 120 countries.While doctors and hospitals are not obliged to follow its advice, its recommendation could curb the use of remdesivir. At the end of October, Gilead cut its 2020 revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand and difficulty in predicting sales of remdesivir.WIDELY USED The drug remains, however, widely used in hospitals. It is authorised or approved for use in more than 50 countries and was one of the medicines administered to US President Donald Trump when he tested positive for coronavirus in October.The European Union signed a 1-billion-euro ($1.2 billion)deal with Gilead for 500,000 courses of remdesivir at 2,070 euros each, days before the Solidarity results.The deal does not oblige European countries to buy remdesivir, but governments decided to place large orders even after the Solidarity results, with Germany buying a big stock in November, saying the drug was useful, especially early in the course of the disease.Kesecioglu said there was not enough data available about when remdesivir might be effective or for which patients, leading to the decision to discourage its routine use in intensive care. This means doctors should use remdesivir only occasionally, and not as a standard treatment for Covid-19 patients.Also Read | South Korean firm to produce 150 mln doses a year of Russian Covid-19 vaccine: RDIFBecause of remdesivir’s unclear benefits, the critical care department at the University Medical Center of Utrecht in the Netherlands, where Kesecioglu works, has not used it to treat Covid-19 patients, he said.POSSIBLE SIDE-EFFECTSTen months into the pandemic, a debate continues to rage in the medical industry about which drugs are best to treat hospitalised Covid-19 patients. Remdesivir has potential side-effects on the kidneys, according to data shared by Gilead with the European Medicines Agency, which is assessing its possible toxicity.Arnaud Hot, head of medicine at Edouard Herriot hospital in Lyon, France, told Reuters that some patients at his hospital had experienced kidney injury and so it was no longer using remdesivir, except in rare cases.Kesecioglu said convalescent plasma, which is also experimentally administered to some Covid-19 patients despite not having been approved, was also not recommended by ESICM for routine intensive care use, as its benefits were unclear.He added the potential side-effects of convalescent plasma - the liquid part of blood extracted from Covid-19 patients - were also not clearIn contrast, Kesecioglu said dexamethasone was recommended for use in hospitalised patients because there was sufficient information on its efficacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-s-top-intensive-care-body-advises-against-remdesivir-for-sickest-covid-patients/story-mKjeDLGENCdjutBfoO3EwO.html

Fifteen of the ships have been waiting since June, according to an analysis of shipping data conducted by Bloomberg. The remainder have been delayed at least four weeks.Mumbai-based Great Eastern Shipping Co.’s Jag Anand bulk carrier arrived around mid-June and has been in limbo ever since. China customs hasn’t cleared its cargo, according to a company spokesperson who asked not to be named due to internal policy. Jingtang isn’t allowing crew to get on or off the vessel, citing Covid-related protocols, and the ship’s charterer has refused to allow the vessel to sail to another port to relieve seafarers, said the spokesperson, who declined to name the charterer.China Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin acknowledged the plight of one Indian ship berthed near Hebei, telling a briefing Friday that authorities had not restricted the ship from leaving. Wang blamed the situation on the freight-forwarder’s reluctance to adjust sailing plans “due to commercial interests.”The standoff at the port, roughly 230 kilometers east of Beijing, compounds a broader threat to the shipping industry. Some 400,000 mariners are overdue to get off their boats; Covid-19 protocols at ports, cancelled flights and, increasingly, charterer mandates have made it more difficult for ship owners to arrange swaps. The crisis has exacerbated labour violations, threatening seafarers’ safety and global supply chains.Seafarers on the Indian-flagged Jag Anand are being supplied with food, water and medicine from local agents, said the Great Eastern Shipping spokesperson. China’s General Administration of Customs didn’t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment. A Jingtang port official said she wasn’t aware of the issue and declined to comment. The terminal is owned by the Tangshan Port Group Co.Under normal conditions, ships typically take a few days to berth at Jingtang, although the duration can increase to 15 to 20 days if it’s busy, according to the Great Eastern spokesperson. The northern port is one of the nation’s key gateways for metallurgical coal imports used in steel production. Nine of the cargoes originated from Hay Point in Australia, with eight from Gladstone and four cargoes from Dalrymple Islet.The political spat between Beijing and Canberra is escalating into a one-sided trade war, with China blacklisting commodities and foodstuffs from coal to lobster. Trade this year had also been snared in virus measures amid port restrictions to halt the spread of Covid-19.The ships, which mostly consist of Capesize and Panamax Dry bulk carrier vessels, typically require a crew of about 20 people. Australian coking coal for November on the Singapore Exchange traded near $104 a ton on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-australia-spat-strands-400-seafarers-as-human-crisis-looms/story-uaLvZYZvWnVnRMB3VQ4UVK.html

The other accused all tested negative.The trial will pick up where it left off with lawyers representing the victims stating their case. Thirty lawyers now need to be heard by Wednesday morning -- but the suspension has meant the timetable for the trial has been shifted back.Anti-terror prosecutors will give their summing up on Wednesday and Thursday before defence lawyers are heard until November 25. The verdict -- which initially had been awaited this week -- is now expected to be handed down on November 27.Fourteen suspects -- including three in absentia -- have been standing trial since September over the January 2015 massacre of staff at Charlie Hebdo, the killing of a policewoman and the deadly hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher market which left a total of 17 dead.To mark the start of the trial, Charlie Hebdo defiantly republished the cartoons of the prophet Mohammed that had angered Muslims worldwide. France is on its highest security alert after a spate of attacks in the last weeks blamed on Islamist radicals, including a stabbing outside its former offices, the beheading of a teacher and a killing spree inside a Nice church.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/charlie-hebdo-trial-to-resume-in-paris-after-covid-19-suspension/story-yOSUiLY70l1w0TBbHMmIaL.html
13-11-2020||World||Forgot what made them successful: Donald Trump attacks news channel, might start his own network||Fox News faces an array of challenges after President Donald Trump leaves office: a potential ratings decline, Trump’s tweets attacking the network, and the threat that he could start a rival media outlet.Yet Fox News has faced many obstacles during its 18 years as the No. 1 cable news network, and has managed to maintain its lead. It has weathered a sexual-harassment scandal, the death of founder Roger Ailes, the departure of stars Glenn Beck, Bill O’Reilly, and Megyn Kelly, and the arrival of right-leaning rivals, Newsmax and One America News Network.Few observers expect Trump’s barrage of attacks to knock Fox News off its throne anytime soon.“They have the distribution, talent and resources to be successful no matter who is president,” said Christopher Balfe, chief executive officer of Red Seat Ventures, which helps build businesses for media personalities like former HLN star Nancy Grace.Still, Fox News’s resilience could be put to the test like never before. Axios reported Thursday, citing unidentified sources, that Trump is planning a subscription-based streaming platform similar to Fox Nation, a $6-a-month service launched two years ago.Meanwhile, Trump is stepping up his attacks against the network after an election loss that he has steadfastly rejected. Fox News, like nearly all major media, has declared Joe Biden the presidential winner.On Thursday, Trump tweeted that Fox’s daytime ratings have “completely collapsed” because the network “forgot what made them successful, what got them there.” Fox News was the biggest difference between the 2016 and 2020 elections because the network forgot its “Golden Goose,” he said.Trump also amplified a series of Twitter posts from users criticizing Fox News as insufficiently loyal to the president and urging conservatives to switch to competitors such as Newsmax.Shares of Fox News’s parent company declined more than 6 per cent Thursday amid the attacks and speculation that Trump might back or launch a rival news service.Newsmax, which was founded by Trump ally Christopher Ruddy, has seen an uptick in viewers in recent days. It still hasn’t declared Biden the president-elect and has used that decision to curry favour with Trump supporters who are skeptical of the results and angry that Fox News made an early call for the Democrat in the key state of Arizona.On Thursday, Ruddy tweeted that Trump called him and “congratulated Newsmax on our ratings explosion.” Trump is “watching Newsmax,” he said, “and also wants every vote counted!”Negotiating ToolTrump’s relationship with America’s most-watched news channel has waxed and waned over the years. He was a frequent Fox News guest long before he decided to run for president, and the network’s evening commentators have been ardent supporters of him throughout his time in office. With the ties fraying, Fox would be wise to patch things up quickly, said Jon Klein, a former president of CNN’s US operations and current co-chairman of the streaming company Tapp Media LLC.“Many Fox News viewers adore President Trump,” Klein said. “If Trump undertook a concerted ongoing anti-Fox News campaign, that would have a real impact on Fox’s numbers because those Trump loyalists will do as they’re told.”Still, the real estate mogul behind a book called “The Art of the Deal” could be using his attacks against Fox as a bargaining tool, Klein said.“Everything for him is about the negotiation,” Klein said. “Once the dust settles, I’m sure he will make the best deal he can, whether it’s starting his own company or getting paid a lot of money to appear on someone’s else air.”Trump has continued to praise Fox News’s prime-time hosts, which he sees as more sympathetic to his cause. On Thursday night, he recommended a segment by commentator Sean Hannity about voting machines.Fox management remains upbeat that it can weather the latest turmoil. On an earnings call last week, CEO Lachlan Murdoch pointed out that the network has led the cable news industry through a number of administrations.“We love competition,” Murdoch said. “We have always thrived with competition, and we have strong competition now.”In response to Trump’s tweets on Thursday, Fox News said its daytime audience is up 62 per cent -- averaging 2.7 million viewers for the seven days through Wednesday -- from the same period last year, citing Nielsen data. The network also was the most-watched on election night, with an audience of 14.1 million.Other OptionsIf Trump wants to start his own media company, he could follow the path of former Fox News star Glenn Beck, relying on his large base of grassroots supporters to pay him monthly subscriptions.But while Beck was able to attract tens of thousands of subscribers to TheBlaze, former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin shut down her online TV channel only a year after its launch.Trump could create a meaningful media business with his own streaming service -- which would be less of a major threat to Fox.“I think a lot of people would sign up for a $5 or $6 a month subscription service to watch his show and support him,” Balfe said. “I don’t think it’s a Fox News channel competitor, but it could be a very successful streaming channel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forgot-what-made-them-successful-donald-trump-attacks-news-channel-might-start-his-own-network/story-pOexM2mUd4Au0B9X2cE3HP.html
13-11-2020||World||Maryam Nawaz Sharif shares struggles she faced in jail||Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz Sharif on Thursday alleged that authorities had installed cameras in her jail cell and bathroom.In a recent interview, Sharif spoke about the alleged inconveniences she had to face when she was incarcerated after being arrested in the Chaudhary Sugar Mills case last year, reported Geo News.“I have gone to jail twice and if I speak about how I, a woman, was treated in jail, they will not have the audacity to show their faces,” she said, referring to the government. In her criticism of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, the PML-N vice president said that if authorities can break into a room and arrest her in front of her father Nawaz Sharif and launch personal attacks on her, then no woman is safe in Pakistan.“A woman, whether she is in Pakistan or anywhere else, is not weak,” she said.Geo News reported that Sharif had said that her party is open to dialogue with the military establishment within the ambit of the Constitution, provided that the incumbent PTI government is removed from power.She further stated that she was not against state institutions but stressed that there would be no dialogue in secret. She also said the idea of dialogue through the platform of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) can be deliberated upon. The PML-N leader was arrested last year in the money laundering case, where she had claimed that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has arrested her by violating the law and that she was being politically victimised.In a press conference last year, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Accountability Shahzad Akbar had said that the Sharif family had used Chaudhry Sugar Mills for money-laundering and illegal transfer of its shares.More than Rs 7 million worth of shares were transferred to Maryam Nawaz in 2008 through the mill’s shares, which were later transferred to Yousaf Abbas Sharif in 2010, Akbar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maryam-nawaz-sharif-shares-struggles-she-faced-in-jail/story-6iqEuBf0LxcVnay0iBWkqL.html

According to him, he was on a “mission from god” to kill prostitutes. He was serving the sentences in the Frankland jail in County Durham.A Prison Service spokesman said: “HMP Frankland prisoner Peter Coonan (born Sutcliffe) died in hospital on November 13. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been informed.”The spate of killings led to one of the largest manhunts in British history, with the identity of the killer long remaining a mystery. The investigation was at times misled but he was finally apprehended and jailed.Richard McCann, son of Sutcliffe’s first victim Wilma McCann killed in October 1975, told BBC: “The attention he’s had over the years, the continuous news stories that we’ve suffered over the years, there is some form of conclusion to that”.“I am sure a lot of the families, surviving children of the victims may well be glad he has gone and they have a right to feel like that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yorkshire-ripper-notorious-1970s-serial-killer-dies-in-jail/story-oEFx1QcPizuTGQSrrzJqsM.html

The doses will be intended for global distribution, it said.GL Rapha has been in talks with RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev for several months this year after the sovereign fund approached it first, a spokesperson for the South Korean firm said.Dmitriev had planned to visit the company, but the plan was put off due to the pandemic, the official said. The biotech company, founded in 2007, offers fill and finish of vials and oversees the whole process of vaccine production.RDIF, which is backing the vaccine’s development and is responsible for its marketing abroad, said it had orders for more than 1.2 billion doses of Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-firm-to-produce-150-mln-doses-a-year-of-russian-covid-19-vaccine-rdif/story-FYmCGKwz2mjA7SPIXKTZGI.html

13-11-2020||World||Hope Sri Lanka will revisit policy to ban burials of Covid-19 victims: UN||The UN has expressed hope that the Sri Lankan government will revisit their policy to ban burials for the victims of the Covid-19 pandemic that has so far claimed the lives of 48 people in the island nation. In a letter to Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, UN Resident Coordinator in Colombo Hanaa Singer has reiterated concerns with the existing Sri Lankan Ministry of Health guidelines, which stipulate cremation as the only method for the disposal of bodies.Sri Lanka since the outbreak of the pandemic in March had adopted the policy of cremating the victim, citing dangers of further spreading the virus through the underground water table if allowed to be buried.The island’s Muslim minority has protested the move and has been urging the government to allow burials, claiming that cremation goes against their religious rituals for the deceased.Also Read | 66 Indian nationals tested Covid-19 positive in Sri LankaMuslim religious organisations have been making representations on the issue. The government said it has appointed a panel of health experts to advise on the issue and until such time recommendations are made to the contrary the policy of cremations would continue.Singer has said that across the world, the safe and dignified handling of those patients whose life has been tragically claimed by this virus has been an important part of the Covid-19 response.“I am following with encouragement recent media reports that the current prohibition of burials of Covid-19 victims in Sri Lanka could be revisited shortly. In this context, I wish to take the opportunity to reiterate the concerns of the United Nations with the existing Ministry of Health guidelines, which stipulate cremation as the only method for the disposal of bodies suspected of Covid-19 infection,” she said in the letter.The UN official also drew Rajapaksa’s attention to the World Health Organisation issued guidelines dated March 24, 2020 and subsequent updated interim guidance on September 4 2020 on the “Infection prevention and control for the safe management of a dead body in the context of Covid-19”.She insists that based on current knowledge of the symptoms of Covid-19 and its main modes of transmission (droplet/contact), the likelihood of transmission when handling human remains is low.“The common assumption that people who died of a communicable disease should be cremated to prevent spread is not supported by evidence. Instead, cremation is a matter of cultural choice and available resources,” she added.The WHO had outlined that people who have died from Covid-19 can therefore be buried or cremated according to local standards and family preferences, with appropriate protocols for handling the body. Sri Lanka has so far reported 15,723 cases of coronavirus and 48 deaths due to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-sri-lanka-will-revisit-policy-to-ban-burials-of-covid-19-victims-un/story-w3BxqBUU54Azfei0ah37HL.html

The two sides have made little progress.The attack on the army checkpoint follows weeks of violence, including an attack by gunmen earlier this month claimed by the Islamic State group affiliate at Kabul University that killed 22 people, mostly students.The government’s head of peace negotiations, Abdullah Abdullah, on Friday urged the Taliban to reach to understanding, finding a peaceful solution to the ongoing war. “we have offered ways but Taliban are not trying to reach to an understanding”Also Read | Al Qaeda leader dies, Afghan forces accuse Taliban of harbouring himOn Thursday, Taliban fighters attacked a government security forces checkpoint in northern Kunduz province, killing five soldiers and wounding two others, said Esmatullah Muradi, provincial governor’s spokesman.

A 45-year-old volunteer said that she suffered side effects similar to the flu jab but that her symptoms were ‘more severe’ after her second jab, according to a Daily Mail report. The report also cited another 44-year-old participant Glenn Deshields, who said the Pfizer’s vaccine shot a ‘severe hangover’. The symptoms, however, quickly cleared up, he said. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageA publicist from Missouri too had joined the study. She said she received her first shot in September and her second last month. She suffered a headache, fever and aches all over her body, comparable to the flu jab, with the first one. Following the second shot, these became ‘more severe’, she told the Daily Mail. The accounts come at a time when Pfizer announced that the Covid-19 vaccine that it was developing in collaboration with BioNTech SE prevented more than 90% of infections in a study of tens of thousands of volunteers. This puts the US company on track to apply later this month for emergency-use approval from the Food and Drug Administration.Pfizer and BioNTech’s announcement that the messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine had at least 90% efficacy among 94 confirmed cases means that at least 84 of the people who developed symptomatic Covid from over 43,000 trial volunteers had received the placebo. This includes people who got two doses of the vaccine as well as those who received a placebo shot. Protection in patients was achieved seven days after the second of two doses, and 28 days after the first, according to preliminary findings. The companies are expecting to supply 50 million vaccine doses globally by the end of this year. Up to 1.3 billion doses will be supplied in 2021.

13-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson seeks green jobs for UK as unemployment surges||Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking advice from industry on how to create green jobs in the U.K. as unemployment rose at the quickest pace in a decade.The government is gathering a green jobs taskforce that seeks to create employment for 2 million by 2030. Johnson is planning a major speech on how he will spur an industrial revolution in clean-energy technologies, part of a series of initiative leading up to global talks on climate change the U.K. will host next year.The move also is aimed at helping the U.K. economy recover from the battering delivered by coronavirus lockdowns, with the number of workers being made redundant hitting a record. With the government weighing a ban on diesel cars by 2035, it’s seeking to spur new technologies like electric vehicles and offshore wind power that can absorb workers from industries that are being wound down.“Businesses desperately need a framework to plan and there’s been a lack of certainty about the future direction of travel,” said Kate Bell, head of rights, international, social and economic at the Trades Union Congress. “There is a need to get moving quickly.”The government has once again delayed a much anticipated energy policy paper that will set a direction for how the U.K. will meet its target to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It will be key for investors who want to create jobs in technologies such as nuclear, hydrogen and carbon capture that are key to reducing pollution but too expensive to work without subsidy. Energy Minister Kwasi Kwarteng on Thursday said it will be published by December.The urgency to create more jobs is building. Despite unprecedented government support to help pay workers wages, U.K. unemployment rose the most since the financial crisis over the summer, taking the jobless rate to 4.8%.Job cuts, known as redundancies in the U.K., increased by a record 181,000 in the third quarter and look set to peak when the furlough program is withdrawn at the end of March. With the pandemic reshaping the jobs landscape, these lay offs risk becoming entrenched unemployment if workers aren’t able to find or fit the skill requirements of newly created roles.The TUC has identified 1.24 million jobs that could be created across the U.K. in two years by investing 85 billion pounds in areas such as home insulation, electric car charging, and planting trees.The new taskforce will meet for the first time on Thursday and seeks to create jobs for both now and in the long term. It will include representatives from Orsted AS, Nissan Motor Co., Tata Steel Ltd., BP Plc and the TUC.One of the biggest challenges will be to find new jobs for the people working in dirty industries. It’s a problem the U.K. faced three decades ago when then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher closed coal mines in the north of England and South Wales, leading to mass unemployment in industrial heartlands -- the effects of which are still felt today.Drax Group Plc, which runs what was once the U.K.’s biggest coal plant will cut more than 200 jobs when it closes its final coal units at the end of March. “The next generation of green jobs that will come with carbon capture and storage won’t become a reality for 3 or 4 more years,” said Will Gardiner, Drax’s chief executive officer.Research by Cambridge Econometrics, on behalf of Greenpeace, this week found a 2030 ban on petrol, diesel and hybrid cars and vans could create 32,000 new jobs by the same year and increase gross domestic product by 0.2% -- or 4.2 billion pounds.That could help more people follow in the footsteps of George Hull, an engineer who left his job building diesel engines for Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc to focus on electric cars.Now he works at the U.K. Battery Industrialization Centre -- a 130 million pound government backed project that helps to scale up new battery technologies and teach people the skills needed to work in the industry.When Hull joined JLR in 2011, the company was betting millions on the future of the internal combustion engine. But a decade later it’s ceased production of diesel and petrol cars to focus on batteries.“You could tell the end of the road is coming for internal combustion engines. I was keen to learn new skills,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-seeks-green-jobs-for-uk-as-unemployment-surges/story-FqRh5404rje3JgJ3x230rJ.html

Wijemuni said the construction site workers, all Indians, “were found coronavirus positive from random tests conducted -- the first batch of 19 was followed by another 47”. All of them are being treated at the interim treatment centre at Dharga Town, he said.The National Operations Centre for Prevention of Covid said the fish market cluster has emerged as the biggest source of the deadly viral infection in Lanka. By Friday morning, the cluster has recorded a total of 9,120 positive cases out of the nationwide tally of 15,722.Lanka has so far recorded 48 coronavirus-related deaths. When the island experienced its second wave on October 4 there was only 3,396 cases with just 13 deaths. The infected figure has jumped four times since then. The Western province, which is also the capital province, is the current area with highest infections. The province after a 10 day lockdown was re-opened early this week. However, travel restrictions continued in the province. The capital city has recorded multiple coronavirus cases since early October when the island was hit by two large clusters of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/66-indian-nationals-tested-covid-19-positive-in-sri-lanka/story-z74AU5QLkh06Di2s9Z613J.html
13-11-2020||World||Saudis say they thwarted attack on oil facility near Yemen||Saudi Arabia claimed late Thursday it thwarted an attack by Yemen’s Iran-backed rebels that sparked a fire near an Aramco oil distribution center, involving unmanned boats loaded with explosives dispatched into the Red Sea.In remarks carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, an unnamed official at the Ministry of Energy reported that Saudi security forces had intercepted and destroyed two explosives-packed boats that it said Yemen’s Houthi rebels were using to target a major refinery and terminal in the southern Saudi province of Jizan.The attempted attack took place late Wednesday near an offloading platform and caused the floating hoses that unload oil to catch fire, according to the energy official, who added that the blaze had been brought under control and caused no injuries.The official sharply condemned the attack as threatening commercial shipping routes near the vital Bab al-Mandeb strait, used for oil shipments from the Gulf to Europe, as well as goods from Asia to Europe.There was no immediate acknowledgement from Yemen’s rebels, who have repeatedly fired drones and missiles targeting oil installations, airports and cities in the Saudi mainland over the course of a grinding five-year war against a Saudi-led military coalition. In September 2019, drone attacks claimed by the Houthis struck two key oil installations in Saudi Arabia, halting about half of the supplies from the world’s largest exporter of oil. Saudi Arabia and the U.S. attributed the assault to Iran, which has denied involvement.Saudi Arabia often claims to foil Houthi cross-border attacks, but evidence is scarce, making it extremely difficult to independently verify the accounts.The Houthis, which Saudi Arabia considers to be Iranian proxies, overran Yemen’s capital and much of the north in 2014, driving the internationally recognized government into exile. The war in the Arab world’s poorest country has killed over 100,000 people, pushed millions to the brink of famine and precipitated what the U.N. calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudis-say-they-thwarted-attack-on-oil-facility-near-yemen/story-REDbAgryGYPlA423Sf5n9M.html

They arrived in a warehouse in Wuhan on August 17 and have not entered the market.“The local authorities have sealed the products, quarantined and conducted tests on relevant personnel and disinfected the area,” the Xinhua report said.It is estimated over 25 novel coronavirus cases have been detected in imported food cold chains since the first case was found in July, mostly from major frozen food exporting countries including Ecuador, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil and Norway.Tianjin, a city neighbouring Beijing and North China’s Hebei, shut down a wholesale market after finding Covid-19 on its imported cold-chain products for two consecutive days.“A Tianjin worker in the cold chain industry was confirmed to have contracted Covid-19 this week. Two Chinese cities have been involved in Tianjin’s cases as some batches of frozen goods sold in these cities were delivered from Tianjin,” a state media report said.By the end of Thursday, a total of 3,662 imported Covid-19 cases had been reported on the mainland. Among them, 3,308 had been discharged from hospitals following recovery, and 354 remained hospitalised. No deaths had been reported among imported cases.Confirmed cases on the mainland reached 86,307 by Thursday, while deaths stand at 4,634, according to the national health commission’s daily bulletin on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-halts-imports-from-indian-firm-after-frozen-seafood-packages-test-covid-19-positive/story-8gE2KkiHVCRl4pGlSCJTnI.html
13-11-2020||World||Israel’s settlement movements could test bond with Joe Biden||On a visit to Israel in 2010, Biden was caught off guard when authorities announced plans to build hundreds of new homes in the sprawling Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem. The incident embarrassed Biden and sparked a diplomatic rift with the Obama administration that never quite healed. Yet despite Biden’s opposition to the project, a decade later Ramat Shlomo has ballooned.The episode could foreshadow what lies ahead under the Biden administration — with a US president opposed to Israeli construction on occupied lands claimed by the Palestinians but seemingly limited in his ability to stop it, particularly when dealing with a changing Middle East and preoccupied by domestic priorities.The coming two months provide a key test for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the matter. The Israeli leader, a longtime supporter of the settlements, may seek to take advantage of the final days of the settlement-friendly Trump administration and push through a flurry of last-minute construction projects. But doing so could antagonize the incoming administration.Both settlement supporters and critics expect Netanyahu to proceed with caution. With the Biden administration expected to re-engage with Iran over its nuclear program, Netanyahu’s top security concern, he seems unlikely to pick a fight with the president-elect. Netanyahu’s office did not respond to a request for comment.Martin Indyk, a former US peace negotiator during the Clinton and Obama administrations, said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is no longer a “vital national interest” for Washington and that he did not expect Biden to make it a priority. Nonetheless, he said Biden still has a strong familiarity with the region.“I don’t think he’s going to want to have a fight over settlements. But if Bibi makes it an issue, then there will be a problem there,” said Indyk, using Netanyahu’s nickname.Trump has delivered a number of diplomatic gifts to Netanyahu, including the withdrawal of the US from the international nuclear deal with Iran, recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the US Embassy there. Trump recently brokered three normalization deals between Israel and Arab countries, shattering a longstanding position by Arab states that have traditionally withheld recognizing Israel until it made major concessions to the Palestinians.In a break from his Republican and Democratic predecessors, Trump also has taken a much softer line toward the settlements. Surrounded by advisers with close ties to the settler movement, Trump’s administration declared last year that it did not consider the settlements to be illegal under international law. Then, in January, he unveiled a Mideast plan that envisions placing parts of the West Bank, including all of the settlements, under permanent Israeli control.Israel this year appeared poised to begin annexing West Bank territory under the Trump plan but was dissuaded as part of the deal establishing ties with the United Arab Emirates. Nonetheless, Israel has ramped up plans to build thousands of new homes throughout the West Bank. Anti-settlement monitoring groups expect additional settlement approvals in the West Bank and east Jerusalem before the end of Trump’s term.Biden, while claiming to have “ironclad” support for Israel, has already indicated he will reverse many of Trump’s decisions. He has come out against unilateral annexation and supports a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Although he has said he will not move the embassy back to Tel Aviv, he is expected to reopen the US Consulate in Jerusalem that managed relations with the Palestinians and restore hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to the Palestinians that Trump cut off.Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi called on the incoming administration not to return to “mistakes of the past” and said the traditional US condemnations of settlement expansion would not be enough.“There must be accountability and consequences if Israel continues its settlement policies,” she said. “Otherwise, what will be the benefit of statements of condemnation if Israel continues with expansion and settlements?”The Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek all of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as parts of a future independent state. With nearly 500,000 settlers now living in the West Bank, and over 220,000 more in east Jerusalem, the Palestinians say the chances of establishing their state are quickly dwindling.Previous American administrations viewed settlements as illegitimate and obstacles to peace. President Barack Obama took an even harsher tack and repeatedly clashed with Netanyahu over new construction. Weeks before leaving office, Obama allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution declaring the settlements illegal.A nadir in those ties came at Biden’s expense with the 2010 Ramat Shlomo incident. As he held friendly meetings with Israeli officials, Israel’s Interior Ministry approved the construction of 1,600 new apartments in the neighbourhood. Netanyahu said at the time that he had been blindsided by the announcement by low-level technocrats and tried to contain the damage at a late-night dinner with Biden.Nonetheless, Biden issued a harshly worded statement, saying the approvals undermined trust.At the time, Ramat Shlomo had about 2,000 apartments, according to Ir Amim, a group that tracks settlement building in Jerusalem.Today, the area, which Israel considers a neighborhood of its capital, is undergoing a construction boom, with nearly 600 homes being built, according to Peace Now, another anti-settlement monitoring group. Ir Amim says over 700 additional apartments are in the pipeline. This week, bulldozers shoveled dirt and cranes whirred in the neighborhood’s building frenzy.Brian Reeves, a spokesman for Peace Now, said the group expects Biden to change the tone on settlements but not to put enough pressure on Israel to stop.“The US will resume its condemnations of settlements but it’s not going to take any drastic action against it, so it’s going to seem like it’s ringing hollow,” he said.Settler leaders, disappointed to be losing a friend in Trump, said they hope Biden will be different than Obama and not push for curbs on construction.“I would hope that they don’t fall back into the old approach that led us into a deadlock,” said Oded Revivi, mayor of the Efrat settlement.For now, Israel seems unlikely to make too many bold moves in the settlements if it wants to curry favor with an administration likely to renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal.“The No. 1 issue for Israel is Iran. Not the settlements, not the peace process, not the Palestinians,” said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on US-Israel relations. “Anything that could disrupt collaboration with the United States on Iran is going to be off.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-settlement-movements-could-test-bond-with-joe-biden/story-8F59JAQXr5srthkzCoxcxL.html

Happy Diwali to everyone celebrating!”The 2020 celebration organised by the ruling Liberal Party was hosted by Canada’s Minister of Public Services and Procurement Anita Anand, the first Hindu Cabinet member in the country’s history, along with MPs Raj Saini from the city of Kitchener in Ontario and Gary Anandasangaree from Scarborough in Toronto.A host of prominent Canadian politicians also joined another celebration, including the Leader of the Official Opposition in the House of Commons, Conservative Erin O’Toole, who also lit a diya.This was the 20th year of the annual event that first took place in 1998 and was started by late MP Deepak Obhrai, to bring Diwali to Parliament Hill, the seat of power in Canada. It was organised by British Columbia MP Todd Doherty in association with the Deepak Obhrai Foundation and the Canada-India Foundation.Thanking Trudeau for being “gracious” in joining the online festivity, India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria tweeted, “Diwali is now so much a Canadian festival!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-joins-virtual-celebration-of-diwali/story-YKWe1iSCyCTqPR4CiQJ3AK.html

The military was rescuing people in places where waters remained high.Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff General Gilbert Gapay said in an emergency meeting with disaster-response officials.“We’ll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,” Gapay said. He reported 39 deaths and 32 other people missing.Typhoon Vamco passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces overnight Wednesday and early Thursday, toppling power poles and trees and damaging homes.More than 350,000 people had been evacuated to safety, mainly residents fleeing vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas before the typhoon hit. Philippine National Police said more than 100,000 people had been rescued, including 41,000 in the capital region.At least 3.8 million households lost power in metropolitan Manila and outlying provinces, but crews have restored electricity in many areas and power was expected to be fully restored in about three days. Government offices were closed and classes suspended for public schools Friday.Vamco hit the Philippines on the heels of Typhoon Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, which left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed 270,000 houses. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year and also had active seismic faults and volcanoes, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/39-dead-after-typhoon-vamco-leaves-high-water-mud-in-philippines/story-mIKMYrstW9zwH3cUcZenzO.html

It has also created a new pathway to permanent residency for Hong Kongers who are in Canada and meet specific eligibility criteria like minimum language and education levels and a year of work experience in the country. This opportunity will come into effect next year.Another pathway will expedite study permits to residents of Hong Kong, and offer a “dedicated” route to permanent residency to those who complete their studies.The Canadian government is also expediting issuance of required documents to Canadians and Canadian permanent residents in Hong Kong, and to “speed up processing of permanent residence applications, including family sponsorship, which will benefit Hong Kong residents, and to encourage Hong Kong youth to study or work in Canada,” according to a release from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).Mendicino “reassured Canadians and Canadian permanent residents in Hong Kong that they can return to Canada at any time, and any documents they require will be expedited.”“We find ourselves at a challenging moment. Canada remains deeply concerned about China’s passage of the new national security law,” he said. “We have unequivocally stated that this legislation and the unilateral powers within it are in direct conflict with China’s international obligations.”Earlier, foreign affairs minister François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement, “China’s decision to remove four democratically elected lawmakers from office in Hong Kong is a further assault on Hong Kong’s high degree of freedoms under the Sino-British Joint Declaration.”Adding that he was “deeply disappointed”, he said, “This action clearly demonstrates a concerning disregard for Hong Kong’s Basic Law and the high degree of autonomy promised for Hong Kong under the ‘one country, two systems’ framework.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-give-hong-kongers-asylum-even-if-charged-under-chinese-security-law/story-8gASpqNXIgwpPlHErnsbwL.html
13-11-2020||World||Mike Pompeo refuses to acknowledge Joe Biden as president-elect, heads to Europe, Mideast||After refusing to acknowledge President Donald Trump’s loss in last week’s election, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is leaving Friday on a trip to Europe and the Middle East, to countries where leaders have all congratulated former vice president Joe Biden for his victory.The seven-nation trip is aimed at shoring up the outgoing Trump administration’s priorities, notably its anti-China and -Iran policies, and will include visits to Israeli settlements in the West Bank that have been avoided by previous secretaries of state.But the usual foreign policy issues are likely to be overshadowed by the extraordinary moment in global politics: Most of the world has accepted the results of America’s election, while the United States’ top diplomat — as well as its president and much of his Republican Party — have not.Pompeo’s trip comes days after he raised eyebrows by dismissing a reporter’s question about the presidential transition by saying “there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.” He appeared to be speaking in jest and went on to say, in a more serious tone, that the world should be assured that the State Department will be functional and successful with the president who takes office January 20. But those comments and subsequent statements in interviews with conservative media did not acknowledge that it’s Biden who will become president then.Pompeo’s weeklong tour takes him to France, Turkey, Georgia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The leaders of each of those countries have offered public congratulations to Biden.Four of those countries — France, Turkey, Georgia and Qatar — have had a fractious relationship with the Trump administration and it was not clear if Pompeo would hold public engagements with any of their leaders. Pompeo has had a notoriously frosty relationship with the press and it was also unclear if he planned to take questions from reporters.In keeping with Trump’s refusal to concede and orders for Cabinet agencies not to cooperate with the Biden transition team, the State Department has not been involved with facilitating Biden’s calls to foreign leaders, according to officials familiar with the process.Pompeo’s ardent support for Trump, who has claimed without evidence that the election was beset by fraud, threatens to hurt America’s standing in making pronouncements about other countries’ democratic shortcomings.On Thursday, Pompeo weighed in on Hong Kong’s legislature, and he has in recent weeks denounced alleged electoral problems in Belarus, Tanzania and Ivory Coast.Yet, at his news conference Tuesday, Pompeo roundly dismissed a question about whether Trump’s unfounded protests have created problems for US credibility. “You asked a question that is ridiculous,” he responded. “This department cares deeply to make sure that elections around the world are safe and secure and free and fair, and my officers risk their lives to ensure that that happens.”Biden has already spoken with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea and fielded congratulatory notes on social media and elsewhere from others.Yet, Pompeo said he would carry on as if there was no change.“I’m the secretary of state,” he said. “I’m getting calls from all across the world. These people are watching our election. They understand that we have a legal process. They understand that this takes time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-refuses-to-acknowledge-joe-biden-as-president-elect-heads-to-europe-mideast/story-KZZ63BwzFpx6DQj7bQgp9L.html

The Shan, whose homeland is in eastern Myanmar, are the country’s largest ethnic minority.An unofficial count by Yway Mal, an independent vote counting service, gave the NLD 397 seats and the USDP 28, with 44 going to other parties.Majority control of Parliament does not give the NLD full control of government. The army-drafted constitution of 2008 grants the military 25% of the total seats, enough to block constitutional changes. Several key ministerial positions are also reserved for military appointees.Also Read | Myanmar’s opposition party demands re-election as Aung San Suu Kyi heads for victoryThe USDP has called the election unfair and refused to accept the election results, but the election commission rejected its claim and its demand for a fresh vote.Independent rights groups have criticized the disenfranchisement of the Muslim Rohingya ethnic minority and cancellation of the vote in certain areas. The Union Election Commission cited the dangers of ongoing combat between government forces and ethnic minority guerrillas, but critics suggested certain areas were singled out for cancellation because they were certain to elect lawmakers from parties hostile to the current government.One of the guerrilla groups, the Arakan Army, said Thursday it would extend a unilateral ceasefire to Dec 31 to allow by-elections to be held in areas of Rakhine province where voting had been cancelled. It urged Myanmar’s army and government to halt military actions and declare a ceasefire encompassing the whole country so voting could take place. The government has not done so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suu-kyi-s-party-to-come-in-power-after-myanmar-s-official-vote-control/story-iq8CPxgpFKiT8qkHbOjcdJ.html
13-11-2020||World||Australian PM Scott Morrison’s Diwali message has special significance this year||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has extended Diwali greetings and said the festival’s message carries “a special significance” this year as the world is responding to the coronavirus pandemic.“Most years, we often think of this dispelling of darkness as a theoretical concept rather than something that is experienced and overcome. This year, Diwali’s message has a special significance,” Morrison said in a video message released recently.“Every nation on earth is responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. Lives and livelihoods have been lost as we have witnessed the most dramatic shock in generations. Despite this, we have a common hope. Throughout 2020, despite our own fears, we have supported each other, encouraged each other, and stood with each other.“We have drawn strength and inspiration from our medical professionals, teachers, cleaners, retail staff, police and defence force personnel and so many more who have responded to the crisis with compassion and professionalism,” he said.He said Australia is the most successful multi-cultural nation on earth and “at this Diwali, I pay tribute to all those who have brought this tradition to our shores.” “Yes, we have seen darkness this year, but the light is overcoming that darkness. There is light ahead, and there is hope. Warmest greetings to everyone celebrating Diwali, the festival of lights. It’s a special moment for people of many faiths,” Morrison said in his message.Other politicians who extended their greetings include Opposition leader Anthony Albanese who said he hoped next year people will be able to celebrate the festival of lights together.“I wish all of you a wonderful Diwali festival. As a celebration of the victory of light over darkness, it is a most welcome and timely antidote to the uncertainty that surrounds us,” Albanese said, adding “we have all had to adapt to the realities of the coronavirus pandemic, yet even amid all this upheaval, Diwali will stand tall as a striking expression of your tradition and your spirituality, your devotion and your faith.” Albanese said, “I sympathise with those who aren’t able to return to their ancestral homes, and to those unable to celebrate with their families this year.” Australia is home to over 7,00,000 Indian-origin people, while Indian migrants are the top source of new Australian citizens with over 28,000 Indian nationals becoming Australian citizens last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-scott-morrison-s-diwali-message-has-special-significance-this-year/story-sDERJu1qUZ9vJwA1bbFogJ.html

Smooth transportation of goods at border ports will be facilitated with sufficient containment measures in place,” the Chinese statement added.Beijing is ready to step up cooperation with the other four parties in testing, diagnostics, treatment, and medicine, and continue to provide them with assistance of containment supplies, the statement said.“In a spirit of mutual trust, openness and win-win cooperation, the five parties welcome other regional countries to join the cooperation against Covid-19 and are ready to engage in dialogue and communication with them,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-holds-meet-with-pak-sri-lanka-nepal-bangladesh-to-jointly-fight-covid/story-eda039n0VNOYMhQELCXIyN.html

It means that this vaccine will potentially be available, subject to the results of those trials, for delivery to Australians early in the third quarter of 2021,” he said.“Our national goal is to ensure that all Australians who seek to be vaccinated are vaccinated by the end of 2021,” he added.CSL Limited has signed a deal to supply the Australian government with 51 million doses of the vaccine once it’s proved to be effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queensland-university-s-potential-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-ready-in-2021-australian-health-minister/story-kJ9T9ej2gcj2nv0IUbot4O.html

But the Democrat was getting growing recognition from Republicans who are demanding equal access for him to classified briefings as the president, which has been blocked by Trump along with other practices routinely associated with transition from one administration to another.“The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history,” said a joint statement by a top official of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with other officials. “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”They added: “While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too.”CISA is part of the sprawling Department of Homeland Security created in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. It joined a small but growing pushback from senior officials to the president’s efforts to use his powers to subvert the established practice of a smooth transfer of power.A top official of the department of justice’s election crimes wing quit last week in protest against Attorney General William Barr’s nod to federal investigators around the country to seek and prosecute “substantial allegations” of election fraud in support of Trump’s claims.Even as the American president has used these wild claims to refuse to acknowledge defeat, he is reported to have expressed growing interest in recent days in running again in 2024, arguing this election was stolen from him. But he is also mulling a digital TV channel to take on Fox, according to other reports.The Trump family, meanwhile, appears divided on the way forward. The president’s adult sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump are reported to be pushing their father to not give up, but his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, both advisers to the president, are seeking an early closure with an eye on their own future.

The seat will become vacant after she is sworn in as the vice president in January. Under California law, the vacancy would be filled up by Governor Gavin Newsom for the remaining two-year term of the Senate seat. State media is reporting various names, including that of Khanna, that are being considered by Newsom to fill up the vacancy. Among the potential contenders are California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, whose election to Senate will make him the first Latino senator from the State; Congresswoman Karen Bass, who was on vice presidential short-list for President-elect Joe Biden; Congresswoman Barbara Lee; Congressman Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee; Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia; State Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins of San Diego; Treasurer Fiona Ma; and State Controller Betty Yee. “I am honoured that my name is in the mix. But I also represent a very powerful constituency....Silicon Valley. So, we’ll see where things go. I am open to whatever opportunity...where I can be most effective,” Khanna told PTI when asked about news reports. According to a recent poll by University of Southern California, 14 per cent want a Latino as the next Senator. But 29 per cent of those interviewed want someone having experience in Washington. As per the poll, 11 per cent of the respondents preferred Barbara Lee and eight per cent picked Ro Khanna. “I think there are a lot of great people out there, but what I hope is that the governor picks someone clearly with a progressive views,” Khanna told ABC News. Khanna was co-chair of the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders. On Thursday, IMPACT, a leading Indian-American advocacy and political action committee, endorsed Khanna to fill the seat to be vacated by Harris. “IMPACT urges Governor Newsom to consider Representative Ro Khanna. He has the essential qualities to meet this moment: At a time when we are deeply divided, Ro has demonstrated an ability to bring together progressives, moderates, and even some Republicans,” Impact executive director Neil Makhija said. “As an Indian American, Ro also represents the fastest growing community in California. As millions of Black and Brown children around the country see the promise of America in the new Vice President-elect, her replacement should offer the same hope and representation for Californians,” Makhija said.

Equitable access is in the national interest of each and every country. Vaccine nationalism will prolong the pandemic, not shorten it; making vaccine work requires a broad collaboration, not just across sectors, but across partners. No country can address these challenges alone,” Tedros added.To ensure equitable distribution of equipment and materials necessary to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, the WHO, European Commission, France and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation launched the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator in late April.However, despite these efforts, the pandemic is still disproportionately affecting low-income countries as they lack access to vital equipment, including ventilators and protective equipment, and need more health care workers.

That means the program identified about one case per 85,000 travellers screened,” CNN reported the CDC as saying.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe reasons for the failure of this style of screening were -- coronavirus has a number of nonspecific symptoms common to other infections, high number of asymptomatic cases, travellers may deny symptoms or take steps to avoid detection and passenger data was limited.Quoting the CDC report, CNN said that travellers and their local communities would be better protected if there was “more efficient” collection of contact information for international air passengers before they arrive and real-time data that could be sent to US health departments.According to the latest data by Johns Hopkins University, the United States has reported 10,523,260 cases of coronavirus and 242,577 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/screening-travellers-at-airports-for-covid-19-symptoms-ineffective-report/story-uJgq3yNP2oFIA4t7FZ6P4O.html
13-11-2020||World||Donald Trump bans investments in firms controlled by China military||Donald Trump signed an order prohibiting US investments in Chinese firms determined to be owned or controlled by the country’s military, the latest bid by the White House to pressure Beijing over what the president has described as abusive business practices.China is “increasingly exploiting” US capital for “the development and modernization of its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses,” posing a threat to the US, according to the executive order, signed on Thursday.Also Read: US warns of more China sanctions over Hong Kong movesRelations between the US and China have deteriorated following the signing of a trade deal early in the year. Trump also has repeatedly vowed to punish Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic, its treatment of Muslim minorities and the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have threatened to retaliate with their own blacklist of US companies.Shares of top Chinese firms -- including China Mobile Ltd and China Telecom Corp Ltd. -- tumbled Friday on reports of the impending decision. The executive order will prohibit US investment firms and pension funds from buying and selling shares of 20 Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon as having military ties in June, as well as an additional 11 companies added in late August.China Mobile, whose controlling shareholder China Mobile Communications Group is on the list, dropped 5.8% in Hong Kong opening, the biggest intraday loss in almost eight months. China Telecom slumped 4.8%.The prohibition will go into effect on Jan. 11, and allows US investment firms and pension funds to divest their holdings in companies linked to the Chinese military over the next year. If the US determines additional companies have military ties in the future, American investors will be given 60 days from that determination to divest.US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said in a statement that many of the companies at issue are traded on exchanges around the world. American investors can unknowingly provide funds through passive investments such as mutual funds and retirement plans, he added.The order “serves to protect American investors from unintentionally providing capital that goes to enhancing the capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army and People’s Republic of China intelligence services,” O’Brien said.In a move earlier this year to restrict the flow of money, the administration sent a letter to Michael Kennedy, then chairman of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, telling him to “halt all steps” associated with putting government employees’ savings in a fund that includes stakes in Chinese companies.Also Read: China’s military lays out technology roadmap to catch up with US by 2027: ReportSeparately, O’Brien on Wednesday said China’s latest clampdown in Hong Kong shows that the one country, two systems arrangement for the territory amounts to a “fig leaf” for dictatorship, and warned of new sanctions.The warning came after China’s top legislative body on Wednesday passed a resolution allowing for the disqualification of any Hong Kong lawmakers who were not deemed sufficiently loyal. Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s government immediately banished four legislators, prompting the remaining 15 in the 70-seat Legislative Council to resign en masse hours later at a joint press briefing.While the US has imposed sanctions against Lam and some officials in Beijing, it has so far held off punishing the country’s senior hierarchy. Such a move would infuriate Beijing and accelerate a deterioration in relations between the two nations on a variety of issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-bans-investments-in-firms-controlled-by-china-military/story-sQSjA6SARPqLGS9EM7RY8N.html
13-11-2020||World||Japan has worst day of Covid-19 cases yet amid fears of winter wave||Japan hit a new daily record of coronavirus infections Thursday as authorities began hinting they may take stronger measures to arrest the increase.A total of 1,661 cases were recorded nationwide, according to a tally by national broadcaster NHK, topping the previous high set during a surge in August. While numbers are low in absolute terms compared to many other countries, a spike in northern Japan is leading to concerns cases could spread as winter sets in.Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister overseeing the country’s coronavirus response, said more stringent steps would be needed if infections continued to rise. That’s the strongest warning yet from the national government in a country that has largely escaped the worst of the pandemic.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“If it continues like this, the medical system could become overstretched,” Nishimura said at a briefing in Tokyo. “It’s not at the point where we need to call for a state of emergency, but we need to have the strongest sense of caution.”Nishimura said that in some regions, several criteria used to evaluate the situation -- such as the pace of new infections and the proportion of cases with an unknown route of infection -- had entered the second-most serious stage on the government’s monitoring scale.Crisis ManagementThe government is considering forming a new post that would coordinate its crisis management of the pandemic, NHK also reported.Speaking Friday, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he had ordered the government to be on the highest alert in its virus response, but said another state of emergency, or the halting of a popular domestic travel campaign, were not something that experts said were needed now.The northern island of Hokkaido and Kanagawa, near Tokyo, were among regions that saw record numbers of new cases. The Hokkaido government has already asked bars and other establishments to close early in the regional capital’s nightlife district. Tokyo saw 393 infections, one of the heaviest days to date.“This could be the beginning of a sharp increase in infections,” said Norio Ohmagari, an infectious disease specialist advising Tokyo authorities, at a local government meeting. “We need to be on alert.”Japan has drawn attention from other nations for its ability to control the spread of the virus without mass-testing or enforced lockdowns. Despite two previous flareups, deaths and serious cases remain low, and hospitals haven’t been pushed to capacity. Life had been returning to normal, with sporting matches resuming and workers returning to offices.But in recent weeks, officials have expressed concern over the increasing variance of infection clusters, with cases rising in nursing homes, hospitals and schools. Experts have pointed to an increased spread among younger adults tired of social distancing, as well as within foreign communities, which may struggle due to language barriers and more limited access to health services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-has-worst-day-of-covid-19-cases-yet-amid-fears-of-winter-wave/story-sM4pBEDhpiiNOs0qEgfo6J.html
13-11-2020||World||Donald Trump, stewing over election loss, silent as Covid-19 surges||President Donald Trump has publicly disengaged from the battle against the coronavirus at a moment when the disease is tearing across the United States at an alarming pace.Trump, fresh off his reelection loss to President-elect Joe Biden, remains angry that an announcement about progress in developing a vaccine for the disease came after Election Day. And aides say the president has shown little interest in the growing crisis even as new confirmed cases are skyrocketing and hospital intensive care units in parts of the country are nearing capacity.Public health experts worry that Trump’s refusal to take aggressive action on the pandemic or to coordinate with the Biden team during the final two months of his presidency will only worsen the effects of the virus and hinder the nation’s ability to swiftly distribute a vaccine next year.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe White House coronavirus task force held its first post-election meeting Monday. Officials discussed the rising case numbers and the promise of a vaccine in development by Pfizer, and they recognized the service of Navy Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, a member of the task force who retired Monday.But Trump, who does not take part in the task force meetings, remains preoccupied with last week’s election results. He has yet to weigh in on the recent spike in virus cases that has state and local officials scrambling and hospitals concerned about their ability to treat those stricken.With more than 100,000 new confirmed US cases reported daily for more than a week, Trump has been more focused on tracking the rollout of a vaccine, which won’t be widely available for months. He has fumed that Pfizer intentionally withheld an announcement about progress on its vaccine trial until after Election Day, according to a White House official who was not authorized to publicly comment and spoke on condition of anonymity. Pfizer said it did not purposely withhold trial results.Although the president has consistently played down the pandemic, which has killed more than 240,000 Americans and infected more than 10 million people in the US, public health experts expressed worry about Trump’s silence on the troubling spike in cases, as well as his refusal to begin coordination on virus issues with Biden’s transition team.“It’s a big problem,” said Dr. Abraar Karan, a global health specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “The transition is not going to happen until January, and we are in a complete crisis right now. We already know where this is headed. ... It’s not good enough to say we’re going to wait until the next president to address this.”The president’s silence comes as numerous White House and campaign officials have tested positive for the virus in recent days.White House chief of staff Mark Meadows tested positive last week after attending an election night party at the White House. Others at the party also have tested positive, including White House political director Brian Jack, former White House aide Healy Baumgardner and Trump campaign advisers David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski said Thursday that he believes he contracted the virus in Philadelphia while assisting the president’s election challenge there.Meanwhile, state and local officials around the country are scrambling in the midst of mounting caseloads. While Trump stays silent, they are urging their residents to step up mask wearing and social distancing, as they brace for what many epidemiologists worry is the beginning of a tumultuous period.In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has issued an order starting Friday for bars, restaurants and gyms to be closed by 10 p.m., and has set a cap of 10 people for private gatherings. In Illinois, public health officials asked employers to allow their personnel to work from home when possible and urged residents to stay at home as much as possible and skip nonessential travel.In Iowa, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who resisted coronavirus restrictions, announced earlier this week that masks will now be required at indoor events of more than 25 people, and she banned outside events of 100 or more people unless all attendees wear masks.Trump hasn’t answered questions since before Election Day. That hasn’t slowed his Twitter habit, but he’s used it almost exclusively in recent days to rage over the election results and spread unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud.By late Thursday afternoon, Trump had tweeted or retweeted more than three dozen times that day. Just one was related to the virus — a retweet of a posting by Sen. David Perdue about Georgia receiving 2,000 vials of a new antibody treatment.White House officials declined to comment Thursday on when Trump last engaged with members of the coronavirus task force but insisted he remains focused on the pandemic“The president is regularly briefed about the coronavirus,” said White House spokesperson Sarah Matthews. “The relevant information is brought to him on the big decisions, and then he moves forward in the way that’s best for our country.”In the closing days of the campaign, Trump sought to reassure Americans that the country was “rounding the corner” on the virus, and he wrongly predicted that Democrats’ focus on the disease would go away right after the election. The president pushed a sunny public tone even after he tested positive for the virus in early October and was hospitalized for three days after contracting the virus. His wife, Melania, and teenage son, Barron, also contracted the virus.Biden, for his part, largely framed the election as a referendum on Trump’s handling of the pandemic. He has made addressing the virus his top priority as he moves forward with his transition. He spoke by phone Thursday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about the intensifying pandemic and prospects for passage of a Covid-19 relief bill in the lame duck session of Congress.Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris met virtually with his new coronavirus advisers this week, and Biden delivered remarks warning Americans that ’’the challenge before us right now is still immense and growing.”“We could save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democratic or Republican lives, American lives,” Biden said in a speech this week. “Please, I implore you, wear a mask.”Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University’s law school, said Biden will only be able to “scratch the surface” of tackling a pandemic that could be a “raging forest fire” by the time he takes office on Jan. 20.He added that even the good news on Pfizer’s development of a vaccine that showed 90% efficacy in early trial results could be diminished if Trump doesn’t begin coordination efforts with Biden’s team on how to roll out the vaccine. Some public health experts believe the task of persuading Americans to take the vaccine and widely distributing it could be as complicated as the vaccine’s development.“I fear the next three months ahead could be the worst we’ve faced during the pandemic,” Gostin said. “America is like a ship at storm, and the captain has decided to go play golf.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-stewing-over-election-loss-silent-as-covid-19-surges/story-u3VpTOE3jQ4feIUbMbr48K.html
13-11-2020||World||3 dead, 2 missing from flooding at North Carolina campsite||Three people are dead and two more, including a child, are missing after floodwaters from a nearby river overtook recreational vehicles at a North Carolina campsite Thursday, an official said. In addition to the three deaths at the Hiddenite Family Campground in Alexander County, a motorist was killed in the county while travelling on a road which was washed out by rising water, said Doug Gillespie, county director of public services. “Just massive amounts of flooding,” Gillespie said. “We’ve had approximately 50 roads across the county (which) have been compromised. Four bridges have been washed away.” According to Gillespie, the floodwaters either covered or swept away the recreational vehicles at the campground, which is next to the South Yadkin River and is home for many of the people caught in the flood. “It was a massive amount of water. Now, there’s a massive amount of debris,” he said, Swift water rescue personnel and local fire departments saved 31 people from their vehicles, some of them hanging onto their campers, according to Gillespie. He said three people were taken to the hospital for treatment, and two have been released. Of the two people still missing, one of them was a child approximately 1 year old, Gillespie said. Fixing the roads and bridges will take time, he said. “This is not going to be a two-day fix, a two-week fix,” Gillespie said. “It will be a months-to-a-year fix.” The campground is approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Charlotte, where a portion of Interstate 85 was closed because of flooding, and city officials said emergency personnel were performing water rescues. The University of North Carolina at Charlotte told students not already on campus to stay away because of widespread flooding. To the east, some school systems dismissed classes ahead of schedule because of the rain. Duke Energy said approximately 3,100 customers were without electricity across North Carolina as of Thursday afternoon. National Weather Service meteorologist Nick Tatro said the rain was the result of a band of tropical moisture moving up ahead of Tropical Storm Eta in the southeast and interacting with a cold front moving across the Carolinas. The cold front passage was going to occur regardless of Eta, but the flow around the tropical storm helped move the moisture northward toward the Carolinas. Forecasters said North Carolina could expect between 2 and 5 inches (5 and 12 centimeters) of rain, with heavier amounts locally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-dead-2-missing-from-flooding-at-north-carolina-campsite/story-YUzSjlpRjknJlLL9BiOPFI.html
13-11-2020||World||UK Prime Minister’s top aide Dominic Cummings quits, will leave by year-end||Dominic Cummings quit as Boris Johnson’s most powerful aide and will leave by the end of the year, a person familiar with the matter said.The news will plunge the prime minister’s leadership into crisis at a critical time for the UK as it navigates the closing stages of Brexit. Cummings earlier told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg that his position “hasn’t changed” since he wrote in January that he wanted to be “largely redundant” within a year.He is the second key adviser to Johnson to go in the space of a day, after tensions blew up over the way the prime minister’s inner circle operates. Late on Wednesday, Communications Director Lee Cain announced he was standing down.Brexit MastermindCummings has been at the premier’s side since he took power in July 2019, and was the mastermind of the successful Brexit referendum campaign that catapulted Johnson into the front rank of British politics three years earlier. His departure will deprive the premier of his most important adviser and strategist, who has wielded huge influence over all aspects of government policy, from its pandemic response to Brexit and economic reform.Johnson’s Senior Aide Resigns Amid Tensions in UK GovernmentCain and Cummings were the two closest aides to Johnson in his political team and he will feel their absence. It’s a critical time for the UK: with the country in a second national lockdown and the pandemic death rate rising again, Johnson has just a few days left to finalize a Brexit trade deal with the European Union before it’s too late.With Cain already gone, Cummings’s departure at year end will dovetail with the U.K.’s departure from its post-Brexit transition arrangements.Divisive FigureHis presence alongside Johnson at the top of government has always been controversial. In the first turbulent months of Johnson’s premiership in 2019, Cummings waged a campaign against anti-Brexit sympathizers inside the governing Conservative Party, forcing some rebels out for good and ripping up political conventions.Then Cummings helped steer the prime minister toward a historic election victory last December, winning the biggest Tory majority in more than 30 years on his platform to “level up” economically neglected regions of the U.K.But when the pandemic hit at the start of the year, the Cummings project ran into a wall. All government focus was turned to combating coronavirus and Cummings himself inevitably became part of the story.In May Johnson put his own authority on the line to defend Cummings, who was accused of breaking lockdown rules by driving more than 250 miles to seek childcare help when the public were being ordered to stay at home.The premier was so determined to keep Cummings that he appeared in public at press conferences and in parliament to answer questions and repeatedly defend his adviser’s actions.CainCain announced he was standing down as Johnson’s director of communications in a statement on Wednesday evening. “It was an honor to be asked to serve as the prime minister’s chief of staff,” Cain said, following reports that he had been lined up for the role by Johnson.It is not clear why Cain did not take up the role of chief of staff. According to one version of events, Cain and Cummings lobbied the prime minister to make Cain chief of staff. But Johnson was unhappy that the appointment was made public in Wednesday’s newspapers before he had reached a final decision, people familiar with the matter said.It remain unclear throughout Thursday if Cummings would follow Cain out the door. The answer came, in staggered fashion, late on Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-prime-minister-s-top-aide-dominic-cummings-quits-will-leave-by-year-end/story-YATvHlhRWeE5zNxwunS3QP.html
13-11-2020||World||China under pressure to reveal Covid-19 vaccine data after Pfizer success||Western politicians have faulted China for initial delays in providing information as the coronavirus spread around the world. Now as Beijing develops a vaccine, the need for transparency is proving essential to win back trust.American drugmaker Pfizer Inc. and German biotechnology firm BioNTech SE announced this week that its vaccine appears more than 90% effective in stopping Covid-19 infections. The preliminary finding spurred a global stock rally and put the companies at the head of the pack in the race for the vaccine.At around the same time, China saw the final-stage trial of one of its top vaccine candidates halted in Brazil due to a serious adverse event. While Brazil reversed its decision in less than 48 hours, the episode underscored the fraught geopolitical tensions around vaccine development: Last month President Jair Bolsonaro said China lacks credibility and people wouldn’t feel safe with the shot “due to its origin.”Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“As China continues to push its own vaccines through the final stage of clinical trial in the midst of Pfizer’s announcement, the need for Beijing to address public perception about its vaccine safety issues is more pressing now than ever,” said Xiaoqing Lu Boynton, a consultant at Albright Stonebridge Group who focuses on health care and life sciences.For China, the stakes in developing a successful vaccine are high after a year that saw the outbreak in Wuhan further roil relations with the US, Europe, India and Australia. While Beijing quickly got the virus under control and sought to distribute aid to other countries, complaints followed about faulty materials and strings attached.The race to develop a vaccine has since become a way for China to show the world its technological superiority as the Trump administration urges countries around the globe to avoid Chinese companies for 5G networks, computer chips and big infrastructure projects. Distributing it widely would also help China regain some lost soft power: President Xi Jinping has promised that vaccines developed by China will be a global “public good,” and he joined a World Health Organization-backed effort to inoculate everyone against Covid-19.‘China Public Good’The “problem for me is global public good or China public good -- it’s two different notions,” said Nicolas Chapuis, the European Union’s ambassador to China. While he praised China’s decision to join the WHO-backed vaccine program, he said many questions remain on distribution, price and international certification.“To be certified samples have to be given,” he said. “Samples have not been given.”China has promised to prioritize providing doses for more than 60 countries, including governments that have received infrastructure loans under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative. Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Morocco have formal agreements with China’s major vaccine manufacturers, and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have been promised a $1 billion loan to purchase doses from them.Still, China’s setback in Brazil combined with Pfizer’s breakthrough “puts China’s vaccine diplomacy in jeopardy,” said Yongwook Ryu, assistant professor of East Asian international relations at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.‘Lack of Transparency’“The issue is the lack of transparency,” Ryu said. “So the right thing for the Chinese government to do is to make its trial results and related information public, so that experts can scrutinize them.”China has already administered the vaccine, including the one from Sinovac Biotech Ltd. whose trial was just paused in Brazil, to hundreds of thousands of people under an expansive emergency use program. But none of the Chinese frontrunners have published any preliminary data from Phase 3 trials as Pfizer has done. Brazil’s health regulator is sending a mission to China this month to inspect facilities of some companies involved in vaccine production.Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have hailed the progress of the country’s vaccines over the past week and said safety was of paramount importance. Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui said China was “at a rather front position in the world,” while spokesman Wang Wenbin said Thursday the country’s vaccine program “has been commended by many countries.”Deep-Freeze Hurdle Makes Pfizer’s Vaccine One for the RichChinese companies could still emerge as leaders in vaccine distribution: The inactivated vaccines would be easier to distribute in poorer countries than the double-shot from Pfizer, which requires costly deep-freeze production, storage and transportation networks. The setback in Brazil might actually reinforce the notion that China is serious about the safety of its vaccine, according to Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.“It’s still too early to say that the U.S. has won the race,” he said.For the moment, however, governments across Asia are getting in touch with Pfizer to secure the vaccine and learn from the company. Pfizer’s results “have given hope” for many research programs that use similar technology, Nakorn Premsri, director of Thailand’s National Vaccine Institute, said in a briefing on Tuesday.‘Tall Order’Even China is jumping on board. Its drug regulator accepted an application from domestic drugmaker Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. to conduct a bridge trial that would pave the way for the Pfizer vaccine to be approved in China. Fosun said it could spend tens of million yuan to build cold-chain logistics needed to store and supply the shot in China.With vaccine nationalism set to rise, it’s all the more important for Chinese companies to publish all their data and have it subjected to peer review, said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor in public health at the City University of Hong Kong.“If the world is going to trust a Chinese vaccine, then the information will have to be transparent,” he said.Yet even then, it still may be hard to get China’s adversaries to accept the vaccine. In India, where vaccine distribution to more than a billion people will prove a challenge no matter where it comes from, public anger with China is the highest in recent memory following a deadly border standoff that has dragged on for months.“Cooperation will be difficult given current levels of trust,” said Biren Nanda, a former Indian ambassador who spent a decade in China. “When not only India but even other nations can’t seem to trust China with their work on our telecom systems and electronics, it would be a tall order to expect trust in a Chinese vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-under-pressure-to-reveal-covid-19-vaccine-data-after-pfizer-success/story-4mga4HNrPUIZrPDNagVPwN.html
13-11-2020||World||Post-election rancor clouds chances for Covid-19 relief bill||President-elect Joe Biden’s top allies on Capitol Hill adopted a combative posture on Covid-19 relief on Thursday, pressing their case for a $2 trillion bill that’s a nonstarter for Republicans and faulting the GOP for dragging its feet on acknowledging Biden’s victory.The message from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. — both of whom witnessed disappointing outcomes in House and Senate races last week — was that Republicans should concede Biden won and immediately return to negotiations on Covid relief, with the Democrats’ $2.4 trillion “HEROES Act” as the starting point.“It’s most unfortunate that the Republicans have decided that they will not respect the will of the people,” Pelosi told reporters. “It’s like the house is burning down, and they just refuse to throw water on it.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., reiterated that Republicans controlling the Senate simply won’t accept a bill of the size that Schumer and Pelosi want.“That’s not a place I think we’re willing to go. But I do think there needs to another package. Hopefully, we can get past the impasse we’ve had now for four or five months and get serious about doing something that’s appropriate,” McConnell told reporters.Top House Republican Kevin McCarthy of California, speaking just minutes later from the same podium, accused Pelosi of playing politics with Covid, deliberately dragging out pre-election talks on new relief to deny President Donald Trump a victory that could have helped him in the election. Trump hasn’t talked or tweeted much about Covid since the election, and has instead focused on grievances about the results.The continued battling comes as caseloads are spiking across the country in a third wave of the pandemic that is threatening a dangerous winter, despite advances in vaccine development and treatments to fight it the disease. The rebound of the economy has been relatively strong so far, but both sides agree more help is needed — even as they spar over specifics like jobless assistance and the means to distribute treatments and vaccines.“We need another COVID relief bill,” said moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. “We need another round of the (paycheck protection) program that’s aimed at the most distressed businesses or otherwise they will not be able to keep employing their workers and they will close their doors forever. We need more funding for schools, for health care providers, for the airlines and bus lines.”Congress virtually unanimously passed a $1.8 trillion Covid rescue bill in March, but top leaders and the administration have fought for months over what another installment of relief should entail. Before the election, with Democrats riding high in the polls, Pelosi took a hard line in the talks, even as the administration made numerous concessions. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, shied away from concessions made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as well.“She sacrificed our economy and people who were hurting,” McCarthy said.The combative postures all around don’t appear to bode well for a quick resolution or the smooth resumption of the serious talks that flamed out before Election Day. Capitol Hill is in limbo, frozen by the refusal of Trump and Republicans like McCarthy to accept Biden’s victory and by two Senate runoff elections in Georgia that Republicans are favored to win to maintain control of the chamber.Pelosi and Schumer, meanwhile, continue to press Covid relief proposals like more than $400 billion in aid to state and local governments that McConnell won’t go for.The two later released a “readout” of a call with Biden, setting benchmarks for a lame-duck relief deal that “provides resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, relief for working families and small businesses, support for state and local governments trying to keep frontline workers on the payroll, expanded unemployment insurance, and affordable health care for millions of families.”It appears, however, that Democratic leverage has eroded despite Biden’s win.“What Joe Biden got in this election was a mandate, a mandate to address the challenges that our country faces,” Pelosi said. “And in order to do that, we must address the COVID, the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/post-election-rancor-clouds-chances-for-covid-19-relief-bill/story-2B6Y0FvxslW4ITwkFmRUoL.html
13-11-2020||World||TikTok gets reprieve on Donald Trump’s demand for a ban on the app||The Trump administration pulled back from its threat to ban the viral video-sharing app TikTok in the US, as the dispute winds its way through the court system and a proposed sale hangs in limbo.For months, the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., has faced the prospect of a US ban starting Thursday. But judges have blocked those prohibitions from going into effect. The Commerce Department said on Thursday that it would comply with those court rulings for the time being, even as the government appeals.The TikTok prohibition “HAS BEEN ENJOINED, and WILL NOT GO INTO EFFECT, pending further legal developments,” the Commerce Department said in a document published in the federal register.Separately, ByteDance has challenged an order from the Treasury Department to sell TikTok or face unspecified penalties. The US Court of Appeals in Washington on Thursday gave ByteDance and the Trump administration Dec. 14 and Dec. 28 deadlines to file documents in the case.When it filed the petition Tuesday, TikTok said the government had not responded to its latest efforts to strike a compromise and prevent an enforced sale. It’s not clear if anything has developed since to extend the deadline, but the court order didn’t allude to any new arrangement.ByteDance had sought US approval for a deal to sell a stake in the app to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. before the Nov. 12 deadline. But the agreement appears to be in limbo. Before filing its petition in Washington this week, ByteDance requested a 30-day extension from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or Cfius, that is overseen by the Treasury Department, to keep working toward a solution. That request went unanswered, according to court papers.Lawyers for TikTok and officials at the Treasury Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.Trump has made the fight over TikTok a central front in his broader efforts to crack down on the influence of China’s technology industry in the US Trump first ordered a TikTok sale in August, and threatened to ban the app if ByteDance couldn’t reach an agreement with an American company.He hasn’t said anything about TikTok since the election, having focused on trying to discredit the results that show he lost. But on Thursday Trump issued an executive order prohibiting US investments in Chinese firms determined to be owned or controlled by the country’s military.In September, a judge in Washington blocked a portion of the ban that would have prevented new downloads of the app. And on Oct. 30, a Pennsylvania judge issued a temporary injunction on rules that would have prevented third-party companies from providing online infrastructure that allows TikTok to function smoothly. The US appealed the Washington ruling in October, and said on Thursday it would appeal the Pennsylvania ruling.The status of the Cifius process for a sale is less clear. If the government reaches an accord with the company, it could exercise discretion around enforcement timing, said Aimen Mir, a partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and a former deputy assistant secretary for investment security at Treasury, where he ran reviews for Cifius.“Usually when there is extended silence from Cfius, it suggests there’s no clear consensus within government on what the next step would be, but this has been an atypical case for awhile,” Mir said.If an extension hasn’t already been granted, Mir said the Justice Department would have to go to court and seek enforcement of the divestiture order. Trump’s executive order from August doesn’t stipulate a clear punishment for failure to divest, but says that “the Attorney General is authorized to take any steps necessary to enforce this order.” The Justice Department declined to comment.TikTok is one of the most popular apps in the world -- with more than 100 million U.S. users -- and ByteDance’s most important service outside of China. The company and its investors are desperate to finish a deal to avoid a ban in what has been a valuable market for other social media apps, like Facebook Inc.’s Instagram and Snap Inc.’s Snapchat.Trump threatened to ban TikTok and order its sale to a US company as a result of national security concerns. The US is worried that the Chinese government could use the app to gain access to the personal data of American citizens.Cifius, the Treasury Department panel that reviews foreign acquisitions of American businesses, said in a July 30 letter included in ByteDance’s court filing in Washington this week that its security concerns were based on both classified and unclassified information. The letter cited the move by a Chinese affiliate of ByteDance in 2017 to establish a Communist Party Committee in its governance structure, and pointed out that ByteDance also collaborates with public security bureaus across China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-gets-reprieve-on-donald-trump-s-demand-for-a-ban-on-the-app/story-uTDL0G2k4DAtBd1S1rNl2O.html
13-11-2020||World||‘Eager to impress...’: Barack Obama’s book on Rahul Gandhi||Former US President Barack Obama found Congress MP Rahul Gandhi “eager to impress” but lacking “aptitude or the passion” to master the subject.In his widely anticipated memoir of his years in office, the former president writes approvingly about former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was Obama’s first state guest at the White House, and former Congress president Sonia Gandhi, according to a review in the New York Times.The observations, whether in direct quotes or paraphrased, are from the review that ostensibly quotes from the book, “A Promised Land”, which is set for public release next week.The review did not mention what the former President thought or wrote about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They met several times and Obama made history as the first US president to visit India twice while in office — 2012 and 2015 — and as the first US president to attend the Republic Day celebrations, both times on PM Modi’s watch.The former president wrote Rahul Gandhi — they met at least twice — in 2015 and 2017 — has “a nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject”, according a direct quote in the NYT review. The context of this observation could not be ascertained from the review, which listed it among gossipy details that Obama put down in the book about leaders he met and interacted over the eight years of his presidency, 2009 to 2017.The former president appeared to write glowingly about Sonia Gandhi but there were no direct quotes from the book in the review. About Singh, Obama wrote: “Secretary of Defense Bob Gates and the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh both come across as having a kind of impassive integrity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eager-to-impress-barack-obama-book-on-rahul-gandhi/story-CExC9kiGpOKjcWWG6cWZPO.html
13-11-2020||World||Coronavirus mutation in Denmark’s minks could be perilous for vaccines||The fight against Covid-19 got a big boost this week, with the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine showing much better-than-expected effectiveness in preventing disease in its first readout and Eli Lilly & Co.’s therapeutic antibody getting an Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. Other vaccines and treatments are likely to follow with similarly positive data. So far so good.But exactly how jubilant should we be? Answering this question depends in large measure on how quickly the virus mutates and finds a way to bypass vaccines and other approved therapies. How quickly it mutates, in turn, depends on our ability to slow the spread through responsible mitigation measures.Some background. Viruses mutate all the time. During the course of a single infection, a person can have coronaviruses with slight differences. If a vaccine or an antibody isn’t 100% effective in eradicating an infection, then even if it prevents disease it could still allow resistant clones to form. These clones could then spread to other people and undermine the efficacy of the vaccine or treatment.This isn’t theoretical. Denmark, one of the world’s biggest producers of mink skins, is in the process of culling its entire 17 million mink population after the virus found its way into herds at hundreds of the country’s farms. By virtue of their sheer numbers, the mink provided the virus with an opportunity to spread rapidly and mutate. Then, in exactly the same way that the virus first entered into the human population in China, it jumped back into humans. One variant of the Danish virus has the potential to be resistant to the very vaccines and therapies that we have just been celebrating.Also Read: Scientists detect two-way transmission of coronavirus on mink farmsBut we don’t need mink farms to generate mutations. A recent study from Emma Thomson, professor at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, and associates found a mutation that can bypass infection-fighting antibodies produced by some people. What this means is that there is one more reason to be concerned about the rapid spread of the coronavirus among humans: The more people get infected, the more likely it is for new versions of the virus to evolve. If the number of infections remains at current levels — or if it continues to rise — there is a risk that new mutations start to spread. Some of these new versions may even be able to reinfect people who had been infected before, a phenomenon that until now has been quite rare.Almost all vaccines in development target the current version of the virus, meaning that they should be effective in preventing the disease in a vast majority of people. However, if we allow the virus to spread, we risk further mutations, and, consequently, less effective vaccines.Should we put the Champagne back on ice? Definitely not. We can take comfort in that we have seen how effective a vaccine can be, at least based on early prevention of disease, and how quickly we can make one. And the beauty of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and another in development by Moderna Inc. is that they can be adapted to deal with new variants that develop. The same applies to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccines, with some caveats.The Danish experience suggests it’s critically important to stop the evolution of the virus before we even start vaccinating people. That means bringing to bear all mitigation tools, from testing and tracing to social distancing and masks. And we may need to keep up these practices after a vaccine has been deployed until we can be sure inoculations eliminate virus transmission. On top of all this, countries should keep a better eye on their animal populations so as to avoid another Danish mink situation. The more responsible we are with our behaviour, the better the chance for a successful vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-mutation-in-denmark-s-minks-could-be-perilous-for-vaccines/story-IqQjmiar9g3kDtIOZff6bI.html

This is what Europe is about and this is what we stand for.”The move comes as some EU nations attract criticism for their policies. Poland has put in place LGBT-free zones while Hungary has proposed legal changes to enshrine religious doctrine and ban same-sex couples from adoption.Also Read: Brexit talks go into next week, with EU and UK dividedThe commission called on all 27 EU nations to adopt an equality strategy, saying that even in countries with a wide acceptance and support for equal rights, “it has not always translated into clear improvements in LGBTIQ people’s lives.”The EU’s plan promises targeted actions, such as legal protection against discrimination at work and hate crime and help cross-border recognition of rainbow families.The EU strategy is adopted “at a time where we are witnessing the erosion or back-sliding of fundamental rights in some member states,” the commission said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-defends-lgbtiq-rights-in-its-first-ever-equality-strategy/story-IFCfxR3DIsR1L4lV2S1RUP.html
13-11-2020||World||Climate crisis is Boris Johnson’s chance to woo Joe Biden||Boris Johnson was given a friendly warning over the risks of Brexit by Joe Biden during a 25-minute phone-call on Tuesday afternoon. But there was at least one bright spot in that first conversation with the incoming American president: a shared goal to tackle climate change.The British prime minister said that it was “extremely exciting” to discuss the global response to the environment. “As you know, the UK is leading the world in driving down emissions and tackling climate change,” he told Parliament the following day.As Britain tries to redefine its role on the global stage after leaving the European Union, Johnson has a lot riding on green policies.The United Nations COP26 global climate change summit in Glasgow a year from now is critical to the success of that broader mission, and to the longer-term reputation of the UK. The question is whether the new man in the White House is about to eclipse Johnson’s standing as a driver of action or enhance it if the two join forces. The UK has a team of 120 climate and energy attachés, the world’s largest network of its kind, and since taking hold of COP26 presidency last year, ministers and senior officials have directly engaged with at least 100 governments to press for faster action.Also read: Boris Johnson urges Pakistan to assure fundamental rights of citizensThis week, his government pledged to be at the vanguard of “green finance” and announced it will ban supermarkets from produce linked to illegal deforestation. Even diplomats from EU member states, many quick to criticize the UK as Brexit talks drag on, have praised British efforts to corral countries from Brazil to Australia to make more ambitious commitments.The election of Biden will see the issue shoot up Washington’s priorities after being effectively abandoned by Donald Trump. While that may help boost overall global efforts, some experts argue it could also ultimately expose the U.K.’s lack of clout when compared with the EU, China and the US“You are going to have a dialog going on between the EU and China and US, and things are moving,” said Rachel Kyte, a dean at Tufts University and a former renewable energy adviser to the UN secretary-general. “The UK is not in the middle of that anymore, so you have to exercise a presidency from outside of the circle rather than from right in the middle of it.”The post-Brexit mantra of “Global Britain” has been derided by opponents who say the UK’s influence will only diminish outside the EU. Johnson’s government also faces plenty of internal struggles after presiding over the worst death toll from the coronavirus in Europe. His inner circle was destabilized on Wednesday evening when a senior aide quit. Yet on climate action some tangible UK successes abroad are apparent. In the past two weeks, Japan and South Korea have committed to zero out their greenhouse gases by 2050. Johnson, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and other ministers had been lobbying both governments in recent months and Raab traveled to the two countries to make the case.As an early adopter of a net-zero target on emissions by 2050, the UK is now well-placed to lean on other countries to follow suit. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to rejoin the landmark Paris climate agreement on his first day in office and to set the US’s own 2050 net-zero target.One key measure of success at COP26 will be getting countries that have dragged their feet to sign up to more progressive goals, said Alessandro Motta, an Italian diplomat helping to organize COP26.“It’s quite evidently a way to show that after Brexit the UK can still exert a leading role on the global stage,” said Motta. “The UK government has really put a lot of reserves on these diplomatic efforts.”According to a diplomat from a major European government, the UK is pushing the climate agenda through all multilateral channels at the UN, G7 and G20. The diplomat said Britain was aiming to get firm commitments from India, Indonesia, Australia, Canada, South Africa, Brazil and Saudi Arabia.The first real test of the UK’s influence will come on December 12, when Johnson will co-host a conference with the UN that asks other world leaders to set their net-zero goals. They will also have to set interim 2030 climate targets. With Trump on his way out, the US may now soon add its name to the list of countries making strong commitments.In the meantime, Johnson is redoubling efforts.In comments on Thursday to mark a year before the summit in Scotland, which was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, the prime minister called on world leaders to bring forward targets. “Climate change will remain the most enduring threat to the futures of our children and grandchildren—and the world we’re fighting for—if we do not act,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-crisis-is-boris-johnson-s-chance-to-woo-joe-biden/story-2Qmo9a8vJHUpD5kfJQA6II.html
13-11-2020||World||As Covid-19 pandemic rages, global daily deaths surpass peak levels from April||While the latest wave of Covid-19 infections in the United States and Europe has been pushing the seven-day average of daily cases to record levels through the past month, the global death trajectory too has seen a massive rise in the past week, going beyond the previous peak witnessed in early April. This means that more people are dying from Covid-19 across the world every day now than ever before in the 11 months since the virus was first reported in eastern China’s Wuhan city. The global trajectory of the viral disease is currently at levels never before witnessed, particularly due to new infections and deaths in countries such as the United States, France, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy touching record levels in the past week or so, shows data from Worldometers.DAILY DEATHS SOAR WORLDWIDEAs the first wave of infections tore through Europe and the US in March, deaths rose at a rapid rate through the month and beyond, with the seven-day average of daily deaths peaking at 7,089 on April 18. In the months, and waves of infections, that followed, while daily cases continued to rise, setting new records on regular intervals, the death trajectory never went past the levels from mid-April. Also read | Japan braces for fresh Covid-19 record amid fears of winter waveThis was largely due to two reasons. First, scientists and doctors got better at saving lives as better understanding of the disease developed with time. Second, the general population in Asia and South America, where the virus spread to through May and September, is younger. By mid-April, the case fatality rate, or the CFR, of the disease across the world was a little over 7%, compared to 2.5% at present. This was particularly due to the high number of fatalities in the West. The US, which had seen more than 40,000 people die from the disease, had the most deaths in the world and a CFR of 5%. Italy had reported 23,286 deaths from 175,918 cases till April 18, registering a CFR of 13%. Countries like Spain and the UK till then had seen around 17% of all infected people die. But as these countries brought the first wave under control, things got better and daily deaths remained low --- below the 6,000 mark for the next six months. In the past few weeks, however, things have worsened. The spike in cases worldwide through October has caused a massive uptick in daily deaths, pushing the seven-day average above the mid-April level for the first time on November 4, when it touched 7140. And it has been rising fast since. Over the last week, 8,300 people have died every day. Most of these deaths have come from the US, where 1,080 people have died every day in the past week. On average, 570 people have died every day in the last week in India – the second highest in the world. On the third spot is France, where 529 people have died a day in the last week. It is followed by Mexico and Italy, where the seven-day averages are 465 and 455, respectively. In Iran, the number is 451, while it is 375 in the UK. To be sure, the number of daily deaths is rising very fast in Europe and North American nations, while in countries such as India that are seeing a drop in new infections, this number has been dropping fast. NEW CASES In terms of new infections, the US continues to have the most cases with the country reporting nearly 130,000 infections in the past week. India, despite the ebbing of the first wave of infections, has reported the second highest number of daily cases in the past week – 46,035. It is followed closely by France (46,031 new cases in the last week) and Italy (34,007 new cases). Interestingly, Poland has been the next largest contributor to daily cases as it has reported 25,600 new cases in the last week. Brazil is on the sixth spot with 22,581 new cases . It is followed by UK, Russia, Germany and Spain with 22524, 20501, 18402 and 17705 new cases a day, respectively. Around 42% of all infections in the world have come from Europe -- 279,000 new infections a day in the past week. In North America, fuelled almost entirely by cases in the US, the seven-day average of daily cases is around 162,000, while the number is 95,000 in Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-covid-19-pandemic-rages-global-daily-deaths-surpass-peak-levels-from-april/story-zjMSniCcTKv1Isad8HVmDL.html
