Only by doing so we can guard against future risks because origin tracing is an evolving and sustained process that involves many countries and regions,” he said.His response came as the World Health Organisation (WHO) team to investigate the origin of the virus is due to arrive in China, even though Beijing is yet to give a timeline.There is also a sense of relief here that US President Donald Trump who launched a tirade against China over Covid-19 terming it as “China virus” is on his way out. Trump also denounced the WHO alleging that it is virtually controlled by China.Besides halting funding for the WHO, the Trump administration has formally notified the UN of its decision to withdraw the US from the global health body but US President-elect Joe Biden has promised to rejoin it.Since the coronavirus cases emerged in Wuhan in December last year before turning into a global pandemic with the worldwide death toll crossing over 1.4 million.China besides denying the US allegations that the virus emerged from a secretive bio-lab in Wuhan also refuted allegations that it emanated from a wet market in the city from bats or pangolins before infecting humans.The market has been sealed off ever since.In May, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the governing body of the 194-member states of the WHO, approved a resolution to set up an independent inquiry to conduct an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the international response as well as that of WHO.It also asked the WHO to investigate the “source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population”.China, which has backed the inquiry with a rider that it should commence after the coronavirus was brought under control, said it is getting ready to receive the WHO experts’ team.WHO emergency expert Dr Mike Ryan told the media early this week that his organisation has had assurances from China that an international field trip to investigate the origins of the new coronavirus will be arranged as soon as possible.“We fully expect that we will have a team on the ground,” Ryan was quoted as saying by the state-run CGTN on November 25.Ryan said the Wuhan market, where the virus is reported to have originated, is “likely to have been a point of amplification” of virus transmission, but whether that was by human, animal or environmental spread is not yet known, the report quoted him saying.He said that there had been human cases that preceded that event, according to the CGTN report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-covid-19-case-reported-in-wuhan-doesn-t-mean-virus-originated-here-china/story-lI3D8ZsKtabpe0BD9iWDLO.html
27-11-2020||World||Coronavirus in custody: Alabama ranks ninth for inmate deaths||At the Bibb Correctional Facility in Alabama, the old prison chapel has been turned into a quarantine zone. The sound of coughing is constant. And some people appear afraid to enter the room.An inmate described life in the quarantine to The Associated Press, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. The prison system has enforced the wearing of masks among inmates, but he said crowded dormitories like his offer nowhere to hide from the virus.He said he became so weak he could not stand.“He said they are just laying around like flies,” said Bonita Jackson, whose brother is a Bibb inmate who was hospitalized. “You can’t hardly hear him. He is gasping for breath.”As coronavirus cases skyrocket nationwide, they are also rising again in prisons, which are plagued by close contact and lack of good hygiene. In Alabama prisons alone, 34 people — 32 inmates and two staff members — have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic began. That ranks ninth in the country for the number of Covid-19 deaths per 10,000 inmates, according to figures compiled by The Associated Press and the Marshall Project.Criminal justice reform advocates have called for the release of vulnerable and elderly inmates and an increase in paroles to alleviate extreme overcrowding, as well as the mass testing of inmates.“These numbers are so disturbing, but not at all surprising given the culture and conditions in Alabama prisons. The Department of Corrections has failed to provide for the basic safety of people in its custody for years and Covid has escalated those failures,” said Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice.“What people should understand is that it did not have to be this bad,” she said.The Alabama Department of Corrections said in a statement that is has taken multiple steps to combat the virus behind bars.“As we continue to monitor the impact of Covid-19 in our facilities, the primary goal and concern of the ADOC is protecting the safety, security, and well-being of our inmates and staff,” the prison system said in a statement emailed from spokeswoman Samantha Rose.The agency said each inmate was given four masks, more than 200 floor-mounted hand sanitizer dispensers have been installed, and room foggers, backpack sprayers and other equipment are used to sanitize areas.Asked about the conditions described by inmates and their families, the prison system said the old chapel at Bibb is serving as a quarantine for symptomatic inmates awaiting Covid-19 test results, but the inmates are being closely monitored.“Using these non-traditional housing areas allows the ADOC to use all available space to quarantine positive cases, while protecting other inmates from exposure,” the system said.Since the pandemic began, nearly 800 inmates have tested positive for Covid-19, according to prison system numbers. The pandemic has also taken a toll on those that work in prisons. More than 600 Alabama prison employees have reported testing positive for Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Most inmates and staff have recovered.Most deaths, like those outside prison walls, have occurred in inmates with pre-existing health conditions, the prison system said.State Sen. Cam Ward, who was recently appointed by the governor as the new director of the Parole Bureau, said prison conditions where inmates are often “warehoused” in large rooms is a factor.“When you have 400-something people in one big room, it is going to spread disease,” Ward said.More than 1,000 people age 65 and older are behind bars in state prisons. Ward said older populations in prison include those sentenced for single violent crimes and those sentenced under the state’s habitual offender act before it was changed.“Because of that stringent three strikes, you’re out, you have a lot of people in there life without parole, and that population in there is getting older,” Ward said.Kenneth Glasgow, founder of the Ordinary People Society dedicated to ending mass incarceration, said he is fielding calls from inmate families daily. He agreed with Crowder that the state should have pursued the release of some offenders and increased testing early in the pandemic.“We’ve got family members calling out the yin-yang. They are scared. They say their family member got a two- or three-year sentence for drugs, not a sickness sentence or a death sentence from Covid,” Glasgow said.January Corbitt said she has underlying health conditions and feared catching the coronavirus before her release from Tutwiler Prison for Women this fall. One inmate and two employees at the Wetumpka prison have died from Covid-19.“It’s scary. Right now, it’s scary,” Corbitt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-in-custody-alabama-ranks-ninth-for-inmate-deaths/story-pq50WcCB8dGxepSwwtrt3O.html
27-11-2020||World||Senate control brings new urgency to Georgia turnout drive||In a black face mask and cap, activist Garrett Bess walked up driveway after driveway of million-dollar homes in suburban Atlanta on a recent afternoon, placing a flyer in each door, ringing the bell and stepping away to make a socially distanced pitch to vote for the conservative candidates in Georgia’s pivotal US Senate runoff elections.Bess’ group, Heritage Action for America, plans to knock on half a million doors before the state’s two Jan. 5 contests that will determine whether Democrats or Republicans control the Senate.“Everyone in Georgia knows the candidates,” said Janae Stracke, a colleague of Bess’ who also canvassed the subdivision. “There’s not a lot of convincing to do. They’ve made up their mind. It’s mostly knowing when to vote, how to vote, encouraging them to vote.”This election season, the coronavirus pandemic has upended traditional get-out-the-vote efforts where campaign workers go door to door to encourage people to cast ballots. With people staying at home and limiting contact with outsiders, an extended conversation with a campaign worker who shows up uninvited may actually encourage people to vote for someone else.But it’s a sign of how important the two Senate elections are that both parties and independent advocacy groups are going all in on their in-person get-out-the-vote efforts.After the GOP lost the presidential election in Georgia for the first time in 28 years, conservatives are urging Republicans to get more aggressive with their turnout efforts in the state to match the outreach of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.After Abrams lost the 2018 governor’s race, she devoted herself to voter outreach, convinced that the state was a genuine battleground if Democrats galvanized young voters, minorities and people moving in from other states. She raised millions of dollars to organize and register hundreds of thousands of voters in the state — efforts credited with helping Democrat Joe Biden win Georgia.Republicans have to catch up, Republican operative Karl Rove told Fox News.“Let’s not kid ourselves: This is a real race,” said Rove, who is leading fundraising efforts for the runoffs,The National Republican Senatorial Committee expects to have 1,000 staffers on the ground in Georgia. For comparison, the Republican National Committee had a total of 3,000 paid field staff across the whole country during the presidential race.Democrats carry their own baggage into the runoff. In many parts of the country, they limited face-to-face campaigning ahead of the Nov. 3 election because of the pandemic, arguing that was the responsible thing to do. But that decision was second-guessed in places such as Florida.The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee plans to spend millions on voter registration and turnout efforts.Outside groups are also hitting the ground, and the in-person appeals will be supplemented with a fusillade of phone calls, text messages, mailers and ads aimed at boosting turnout for the races pitting Republican Sen. David Perdue against Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler against Democrat Raphael Warnock.Turnout tends to drop precipitously in runoff contests in Georgia. And activists fear there might be even more of a falloff this time, when the excitement of the Trump-Biden race is over. So getting voters to come back to the polls becomes more of a focus than “trying to find new voters or win over voters who voted for your opponent,” said Charles Bullock, an expert on Southern politics at the University of Georgia.Historically, that drop-off has disproportionately affected Democrats, so the party faces strong headwinds heading into January. The Republican candidate has beaten the Democrat in seven out of eight runoff elections since 1992, including two US Senate races.Democrats have reason for optimism after Biden’s win, but his margin of victory was tiny — less than 13,000 votes of nearly 5 million cast — and it’s been 20 years since the state elected a Democrat to the US Senate.But groups whose efforts tend to favor Democrats are charged. The African Methodist Episcopal Church in Georgia, which has more than 150,000 parishioners in the state, is asking members to call eligible voters in their congregations, encourage them to vote early and assist with rides if they need help getting to the polls on Jan. 5.Bishop Reginald T. Jackson said Black voters are excited and “realize the eyes of the nation are on Georgia.”“They know people are going to be looking to see whether or not Blacks turn out,” he said.The New Georgia Project, a group founded by Abrams, will try to register some of the estimated 35,000 people who have finished their felony sentences and can requalify to vote as well as some of the estimated 23,000 people who are turning 18 before the runoff, Executive Director Nse Ufot said.Ufot said the group also aims to knock on 1 million doors before the runoff, up from 500,000 before the general election, and is training volunteers to take coronavirus precautions.In Milton, Bess and Stracke were in friendly territory. The affluent, mostly white city about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Atlanta showed strong support for President Donald Trump in the November election. The neighborhood they canvassed last week featured manicured lawns and spacious homes set back from the street.“Oh, you have no problem here,” Holly McCormick, 73, told Bess after he rang her doorbell. The flyers he carried warned that Georgia was the country’s “last line of defense from a socialist takeover.”McCormick called the outcome of the presidential race “rigged” though there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and she said Trump’s claims of illegal votes made her more energized to vote for Perdue and Loeffler in January.“We have to hold the Senate,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-control-brings-new-urgency-to-georgia-turnout-drive/story-NmGGNgcFOGrOag274GpVKK.html
27-11-2020||World||Let’s deepen ties in 2021: Boris Johnson tells Narendra Modi||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday and pushed for 2021 to be a year to deepen and strengthen the India-UK relationship in various sectors, particularly in trade, climate crisis, defence security and health.A Downing Street spokesperson said the two prime ministers discussed joint efforts to find treatment and vaccines for Covid-19, and welcomed the collaboration between the two countries’ leading scientists.“They looked forward to next month’s Climate Ambition Summit, which will be an opportunity to reinvigorate the global efforts against climate change ahead of the UK-hosted COP26 Summit next year,” the spokesperson said.The UK will be out of the European Union from January 1, 2021, when it hopes to forge new relationships and strengthen existing ones across the globe, particularly a free trade agreement with India.“The prime minister stressed the importance of improving bilateral trade and investment flows. Both leaders welcomed the extensive work that has taken place on this to date and shared an ambition for deepening the economic relationship,” the spokesperson said.According to a readout of the interaction, Johnson “re-emphasised the UK’s commitment” to the wider Indo-Pacific region and looked forward to the first deployment of the HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier group to the region next year.An integrated review of the UK’s foreign policy with a focus on the Indo-Pacific is expected to be released in early 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/let-s-deepen-ties-in-2021-boris-johnson-tells-narendra-modi/story-dKqbENEJS19TigmrabW8NL.html

27-11-2020||World||Who is the Iranian scientist killed in Tehran?||Prominent Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, killed in an attack outside Tehran on Friday, was widely seen outside the country as a leading figure in the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme. Iran denies his involvement.Who is the scientist and what is known about him?Western officials and experts believe Fakhrizadeh played a pivotal role in suspected Iranian work in the past to develop the means to assemble a nuclear warhead behind the facade of a declared civilian uranium enrichment programme. Iran denies ever having sought to develop a nuclear weapon.A landmark report by the UN nuclear watchdog in 2011 identified Fakhrizadeh as a central figure in suspected Iranian work to develop technology and skills needed for atomic bombs, and suggested he may still have a role in such activity. Believed to be a senior officer in the elite Revolutionary Guards, Fakhrizadeh was the only Iranian the report identified.What is known about his background?An exiled Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), in May 2011 issued a report with what it said was a photograph of Fakhrizadeh, with dark hair and beard stubble. It was not possible to independently verify the picture.The NCRI said in the report that Fakhrizadeh was born in 1958 in the holy Shi’ite Muslim city of Qom, was a deputy defence minister and a Revolutionary Guards brigadier-general, and holds a nuclear engineering doctorate and taught at Iran’s University of Imam Hussein.What does Iran say?The UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has long wanted to meet Fakhrizadeh as part of a protracted investigation into whether Iran carried out illicit nuclear weapons research. Showing no sign it would heed the request, Iran acknowledged Fakhrizadeh’s existence several years ago but said he was an army officer not involved in the nuclear programme, according to a diplomatic source with knowledge of the matter.He was also named in a 2007 UN resolution on Iran as a person involved in nuclear or ballistic missile activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-is-the-iranian-scientist-killed-in-tehran/story-leIWchcKko9ShSTGssltdI.html
27-11-2020||World||Iran scientist linked to military nuclear program killed||An Iranian scientist that Israel alleged led the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear program until its disbanding in the early 2000s was killed in a targeted attack that saw gunmen use explosives and machine gun fire Friday, state television said.Israel declined to immediately comment on the killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once called out in a news conference saying: “Remember that name.” Israel has long been suspected of carrying out a series of targeted killings of Iranian nuclear scientists nearly a decade ago.State TV said Fakhrizadeh was attacked by “armed terrorist elements.” He died at a local hospital after doctors and parademics couldn’t revive him.The semiofficial Fars news agency, believed to be close to the country’s Revolutionary Guard, said the attack happened in Absard, a small city just east of the capital, Tehran. It said witnesses heard the sound of an explosion and then machine gun fire. The attack targeted a car that Fakhrizadeh was in, the agency said.Others wounded, including Fakhrizadeh’s bodyguards, also were taken to a local hospital, the agency said.State television on its website later published a photograph of security forces blocking off the road. Photos and video shared online showed a Nissan sedan with bullet holes through windshield and blood pooled on the road.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, Iranian media all noted the interest that Netanyahu had previously shown in Fakhrizadeh.Hossein Salami, chief commander of the paramilitary Guard, appeared to acknowledge the attack on Fakhrizadeh.“Assassinating nuclear scientists is the most violent confrontation to prevent us from reaching modern science,” Salami tweeted.Hossein Dehghan, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader and a presidential candidate in Iran’s 2021 election, issued a warning on Twitter.“In the last days of their gambling ally’s political life, the Zionists seek to intensify and increase pressure on Iran to wage a full-blown war,” Dehghan wrote, appearing to refer to U.S. President Donald Trump. “We will descend like lightning on the killers of this oppressed martyr and we will make them regret their actions!”The killing comes just days before the 10-year anniversary of the killing of Iranian nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari, which Tehran also blamed on Israel. Those targeted killings came alongside the so-called Stuxnet virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, that destroyed Iranian centrifuges.The area around Absard is filled with vacation villas for the Iranian elite with a view of Mount Damavand, the highest peak in the country. Roads on Friday, part of the Iranian weekend, were emptier than normal due to a lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic, offering his attackers a chance to strike with fewer people around.Fakhrizadeh led Iran’s so-called “Amad,” or “Hope” program. Israel and the West have alleged it was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon in Iran. Tehran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful.The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran “carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device” in a “structured program” through the end of 2003. That was the Amad program, which included work on the carefully timed high explosives needed to detonate a nuclear bomb.Iran also “conducted computer modeling of a nuclear explosive device” before 2005 and between 2005 and 2009, the IAEA has said. The agency said, however, that those calculations were “incomplete and fragmented.”IAEA inspectors now monitor Iranian nuclear sites as part of Iran’s now-unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.Netanyahu in 2018 gave a presentation in which he unveiled what he described as material stolen by Israel from an Iranian nuclear archive.“A key part of the plan was to form new organizations to continue the work,” Netanyahu alleged in 2018. “This is how Dr. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, head of Project Amad, put it. Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-scientist-linked-to-military-nuclear-program-killed/story-7pud8qCjUWXAig9RzSadkN.html
27-11-2020||World||Thai pro-democracy protesters warn of possible military coup||Pro-democracy demonstrators in Thailand, undeterred by arrest warrants and the possibility of violent attacks, staged another rally on Friday, poking fun at their critics and warning of the possibility of a military coup.The potential for violence was illustrated after their last rally on Wednesday, when in the hours after it ended, two men were reportedly shot and critically wounded. Although the incident remains murky and its connection to the rally unclear, it was a reminder that the student protesters are vulnerable, especially because of the passions they inspire among some of their opponents.The protest movement’s core demands are for Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and his government to step down, the constitution to be amended to be more democratic, and the monarchy to be reformed to make it more accountable.Their demand concerning the monarchy is the most controversial and earns them the most enemies. The royal institution by law and tradition is virtually untouchable, and regarded by many as the bedrock of national identity. The military has declared defense of the monarchy to be among its foremost duties.The protest leaders believe that King Maha Vajiralongkorn holds more power than is appropriate under a constitutional monarchy, and have made that the centerpiece of their campaigning in recent weeks. Although any criticism of the monarchy used to be taboo, speeches at the rallies — as well as signs and chants __ include caustic words about the king and the palace.In response, Thai authorities this past week escalated their legal battle against protest leaders, charging 12 of them with violating a harsh law against defaming the monarchy. The lese majeste law carries a penalty of three to 15 years’ imprisonment, but has not been used for the past three years.Historically, defending the monarchy has been abused for political reasons. It has also triggered violence, most notably in 1976, when it led to the killings of dozens of students at a university protest against the return from exile of an ousted military dictator. That event was the trigger for a coup, and since then Thailand has had successful coups in 1977, 1991, 2006 and 2014.There is concern that if the government feels it cannot control the protests, which show little sign of abating, it may impose martial law or be ousted by the army in a coup.Some speakers on Friday evening urged the crowd to take measures to resist any coup that might be launched.Resisting any coup attempt was the nominal theme of the rally, which began in a festival-like atmosphere that has marked many of the protest events. Oversized inflatable yellow rubber ducks that became icons of the movement after they were used as shields against police water cannons were joined by balloons in the image of silvery space aliens. The balloons are displayed to mock accusations that foreigners — “aliens” — fund and direct the protest movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thai-pro-democracy-protesters-warn-of-possible-military-coup/story-ZoutuYEH7j0nV7Z1bPZqlN.html
27-11-2020||World||New cardinals quarantine in pope’s hotel ahead of consistory||The Vatican’s Santa Marta hotel was built to sequester cardinals during papal elections. It’s now sequestering soon-to-be cardinals in town for this weekend’s ceremony to get their red hats: A handful are in protective coronavirus quarantine, confined to their rooms on Vatican orders and getting meals delivered to their doors.The 10-day quarantines, with Covid-19 tests administered at the start and finish, are just one example of how Saturday’s ceremony to elevate new cardinals is like nothing the Holy See has ever seen.“They told me it would be like this but I didn’t think it would be so strict!” marveled Cardinal-designate Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel, the retired archbishop of Chiapas, Mexico.During a Zoom call with The Associated Press from his hotel room, Esquivel said he had thought there might be some exceptions to the lockdown for new cardinals. “No! Here, it doesn’t matter if you’re a cardinal or a pope. The virus doesn’t respect anyone,” he said.Pope Francis on Saturday will elevate 13 clerics to the College of Cardinals, the elite group of red-robed churchmen whose primary task is to elect a new pope. It’s the seventh time Francis has named a new batch of cardinals since his election in 2013, and his imprint is increasingly shifting the balance of power away from Europe and toward the developing world.The Vatican has said two new cardinals won’t make it to Rome for the ceremony, known as a consistory, because of Covid-19 and travel concerns: The Vatican’s ambassador to Brunei, Cardinal-designate Cornelius Sim, and the archbishop of Capiz, Philippines, Cardinal-designate Jose Advincula.The Vatican is arranging for them, and any of the cardinals who might not make it, to participate in the ceremony remotely from their homes. They’ll get their three-pointed “biretta” hats from a Vatican ambassador or another envoy.For those who are participating in person, the public health crisis has posed an unusual set of challenges. Italy, where the pandemic erupted in late February, is currently in the throes of a second wave. The Vatican itself has returned to a modified lockdown in recent weeks, with the Vatican Museums shuttered and a dozen Swiss Guards testing positive.Francis, 83, has been criticized for his rather lax mask usage, but he has abided by social distancing measures to a degree. He too lives at Santa Marta, where there has been at least one positive case reported in recent months.Usually, consistories are full of parties and crowds: Cardinals come to town with family, friends and sometimes benefactors and parishioners who get to see the new “princes of the church” up close and then attend receptions and dinners in their honour. Under normal circumstances, the consistory would be followed by “courtesy visits,” where the new cardinals greet well-wishers and the general public from the grandeur of their own reception rooms in the Apostolic Palace or Vatican auditorium.This year, there will be no courtesy visits, and each cardinal has a 10-person limit for guests. For Esquivel, no one other than his secretary travelled with him from Mexico, so he’s inviting some priests from the residence where Mexican clergy working or studying in Rome live.“We don’t have contact with practically anyone. It’s total isolation, but it’s necessary,” he said.Esquivel is one of four cardinals over age 80 who are joining the college as honorary members, named by Francis to recognize their lifetime of service to the church. The other nine are under age 80 and eligible to vote in a conclave to eventually choose Francis’ successor.History’s first Latin American pope has long sought to name cardinals from the “peripheries,” to show the universal nature of the church and boost small communities, where Catholics are a minority, with high-profile leaders.As of Saturday, there will be 128 voting-age cardinals, 42% from Europe. The Pew Research Center notes that in 2013 Europeans made up 52% of the voting-age block, evidence of Francis’ effort to decrease the strength of Europeans as a voting bloc and give greater visibility to church leaders from Asia, Africa and the Americas.Among the new voting age cardinals is the first African-American, Cardinal-designate Wilton Gregory, archbishop of Washington, D.C.He too is concluding his quarantine in the Santa Marta hotel, where he said his meals are left on a tray outside his door. Gregory said that while he was unable to go out, at least his new red cassock was delivered from Rome’s famous clerical haberdasher, Gammarelli.In a Zoom call, Gregory explained that a US-based ecclesiastical tailor took his measurements while he was still in Washington and sent them to Gammarelli, which then made the robes to order and sent them to Santa Marta.“I have them now. They fit!” he said.Fashion aside, Gregory said he was humbled by Francis’ decision to make him a cardinal and said he would return to a United States still in the throes of the pandemic with hope that vaccines against the virus will soon work.“I hope we can use them effectively to protect people and ... once this pandemic is brought under control, to face the future with hope,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-cardinals-quarantine-in-pope-s-hotel-ahead-of-consistory/story-BcISwdfquOqH6e6Had4a9O.html
27-11-2020||World||Iraq: Unmasked demonstrators take to the streets in support of radical cleric||Thousands of Iraqis — most of them not wearing protective masks — took to the streets in Baghdad on Friday in a show of support for a radical cleric ahead of elections next year, stirring fears of a spike in coronavirus cases.Supporters congregated in the capital’s Tahrir Square, once the epicentre of mass anti-government protests, to show their support for Moqtada al-Sadr, who leads a powerful political bloc, ahead of federal elections slated for next June.Most of al-Sadr’s followers stood unmasked in the square, chanting: “Yes, yes for our leader,” in support of the firebrand cleric as Iraq remains a high-risk country for coronavirus infection. The crowd then stood side-by-side for Friday prayers at noon.More than 12,000 people have died of the virus in Iraq amid 544,000 confirmed cases, according to Health Ministry figures. Daily infection rates average 2,400 cases per day, but health workers say the number may be higher as many Iraqis with symptoms choose to stay home and avoid hospitals to get tested.Iraq has the second highest outbreak and number of deaths in the region after Iran.Al-Sadr leads the Sairoon political bloc, which holds the majority in parliament. He has taken steps in preparation for elections scheduled for June next year. His followers called for a demonstration in support of the leader’s call for mass participation in the vote.“The Iraqi people and al-Sadr’s followers will have one saying, and that is: Yes yes for Iraq,” said Ibrahim al-Jabiri, director of al-Sadr’s office north of Baghdad.Observers consider the protest as a show of mettle by al-Sadr meant to send a message to other political blocs that on Iraq’s streets, the cleric still has clout.Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi called for elections to take place next June, a year earlier than expected. That was a key demand of anti-government protesters who paralysed Iraq’s streets when tens of thousands demonstrated last October.The elections will take place under a new law approved by lawmakers this year that theoretically will enable more independent candidates to run. Iraq’s electoral commission has said it is prepared to hold early elections on time if the government allocates a budget for the vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-unmasked-demonstrators-take-to-the-streets-in-support-of-radical-cleric/story-f3YV9sefmQb7KtZrknRFWJ.html
27-11-2020||World||US colleges mull new virus protocols for students’ return||St. Michael’s College managed to keep coronavirus cases at bay for almost two months this fall with students tested upon arrival and once every three weeks.But in mid-October, cases at the small Vermont school started to climb. The outbreak was linked to an ice rink more than 40 miles (64 kilometers) away. The liberal arts college shifted to all-remote learning and closed the campus to visitors. By November, a total of 76 of the roughly 1,600 students had tested positive, the school said.“It was very concerning to experience the spike in cases that we did after so many weeks of surveillance tests with no positives,” President Lorraine Sterritt said by email.When students come back for the spring semester, St. Michael’s will begin testing them weekly. The college may also require students to move to a separate residence hall when they are told to quarantine.The coronavirus presented huge challenges for the fall semester for US colleges that opened the academic year with in-person learning, including some that took a battering from outbreaks. Those not joining the growing number that will offer only virtual learning are assessing how they would bring students back after the winter holidays while the country faces crushing rates of virus infections.Schools that are bringing students back are adjusting testing protocols, introducing new screenings, and eliminating spring breaks to discourage students from traveling to help keep campuses open.Other schools big and small think it’s still possible to keep a pandemic-era residential college experience.California Polytechnical University in San Luis Obispo plans to add saliva testing in the winter quarter that will be processed on campus and will allow it “to test many more people much more quickly — our current estimate is 4,000 tests per day by mid-January,” President Jeffrey Armstrong said in a campus-wide message this month.In the spring semester, Colby College in Maine wants to add some rapid antigen tests to twice-weekly tests for students, faculty and staff. It also did away with the one-week spring break replacing it with two mini-breaks in March and April.“We’ll program stuff for the campus so people get a break,” Chief Financial Officer Douglas Terp said.More schools are expected to require students get tested before they come to campus rather than when they arrive, as some institutions did before the fall semester, said Barbara Mistick, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.Institutions like Syracuse University in New York abandoned in-person learning earlier than planned this fall but are planning on a resumption of campus life next semester.But a growing number of schools will stick with virtual instruction through the spring.“We are seeing a rapid rise in colleges and universities announcing they will move to remote learning for the remainder of this semester and for the spring,” said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities.George Washington University in Washington, D.C., for one, announced early last month it will continue most of its classes virtually.Student cooperation with protocols helped to keep the number of coronavirus cases low at the University of Vermont’s campus in the small city of Burlington, President Suresh Garimella said.On a recent day, students wearing masks streamed through a tent outside the student center where they are required to be tested weekly. They stayed apart, stopped at a station to sanitize their hands and blow their nose and then proceeded into the indoor testing center.“It’s part of my routine,” said sophomore Brian Boyle of the testing.The school received federal coronavirus relief funding for virus-related expenses like testing, but Garimella estimates it will spend an additional $10 million to $15 million.There are also a lot of precautions in place, rules for social distancing and the maximum number of people in a group, Boyle said. It’s harder to get together with people socially, but he said students can find ways to go about it and still follow the rules and be safe.“You know being outside in small groups and stuff,” he said.As cases rose in Vermont and at UVM in November, though, he said he was becoming a bit concerned about whether the spring semester will be in-person.“My biggest concern is probably that people will become more relaxed with their individual social distancing/quarantining measures over winter break,” he said by email. “I can only hope that people will remember how important these safety measures are, and will continue to practice them for the sake of their health and for the sake of our education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-colleges-mull-new-virus-protocols-for-students-return/story-5y3n6hqH0SCI9L5QPhslmN.html
27-11-2020||World||Covid-19: Hospitals race to set vaccine priorities for healthcare workers||Large hospital systems are grappling with how best to decide which health-care workers will be vaccinated first for Covid-19, a daunting task when it’s unclear which shots they’ll get, how many and when they’ll arrive.The first Covid-19 vaccine could be cleared for US use as soon as next month, with Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s candidate already under review and Moderna Inc.’s shot not far behind. Federal officials, meanwhile, have signaled that health-care workers and older Americans at high risk should be vaccinated as step one in what could set off months of fraught decisions involving other key priority groups.But following those initial guidelines could prove difficult. With 21 million health-care workers in the US, there almost certainly won’t be enough doses to reach them all at once. That’s forcing hospitals to categorize their workers based on best-guess distribution estimates, a task made even more complex for some systems by a patchwork state-by-state approach.Minnesota’s Allina Health system, which employs 15,600 workers who have direct contact with patients in Minnesota and Wisconsin, is estimating it could get 3,000 to 4,000 doses initially. The plan: Prioritize those that interact directly with coronavirus patients by listing each worker by their job type and the units they work in.“We’re looking at all employees, where they work, what their roles are and what their exposure risk is,” said Ryan Else, a doctor who is overseeing the coronavirus response in Allina Health’s hospitals.Health systems that operate across state lines face an even bigger challenge. While states are taking cues from federal guidelines, they are developing their own priority lists, creating a situation where some employees in one state might get vaccinated before their peers in another.“How fair does that feel to people in the same system?” said Amy Compton-Phillips, a doctor and chief clinical officer at Providence, which operates 51 hospitals, as well clinics and medical offices across seven states.Like Allina, Providence also plans to vaccinate workers based on their roles in an attempt at fairness. The health system will notify workers when it’s their turn to get vaccinated. It is also creating an appeal process if people think groups were misclassified.“When things are in short supply, you make really hard decisions. They don’t feel good,” Compton-Phillips said.Federal officials plan to initially send 6.4 million doses across the country, according to Gus Perna, Operation Warp Speed’s chief operating officer. More doses will then be sent out on a weekly basis with the goal of distributing 40 million doses by the end of the year, Perna said on a call with reporters Tuesday.Shipments will be divvied up across states based on the size of their adult populations, and not in response to any virus surges, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on the call.“We wanted to keep this simple, first because we’re seeing nationwide spread and susceptibility to the disease,” Azar said. “But also, once we pass through these initial tranches where we’re in much more of a scarcity situation, we’re eventually going to get to the point where it would need to be per capita. So instead of having multiple methodologies, we thought it best to keep it simple.”Some health systems are taking a more granular approach in preparing for use of the shots.Advocate Aurora Health Inc., with 26 hospitals and even more clinics and doctors across Illinois and Wisconsin, is identifying workers at greatest risk of severe illness, anticipating it will not receive enough doses to cover employees evenly. That means factoring in details like how prevalent the coronavirus is in a particular community, as well as employees’ risk factors, said Robert Citronberg, a doctor and executive medical director of infectious disease and prevention.“We want to target as best as possible the people who are most likely to get severely ill from Covid, and we know those are older people, people with underlying medical conditions,” Citronberg said.New York’s Northwell Health, with 23 hospitals, has already compiled a spreadsheet of its 74,000 workers that categorizes them by their risk of catching the novel coronavirus on the job, according to Mark Jarrett, who is a doctor and the system’s chief quality officer.Virus PrevalenceNorthwell’s calculation weighs how much employees interact with infected patients and, like Advocate Aurora, how prevalent the virus is in the community. That second data point could change at times, resulting in people working in areas with more spread being vaccinated first.And Jarrett brings another issue to the table. He’s worried less about people clamoring for a vaccine and more about workers not wanting one, a fear other hospital executives across the country echoed.Health systems already had to contend with anti-vaccination movements when concerns about the quick speed of Covid-19 vaccine development further spooked workers, Providence’s Compton-Phillips said.Allison Suttle, a doctor and chief medical officer of Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based Sanford Health, hopes clinical trial data will reassure the system’s workers. Internal surveys found more people said they would take a Covid-19 vaccine after Pfizer and Moderna released early results showing their candidates were each around 95% effective.Cautiously Optimistic“I’m optimistic, cautiously optimistic, and proud of our health-care workers that they’re willing to jump up, stick out their shoulder and get the vaccine,” Suttle said.If and when the Food and Drug Administration authorizes vaccine candidates, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make its final recommendations for whom to vaccinate. Members of the CDC’s immunization committee will review the data for clues on whether the formulas work better in some groups than others.In the meantime, health systems will continue preparing as best they can. When asked whether Northwell knows how many doses it will receive, Jarrett laughed.“Nope,” he answered. Any estimates are likely to change, Jarrett said, and even the smallest of fluctuations could make a big difference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-hospitals-race-to-set-vaccine-priorities-for-healthcare-workers/story-xOZMUjsivq4Okg5cCWcnAO.html

Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, reportedly said that the US’ attempts to give legitimacy to the “illegal Israeli settlements” contradicts the UN Charter and the Security Council’s resolutions.“We see this as another manifestation of the United States’ blatantly disdainful attitude to the globally recognized international legal principles of the Mideastern settlement,” Zakharova was quoted as saying by ANI .Here’s what you need to know about all US decisions favouring Israel:The Trump administration has been aggressive about its policy towards Israel by taking several decisions that have been considered as against Palestinian interests. Last year, the United States recognised Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a disputed region occupied by Israel since 1967.The United States also announced a reversal of its decades-long policy on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, calling the occupation not necessarily a violation of international law. Pompeo said that the US no longer agrees with the 1978 State Department legal opinion that held the occupied territories “inconsistent with international law”.Also Read | Pompeo touts Iran policy in Gulf ahead of Biden presidencyThe Trump administration went on to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved its embassy from Tel Aviv from the holy city. “Basing policy on reality, we recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and we recognised Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights,” Pompeo told a Senate committee in 2019.The US also brokered a deal for the normalisation of ties between Israel and the UAE. It was touted as a historic agreement since demands for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine issue was considered as a major obstacle to the normalisation of ties.Recently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US ambassador David Friedman also signed amended scientific cooperation agreements that effectively lifted the US’ ban on funding scientific research projects in the West Bank and Golan Heights.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-slams-pompeo-s-visit-to-golan-heights-know-about-all-us-decisions-favouring-israel/story-fXOsnWn3smRAjoNJHlnycL.html
27-11-2020||World||Biden’s win hides a dire warning for Democrats in rural US||Democrats once dominated Koochiching County in the blue-collar Iron Range of northern Minnesota. But in this month’s presidential election, President Donald Trump won it with 60% of the vote.That’s not because voters there are suddenly shifting to the right, said Tom Bakk, who represents the area in the state Senate. It’s because, he said, Democrats have steadily moved too far to the left for many rural voters.“We’ve got to see if we can get the Democratic Party to moderate and accept the fact that rural Minnesota is not getting more conservative,” said Bakk, who announced last week that he would become an independent after serving 25 years as a Democrat. “It’s that you guys are leaving them behind.”While Democrats powered through cities and suburbs to reclaim the White House, the party slid further behind in huge rural swaths of northern battlegrounds. The party lost House seats in the Midwest, and Democratic challengers in Iowa, Kansas, Montana and North Carolina Senate races, all once viewed as serious threats to Republican incumbents, fell, some of them hard.Though Democrats’ rural woes aren’t new, they now heap pressure on Biden to begin reversing the trend. Failure to do so endangers goals such as curbing climate change and winning a Senate majority, especially with GOP Senate seats in Iowa, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin up in 2022.“The pressure for Democrats has to be on conveying an economic message for rural America,” said Iowa Democrat John Norris, a former candidate for governor. “We have a great one to convey, but we haven’t put enough emphasis on it.”It has become a defining dynamic in almost every state where Democrats dominate urban areas and, for at least two elections, have clear momentum in the suburbs.While Trump sought to squeeze more out of his mostly white, working-class base, he made little ground in places he barely won or lost in 2016, and slid in suburbs across the industrial and agricultural north. Instead, he supercharged his focus on places he won big last times.Trump lost Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, after winning all three in 2016. But he won at least 60% of the vote in 126 counties in the three — 14 more than in 2016, according to Associated Press and state elections data. All of those counties are lightly populated.Perhaps more telling, Trump increased his winning percentages in 90% of the counties where he reached the 60% mark in those three states four years ago. That includes all 24 counties where he won at least 70% of the vote last time, even while Biden was vastly outspending Trump on advertising.The rural runaway was even greater in Iowa and Ohio, where polls late in October gave Biden’s campaign hopes of a close race or narrow win, only to see him lose them by the same margins Clinton did.Trump’s greater dominance in rural Ohio surprised even Republican strategists. In Ohio’s 6th Congressional District, 18 counties that hug the Pennsylvania border and Ohio River, Trump improved from 64% of the vote to more than 66%.“I’ll be the first to say I was doubtful President Trump could exceed what he did in 2016,” said Ryan Steubenrauch, a senior adviser to 6th District Republican Rep. Bill Johnson.Though Biden fulfilled Democrats’ long-sought goal of carrying Georgia and Arizona, albeit narrowly, it wasn’t because he concentrated on reaching beyond their metro hubs, said Steve Jarding, a veteran Democratic strategist who has long argued for greater party engagement in rural America.“Democrats have found a way to win in the country, at least they believe this to be the case, by not concentrating much in big parts of the middle of the country,” he said. “That’s a scary proposition.”Jarding worries that by winning Arizona, Georgia and the northern swing states without addressing the rural economy, Democrats might believe the states are now trending their way as the result of favorable population and demographic shifts.“We didn’t win Georgia because we had a great message to rural Georgians,” said Jarding, who helped Mark Warner win the Virginia governorship in 2001 by advising him to campaign aggressively far from the booming Washington, D.C., suburbs. “If Democrats say, look, we got into Georgia and we won it without having to talk about rural issues, they are dead wrong. It will flip back.”In clinging to their majority, House Democrats lost rural seats, notably the one held for 30 years by Rep. Collin Peterson in western Minnesota. The setbacks prompted accusations from moderates that the party’s prominent liberals, such as New York Rep. Alexandra Ocasio Cortez, had become representative of a party foreign to America’s farming and small manufacturing towns.“I would argue everyone talks about the big tent. It’s not as big as it used to be,” Minnesota’s Bakk said.Biden campaigned little in person, even less in rural areas. Trump, on the other hand, whipped up enthusiasm at rallies in places like Wausau, Wisconsin, in the state’s rural north where he dominated, as well as Saginaw in Mid Michigan, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania, surrounded by counties he carried by more than 70%, even 80%.Democrats also spent little time and money combatting Trump’s attacks.Unanswered, Trump’s claims that Biden and other Democrats are proponents of socialism and eliminating police departments, as unfounded as they were, resonated in small towns, according to VoteCast, an Associated Press survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago.“We have to address this in a really more aggressive way,” said veteran Democratic strategist James Carville, especially Trump’s claims that Democrats are anti-police. “There were some serious kind of headwinds there.”Democrats need to not just defend against attacks but recruit more candidates among rural Americans and argue that progressive policy is to their advantage.“We obviously have a brand problem in rural America,” said former North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat defeated in 2018. “But if you want to be an alternative, you can’t go there empty-handed.”Heitkamp credits Biden for including specifically rural provisions in his policy plans, such as a transportation component in his health care proposal, considering many people in sparsely populated areas must travel some distance to see a doctor.For now, Democrats’ future in rural America rests largely on how Biden is viewed there, Heitkamp said.“A good way to start out would be to make sure in his inaugural speech and state of the union, he talks about rural America,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-win-hides-a-dire-warning-for-democrats-in-rural-us/story-twPwz6c65T2yjlqUp3rXRO.html
27-11-2020||World||Covid-19: Death toll of UK Indians crosses 1,000||The death toll from Covid-19 of patients categorised as ‘Indian’ in official figures crossed the grim milestone of 1,000 on Friday, making the community the worst-hit among non-whites and complementing studies that showed non-whites have been disproportionately hit by the virus.As of Thursday evening, 1,029 Indians had passed away in England’s hospitals and care homes, according to the National Health Service (NHS). The Indian ethnic group is followed by Pakistanis, with 889 deaths, and Caribbean ethnicity with 739 deaths.Funeral companies catering to the Indian and Asian communities have been busier than ever this year, particularly in towns and areas such as Leicester, Birmingham, Manchester, Southall, Brent and Harrow.Those from the Indian community who succumbed to the virus include several doctors, nurses and pharmacists on the frontline of treatment. The largest number of health professionals in the NHS, after those who trained in the UK and EU, are from India, besides such UK-trained personnel of Indian origin.Health professionals of Indian heritage who passed away include Jitendra Kumar Rathod, Manjeet Singh Riyat, Krishan Arora, Rajesh Kalraiya, Pooja Sharma, Jayesh Patel, Vivek Sharma, Kamlesh Kumar Masson, Amarante Dias, Sophie Fagan, Hamza Pacheeri and Amrik Bamotra.According to Kamlesh Khunti, a medical expert at the University of Leicester, the reasons Indian and other non-white people figure more in the Covid-19 figures, despite accounting for only 14% of the UK population, include lower socioeconomic backgrounds, work in public-facing occupations, holding different cultural beliefs and behaviours or being at high risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.Several research reports published this year concluded that non-white communities have been disproportionately affected by the virus. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, Other Asian, Black Caribbean and Other Black ethnicity have between 10 and 50% higher risk of death when compared to White British, according to a report of Public Health England.It said: “When compared to previous years, we also found a particularly high increase in all cause deaths among those born outside the UK and Ireland; those in a range of caring occupations including social care and nursing auxiliaries and assistants; those who drive passengers in road vehicles for a living including taxi and minicab drivers and chauffeurs; those working as security guards and related occupations; and those in care homes”.A report by think-tank Runnymede Trust found that, besides structural inequalities, non-white groups are at greater risk from Covid-19 for various reasons.They are more likely to be working outside their home, using public transport, working in key worker roles, and living in multigenerational, overcrowded housing and therefore less able to self-isolate and shield from the virus, it said.They are also less likely to be rotected with personal protective equipment, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-death-toll-of-uk-indians-crosses-1-000/story-fWYrv1PAOI5cgWKvwJOysL.html
27-11-2020||World||For Big Tech, Biden brings a new era but no ease in scrutiny||The Obama-Biden administration was a charmed era for America’s tech companies — a moment when they were lionized as innovators, hailed as job creators and largely left alone.Now Joe Biden is coming back, this time as president. But times have changed. The halcyon days of an adoring Washington are unlikely to return when Biden takes the oath of office in January, with mounting legislative and regulatory challenges to the industry — including stronger enforcement of antitrust laws — nearly certain to outlast the tenure of President Donald Trump.“The techlash is in full force,” said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and co-director of its High Tech Law Institute.In the years since Barack Obama and Biden left the White House, the tech industry’s political fortunes have flipped. Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have come under scrutiny from Congress, federal regulators, state attorneys general and European authorities. Twitter has found itself in frequent run-ins with lawmakers over its policies for moderating content on its platform. And companies have seen their political support in Congress erode.Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle champion stronger oversight of the industry, arguing its massive market power is out of control, crushing smaller competitors and endangering consumers’ privacy. They say the companies hide behind a legal shield to allow false information to flourish on their social media networks or to entrench bias.In steps Biden, who may aim to take a bite out of the dominance of Big Tech and may welcome an opportunity to work with the opposing side to curb the power of a common adversary.As a presidential contender, Biden said the breakup of big tech companies should be considered. Dismantling the tech giants is “something we should take a really hard look at,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. He said he wants to see quickly crimped the social media companies’ long-held legal protections for speech on their platforms. And he singled out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for scorn, calling him “a real problem.”The Biden administration is also expected to press forward with the Trump Justice Department’s new antitrust lawsuit against Google, though its shape likely could be changed.But if Biden decides to pursue major legislation to overhaul the laws governing tech competition, he’ll have to navigate a tricky congressional and political landscape.Democratic lawmakers in the House, after a sweeping investigation by a Judiciary Committee panel, called last month for Congress to rein in Big Tech, possibly forcing the giants to break up their businesses while making it harder for them to acquire others and imposing new rules to safeguard competition.Those kinds of mandated breakups through a legislative overhaul would be a radical step for Congress to take and could be a bridge too far for most Republicans.Though it hasn’t been settled, Biden faces the possibility of becoming the first Democrat in modern history to take office without his party controlling Congress. Republicans would retain control of the Senate by winning one of two runoff elections in Georgia in January. Democrats have already won the House.Republican control of the Senate would force Biden to curb his ambitions and pursue a different legislative agenda, one rooted in bipartisanship. Legislation on the tech industry could be one area of possible agreement.“Biden’s strength as a senator was exactly trying to broker those kinds of deals,” noted Santa Clara University’s Goldman.But what may emerge in the end is a heavy reliance on executive power through more vigorous enforcement of existing antitrust laws, said Jerry Ellig, a former government official and professor at George Washington University’s Regulatory Studies Center. Republican lawmakers are likely to hang together in opposing fundamental changes to the tech industry, which also could affect smaller companies, while Democrats could be pulled in different directions.The Justice Department’s landmark suit last month accused Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to boost profits — the government’s most significant attempt to protect competition since its groundbreaking case against Microsoft over 20 years ago.Then there’s the issue of legal protection for speech on the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter and Google: another area of agreement between the two parties, though for different reasons.Momentum has built in Congress toward curbing some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms. Republicans accuse the companies of anti-conservative bias that erases those viewpoints on social media while allowing what they describe as extreme leftist and anti-American rhetoric to thrive.Democrats’ concern focuses on hate speech and conspiracy theories that have sometimes incited physical violence and on the amplification on tech platforms of falsehoods from Trump — most notably allegations of fraud in ballot counting in the recent election.The social media companies’ CEOs rebuffed accusations of anti-conservative bias at a Senate hearing last month and promised to aggressively defend their platforms from being used to sow chaos in the Nov. 3 election.Critics in both political parties say the immunity under Section 230 of a 1996 telecoms law enables the social media companies to abdicate their responsibility to impartially moderate content.Biden has said that Section 230 “immediately should be revoked.”Given the landscape in Congress and the factions of views on material seen by nearly everyone on the planet, quick action may be difficult.If consensus legislation does emerge, suggests George Washington’s Ellig, “They’ll make it vague enough so everyone can claim victory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-big-tech-biden-brings-a-new-era-but-no-ease-in-scrutiny/story-RGrjobj9UuixJrKzpK1l1K.html
27-11-2020||World||Iran shuts govt offices, tightening virus restrictions||Iran on Friday announced that all government offices will effectively close and operate with only essential staff, further tightening coronavirus measures as the country struggles to contain its most widespread wave of infection yet.Starting this Saturday — the first day of Iran’s workweek — state TV said “only those employees who need to be present will be at work” in government offices. Managers will make the call on who must still come to work.The report did not specify how long the closures would last, but asked Iranians to postpone any planned visits to government offices.Infections have soared in recent months, and on Friday, Iran again set a record for new virus cases in a single day with 14,051 cases, bringing the total to 922,397.Iran has also recorded more than 400 daily virus deaths since last Saturday, the same day new tightened restrictions went into effect. Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said the death toll on Friday reached 47,095, after 406 people died since Thursday.Since Saturday, some government offices and organizations had closed or began working with less than 30% of their employees, while banks, post offices, communications and other utilities worked with half their staff.Those new lockdown measures also included shuttering most businesses, shops, malls, and restaurants, and are set to last two weeks.Iran’s government had recently resisted shutting down the country in an attempt to salvage an economy cratered by unprecedented American sanctions, which effectively bar Iran from selling its oil internationally. The Trump administration reimposed sanctions in 2018 after withdrawing from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers.Earlier this month, authorities ordered a month-long nightly curfew for businesses in Tehran and 30 other major cities and towns, asking nonessential shops to keep their workers home. Still, enforcement in the sprawling metropolis remains a challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-shuts-govt-offices-tightening-virus-restrictions/story-VMHA8HohyRWwNHKBP35rFM.html
27-11-2020||World||Amid test data doubts, UK seeks temporary supply of AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine||The Boris Johnson government has requested the UK’s medicines regulator assess the suitability of Oxford/AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine for temporary supply, as soon as the company submits the necessary safety, quality and efficacy data, amid doubts regarding its trial results.The UK will be one of the first countries in the world to receive the vaccine, if authorised, with AstraZeneca expecting to have up to 4 million doses ready by the end of the year and 40mn by the end of March 2021, the Department of Health and Social Care said in a release.The UK was the first country in the world to sign an agreement with Oxford University/AstraZeneca, securing access to 100 mn doses of the vaccine, it added.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confirmed the government request and said public safety “will always come first.”Health secretary Matt Hancock said: “We have formally asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, to understand the data and determine whether it meets rigorous safety standards. This letter is an important step towards deploying a vaccine as quickly as safely possible”.The letter asks MHRA to assess the vaccine for authorisation under Regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations, which enables the temporary supply of medicines to be authorised in response to a public health need.The MHRA has already started a rolling review to determine whether the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine meets its strict standards of safety, efficacy and quality. Once the MHRA receives the full data from the company, its team of scientists and clinicians will progress its assessment.The UK government has already formally asked the MHRA to assess the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for its suitability for authorisation under Regulation 174.The UK has so far secured early access to 355mn doses of seven of the most promising vaccine candidates, including: Pfizer/BioNTech (for 40mn doses), Oxford/AstraZeneca (100mn), Moderna (5mn), GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur (60mn), Novavax (60mn), Janssen (30mn) and Valneva (60mn).Johnson on Thursday evening sounded a note of caution on relaxations announced for Christmas, asking Britons to follow guidelines strictly to prevent another spike in new cases and potentially another lockdown in early 2021. The current lockdown in England is to end on December 2, with the country moving to the earlier 3-tier alert system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-test-data-doubts-uk-seeks-temporary-supply-of-astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine/story-jo01Dj32BIhe3CYFxGOsvJ.html
27-11-2020||World||Facebook’s AI Mistakenly Bans Ads for Struggling Businesses||New York-based businesswoman Ruth Harrigan usually sells her honey and beeswax products in souvenir shops. But with Covid-19 pausing tourism, she’s been almost entirely dependent on Facebook ads to drive online sales. On Nov. 11, this new financial lifeline was abruptly cut when the social media company blocked her HoneyGramz ad account for violating its policies. She couldn’t imagine what about her tiny honey-filled gifts would have triggered the problem.Friends told Harrigan to just wait a couple of days and the problem might resolve itself. She waited, until she lost an estimated $5,000 in revenue.“I was getting a little anxious thinking, ‘Oh my God, Black Friday is around the corner, most of my sales for the year happen in November and December and that’s it,’” she explained. “I said, ‘If I’m shut down any longer than this, it’ll cripple me.’”Harrigan is one of millions of small business advertisers who have come to rely on Facebook Inc. because the coronavirus has shut down many traditional retail channels. The social media giant has provided new sales opportunities for these entrepreneurs, but also exposed them to the company’s misfiring content-moderation software, limited options for customer support and lack of transparency about how to fix problems.Facebook’s human moderators have focused on election and Covid-19 misinformation this year, so the company has leaned more on artificial intelligence algorithms to monitor other areas of the platform. That’s left many small businesses caught in Facebook’s automated filters, unable to advertise through the service and frustrated because they don’t know why.The same weekend Harrigan’s account went down, Ivonne Sanchez, who runs a permanent makeup clinic in Ottawa, found her ads were blocked too, for what Facebook said was a “policy violation.” Her business, which had to shut down between March and June for the pandemic, was relying on Facebook to recover financially. The account was restored the next day without explanation, but “in the middle of a crucial shopping season, it left us shaken,” she said. “This experience makes us very nervous about investing dollars into a system that is operated seemingly by a bot.”Even if an ad account gets restored, businesses lose crucial momentum. Facebook’s advertising algorithm takes a couple of weeks to figure out which users may be interested in an ad, to refine the targeting. Jessica Grossman, chief executive officer of digital marketing firm In Social, said when her clients get hit, the hardest part is telling them their campaigns have to start over and their money won’t go as far.“Facebook almost doesn’t realize the impact of their own algorithm and what that means,” Grossman said. There seemed to be no logic to the account bans imposed on In Social’s clients, she added. A pizza vending machine company, a reusable water bottle company, a coffee delivery service, a business coach and a hair weave company were all suspended.“We know it can be frustrating to experience any type of business disruption, especially at such a critical time of the year,” Facebook said in a statement. “While we offer free support for all businesses, we regularly work to improve our tools and systems, and to make the support we offer easier to use and access. We apologize for any inconvenience recent disruptions may have caused.”Facebook often touts its commitment to small businesses, as it defends its ever larger hold over their economic future. On a recent earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said this was a “major focus” that’s “more important now than ever” as Covid-19 shifts commerce online. During a July ad boycott by major brands, Facebook’s revenue still grew, bolstered by small businesses rushing online to try to survive. The company added more tools this year for small businesses to sell directly to customers through its site, hoping these virtual shops become advertisers, too.But while business owners agree that Facebook is a lifeline during the pandemic, they say it’s also an unreliable partner. Facebook’s ban on political ads around the U.S. election, for instance, affected companies that have no connection to politics, like a business selling bracelets to benefit refugees. A seed company was also blocked for sharing a picture of Walla Walla onions -- which were “overtly sexual,” according to Facebook’s AI.The company’s policies against cryptocurrency frequently trapped ads from a solar roof company, Human SOLR, because some of the acronyms used by the business are similar to cryptocurrency tokens. After that issue was resolved, Human SOLR’s ads were banned again for using phrases like “see if your roof qualifies.” Facebook’s software guessed the company was selling financial products, which are more regulated. After enough flags on the account, Brett Lee, who runs the business, gave up on Facebook ads. “My business is at a complete standstill,” said Lee, based in St. George, Utah. “My employees’ lives are at a standstill.”GFP Delivered, a Chicago-based produce company advertising a way for people to avoid the grocery store during Covid-19, had its Facebook ads shut down for two months without clear explanation, according to owner George Fourkas. He said he was able to fix the problem only after reaching out to old college friends who work at Facebook.Yaniv Gershom, co-founder of digital marketing firm 4AM Media, said he had to cut 12 jobs partly because of Facebook ad account bans, which have lasted almost six months. “They give you zero feedback,” he added. “The only people who are OK are massive spenders who get a Facebook rep that can escalate issues and find out what’s wrong.”In some cases, the business impact is hard to quantify. Matt Snow, co-founder of an apparel business called Boredwalk, said Facebook’s automated systems inadvertently flagged 40% of his company’s product catalog as unsafe late last month. That left Snow targeting the wrong products to potential customers. He eventually noticed and quickly resolved the issue with a Facebook sales manager, but Snow doesn’t know how long the products were banned, or even which other items were being advertised in their place. “Facebook is very black box about all their internal machinations,” he said.Facebook has been automating content moderation for years, a transition it highlights in a quarterly report detailing how much content the company removes. In more nuanced categories such as “hate speech,” Facebook removed almost 95% of violating posts automatically in the third quarter, up from just 53% two years ago.But that increase comes with more corrections. Facebook removed 22 million posts for hate speech in the third quarter, more than 3 times as many as a year earlier. The number of posts it later restored jumped by 40%.Advertisers have been particularly hurt by these automated decisions in recent months. “It just exploded. They turned up the AI recently -- somebody changed something -- and all of the sudden everybody was getting shut down,” said Justin Brooke, founder of Adskills.com, which teaches businesses how to market on Facebook. “What are these small businesses going to do? They’ve got families to feed.”One of Brooke’s own Facebook ads has a small written disclaimer saying it wasn’t open to those trying to sell adult content. That got flagged and taken down. Facebook’s automated explanation? The post didn’t follow the company’s community standards on “nudity/sexual activity.”The over-reaction by Facebook’s AI is a side effect of the company taking more responsibility for the content on its platform, according to Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of integrity. “As we take more action, we remove more content, there’s more opportunities also for those to be in error,” he said during a recent press call.That’s what HoneyGramz’s Harrigan was told happened to her account. She eventually got desperate enough to Google names of Facebook employees who might help. She found Rob Leathern, the company’s director of ad products, and sent him a message on Twitter. Miraculously, he responded. A few hours later, Facebook sent an email restoring her account.“They just said they turned it off in error,” Harrigan said. “They didn’t give me any feedback. They just reset the whole thing as if it never happened.”But Harrigan won’t forget. She printed off the email and pinned it to her office whiteboard. “It was really, really scary,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-s-ai-mistakenly-bans-ads-for-struggling-businesses/story-TtUKmz6Yv9uuGgkBd60kRM.html

Research has found that the Galleri blood test can identify many types of cancer that are difficult to diagnose at an early stage, including head and neck, ovarian, pancreatic, oesophageal and some blood cancers. If the programme shows that the test also works for people without symptoms, it will be rolled out to become routinely available. Through the pilot programme, NHS plans to increase the proportion of cancers diagnosed at an early stage to help reduce the mortality rate related to the disease. According to the healthcare agency, patients have between five and 10 times the chance of surviving when diagnosed at ‘stage one’ as against ‘stage four’.NHS chief executive Simon Stevens said in a statement that early detection, particularly for hard-to-treat conditions, has the potential to save many lives. Stevens stressed that the “promising blood test” could turn out to be a game-changer in cancer care. “This trial again confirms that the NHS is at the forefront of cutting-edge treatments and technology,” he added.Also Read | UK: PM Johnson warns of New Year lockdown as he defends new tier systemThe pilot programme is due to start in mid-2021 and will involve 165,000 people, of which 140,000 participants aged 50 to 79, with no symptoms, will have annual blood tests for three years. Another 25,000 people with possible cancer symptoms will be offered the testing to speed up their diagnosis. The results of the programme are expected by 2023.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a “hugely promising breakthrough” that could transform the way cancers are diagnosed and treated. Johnson took to Twitter to thank the scientists and the NHS for helping to make it happen. Hugely promising breakthrough that could transform how we diagnose & treat cancer which still takes too many before their time.Another example of UK scientific leadership.

Earlier, China stopped or reduced imports of beef, coal, barley, seafood, sugar and timber from Australia after it supported calls for a probe into the origin of the coronavirus pandemic, which began in China in December. China’s ruling Communist Party is trying to deflect criticism of its handling of the outbreak, which plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s, by arguing the virus came from abroad, despite little evidence to support that.Meanwhile, Australia is working on a mutual defense treaty with Japan, which Chinese leaders see as a strategic rival, and has joined Washington and Southeast Asian governments in expressing concern about China’s construction of military facilities on islands in the disputed South China Sea, a busy trade route.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman called on Australia to “do something conducive” to improve relations but gave no details.Read more | China says India’s latest app ban order violates WTO rules“Some people in Australia adhering to the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice have repeatedly taken wrong words and deeds on issues concerning China’s core interests,” said the spokesman, Zhao Lijian.Australia should “take China’s concerns seriously, instead of harming China’s national interests under the banner of safeguarding their own national interests,” Zhao said. Australia’s main stock market index fell 0.5% on Friday following the news.“To a certain extent, this is Australia’s fault for allowing itself to become a one-trick pony export-wise to China,” market analyst Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a report. The Chinese market is especially important at a time when China is recovering from the coronavirus while the United States, Europe and other major economies are struggling with anti-disease controls that depress demand.The Ministry of Commerce said the wine tariffs are in response to complaints Chinese producers were damaged by improperly low-priced Australian imports. Australia’s government denied subsidizing wine exports. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said the accumulation of Chinese sanctions suggested they were due to “other factors” but gave no details.“The Australian government categorically rejects any allegation that our wine producers are dumping product into China,” Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said.Australia has imposed restrictions meant to block foreign influence in its politics following complaints Beijing might be trying to manipulate its government. Australia also has joined the United States in imposing curbs on use of technology from Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei Technologies Ltd. on security grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slaps-200-tax-on-australia-wine-amid-tensions/story-Ri5n2D6CuB2VlL7Ue6oT1L.html

The move by CAO, one of the largest buyers of jet fuel in Asia, comes as Chinese domestic air travel continues to recover after the pandemic-driven destruction.Tourism has rebounded in China after early and aggressive measures by the country to tackle the coronavirus proved effective in curbing its spread. The nation’s success in warding off a major outbreak during the Golden Week holiday in early October could also help boost optimism for locals preparing to travel back home during the Lunar New Year break.Traders expect a rise in Chinese jet fuel imports ahead of the extended holiday in February, even as overall volumes are forecast to remain well below 2019 levels.CAO’s activity is a positive sign that China’s jet fuel consumption is improving, said Fenglei Shi, an analyst at IHS Markit. However, buying is partly driven by the incentive to stock up ahead of the Spring Festival when travel usually peaks, and there are still some uncertainties after the holiday ends, she said.While China’s typically a net exporter of jet fuel, the country also imports the fuel in an opportunistic manner.China’s domestic aviation has been a rare recovery story in the midst of a suffering global jet fuel market, with local flights last month at about 88% of the levels seen a year earlier. IHS Markit expects jet fuel demand to reach 95% of 2019’s level by this month..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-seeks-to-import-jet-fuel-ahead-of-lunar-new-year-holidays/story-rOrqGumVivQQFBpQqopGfM.html
27-11-2020||World||UK: PM Johnson warns of New Year lockdown as he defends new tier system||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was on Friday fighting back rebels from within his own Conservative Party who are opposed to most of England being put into the toughest two tiers of high Covid-19 alert after the country’s second stay-at-home lockdown ends next Wednesday. In a Downing Street briefing on Thursday after he ended his self-isolation on being in contact with a Covid-19 positive MP, Johnson defended the three-tier system as the best chance of avoiding a third complete national lockdown in the New Year. “If we ease off now, we risk losing control of this virus all over again, casting aside our hard won gains, and forcing us back into a New Year national lockdown with all the damage that would mean,” said Johnson.Also Read: UK shares poised for weekly loss on Covid-19 vaccine doubts, Brexit concerns “Under our Winter Plan, England will return to a tiered system of local restrictions. Our decisions on which area enters which tier are based on public health advice according to five indicators: cases across all ages, especially the over 60s, the rate by which cases are rising or falling, the percentage of those tested in a local population who have Covid-19, and the pressure on the NHS,” he said. However, the Covid Recovery Group (CRG), made up of Tory backbenchers within his party, said it was “authoritarianism at work”. “There is no logic whatsoever in having a month of lockdown only for people to have to live under an even more severe set of restrictions afterwards,” said Harriett Baldwin, the Tory MP for West Worcestershire, which has been placed in Tier 2. Johnson has a comfortable 80-strong majority in the House of Commons, but if 40 of his own MPs vote down his Winter Plan when it comes for a vote next Tuesday, he will have to rely on support from the Opposition to get it through. And, the Labour Party is expected to decide only early next week whether to back the plans after consultation with government coronavirus experts. Under plans laid out in the Commons on Thursday, only three areas of England – Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly – have been placed into the lowest Tier 1 or the medium restrictions category, with most of England either in Tier 2 or 3.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic Under the highest Tier 3 alert level, there is a complete ban on mixing of households except in limited outdoor settings. For Tier 2, the rule of six applies with up to six members of different households allowed to meet outdoors and under Tier 1, the rule of six applies both indoors and outdoors. Unlike before, gyms and close-contact beauty services like hairdressers will be able to open in all tiers but government guidance says that people in all tiers who can work from home should continue to do so. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the authority to set their own coronavirus regulations but all four UK nations have agreed a joint plan for Christmas, allowing up to three households to get together in a bubble between December 23 and 27. However, Scotland has set out further advice on what the so-called “Christmas bubble” can comprise of, with an eight-adult limit. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland entered another tough new lockdown on Friday as a two-week “circuit breaker”. Non-essential retailers have been told to close except for click-and-collect services and cafes and restaurants can only provide a take-away service. Wales has also been implementing similar measures and continues to impose tough social distancing measures. It comes as the UK recorded 498 Covid-related deaths in the last 24 hours and 17,555 new cases of coronavirus, with the death toll from the virus now over 57,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-johnson-warns-of-new-year-lockdown-as-he-defends-new-tier-system/story-RBpNcAV44vyGdR3rf4ILiI.html
27-11-2020||World||Chinese universities teaching Hindi hold Bollywood movie dubbing contest||Students from more than a dozen top Chinese universities where Hindi is taught have taken part in the first competition of its kind in the country to dub dialogues from a Bollywood movie of their choice.In an initiative by the prestigious Beijing International Studies University’s (BISU) School of Asian Studies, 80 videos in Hindi from 14 Chinese universities across the country have been submitted.Titled “Hindi Oral Competition”, the online event was hosted by the Chinese Association for South Asian Language Studies. The students were given a choice of five Hindi movies from which they could pick the dialogues: Mohabbatein, Bajrangi Bhaijan, 3 Idiots, Secret Superstar and Dangal.Many of the students who have submitted videos are enrolled in some of China’s leading educational institutions including Peking University, Communication University of China, Beijing Foreign Studies University, Guangdong University of Foreign studies, and Yunnan Nationalities University.“The rules were these: Each student had a time limit of three to five minutes in which they had to dub their favourite dialogue – in Hindi – from one of the five movies. That part of the movie will play in the background,” explained Zhang Yaneng, Hindi lecturer at BISU’s Hindi department, adding that the planning took about two months.“We set up standards for assessment,” she said.The students of Hindi will be tested on their pronunciation, intonation and the quality of the video and the techniques they used to record it, said Zhang, who is known as Soumya among her peers.Some of the top names associated with Hindi in China are part of this competition and will be judging the participants.It includes Jiang Jinkui, head of the Centre for South Asian Studies and the Hindi department at Beijing’s Peking University, who is a consultant for the competition.Hindi experts from several universities including Shanghai Foreign Language University and Xi’an International Studies University are associated with the competition.There are eight judges and an Indian consultant, Prof Rakesh Vats, who will declare the winners in December, Zhang added.Initially, BISU’s Hindi department professors and students had planned to hold the competition among themselves.Subsequently, it was decided to expand its scope and involve Hindi departments of universities across China.“Earlier, similar competitions had been held in Beijing or Tianjin (a city about 100 km from Beijing). This is the first time it is being held nationally,” Zhang told HT.The history of Hindi in China dates back at least to 1942, seven years before the People’s Republic of China under the Communist party was formed.In 1942, under Chiang Kai-shek, the then Chinese government established the National Institute of Eastern languages in Yunnan and officially initiated the teaching of modern Indian languages including Hindi in China.The seeds were sown during the visits of former PM, then Indian National Congress leader, Jawaharlal Nehru to China in 1939, followed by Chiang’s India visit in 1942.The language continued to be taught in China even during the tumultuous decade (1966-76) of the Cultural Revolution.This year’s competition has taken on added importance despite the chill in ties because of the border friction – 2020 marks the 70th year of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between the two neighbours.“Our inspiration was the 70 years of Sino-India relationship. The competition is our tribute to the ties between the two countries,” Zhang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-universities-teaching-hindi-hold-bollywood-movie-dubbing-contest/story-9liEdJtOhnvnWPp4yMY4nN.html
27-11-2020||World||Another week gone, Brexit trade talks remain stuck||The European Union said Friday that another week of talks with Britain on a new trade deal has gone with barely any progress. Its chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is heading to London for ever-more pressing weekend negotiations to avoid chaos when Britain’s trade agreements with the EU end at New Year.Barnier emerged from a Covid-19 quarantine on Friday and said that after a week of remote video talks the “same significant divergences persist.”The lack of progress is frustrating since the EU had sounded optimistic about a deal last Friday and had committed to be “creative” in its approach during the final stages of the talks. Barnier was on Friday briefing EU member states and the EU parliament, which all have to give their consent to any deal reached with the UK.The three most divisive issues remain EU fishing rights in UK waters, compliance guarantees on any deal reached and the standards the UK must meet to export into the EU.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said substantial and important differences remained with the European Union on a Brexit trade deal.“Clearly there are substantial and important differences still to be bridged but we’re getting on with it,” Johnson told reporters. “The likelihood of a deal is very much determined by our friends and partners in the EU - there’s a deal there to be done if they want to do it.” (with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-week-gone-brexit-trade-talks-remain-stuck/story-tQXm8SHUB6kg6D3AuytFpJ.html
27-11-2020||World||New UK regulator to rein in Google, Facebook, other tech giants||Tech giants such as Google and Facebook will be subject to a new UK regime to give consumers more choice and control over their data, help small businesses thrive, and ensure news outlets are not forced out by bigger rivals, business secretary Alok Sharma announced on Friday.A dedicated Digital Markets Unit to be set up within the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in April will work closely with regulators including Ofcom and the Information Commissioner’s Office to introduce and enforce a new code to govern the behaviour of the tech giants.Officials said online platforms bring huge benefits for businesses and society, but there is growing consensus in the UK and abroad that the concentration of power within a small number of tech companies is curtailing growth in the tech sector, reducing innovation, and potentially having negative impacts on the people and businesses that rely on them.The new code will set clear expectations for platforms that have considerable market power - known as strategic market status - over what represents acceptable behaviour when interacting with competitors and users.Under the new code, platforms including those funded by digital advertising could be required to be more transparent about the services they provide and how they are using consumers’ data, give consumers a choice over whether to receive personalised advertising, and prevented from placing restrictions on their customers that make it hard for them to use rival platforms.The new unit could be given powers to suspend, block and reverse decisions of tech giants, order them to take certain actions to achieve compliance with the code, and impose financial penalties for non-compliance.Sharma said: “Digital platforms like Google and Facebook make a significant contribution to our economy and play a massive role in our day-to-day lives - whether it’s helping us stay in touch with our loved ones, share creative content or access the latest news”.“But the dominance of just a few big tech companies is leading to less innovation, higher advertising prices and less choice and control for consumers. Our new, pro-competition regime for digital markets will ensure consumers have choice, and mean smaller firms aren’t pushed out”.The officials said the code could be used to ensure platforms are not applying unfair terms, conditions or policies to certain business customers, including news publishers. Currently, dominant online platforms can impose terms on news publishers that limit their ability to monetise their content - severely impacting their ability to thrive.The new code will govern commercial arrangements between publishers and platforms to help keep publishers in business, helping enhance the sustainability of high-quality online journalism and news publishing in the UK.According to a CMA study, Google has significant market power in the general search market and in search advertising, and Facebook has significant market power in the social media market and in display advertising.Nearly £14 billion was spent on digital advertising in the UK in 2019, around 80% of which was spent on Google and Facebook. The CMA noted that the number of advertisements that consumers are exposed to on digital platforms is increasing, with adverts seen per hour on Facebook rising from 40-50 in 2016 to 50-60 in 2019. Its average revenue per user is now more than 10 times higher than competitors, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-uk-regulator-to-rein-in-google-facebook-other-tech-giants/story-FfLXh8G3WEtUmhbgCFIV2H.html

In a subsequent tweet, the US president said that Section 230 must be immediately terminated for purposed of “national security”.  For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!!What is Section 230?Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was enacted to protect owners of any “interactive computer service” from liability for content published by third-party. The piece of legislation is considered extremely vital for social media networks since the firm can not be held accountable for the millions of content posted by users. The law was passed in 1996 as a part of the Communications Decency Act, which encouraged the emergence of a new form of communication in the internet era. However, it doesn’t protect copyright violations, sex work-related material, and violations of federal criminal law. It also allows social media platforms to remove posts that are obscene or violate the company’s policies, so long as they are acting in “good faith.”Also Read | Social media CEOs get earful on bias, warning of new limitsRepublicans cry anti-conservative biasDuring a Congressional hearing, the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook and Google were accused of anti-conservative bias on the social media platforms.

Thank you to my family and friends...thinking of my dad today,” Kahlon said in a tweet.The task before him will be tough especially as Canada and BC are witnessing a second wave surge of coronavirus cases.The province’s Premier John Horgan made clear the challenge that lies before Kahlon.“Mr Kahlon is taking on an enormous responsibility. The recovery initiatives that we announced in September will now be overseen by Ravi,” media outlet Vancouver Sun quoted him as saying.“We have had a cross-government approach to recovery from the beginning, but Ravi will be the point person.”Also back in the New Democratic Party government’s cabinet is veteran Harry Bains, who was a minister in the outgoing government as well. He will have charge of labour.While Kahlon was originally appointed a parliamentary secretary when the Horgan-led NDP formed a coalition government in 2017, the party now has a majority mandate. Another Indo-Canadian who will feature in the government will be Niki Sharma, who has been named parliamentary secretary for community development and non-profits.While Kahlon and Bains are Sikhs, Sharma is of Hindu heritage.Another veteran Jinny Sims, who had been a cabinet minister when the first Horgan government was formed, has been dropped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/three-indo-canadian-politicians-get-key-positions-in-british-columbia-govt/story-ZPC95fOjnSNbLlV5kKnGKN.html

It is seeking 20-50 million doses from China’s Sinovac and US firm Pfizer among others. AstraZeneca is one of five vaccine makers that have applied to hold late-stage trials in the Philippines and the supply deal comes amid questions over the results of one such study elsewhere.

Baleg, which sets parliament’s legislative agenda, will decide whether to prioritise the new proposals over its own revision to BI laws in coming days, deputy chairman Achmad Baidowi told Reuters.In September, BI Governor Perry Warjiyo said in a parliamentary hearing he had been consulted by the government about a planned bill seeking to widen BI’s mandate. He said in reality BI has already taken into account economic performance when reviewing policy.BI has this year cut interest rates a total of 125 basis points, pumped some $48 billion into the financial system and relaxed lending rules to lift Southeast Asia’s largest economy out of its first recession in more than two decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-s-new-bill-seeks-to-expand-central-bank-mandate-formalise-bond-purchase/story-7ViKhlEfKTNFR39v1zLDwL.html

27-11-2020||World||Pakistan Cabinet approves chemical castration of rapists, special courts for rape trials||Pakistan’s Cabinet has approved two anti-rape ordinances which called for the chemical castration of rapists with the consent of the convict and setting up of special courts for rape trials, according to a media report on Friday. A meeting of the Cabinet committee on legislative cases chaired by federal Law Minister Farogh Naseem on Thursday approved the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Ordinance 2020 and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance 2020. The ordinances have already been approved in-principle by the federal Cabinet on Tuesday, the Dawn News reported.The concept of chemical castration for first or repeated offenders has been introduced mainly as a form of rehabilitation, and subject to consent of the convict, it said.According to law minister Naseem, it is mandatory under the international law to take consent of the convict before castrating him.In case, chemical castration is ordered without taking consent, the convict might challenge this before a court of law, he said.If a convict would not agree to castration, he would be dealt with in accordance with the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) under which the court might award him death sentence, life imprisonment or 25-year jail term, the minister said.However, he said, it is up to the court to decide the punishment. The judge may order chemical castration or the punishment under the PPC.Also Read | Rise in crimes against women, children in Mumbai in 2019-2020: Praja Foundation reportThe court might order castration for a limited period or lifetime, Naseem said.The ordinances also provide for setting up of special courts to conduct trial in rape cases. Special prosecutors for the special courts will also be appointed. As per the proposed legislations, anti-rape crisis cells headed by a commissioner or deputy commissioner will be set up to ensure prompt registration of an FIR, medical examination and forensic analysis.It also bar the cross-examination of a rape survivor by the accused. Only judge and the accused’s lawyers will be able to cross-examine the survivor.The proposed laws include in-camera trials, witness protection for the victim and witnesses, use of modern devices during investigation and trial, legal assistance to the victims and appointment of independent support advisers for the victims.It prohibits the controversial “two-finger” test performed on rape survivors. The World Health Organisation has already declared the test as “unscientific, medically unnecessary and unreliable”. Human Rights groups have also termed the test as invasive, disrespectful and a gross violation of a woman’s right to dignity and privacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-cabinet-approves-chemical-castration-of-rapists-special-courts-for-rape-trials/story-VwPfi7bYCYm7Fh7GgHx2MN.html
27-11-2020||World||Census gives Trump a final Supreme Court showdown on immigration||President Donald Trump’s administration has one last blockbuster showdown at the Supreme Court over his divisive immigration policies, and this one goes to the heart of how US political power is allocated.In an argument set for Monday, the administration will seek the right to exclude undocumented immigrants from the census count used to divvy up congressional seats and federal funds. The move would change more than two centuries of practice in a nation that has always counted non-citizen residents, even those in the US illegally.The administration is racing to finish the count, and submit a report to Congress, before Joe Biden is inaugurated to succeed Trump on January 20. Critics say Trump is trying to manipulate the numbers at the expense of Democratic-leaning areas with high immigrant populations. The push could mean fewer seats for Texas, California and possibly New York and New Jersey.“This case is about the basic constitutional requirements for how political representation is divided in this country,” said Dale Ho, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who will argue against the Trump plan on Monday. “For 230 years, it’s been on the basis of people living in each state, and what the administration wants to do is a radical departure from that.”The 80-minute session Monday is Trump’s biggest remaining Supreme Court argument in a presidency defined by polarizing legal battles over immigration.Since 2018, the court has upheld Trump’s restrictions on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, blocked his addition of a citizenship question to the census and stopped him from rescinding the DACA deferred-deportation program. The justices also let Trump force asylum applicants to wait in Mexico and cleared him to use redirected Pentagon funds to build fencing along the Mexican border.The court has put the latest census case on a fast track, making a ruling possible by the end of the year. But the challenge is just one of several hurdles Trump will have to overcome to accomplish his goal.With the pandemic slowing the count, Census Bureau officials have told the Commerce Department they can’t produce the state population totals until after Trump leaves office, the New York Times reported last week. And even if Trump can send Congress the numbers, lawmakers could still reject the tally, and Biden might be able to submit a revised report after he becomes president.Read more | Donald Trump calls into Pennsylvania event, urges overturning electionLooming DeadlinesStill, the focus next week will be the Supreme Court, as Trump tries to take advantage of the 6-3 conservative majority he helped create. The president is defending his July 21 memorandum making it administration policy to exclude undocumented immigrants from the count. The memo tells the Commerce secretary to send the president a tally that excludes that group, along with a separate set of numbers showing the total population.Current federal law requires the Commerce secretary to send the census figures to the president by Dec. 31, and the president to send Congress the numbers for allocating House seats by Jan. 10.Three lower courts around the country have said the Trump policy violates either the Constitution or federal statutes. In the case directly before the justices, a three-judge panel in New York said the plan runs afoul of the U.S. Census Act, which requires the Commerce secretary to show the “tabulation of total population by states” and says the president must give Congress “the whole numbers of persons in each state.”Critics of the Trump push say those words leave no room for interpretation. That’s an argument that could resonate with Trump’s three Supreme Court appointees -- Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett -- all of whom advocate interpreting laws strictly according to their text.“It’s difficult to know how Congress could have been any more plain than they already were unless they put in parentheses ‘and we really mean it,’” said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.Read more| Donald Trump says he will leave office if Joe Biden’s victory confirmedPresidential DiscretionThe Trump administration contends the laws leave room for the president to exclude people who are in the country illegally. The administration’s top Supreme Court lawyer, acting U.S. Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall, argued in court papers that the phrase “persons in each state” means “inhabitants,” a term whose application requires the use of judgment.“The president need not treat all illegal aliens as ‘inhabitants’ of the states and thereby allow their defiance of federal law to distort the allocation of the people’s representatives,” Wall argued.Supporters of the president’s effort say his approach is long overdue.“What’s at stake is whether the American people are represented in Congress or whether others who are not part of the American people are also represented in Congress,” said Christopher Hajec, director of litigation at the Immigration Reform Law Institute.The administration must also defend against contentions that the plan is unconstitutional. In a separate case in California, a court said Trump was violating a constitutional provision that requires congressional seats to be apportioned according to the “whole number of persons in each state.”‘Biggest Hurdle’The Trump memo is being challenged by states led by New York and advocacy groups represented by the ACLU. Their biggest obstacle at the Supreme Court is likely to be a procedural one: Trump’s contention that they don’t currently have “standing” to challenge the plan because they lack a legal stake in the outcome.Trump’s contention that they don’t currently have legal “standing” to challenge the plan.In letting the suit go forward, the three-judge panel said the plan to exclude undocumented immigrants could chill participation in the census. But with the survey now complete, that argument for standing is questionable at best. And the Trump administration says any impact on congressional apportionment is too speculative at this stage to allow a lawsuit.“Whether the memorandum will result in the exclusion of a number of illegal aliens sufficient to impact apportionment is unknown,” Wall argued. “The executive branch thus should be allowed to implement the memorandum, at which point suit can be brought by any actually injured parties.”Ho, the ACLU lawyer, called standing “the biggest hurdle” for the challengers. But he pointed to a prediction in the Trump memo that California would lose two or three seats without undocumented immigrants.“The purpose of the memorandum was to change the way that Congress is apportioned,” Ho said. “It sort of strains credulity for the government to be saying, ‘We don’t know if this is going to change the apportionment.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/census-gives-trump-a-final-supreme-court-showdown-on-immigration/story-HhFg4JmPAplwODQ9lITMYO.html
27-11-2020||World||Germany passes 1 million Covid cases since start of pandemic||Germany’s total coronavirus cases exceeded 1 million for the first time late Thursday, passing the grim milestone around 10 months after the country reported the first infections.Cases in Europe’s biggest economy have more than tripled since the start of October, with the number of people with the disease in intensive care climbing to record levels.Germany recorded 21,951 new infections in the 24 hours through Friday morning, taking the total to 1,017,830, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The number of deaths rose by 430, the biggest gain since April 16’s record of 510.Like other European nations, Germany has imposed stricter measures in recent weeks to stop the disease from spreading. Chancellor Angela Merkel and the leaders of Germany’s 16 states agreed Wednesday to tighten limits on private gatherings but kept schools and most businesses operating to help limit the impact on the economy.Read more | Germany extends partial shutdown to curb virus spreadIn contrast to nations like France and the UK, Germany’s curbs have yielded little progress in slowing the disease’s spread. Infection levels are still nearly three times the government’s target rate and fatalities have exceeded 300 for four straight days, the first time that’s occurred since the start of the pandemic.“The case numbers have stagnated at far too high a level,” Merkel told lawmakers on Thursday. She wants the seven-day incidence per 100,000 citizens to come down to around 50 -- and stay there -- before restrictions can be loosened. It was at 138 on Thursday, according to the latest report from the RKI public health institute.“We undoubtedly have some difficult months ahead of us again,” Merkel said before urging citizens to do everything they can to avoid a “worst-case scenario.”The chancellor said restrictions will likely remain in place until early January, while her chief of staff raised the possibility of them being extended until March. On a more positive note, Merkel said it’s possible that a vaccine for the virus will be available before Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-passes-1-million-covid-cases-since-start-of-pandemic/story-daKXW8zaG2oDXiHLZMLlTI.html
27-11-2020||World||Turkey rejects European Parliament call for sanctions over Cyprus||Turkey on Friday rejected a call by the European Parliament for sanctions against Ankara over President Tayyip Erdogan’s recent visit to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in north Cyprus, calling the demand “disconnected from the realities”.On Thursday, the European Union’s parliament agreed a non-binding resolution in support of EU member Cyprus urging EU leaders to “take action and impose tough sanctions” against Turkey, a move likely to bolster support for France’s push for sanctions on Ankara at an EU summit next month.Turkey is at odds with EU members Greece and Cyprus over hydrocarbon exploration in disputed east Mediterranean waters.Erdogan incensed Cyprus, whose territory covers the southern half of the partitioned Mediterranean island, on Nov. 15 by visiting Varosha, a resort on the island that has been fenced-off and abandoned in no-man’s land since 1974.Ankara supported the partial reopening of Varosha last month in a move criticised by the United States, Greece and Greek Cypriots.Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy denounced the resolution and accused the European Parliament of being “prejudiced and disconnected from the realities” on Cyprus.“If this approach and mentality are maintained, it would not be possible for EU bodies to make a constructive contribution to the settlement of the Cyprus issue,” Aksoy said.Cyprus has been divided since a 1974 Turkish invasion after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Only Ankara recognises northern Cyprus as an independent state, but not the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government to the south.France has not yet drawn up sanctions against Turkey, but diplomats say any measures would probably target areas of Turkey’s economy linked to natural gas exploration in seas off the coast of Cyprus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-rejects-european-parliament-call-for-sanctions-over-cyprus/story-bnvQJPkMC3clqm1pmCzEbK.html

The success means Australia will be among a handful of western nations that can look forward to Christmas with limited restrictions on family gatherings and what authorities are calling a Covid-normal summer.The 28-day run is “an extraordinary achievement psychologically as well as practically, in terms of opening up the economy,” said Sanjaya Senanayake, an infectious diseases physician and associate professor of medicine at the Australian National University in Canberra. But there’s no room for complacency, he warned, and Australia faces on an ongoing risk of the virus entering the community from returned overseas travellers -- despite a mandatory system of hotel quarantine.“The reality is, no matter how careful people are, there can always be that accidental breach or a breach where you can’t even identify the source,” Senanayake said.More than 30,000 Australians, many living in Europe and the US where the virus is rampant, are waiting to return home.Also Read |  Australia opens up more borders in domestic travel boost, eyes vaccineBungled security at quarantine hotels in Victoria, which reportedly included guards sleeping with guests, saw the virus escape into the community -- leading to the three-month lockdown in Melbourne. Meanwhile, in neighboring South Australia, authorities are investigating how two security guards, a cleaner and two returned travellers contracted the virus while in hotel quarantine -- seeding a cluster of infections in the state that’s grown to at least 31.While 28 days with no mystery cases of Covid-19 is the working definition for eliminating community transmission, the Victoria government remains wary.“Now is not the time to be complacent,” Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said in a statement. “Recent wastewater testing demonstrates there may still be virus in the community and a real risk remains with arriving interstate travelers or the emergence of new local cases. Our fight against Covid-19 is not over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-toughest-lockdown-pays-off-with-no-covid-19-cases-for-28-days/story-xKtJPOpMAYoD5V3y5MCznL.html
27-11-2020||World||China to impose temporary anti-dumping measures on Australian wine imports||Australia has responded defiantly to China imposing anti-dumping tariffs on Australian wine, saying the “seriously concerning development” looks to be about diplomatic grievances and not any action by winemakers.China will impose temporary anti-dumping tariffs of 107.1% to 212.1% on wine imported from Australia from Nov. 28, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said on Friday.Australia’s trade minister Simon Birmingham said the tariffs were unjustifiable and it was a distressing time for hundreds of wine producers because it “will render unviable for many businesses, their wine trade with China”. China takes 37 per cent of Australia’s total wine exports, an industry worth AU$2.9 billion, the government said.Last week China outlined a list of grievances about Australia’s foreign investment, national security and human rights policy, saying Canberra needed to correct its actions to restore the bilateral relationship with its largest trading partner.“China’s recent comments gives the perception that it’s more about their grievances around those matters, rather than in fact around anything any industry has done wrong,” Australia’s agriculture minister David Littleproud told media on Friday.He added, “It just doesn’t worry Australian exporters, it worries exporters from around the world.”China began an anti-dumping probe in August at the request of the Chinese Alcoholic Drinks Association, but in Canberra the preliminary decision to impose tariffs was viewed as part of a pattern of punitive trade measures since Australia called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.Birmingham pointed to “the cumulative impact of China’s trade sanctions against a number of Australian industries” and said if they were a response to other factors this would be “completely incompatible with the commitments China has given” to the World Trade Organisation.This year China has imposed tariffs on Australian barley, suspended meat imports, and Chinese importers were told to expect customs delays across seven categories of Australian products from coal to seafood from November.Importers bringing in Australian wine will need to pay deposits to China’s customs authority, which will be calculated based on different rates the authority has assigned to various companies, according to the statement. The rate required of Treasury Wine was 169.3%, the highest among all the named wine firms in the statement. Shares of Australia’s Treasury Wine Estates Ltd, the world’s largest listed winemaker, fell more than 13% before being put on a trading halt pending an announcement.An importer of Australian wine in Shanghai told Reuters:”I will stop importing Australian wines for at least 3 months to see how things go. Many importers will stop the business, according to what I know, because it is simple not workable with such a deposit.”Casella Wines will require a 160.2% deposit, Swan Vintage will require 107.1%. For Australian wines that are not named on the list, the rate is 212.1%.The Australian government will hold a meeting with winemakers on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-impose-temporary-anti-dumping-measures-on-australian-wine-imports/story-TPfDDOhL9UsHQtpVHg0ZaP.html

But he vowed to continue pursuing poll fraud allegations until then, undeterred by the dismal impact of his lawsuits and challenges.“Certainly, I will, and you know that,” Trump said when asked by reporters if he will leave the White House, which has become a concern as he has refused to acknowledge the outcome despite losing to Biden by a wide margin of 306-232 in Electoral College votes, and by over 5 million popular votes.Trump has not conceded yet. But he told reporters after the traditional Thanksgiving messages to US armed forces that he will if the Electoral College elected Biden.  Watch | Trump says he’ll leave WH if Electoral College seats Biden; snaps at reporter“It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede,” he said, adding, “If they do, they made a mistake.”Americans don’t vote to directly elect their president.

Trump is trying to subvert the process and use this stage to further delay the inevitable.The electors will meet in their respective states on December 8 to elect the president. And on the basis of the current projected count — pending complete certification of results by all states — Biden will win 306 of the 528 total votes, to Trump’s 232.

You cannot save your way through a crisis,” said Greens lawmaker Sven-Christian Kindler.Planned new debt of 179.82 billion euros for next year compares to 96 billion euros initially envisaged by Finance Minister Olaf Scholz in September.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has taken unprecedented steps to help companies and small businesses get through the crisis, freeing up billions of euros to prevent the economy shrinking further. To fund the measures, it needs to borrow more than planned.Also Read | Amazon unions from Brazil to Germany plan Black Friday protestsParliament this year suspended Germany’s debt brake in the constitution to allow the government to take on net new debt of up to 218 billion euros to finance rescue and stimulus measures. However, coalition sources have said it was unlikely to need the full amount.Merkel’s government expects the economy to shrink by a calendar-adjusted 5.9% in 2020 and rebound by 4.4% in 2021.Merkel and state premiers agreed on Wednesday to extend and tighten a partial coronavirus lockdown which will see bars, restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues stay shut until at least Dec 20. Financial support for businesses that have been closed since Nov 2 due to the pandemic will be extended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-plans-nearly-180-billion-euros-in-new-debt-for-2021/story-JaR4QVtwjUcONyduIQRBgK.html

Still, his statements reveal growing tensions over the vaccine rollout in Latin America’s biggest country, with the world’s second-highest COVID-19 death toll.Critics of President Jair Bolsonaro argue he is threatening the independence of Anvisa with political appointees to gain leverage over governors and other rivals.In a video interview on the news website Metropoles, Doria said Sao Paulo could use the vaccine from Sinovac Biotech Ltd based on approval from regulators in other countries.“Today, there is suspicion that Anvisa could suffer political interference from the presidency and could fail to be an independent agency as it should be, as it must be,” he said.He added the state would consider the vaccine appropriate for use if approved by authorities “in the United States, in Europe and, above all, in Asia.”In a statement, Anvisa said that was impossible.“It is important to clarify that the tacit approval of vaccines by other agencies ... is not foreseen in the law,” the regulator said. “Even after it is approved in another country, Anvisa’s approval is necessary.”Doria, a staunch opponent of Bolsonaro, has already ordered the construction of facilities to produce the Sinovac vaccine, which is currently undergoing late-stage trials in Sao Paulo and elsewhere in Brazil.Bolsonaro, a strident China critic, has frequently dismissed the Sinovac vaccine, known as Coronavac, saying he is concerned about its “origin.”So far, the federal government’s principal bet has been on a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca, though federal health officials have also held discussions with other vaccine developers, such as Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer Ltd .

27-11-2020||World||UK asks regulator to assess AZ-Oxford vaccine amid questions||The British government said Friday it has formally asked the country’s medicines regulator to assess whether a coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University should be authorized for use.The step comes amid questions about preliminary results from trials of the jab, after the company and the university acknowledged that the most encouraging part of their findings stemmed from a dosing error.UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he had asked the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency to determine whether the vaccine “meets rigorous safety standards.”It’s the second vaccine candidate to reach the formal assessment stage in Britain, following a shot developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. A third vaccine from U.S. firm Moderna is not far behind.The British government has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and plans to start distributing it in December if it gains approval.The regulator said it could not give a time frame for possible approval of the vaccinesMHRA Chief Executive June Raine said “no vaccine would be authorized for supply in the U.K. unless the expected standards of safety, quality and efficacy are met.”Oxford and AstraZeneca reported Monday that their vaccine appeared to be 62% effective in people who received two doses, and 90% effective when volunteers were given a half dose followed by a full dose. They did not mention at the time, but later acknowledged, that a manufacturing issue had resulted in “a half dose of the vaccine being administered as the first dose” to some participants.The drugmakers informed the U.K. regulator of the issue when it was discovered, and it was agreed to complete the late-stage trial with two groups.AstraZeneca has said it plans to conduct a new global clinical trial to assess the vaccine’s efficacy but does not expect that to delay regulatory approval in Britain or the European Union -- though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may take longer.Some scientists have expressed concerns about gaps in the data and the way the results were reported. Only 2,741 people received the half dose, making it hard to know if the effectiveness seen in the group is real or a statistical quirk. A total of 8,895 people received two full doses.Eleanor Riley, professor of Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Edinburgh, said Oxford and AstraZeneca needed to answer questions about their results “clearly and completely.”“Trust is at a premium when it comes to vaccines and we must not do anything that might in any way undermine that trust,” she said.Full results are due to be published in medical journal The Lancet, though no date has been given.Pfizer and BioNTech said earlier this month that their vaccine is 95% effective, and Moderna said its product appears to be 94.5% effective, according to preliminary data.Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab does not need to be stored at freezer temperatures, making it potentially easier to distribute, especially in developing countries. It is also cheaper, because AstraZeneca has agreed not to profit from it during the pandemic.The British government and its scientific advisers have expressed confidence that multiple vaccines will win approval, but say all decisions are up to the regulator.“They will make an assessment with lots of data that is not currently public domain on efficacy and on safety,” said England’s Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty.“I think it’s always a mistake to make too many judgements early before we have the full information and particularly before the regulator, the independent regulator, has had their chance to look at the data and make an assessment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-asks-regulator-to-assess-az-oxford-vaccine-amid-questions/story-7hAIv3zBqzHeQsIkKpjmsK.html
27-11-2020||World||Empty seats, delivered feasts as coronavirus ‘changes’ Thanksgiving||Vivian Zayas can’t keep herself from scrolling through photos of last Thanksgiving, when her mother stood at the stove to make a big pot of rice and beans and then took a seat at the edge of the table.That was before anyone had heard of Covid-19 and before it claimed the retired seamstress. Ana Martinez died at 78 on April 1 while recovering at a nursing home from a knee replacement.The family is having their traditional meal of turkey, yams, green beans and rice and beans — but Zayas is removing a seat from the table at her home in Deer Park, New York, and putting her mother’s walker in its place.“It’s a painful Thanksgiving. You don’t even know, should you celebrate?” asked Zayas. “It’s a lonely time.”The family is left with “an empty chair at the table forever,” another daughter, Alexa Rivera, said Thursday.Americans are marking the Thanksgiving holiday amid an unrelenting pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than a quarter of a million people in the United States.Turkey and pies will still come out ovens, football will still be on TV, families will still give thanks and have lively conversations about politics. But this holiday has been utterly altered after months filled with sorrows and hardships: Many feasts are weighed down by the loss of loved ones; others have been canceled or scaled back with the virus surging.Zoom and FaceTime calls have become a fixture at dinner tables to connect with family members who don’t want to travel. Far fewer volunteers are helping at soup kitchens or community centers. A Utah health department has been delivering boxes of food to residents who are infected with the virus and can’t go to the store. A New York nursing home is offering drive-up visits for families of residents struggling with celebrating the holiday alone.“The holidays make it a little harder,” said Harriet Krakowsky, an 85-year-old resident of the Hebrew Home at Riverdale in New York who misses the big Thanksgiving celebrations of years past and has lost neighbors and friends to the virus. “I cry, but I get over it. We have to go on.”On any normal Thanksgiving Day, Kara McKlemurry and her husband would drive from their Clearwater, Florida, home to one of two places: his family’s home in another part of the state or her family’s house in Alabama. This year, McKlemurry informed her family there would be no visits. When her in-laws offered to stop by, the couple said no.She and her husband didn’t want to risk infecting anyone or getting the virus themselves.Not everyone followed McKlemurry’s example. Millions of Americans bought tickets to fly somewhere for the holiday, crowding airports despite pleas from officials to avoid travel and gatherings.Still, McKlemurry, 27, wanted to do something unique to mark this unusual holiday — something to let everyone know that she and her husband still feel blessed this year.So, a week before Thanksgiving, armed with coloured pens and stickers of owls with scarves, she hand wrote notes of gratitude to every member of the family.“We’re so grateful to have you in our lives,” she wrote on a card with a cartoon fox, “even if we can’t actually be together this year for the holidays.”In the nation’s capital, the convention center is empty unlike in previous years, when volunteers have worked together to serve a meal to about 5,000 people. In the era of social distancing, the sponsored event had to be reimagined.Ahead of the holiday, organizers delivered to 20 nonprofits 5,000 gift bags, each with winter clothing accessories, hand sanitizer and a mask, and 5,000 boxes that included a turkey sandwich with condiments, a side potato salad, a cookie and utensils.From start to finish, Thanksgiving is different this year for Jessica Franz, a nurse who works the graveyard shift at Olathe Medical Center, in a Kansas City suburb.For one, Franz, 39, is celebrating without her mother-in-law, Elaine Franz, who died of the coronavirus on Nov. 10, just one day before her 78th birthday. In previous years, her mother-in-law, who was Mennonite, would lay out a spread for her children and grandchildren. At Franz’s work, in a typical year, co-workers would bring food for a potluck.None of that is happening this year.The family is shifting the festivities to Zoom and FaceTime. It’s been hard for her daughters — ages, 2, 8 and 11. Her middle daughter was exposed to the coronavirus at school and is quarantined until Dec. 3, and her oldest daughter is struggling with the concept of a scaled-back holiday.“We had a good conversation that was, ‘This year may be different, and that’s OK. It is one year. If things are different this year and that means we get to see all the rest of our family next year, it is OK,’” said Franz, who has personally cared for patients dying of coronavirus.The Thanksgiving gathering at David Forsyth’s home in Southern California, meanwhile, comes with a uniquely 2020 feel: rapid virus tests at the door to decide who gets inside.The kit costs about $1,000 for 20 tests, each of which involve pricking a finger and putting a drop of blood on a tray. Ten minutes later the results either show someone is negative, has antibodies or is positive.Normally, about 15 to 20 people attend the family’s Thanksgiving dinner in Channel Islands Harbor. But this year, it will only be eight of them: Forsyth, his wife, her four adult sons and the partners of two of them.His wife started cooking Tuesday. She’s planning a cold cucumber soup for a starter and bunch of appetizers for the early afternoon meal. The sons are bringing side dishes. Turkey and the fixings are the main course. Champagne may be cracked.Forsyth hasn’t seen his family much during the pandemic but wanted to save the holiday.“People are trying to live a normal life,” he said. “And, you know, with the second wave coming now, it’s not a bad idea to be prepared.”Kerry Osaki longs to see his now-grown children, without masks, and hug them. But instead he and his wife are celebrating just the two of them after their traditions were upended.Osaki’s 93-year-old mother, Rose, who lived with the couple in Orange County in California, died from the virus after all three got sick.With his mother gone, Osaki, 67, and his cousin decided to pass on the family’s annual Thanksgiving get-together. His wife, Lena Adame, typically spent the holiday cooking a spread of turkey and stuffing with her relatives — but some had seen virus cases at their workplaces, so the couple decided to skip that, too.“It’s just been a long, rough and sometimes sad year,” he said.In Ogden, Utah, Evelyn Maysonet stepped out of her home Tuesday morning to find boxes overflowing with canned goods, desserts and a turkey. She has been isolating with her husband and son since all three tested positive for Covid-19.None of them has been able to leave to buy groceries, so they were thrilled to receive the health department’s delivery — and the chance to cherish the things that matter most.“As long as you have a life and you’re still alive, just make the best of it with you and your family,” Maysonet said.___Associated Press journalists Tamara Lush, Jennifer Sinco Kelleher, Sophia Eppolito, Amy Taxin and John Minchillo contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/empty-seats-delivered-feasts-as-coronavirus-changes-thanksgiving/story-FmoUqjo4BTncjhd2dyzZVP.html
27-11-2020||World||Angry Donald Trump promises rally in battleground state of Georgia||President Donald Trump has renewed baseless claims that “massive fraud” and crooked officials in battleground states led to his election defeat, and said he’ll go to Georgia to rally supporters ahead of two Senate runoff elections.“This has a long way to go,” Trump said on Thanksgiving evening, despite the fact that President-elect Joe Biden won the election. “This election was a fraud. It was a rigged election.” Trump spoke to reporters at the White House on Thursday after speaking with US military leaders overseas.After his conversation, Trump took questions for the first time since Election Day and angrily denounced officials in Georgia and Pennsylvania, two key swing states that helped give Biden the win, as “enemies of the state” and claimed they were culprits in vote fraud.State officials and international observers have repeatedly said no evidence of mass fraud exists and Trump’s campaign has repeatedly failed in court.Trump said he would hold a rally with thousands of supporters in Georgia on Saturday to support a pair of Republican candidates — Sen. David Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler — whose runoff elections on January 5 will determine which party controls the Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angry-donald-trump-promises-rally-in-battleground-state-of-georgia/story-j9qpVdiWwLx7Ujcrss5P7I.html
27-11-2020||World||Kim Jong Un likely to let his missiles do the talking with Joe Biden||North Korea has greeted the last two US presidents with tests of missiles or nuclear bombs within weeks of taking office. And experts see the same happening with Joe Biden, whom the regime has called “a rabid dog.”Kim Jong Un is one of the few world leaders who has yet to congratulate -- or even acknowledge -- the president-elect, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping did so on Wednesday. While it’s not unusual for North Korea to stay silent on the results of US elections, Kim held unprecedented meetings with President Donald Trump that broke the mold of relations between the long-time adversaries.Ties now are poised to revert to the frostier days of the Obama administration, when the US deployed “strategic patience” to avoid rewarding North Korea for provocations -- a policy that stayed in place after Kim took power in 2011. For North Korea, it may not make too much of a difference: Under both Barack Obama and Trump, Kim steadily increased his ability to threaten the US homeland with nuclear weapons even in the face of ever-tighter sanctions.“Regardless of the US presidency, the North Korean regime is unlikely to change its behavior or shift its strategy toward the US,” said Soo Kim, a Rand Corp. policy analyst who previously worked at the Central Intelligence Agency. “The nukes are here to stay, Kim will continue to build and extort, and the strategy has proven to work for decades. So why change what works?”North Korea tested Obama with the launch of a long-range rocket and a nuclear device within months after he took power in 2009. Trump was welcomed to the White House with a series of ballistic missile tests that culminated with the launch in November 2017 of an intercontinental ballistic missile that experts said could deliver a nuclear warhead to all of the the USThe most likely missile test this time will be another ICBM. This could include a new rocket North Korea rolled out at a military parade in October, which is designed to carry multiple nuclear warheads to the US homeland. The Pentagon said earlier this month that it had successfully intercepted a mock ICBM simulating one developed by North Korea.“They need to test the new ICBM in order to demonstrate it is credible in the eyes of adversaries, and they will likely do so when they are ready,” said weapons expert Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network. “North Korea only needs their ICBMs to be accurate enough to deter the United States.”North Korea sees its nuclear weapons as insurance against a US attack, and has vowed to maintain its deterrent no matter what. Kim has repeatedly rejected the Trump administration’s call for a “complete, verifiable and irreversible” dismantlement before Pyongyang can receive any rewards.Biden’s camp has signaled more room for negotiations, saying in a policy paper that he wants to “jump start” a campaign with US allies and others for denuclearization. At the second presidential debate in October, Biden called Kim a “thug” but said he could meet the North Korean leader if he made moves to reduce his nuclear arsenal.Biden’s choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has called Trump’s personal diplomacy a failure and advocated for a multilateral approach that seeks disarmament in stages. In a 2017 opinion piece in the New York Times, Blinken backed a negotiated settlement with North Korea “that first freezes and then rolls back North Korea’s nuclear program, with inspectors to carefully scrutinize compliance” before a more comprehensive deal is reached.Kim is likely to give clues on how he’ll approach the new Biden administration during an annual New Year’s address -- one of the biggest political speeches on the country’s political calendar. North Korea is also expected to hold a rare ruling party congress at around the time of Biden’s inauguration to lay out a new five year plan for its economy, which is headed for its biggest contraction in more than two decades due to sanctions, the coronavirus and a series of natural disasters.Kim’s decision to close borders due to the coronavirus has had a devastating impact on trade, which is on course to drop with its most important partner China by 80% for the whole year, the Korea International Trade Association said in a report Friday.Pyongyang has made clear that it prefers dealing with Trump, who gave Kim a seat at the table as an equal. His regime has extolled the “mysteriously wonderful” chemistry between the two leaders, while denouncing Biden as an “imbecile bereft of the elementary quality as a human being.”And as Biden seeks to work with allies following Trump’s “America First” approach, Kim may also find that he has more friends now than he did a few years ago. He enjoys much better relations with China and Russia, who joined with the the US in 2017 to support unprecedented United Nations Security Council sanctions against North Korea in response to its nuclear and missile tests.“This time around, new tests may not have the same effect at the UN,” said Ankit Panda, a Stanton senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, adding that tensions could escalate quickly if Biden responds with a show of military might. “The greatest risk would be that we reenter a crisis cycle with North Korea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-likely-to-let-his-missiles-do-the-talking-with-joe-biden/story-xcK3QxCbuKetNojufQfyTO.html
27-11-2020||World||Amazon will spend $500 million on holiday employee bonuses||Amazon.com Inc. will pay the employees who pack and deliver its goods a one-time bonus of up to $300, extra compensation that comes as the company faces a union drive and criticism from others for rolling back pandemic hazard pay.The company said on Thursday that it would pay full-time operations workers $300, and part-timers $150, if they are employed by the e-commerce giant for the entire month of December. The cost to Amazon will amount to about $500 million, logistics chief Dave Clark said in a corporate blog post.Like many of its peers in retail who had offered hazard pay as an incentive for workers to keep coming in during the pandemic, Amazon ended its bonuses after an economic upheaval swelled the ranks of job seekers. The company ended its $2-an-hour bump for hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers at the end of May. In June, it paid one-time bonuses of as much as $500.More recently, Amazon has faced criticism from some employees for trying to attract new hires with a $3,000 bonus to ensure sufficient staffing to cover the holiday rush while only offering existing workers vouchers toward Thanksgiving turkeys. Earlier this week, a union drive organized by a group of workers at an Alabama warehouse became public, a rare step at a company that has worked to fend off organized labor in its ranks.“Our teams are doing amazing work serving customers’ essential needs, while also helping to bring some much needed holiday cheer for socially-distanced families around the world,” Clark said in the blog post Thursday. “I’ve never been more grateful for -- or proud of -- our teams.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-will-spend-500-million-on-holiday-employee-bonuses/story-JgubEhQVo6XXD8Yl5t4XMK.html

27-11-2020||World||Trump rants about polls, pardons Flynn||US President Donald Trump pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn on Wednesday, ending a prosecution in the Russia probe that saw Flynn twice plead guilty to lying to the FBI and then reverse himself before the justice department stepped in to dismiss his case.The US president, meanwhile, yet again railed over the election outcome. He stayed home at the White House, rage-tweeted about his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, saying it was a “rigged election”, then barely mentioned the pandemic or greeted the nation on Thanksgiving, phoned into a packed news conference held by his allies in Pennsylvania, and called for “this election to be turned around”.On the move to pardon his former NSA, the US president tweeted, “It is my great honour to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a full pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving!”The Washington Post slammed the decision to pardon Flynn as a “parting disgrace” from the outgoing president.President-elect Biden had a more constructive presence through the day. He called for unity and hope in a Thanksgiving eve address to Americans, reminding them that the country was at war with the coronavirus pandemic “and not with each other”.The contrast in approach between the two leaders, their priorities and their styles played out in full public view over the day on Wednesday. A sombre Biden spoke to Americans from an empty music hall about the need for “solutions, not shouting; reason, not hyper-partisanship; light, not heat”, and urged them not to despair in the face of the pandemic. Speaking of the Covid-19 vaccines in the pipeline, he said, “Hang on, don’t let yourself surrender.”Biden, who has sought to stay above Trump’s attempts to challenge the election result, addressed the issue head on.“In America, we have full and fair and free elections, and then we honour the results,” he said without naming anyone. “The people of this nation and the laws of the land won’t stand for anything else.”Biden said he understood the task of unifying the country is not going to be easy, but he insisted he was determined to bring together Democrats, Republicans and Independents. “Americans dream big. And, as hard as it may seem this Thanksgiving, we are going to dream big again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rants-about-polls-pardons-flynn/story-RMou3XnSRnGlWiBf06iXWI.html

On Wednesday, it spiked to nearly 200,000 cases, with a death toll of more than 2,400 - a six-month high. More than 262,000 people have been killed by the virus in the US so far.In recent days, images on social media of crowded airports fuelled concerns Americans were not taking advice from health authorities to curb travel seriously. In Germany, the government has announced that it will extend its virus curbs until 2021 and plans to seek a deal with European partners to close ski slopes until January 10. A statement from Chancellor Angela Merkel dovetailed with France’s plans to shutter ski resorts through the year’s end. Russia on Thursday registered record numbers for daily infections and deaths for the second time in less than a week. Officials reported 25,487 new infections and 524 new deaths. South Korea reported its highest daily cases since March, with a surge of new infections sparking fresh fears.

She got out colored pens, stickers of owls with scarves, and cute greeting cards.“We’re so grateful to have you in our lives,” she wrote on a card with a cartoon fox, “even if we can’t actually be together this year for the holidays.”In the nation’s capital, the convention center is empty unlike in previous years, when hundreds of volunteers have worked together to serve a traditional holiday meal to about 5,000 people, who also got access to clothing donations, medical testing and other services. In the era of social distancing, the sponsored event had to be reimagined.Ahead of the holiday, organizers delivered to 20 nonprofits 5,000 gift bags, each with winter clothing accessories, hand sanitizer and a mask, and 5,000 boxes that included a turkey sandwich with condiments, a side potato salad, a cookie and utensils.From start to finish, Thanksgiving is different this year for Jessica Franz, a nurse who works the graveyard shift at Olathe Medical Center, in a Kansas City suburb.For one, Franz, 39, is celebrating without her mother-in-law, Elaine Franz, who died of the coronavirus on Nov. 10, just one day before her 78th birthday. In previous years, her mother-in-law, who was Mennonite, would lay out a spread for her children and grandchildren. At Franz’s work, in a typical year, co-workers would bring food for a potluck.None of that is happening this year.The family is shifting the festivities to Zoom and FaceTime. It’s been hard for her daughters — ages, 2, 8 and 11. Her middle daughter was exposed to the coronavirus at school and is quarantined until Dec. 3, and her oldest daughter is struggling with the concept of a scaled-back holiday.“We had a good conversation that was, ‘This year may be different, and that’s OK. It is one year. If things are different this year and that means we get to see all the rest of our family next year, it is OK,’” said Franz, who has personally cared for patients dying of coronavirus.The Thanksgiving gathering at David Forsyth’s home in Southern California, meanwhile, comes with a uniquely 2020 feel: rapid virus tests at the door to decide who gets inside.The kit costs about $1,000 for 20 tests, each of which involve pricking a finger and putting a drop of blood on a tray. Ten minutes later the results either show someone is negative, has antibodies or is positive.Normally, about 15 to 20 people attend the family’s Thanksgiving dinner in Channel Islands Harbor. But this year, it will only be eight of them: Forsyth, his wife, her four adult sons and the partners of two of them.His wife started cooking Tuesday. She’s planning a cold cucumber soup for a starter and bunch of appetizers for the early afternoon meal. The sons are bringing side dishes. Turkey and the fixings are the main course. Champagne may be cracked.Forsyth hasn’t seen his family much during the pandemic but wanted to save the holiday.“People are trying to live a normal life,” he said. “And, you know, with the second wave coming now, it’s not a bad idea to be prepared.”In Ogden, Utah, Evelyn Maysonet stepped out of her home Tuesday morning to find boxes of food on her front porch overflowing with canned goods, desserts and a turkey. She has been isolating with her husband and son in their home since all three tested positive for COVID-19 over a week ago.None of them has been able to leave to buy groceries, so they were thrilled to receive the health department’s delivery — and the chance to enjoy a meal together and cherish the things that matter most.“As long as you have a life and you’re still alive, just make the best of it with you and your family,” Maysonet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/empty-seats-delivered-feasts-as-coronavirus-changes-thanksgiving/story-rfR1NnZoSKyy82l5tGk9mJ.html
27-11-2020||World||‘Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief’: British royal Meghan Markle speaks about miscarriage||Meghan, Britain’s Duchess of Sussex, has revealed that she had a miscarriage, an extraordinarily personal disclosure coming from a high-profile British royal.The wife of Prince Harry and former actress wrote about the experience in detail in an opinion article published in the New York Times on Wednesday, saying that it took place one July morning when she was caring for Archie, the couple’s son.“I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second,” Meghan wrote, describing how she felt a sharp cramp after picking up Archie from his crib, and dropped to the floor with him in her arms, humming a lullaby to keep them both calm. Also Watch | Meghan Markle attends ‘The Lion King’ premiere with Prince HarryMeghan described how she and her husband were both in tears as she lay in a hospital bed hours later.“Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few,” she wrote.“In the pain of our loss, my husband and I discovered that in a room of 100 women, 10 to 20 of them will have suffered from miscarriage. Yet despite the staggering commonality of this pain, the conversation remains taboo, riddled with (unwarranted) shame, and perpetuating a cycle of solitary mourning.”The intimate details shared in the article are strikingly at odds with the usual policy of senior members of the British royal family, who reveal almost nothing about their personal lives.Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, has never discussed her private life in any media article or interview in her 68-year reign.However, there is intense global media interest in the senior royals, especially when it comes to family matters such as the birth of children.Harry’s older brother Prince William and his wife Kate appeared in front of TV camera crews and photographers outside the London hospital where Kate gave birth to her three children shortly after each birth, each time with their newborn baby.Despite the media frenzy, however, William and Kate have revealed almost nothing of substance about their home life.“MOTHER, FEMINIST, ADVOCATE”A source close to Harry said the Duke had discussed the article with the royal family beforehand.Meghan and Harry married in May 2018 in a glittering ceremony televised around the world, but the period after their wedding was tumultuous, with the couple falling out publicly with some British media and opening up about their struggles.They stepped back from royal duties and moved to the United States earlier this year to try and forge a new role for themselves outside the constraints of life in Britain’s strictly codified royal bubble.The byline on the New York Times article was “Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex”, and she was described as “a mother, feminist and advocate”.Meghan wrote that 2020 had brought many people to breaking points, and called on people to put aside political differences and other divisions and show some care for each other.“So this Thanksgiving, as we plan for a holiday unlike any before — many of us separated from our loved ones, alone, sick, scared, divided and perhaps struggling to find something, anything, to be grateful for — let us commit to asking others, ‘Are you OK?’,” she wrote.“As much as we may disagree, as physically distanced as we may be, the truth is that we are more connected than ever because of all we have individually and collectively endured this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-royal-meghan-speaks-about-miscarriage-in-new-york-times-article/story-VVqhqWvpCBpnPhrMfU9lBJ.html
