Sentinel-6a will be the first of two identical satellites -- the second to be launched in five years -- that will provide measurements of unprecedented precision until at least 2030.Each Sentinel-6 probe carries a radar altimeter, which measures the time it takes for radar pulses to travel to Earth’s surface and back again.The satellites will circle the planet in the same orbit as earlier missions that supplied sea-surface height data over the last three decades, mapping 95 percent of Earth’s ice-free ocean every ten days.Accelerating sea level rise is arguably the climate change impact that will affect the largest number of people over the next three decades.Nearly 800 million people live within five metres of sea level, and even an increase in sea level of a few centimetres can translate into vastly more damage from high tides and storm surges.Sea level rise acceleratingAlready today, there are more than 100 million people living below high tide levels. “Extreme sea level events that are historically rare -- once per century in the recent past -- are projected to occur frequently, at least once per year, at many locations by 2050,” especially in the tropics, the UN climate science advisory panel, the IPCC, concluded in a major report last year.Satellites tracking the world’s oceans since 1993 show that global mean sea level has risen, on average, by over three millimetres (more than a tenth of an inch) annually. More recently, that rate has increased to 5 mm per year.“It is crucial that we are able to see these accelerations,” said Alain Ratier, outgoing Director-General of Europe’s meteorological satellite agency, EUMETSAT.China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand are home to the greatest number of people who today live on land that could be threatened by permanent inundation by 2100.The IPCC forecasts an increase in global sea level rise of up to 1.1 metres (43 inches) by the end of the century.The Copernicus Sentinel-6 mission is a collaboration of the European Commission, the European Space Agency (ESA), EUMETSAT, NASA and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).The Sentinel satellites are each about the size and shape of a large minivan topped with slanted solar panels, and weigh nearly 1,200 kilos (2,600 pounds), including rocket fuel.They are designed to last for five-and-a-half years, but could provide data for far longer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellite-to-track-rising-seas-as-climate-warms/story-4Pw3VWxLm9LYylZulgfNRO.html

China has done that time and again, extending its protective shield to Pakistan’s terror groups, which have targeted India to its east and Afghanistan to its west.“It is time that the Security Council speaks unequivocally against violence and terrorist forces and acts against terrorist sanctuaries and safe havens,” T S Tirumurti, the Indian permanent representative, said during an “Aria formula meeting” on Afghanistan. India participated in the discussion as an incoming member; it starts its eighth term as A non-permanent member in January.“For durable peace in Afghanistan, we have to put an end to terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries operating across the Durand Line (which separates Afghanistan and Pakistan),” the diplomat said, adding, citing a UN report that pointed to the continued presence of foreign fighters in Afghanistan, “For violence to end in Afghanistan, these terrorist supply chains must be broken.”Though Tirumurti’s remarks were in the context of Afghanistan, they were relevant to the region. India on Thursday apprehended four alleged operatives of Jaish-e-Mohammad, a Pakistan-based and -funded terrorist outfit founded by Masood Azhar, whose designation by the UNSC had been blocked by China for years, until it faced the combined force of other permanent members in 2019.The top Indian diplomat at the UN reiterated India’s support for “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled” peace process, but also stressed that need for expressly calling attention to terrorism.Tirumurti said, “There needs to be zero-tolerance of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Afghanistan can succeed only when terrorism no longer flows across the Durand Line. Terror and violence cannot be the instrument to shape Afghanistan’s future or dictate the choices Afghans make. It is important to ensure that no one provides sanctuary to terrorists who threaten Afghanistan or any other country in the region. Those who do so must be held accountable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-tells-unsc-it-s-time-to-speak-unequivocally-against-terrorism/story-S1kMOE6dpJwYzM1qc209QI.html

He can, however, still seek another recount under the state’s election rules. Wisconsin, meanwhile, began a recount in two counties on Friday, as demanded by the Trump campaign.Trump and Republican allies have filed more than 30 lawsuits since November 3, when polling closed for the 2020 election. They first alleged election fraud and irregularities, and then dropped them, indicating how tenuous they were. They have also put forward wild conspiracy theories - as did Rudy Giuliani, the US president’s personal lawyer, and others at a press briefing on Thursday that was widely panned as “crazy” even by Trump’s allies. Mitt Romney, a Republican senator who has been critical of Trump, said, “Having failed to make even a plausible case of widespread fraud or conspiracy before any court of law, the president has now resorted to overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election. It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic act by a sitting American president.”Trump has invited a group of Republican legislators from Michigan, a battleground state he lost, to the White House on Friday in a reported bid to persuade them to reject the election’s outcome. Trump lost Michigan, which has 16 electoral college votes, by more than 150,000 popular votes and tried earlier to persuade local Republican officials to not certify the result in the state’s largest county, which is mostly black. He has had no success yet.The US president will need to deploy this strategy based on the use of the power of his office in other states to overturn the 306-232 verdict and could next target Georgia (16 electoral votes) and Arizona (11) - states with Republicans in control of the legislatures and the governorships.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-seeks-to-overturn-us-election-outcome-as-georgia-recount-reaffirms-joe-biden-victory/story-ECOcSmZqtCYcf8IFMJtJjJ.html

He has been refused the party whip in the House of Commons for a few months, but that is a very lame response to a very big crisis,” Lord Desai said.“I have been very uncomfortable and slightly ashamed that the party has been injected with this sort of racism. Jewish MPs were abused openly, and female members were trolled. It is out and out racism,” he said.Also Read | UK’s Labour party readmits Jeremy Corbyn after brief suspensionThe Labour Party has been plagued by allegations of antisemitism over the years, with its disastrous electoral defeat in the December 2019 election also linked to the crisis. Sir Keir Starmer took over as the new party leader this year with the promise of ridding the party of the scourge and had taken the step to suspend Corbyn last month after he seemed to downplay the very critical findings of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC). The watchdog had found that Labour had broken the law in its failure to handle antisemitism, or anti-Jewish, complaints and there were “serious failings” by its leadership at the time.“I don’t see things really changing in the foreseeable future and have to ultimately live with my conscience. I can’t go on being in an antisemitic party,” said Desai, even as he stressed that he has no plans of joining any other political party.He has sent in his resignation letter to the Leader of the Labour Party in the House of Lords, Baroness Angela Smith, and despite many appeals for him to reconsider, he will now sit as an independent peer while his application to be part of the Crossbench group of the UK Parliament’s Upper House is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-peer-lord-meghnad-desai-quits-labour-party-over-racism/story-CFu1RzAFRfnFjQyP6m9htL.html
20-11-2020||World||Don’t use Gilead’s remdesivir in hospitalised Covid-19 patients, says WHO||Gilead’s remdesivir should not be used for patients hospitalised with Covid-19, regardless of how ill they are, as there is no evidence the drug improves survival or reduces the need for ventilation, a World Health Organization panel said on Friday.“The ... panel found a lack of evidence that remdesivir improved outcomes that matter to patients,” the guideline said.“Especially given the costs and resource implications associated with remdesivir ... the panel felt the responsibility should be on demonstrating evidence of efficacy, which is not established by the currently available data,” it added.The advice is another setback for the drug, which grabbed worldwide attention as a potentially effective treatment for Covid-19 in the summer after early trials showed some promise.The antiviral, known by the brand name Veklury, is one of only two medicines currently authorised to treat Covid-19 patients across the world. But a large WHO-led trial known as the Solidarity Trial showed last month that it had little or no effect on 28-day mortality or length of hospital stays for Covid-19 patients.The medication was one of the drugs used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump’s coronavirus infection, and had been shown in previous studies to have cut time to recovery. It is authorised or approved for use as a Covid-19 treatment in more than 50 countries.Gilead has questioned the Solidarity Trial’s results and said in a statement on Friday it was “disappointed” at the new WHO guideline.“Veklury is recognised as a standard of care for the treatment of hospitalised patients with Covid-19 in guidelines from numerous credible national organisations,” it said.“The WHO guidelines appear to ignore this evidence at a time when cases are dramatically increasing around the world and doctors are relying on Veklury as the first and only approved antiviral treatment for patients with Covid-19.”The WHO advice raises questions about whether the European Union will need the 500,000 courses of the antiviral, worth 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), it ordered last month.The European Commission said on Friday it had taken note of the WHO updated guideline on remdesivir but that “at the moment, there are no changes” to its authorisation for the drug.It said the region’s drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency, had requested the full data from Solidarity Trial and “will assess the evidence ... together with other available data, to see if any changes are needed”.Italy’s drugs regulator, AIFA, said it had been “stressing for weeks the modest effectiveness of remdesivir”.“In practice we have been saying for some time that it is not use for much,” a spokeswoman said.NO MEANINGFUL EFFECTThe WHO’s Guideline Development Group (GDG) panel said its recommendation was based on an evidence review that included data from four international randomised trials involving more than 7,000 patients hospitalised with Covid-19.After reviewing the evidence, the panel said it concluded that remdesivir, which has to be given intravenously and is therefore costly and complex to administer, has no meaningful effect on death rates or other important outcomes for patients.Peter Horby, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at Britain’s Oxford University, said the WHO’s new advice should prompt “a rethink about the place of remdesivir in Covid-19”.“Remdesivir is an expensive drug that must be given intravenously for five to 10 days, so this recommendation will save money and other healthcare resources,” he said.At the end of October, Gilead cut its 2020 revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand and difficulty in predicting sales of remdesivir.The recommendation, which is not binding, is part of its so-called “living guidelines” project, designed to offer ongoing guidance for doctors. The panel added that it supported continued enrolment into clinical trials evaluating remdesivir in patients with Covid-19, which it said should “provide higher certainty of evidence for specific groups of patients”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-use-gilead-s-remdesivir-in-hospitalised-covid-19-patients-says-who/story-GeqehtjchhtHDr26qqu3cI.html

His death sparked worldwide protests and triggered a re-evaluation of the legacy of slavery and racism.As protesters worldwide fell monuments honoring slave owners, Confederates and disgraced white leaders of decades past, their downfall opens a debate over who should rise up to take their place.“What the tragedy of what happened to George Floyd has done is to really amplify the discussion,” said Ambassador Michael Kanu, Deputy Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone to the United Nations, who co-authored the paper.“It’s all part of the quest for justice,” he said in an interview, adding he hoped West African nations could put the proposal before the ISA some time next year.The memorial would add a cultural aspect to the economic and environmental considerations before the ISA about deep-sea mining exploration, particularly of copper and cobalt, said Turner.About 40,000 slave voyages crossed the Atlantic, carrying more than 12.5 million captive Africans from the early 1500s to the late 1800s, according to the authors.The routes of the slave ships became the burial sites of those who were thrown overboard, killed themselves or drowned when ships sank, the paper said.The memorial would be the first of its kind to honor slave trade victims. The undersea wreck of the Titanic, which sank in the Atlantic Ocean in 1912, was declared a memorial by the U.S. Congress in 1986.On land, well-known slavery memorial sites include a wharf in Rio de Janeiro, where an estimated 900,000 African slaves were shipped, and a 15th-century slave trading house in Calabar, Nigeria.(Reporting by Ellen Wulfhorst; Editing by Zoe Tabary.

20-11-2020||World||Pfizer, BioNTech plan emergency move to use Covid-19 vaccine in December||Covid-19 vaccine makers Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE on Friday said they plan to file for an emergency use authorisation that could allow their Covid-19 vaccine to be used in the US next month.In a respite to a pandemic-hit world, the US drugmaker and its German partner had confirmed earlier this week that a final analysis of clinical trial data showed the shot was 95% effective at preventing the disease. The filing with the Food and Drug Administration could permit the vaccine to be administered to high-risk populations in the US by the middle to the end of December, the companies said in a statement.In their application, Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE have also included safety data on about 100 children 12-15 years of age. The company said 45 per cent of US trial participants are 56-85 years old.Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla has said that this move by the drugmakers marks a critical milestone.““Filing in the U.S. represents a critical milestone in our journey to deliver a Covid-19 vaccine to the world and we now have a more complete picture of both the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine,” Bourla said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-plan-emergency-move-to-use-covid-19-vaccine-in-december/story-6sQGY8LXLOI5lZ6s5KwxZP.html
20-11-2020||World||Pfizer seeks emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine in US||Pfizer said Friday it is asking US regulators to allow emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine, starting the clock on a process that could bring limited first shots as early as next month and eventually an end to the pandemic -- but not until after a long, hard winter.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The action comes days after Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech announced that its vaccine appears 95% effective at preventing mild to severe Covid-19 disease in a large, ongoing study.The companies said that protection plus a good safety record means the vaccine should qualify for emergency use authorization, something the Food and Drug Administration can grant before the final testing is fully complete. In addition to Friday’s FDA submission, they have already started “rolling” applications in Europe and the UK and intend to submit similar information soon.With the coronavirus surging around the US and the world, the pressure is on for regulators to make a speedy decision.“Help is on the way,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert said on the eve of Pfizer’s announcement, adding that it’s too early to abandon masks and other protective measures. “We need to actually double down on the public health measures as we’re waiting for that help to come.”Friday’s filing sets off a chain of events as the FDA and its independent advisers debate if the shots are ready. If so, still another government group will have to decide how the initial limited supplies are rationed out to anxiously awaiting Americans.How much vaccine is available and when is a moving target, but initial supplies will be scarce and rationed. About 25 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine may become available in December, 30 million in January and 35 million more in February and March, according to information presented to the National Academy of Medicine this week. Recipients will need two doses, three weeks apart.Not far behind is competitor Moderna Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine. Its early data suggests the shots are as strong as Pfizer’s, and that company expects to also seek emergency authorization within weeks.MAKING THE DATA PUBLICThe public’s first chance to see how strong the evidence really is will come in early December at a public meeting of the FDA’s scientific advisers.Also Read | Oxford scientists expect Covid-19 vaccine data by ChristmasSo far, what’s known is based only on statements from Pfizer and BioNTech. Of 170 infections detected to date, only eight were among people who’d received the actual vaccine and the rest had gotten a dummy shot. On the safety side, the companies cites results from 38,000 study participants who’ve been tracked for two months after their second dose. That’s a milestone FDA set because historically, vaccine side effects don’t crop up later than that.“We’ll drill down on these data,” said FDA adviser Dr. Paul Offit of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.Think of it like science on trial. A few days before the meeting, the FDA will release its own internal analysis. That sets the stage for the advisers’ daylong debate about any signs of safety concerns and how the new vaccine technology works before rendering a verdict.They’ll recommend not just whether FDA should allow broader use of the vaccine generally but if so, for whom. For example, is there enough proof the vaccine works as well for older, sicker adults as for younger, healthier people?There’s still no guarantee. “We don’t know what that vote’s going to be,” said former FDA vaccine chief Norman Baylor.EMERGENCY USE ISN’T THE SAME AS FULL APPROVALIf there’s an emergency green light, “that vaccine is still deemed investigational. It’s not approved yet,” Dr. Marion Gruber, chief of FDA’s vaccine office, told the National Academy of Medicine this week.That means anyone offered an emergency vaccination must get a “fact sheet” describing potential benefits and risks before going through with the shot, she said.There will be a lot of unknowns. For example, the 95% protection rate is based on people who developed symptoms and then were tested for the virus. Can the vaccinated get infected but have no symptoms, able to spread the virus? How long does protection last?That’s why the 44,000-person study needs to keep running -- something difficult considering ethically, participants given dummy shots at some point must be offered real vaccine, complicating the search for answers.And at least for now, pregnant women won’t qualify because they weren’t studied. Pfizer only recently began testing the vaccine in children as young as 12.A decision on Pfizer’s vaccine won’t affect other Covid-19 vaccine candidates in the pipeline, which will be judged separately.Also Read | HTLS 2020: There is light at the end of the tunnel, say top Covid expertsMANUFACTURINGBrewing vaccine is more complex than typical drug manufacturing, yet the millionth dose to roll out of Pfizer’s Kalamazoo, Michigan, factory must be the same purity and potency as every dose before and after.That means the FDA decision isn’t just based on study data, but on its determination that the vaccine is being made correctly.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine -- and Moderna’s shots -- are made with brand-new technology. They don’t contain the actual coronavirus. Instead, they’re made with a piece of genetic code for the “spike” protein that studs the virus.That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, training immune cells to recognize it if the real virus eventually comes along.GETTING INTO PEOPLE’S ARMSAnother government group -- advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- decides who is first in line for scarce doses. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said he hopes that decision can be made at the same time as FDA’s.The Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed has worked with states to line up how many doses they’d need to cover the populations offered vaccine first.Pfizer will ship those supplies as ordered by the states -- only after FDA gives the OK.Company projections of how much it will ship each month are just predictions, Baylor warned.“It’s not like a pizza,” he said. Manufacturing is so complex that “you don’t necessarily end up with what you thought.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-seeks-emergency-use-of-its-covid-19-vaccine-in-us/story-smaCA20nISwSIps7Aldp0M.html
20-11-2020||World||EU warns UK hasn’t compromised enough for Brexit trade deal||The European Union warned that the UK hasn’t moved sufficiently to overcome the three main obstacles to a post-Brexit trade deal as three of the bloc’s leaders called for contingency plans to be stepped up in case one isn’t reached.At a meeting in Brussels on Friday, envoys from the EU’s 27 member states were told that progress has been slow, and negotiations could now slip into December, according to people in the meeting who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. The pound trimmed its earlier gains.The talks were roiled this week by the disclosure that a member of the EU team had tested positive for coronavirus. Face-to-face negotiations have been now suspended, and Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief negotiator, is to go into quarantine just as time to reach a deal runs out.Late on Thursday, the leaders of France, Belgium and the Netherlands called on the bloc to make contingency plans in case a deal fails to materialize. If that happens, businesses and consumers will face disruption as tariffs and quotas return.In recent days, though, officials on both sides had privately voiced cautious optimism that a deal could be concluded as soon as next week. The EU briefing to the ambassadors and the comments by the three leaders may be an attempt to pressure the U.K. government to compromise further before a deal is struck at a later date.Officials said talks are at a delicate stage and envoys were not briefed in detail so as not to undermine the negotiations and put possible compromises at risk.While the EU has been saying for weeks that the disagreements on fishing, the level playing field and how any agreement will be enforced, the reality appears more nuanced. Both sides have made concessions and some progress in recent days, according to people familiar with the negotiations.Some progress has been made on state aid, two EU officials said, but on other so-called level playing field issues, the U.K. is still resisting EU pressure include ratchet clauses -- which would force Britain to raise its legal standards in areas including environment and social protection if EU legislation changes in the future.On fishing, the two sides still can’t agree on how much of the British catch EU boats will be allocated. On governance, the two sides haven’t agreed on cross retaliation clauses, the official said.“We are working hard to get an agreement and to find solutions that fully respect U.K. sovereignty” a British official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-warns-uk-hasn-t-compromised-enough-for-brexit-trade-deal/story-UFQHsJXTjDSdJBnel75TeI.html
20-11-2020||World||Rishi Sunak’s spending challenge laid bare as deficit hits record||UK government borrowing climbed to a record 214.9 billion pounds ($286 billion) in the first seven months of the fiscal year, underscoring the tough choices facing Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak as he prepares for a major announcement on spending next week.Office for National Statistics figures Friday showed the deficit in October alone totaled 22.3 billion pounds, leaving Britain on course for a shortfall approaching 400 billion pounds for 2020-21 as a whole and debt above 100% for the first time since the early 1960s. There was better news on retail sales, which rose for a sixth straight month.The scale of the damage inflicted by the pandemic will be laid bare on Nov. 25, when Sunak unveils the cash each department will get to fund public services and investment in the coming year. While the spending review is expected to deliver on key commitments, millions of public-sector workers are facing a renewed pay squeeze as the government tries to contain borrowing.The plans will be underpinned by new forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is expected to echo the Bank of England and private-sector analysts by predicting the sharpest economic contraction since the Great Frost of 1709 -- and only a gradual recovery to pre-pandemic levels.At almost a fifth of the economy, the deficit is set to be the largest in British peacetime -- a staggering deterioration from March, when the OBR was expecting just 55 billion pounds, or around 2.5% of GDP.Sunak is expected to focus on environmental projects and delivering on election commitments made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to level up poorer regions of the country. But with the fiscal position so weak, the chancellor is set to squeeze overseas aid and pay in the public sector, where workers have fared better than their private-sector peers during the crisis.An announcement on pay restraint is likely to exempt health-care workers who have been on the front line of the battle against coronavirus, according to people familiar with the matter. But the decision will be a blow to millions of teachers, police officers and civil servants, who just over a year ago were promised an end to almost a decade of austerity.With many public services pared to the bone, tax increases to repair the government finances appear inevitable once the crisis has passed. Sunak is under no under immediate pressure, however, with the BOE’s vast bond-buying program keeping borrowing costs at record lows.Friday’s ONS figures show that revenue was down 8.8% in the financial year to date compared with a year earlier, while spending surged 29% amid the huge cost of programs to support workers and businesses through through the crisis.A cash measure of borrowing totaled 260.8 billion pounds between April and October, suggesting the Debt Management Office may need to sell around half a trillion pounds of government bonds, or gilts, in the current fiscal year. Net debt climbed to 2.08 trillion pounds, or 100.8% of GDP.The first six months of the fiscal year saw the headline borrowing figure revised down by almost 16 billion pounds, largely reflecting stronger estimates for value-added tax and the timing of wage-subsidy payments to furloughed employees. In cash terms, the figures were little changed.Retail sales volumes rose 1.2% from September, the ONS said in a separate report. Economists expected a decline of 0.3%.Statisticians said evidence from businesses suggests part of the increase was driven by consumers starting their Christmas shopping earlier.

20-11-2020||World||Locked-down France inches toward ‘Black Friday’ postponement||Amazon’s director in France floated the possibility Friday of postponing its “Black Friday” discount shopping promotion by a week amid broad concerns that French shops shuttered by the nation’s coronavirus lockdown are hemorrhaging business and could be hurt further if they miss out on the consumer splurge.Mindful of the economic suffering felt by real-world storeowners but also of the health risks of prematurely easing the virus lockdown, the government was working to broker a deal to delay “Black Friday” until shuttered shops have been allowed to reopen, so they can also profit from consumer spending on cut-price goods ahead of Christmas.France’s economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, was working to get agreement from the e-commerce sector and supermarket chains to delay “Black Friday” by a week to December 4, by which time real-world stores might have emerged from lockdown.Le Maire’s ministry said supermarket operators and e-commerce sites are looking “favorably” at a possible postponement, “in a spirit of responsibility.”More talks were scheduled for Friday afternoon, “with a view to finalizing an agreement,” the ministry said.The director of Amazon France, Frederic Duval, told France Info radio on Friday before the meeting that the e-commerce distributor is ready to sign up to a delay.The focus on “Black Friday” is part of what has become a wider debate in France about the lopsided effects of lockdowns, with businesses deemed “nonessential” forced to close while some big distributors and e-commerce sites have thrived as consumers have shopped online instead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/locked-down-france-inches-toward-black-friday-postponement/story-G8lgJWjR4LbYRzqs2BBk7I.html
20-11-2020||World||China FM to visit Japan to discuss coronavirus, regional concerns||Japan’s foreign minister announced Friday that his Chinese counterpart will visit Tokyo next week to discuss ways to revive their pandemic-hit economies as well as regional concerns over China’s growing influence.“There are various issues of concern between Japan and China, and it is important that we resolve them one by one through high-level meetings like this,” Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said. “I hope to frankly exchange our views on regional issues, the global expansion of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as other international issues.”During his Nov. 24-25 visit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Motegi are expected to discuss resuming business trips between the world’s No. 2 and No. 3 economies through a “business track” program that would allow visitors to engage in limited business activity during 14-day quarantine periods. Japan recently launched such arrangements with South Korea and Vietnam.Motegi noted that Chinese visitors topped the number of tourists in Japan before the pandemic and said he hoped to discuss how they can resume travel while taking disease prevention measures.He said the two countries are not currently considering rescheduling Chinese President Xi Jinping’s state visit to Japan, postponed from the spring due to the pandemic, because they are focusing on their fight against the pandemic.Relations between the two countries have been strained over territorial disputes and wartime history.The visit comes amid growing concerns stemming from China’s increasing influence in the region.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison held talks this week with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in which they agreed to step up their military partnership and cooperation to promote peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region as a counter to China’s rise.The two countries, along with the U.S. and India, are also trying to bring in Southeast Asian nations and others to join their cooperation, which Beijing has criticized as an attempt to form an “Asian NATO” to counter China.Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters Friday that the vision, known as “Free and Open Indo-Pacific,” is not targeting a specific nation and “we plan to achieve it by cooperating with any country that shares the view.”Motegi said a meeting is being arranged between Wang and Suga during his visit, the first with a Japanese prime minister by a top Chinese official since the February visit of Chinese foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi.___Follow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mariyamaguchi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-fm-to-visit-japan-to-discuss-coronavirus-regional-concerns/story-wZvvFzRNmQUeWlmS68aItK.html
20-11-2020||World||Republicans defending Trump’s ‘bogus’ claims of voter fraud as they are ‘intimidated,’ claims Obama||Barack Obama has voiced concern over the Republican leaders’ attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and said that they are defending President Donald Trump’s “bogus claims” of voter fraud because they are “intimidated” by it. Democrat Joe Biden was declared the winner of the November 3 presidential election, but President Trump, a Republican, has refused to concede defeat and has filed multiple lawsuits, challenging poll results in several states. “I have been troubled, like I think every American, whether you’re a Democrat, a Republican or an independent, should be troubled, when you start having attempts to block, negate, overturn the people’s vote when there’s no actual evidence that there was anything illegal or fraudulent taking place,” former president Obama told MSNBC. He also criticised the conservative-leaning news outlets for giving a platform to Trump’s unsubstantiated claims. “And the degree to which you’ve seen some news outlets that cater to the right and the conservative viewpoint, somehow try to prop up these, you know, bogus claims,” Obama, the first Black American president said. In the last phase of the campaign, Obama had campaigned for former vice president Biden and Kamala Harris Harris in some of the key battleground States of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Georgia. The embattled Trump campaign has challenged vote count in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, among other states. A number of their lawsuits have been dismissed. “They’ve been repeatedly rejected by the courts. I’m less surprised by Trump doing this; he has shown only a flimsy relationship to the truth. I’m more troubled that you’re seeing a lot of Republican officials go along with it, not because they actually believe it but because they’re intimidated by it,” Obama said. Obama said that there is a difference between 2008 and now in 2020. “The way Trump is behaving in transition is very different than the way George Bush behaved in his final months, when he was in office — and because we’re in the middle of a pandemic we don’t know what inauguration is going to look like,” he said. President-elect Biden is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021. “But I think Biden is right to say that we should all make an effort to do our best to lower the temperature and listen to the other side. But, I think when you have a current president whose entire style is to fan division, that’s hard while he’s on the stage,” Obama said. Biden on Thursday won the Republican stronghold of Georgia, becoming the first Democrat to have won the key battleground state since 1992. With Georgia’s 16 electoral votes, Biden will now have 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232. To win the race to the White House, the successful candidate should have at least 270 electoral votes out of the 538-member Electoral College.

The first one, Aghdam, is to be turned over on Friday.Nagorno-Karabakh lies within Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. That war left not only Nagorno-Karabakh itself but substantial surrounding territory in Armenian hands.Heavy fighting that flared up Sept. 27 marked the biggest escalation of the decades-old conflict between the two ex-Soviet nations in over a quarter-century, killing hundreds and possibly thousands of people.The truce last week halted the violence after several failed attempts to establish a lasting cease-fire. It was celebrated as a victory in Azerbaijan, but sparked mass protests in Armenia, with thousands regularly taking to the streets to demand the ouster of the country’s prime minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/azerbaijani-army-enters-territory-ceded-by-armenian-forces/story-2sJUNyxEBzQVdke3fRbsGO.html
20-11-2020||World||Pakistani cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi dies at 54||Days after signing an agreement with the Pakistan government and calling off a sit-in of his party supporters that had blocked an important junction between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the chief of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, died in Lahore. He was 54. The cause of the Pakistani cleric’s death was not known. Some media reports hinted that he had symptoms similar to that of Covid-19, although that couldn’t be verified.TLP supporters had crippled parts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi last week when they held a sit-in to demand the expulsion of the French ambassador to Pakistan and the recall of his Pakistani counterpart in Paris. The sit-in was called off after Rizvi and ministers from the Imran Khan administration signed an understanding that took note of their demands. However on Thursday, Rizvi was taken ill and died soon after. According to the party’s spokesperson Muhammad Hamza, the TLP chief had been experiencing difficulty in breathing and was running a fever since Wednesday.The spokesperson added that Rizvi was at his madrasa on Multan Road when his condition deteriorated on Thursday evening. He was subsequently rushed to Farooq Hospital in Iqbal town, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. He was later taken to Sheikh Zayed hospital where doctors pronounced him dead.There was some confusion over his death after some reports on social media suggested that Rizvi had resumed breathing and had only been unconscious for a while. A party spokesman confirmed this, but added that soon after, the TLP leader had stopped breathing and was declared dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistani-cleric-khadim-hussain-rizvi-dies-at-54/story-LS6Ed52NaRvoyif97NR5aP.html
20-11-2020||World||Canada to return 18th century Annapurna statue to India||A stone statue of goddess Annapurna, which may have been stolen and transported to Canada over a century back, will be returned to India. The statue, dating back to the 18th century, was handed over by interim president and vice-chancellor of the University of Regina, Thomas Chase, to India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, in a virtual event that was also attended by officials from Global Affairs Canada and Canada Border Service Agency.The statue is believed to be originally from Varanasi and was part of the university’s collection in its MacKenzie Art Gallery. According to a release from the Indian high commission, the university recently discovered that the Annapurna statue may have been acquired “under suspicious circumstances and did not conform to current principles of ethical acquisition”.Bisaria expressed his gratitude for the proactive action of the university, which is located in the capital of the province of Saskatchewan, and said, “The move to voluntary repatriate such cultural treasures shows the level of maturity and understanding in India-Canada relations.”The statue was added to the gallery’s collection as part of a 1936 bequest by Norman Mackenzie, after whom it is named. That it may have been illegally brought to Canada was first raised by artist Divya Mehra as she was going through the collection while preparing for her exhibition, which began in August this year.According to a statement from the university, Mehra’s research showed that Mackenzie may have brought it back after a trip to India in 1913 after a stranger heard the collector’s “desire to have the statue, and stole it for him from its original location - a shrine at stone steps on the riverbank of the Ganges at Varanasi”.The Annapurna statue was then identified by Dr Siddhartha V Shah, curator of Indian and South Asian Art at the Peabody Essex Museum. Once alerted, the university sought to remedy the century-old wrong. Chase said, “As a university, we have a responsibility to right historical wrongs and help overcome the damaging legacy of colonialism wherever possible. Repatriating this statue does not atone for the wrong that was done a century ago, but it is an appropriate and important act today.”His views were echoed by Alex King, curator-preparator of the University’s president’s art collection, who said, “Today, we conduct due diligence on the provenance of incoming artwork, but will take steps to review objects that have been in our care before such standards were commonplace.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-return-18th-century-annapurna-statue-to-india/story-3EQAbghVUq5yWf3vunmpeO.html
20-11-2020||World||Amid US-China trade war, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to meet at virtual Asia Pacific meet||U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping will attend a virtual summit of Asia Pacific leaders on Friday to discuss the coronavirus and global economic recovery, with lingering trade differences likely to cloud the meeting.The pair will be at a meeting of the leaders of the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) hosted virtually by Malaysia just two weeks after Trump lost his re-election bid. Asia Pacific leaders have called for more open and multilateral trade to support the economic recovery, and warned against protectionist trade policies. After coming to power in 2017, Trump slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese products, which launched a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.At the last APEC summit in 2018, member countries failed to agree on a joint communique for the first time in the bloc’s history as the United States and China disagreed on trade and investments.In the run up to Friday’s meeting, several APEC leaders warned against protectionism as the world grapples with the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.“As we confront this generation’s biggest economic challenge, we must not repeat the mistakes of history by retreating into protectionism,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Friday, speaking at the APEC CEO Dialogues. “APEC must continue to commit to keeping markets open and trade flowing.”Xi on Thursday said “mounting unilateralism, protectionism and bullying as well as backlash against economic globalisation” had added to risks and uncertainties in the world economy.He said China will remain committed to multilateralism, openness and cooperation.Other Asia Pacific leaders have also expressed hope that a Joe Biden administration would engage more and support multilateral trade.Japan aims to expand the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Friday, potentially catering for China’s and Britain’s interest in joining the deal.Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, the predecessor to CPTPP. The United States is also absent from the world’s largest free-trade bloc, the Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (RCEP) - a 15-nation pact backed by China that was signed last week.The Trump administration has been criticised for a lower level of engagement in Asia. The only time he has joined an APEC summit - held annually - was in 2017. Last year’s summit in Chile was cancelled due to violent protests.Trump also missed two virtual Asia meetings last week: the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit and the broader East Asia Summit. Other than working on a joint communique, the APEC leaders are also expected to discuss the bloc’s post-2020 vision, which would replace the 1994 Bogor Goals - a set of targets on reducing barriers to trade and investment - that expire this year.

20-11-2020||World||France turns the screws on Imran Khan, declines upgrade for Mirage, subs and more||France has decided against helping Pakistan upgrade its fleet of Mirage fighter jets, air defence system and Agosta 90B class submarines, a direct fallout of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s loud criticism of French President Emmanuel Macron’s defence of the right to mock religion following the murder of a French schoolteacher, people familiar with the matter said.France has also told Qatar, one of the countries that bought the Rafale fighters, not to allow Pakistan-origin technicians to work with the plane over concerns that they could leak technical information about the fighter to Islamabad as the omni-role jet is the front-line fighter of India. Pakistan is known to share vital defence data with China in the past. Paris has already started putting the asylum requests from Pakistanis under detailed scrutiny in view of the strained ties between the two countries and the stabbing incident outside the former Paris office of the controversial Charlie Hebdo magazine. In September, Ali Hassan, an 18-year-old of Pakistani origin, stabbed two persons with a meat cleaver outside the magazine’s previous office, unaware that the magazine had shifted out. His father, who lives in Pakistan, later told a local news channel that his son had “done a great job” and he is “very happy” about the attack.Watch | France snubs Pakistan, refuses to upgrade Mirage fighter jets, submarines Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was told about the French government’s decisions when he visited Paris on 29 October after New Delhi criticised the personal attacks on President Macron. France also reassured Shringla that it is very sensitive to security concerns of its strategic ally and had issued directions about keeping Pakistan-origin technicians away from Rafale fighter jet under the export control regime in light of India’s security concerns that has inducted Rafale fighters in the Indian Air Force.The French government’s decision not to upgrade the Mirage III and Mirage 5 fighter jets could severely impact the Pakistan Air Force which has had about 150 Mirage fighter jets manufactured by the French firm Dassault Aviation. Only half of them, however, are serviceable.Pakistan had been buying Mirage jets for decades, some of them discarded by other countries, according to a 2018 AFP report, and has a facility outside Islamabad to refurbish the ageing fighter jets to keep them flying. Diplomats in New Delhi and Paris told Hindustan Times that Pakistan had recently requested France for upgrades to keep the fighter jets in the air. “The request has been declined,” one diplomat in Paris said.A similar request for upgrading the French-Italian air defence system has also been denied.Diplomats said a third request from Pakistan to upgrade its Agosta 90B class submarines with air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems that would allow them to stay underwater for longer has also been rejected by France. Pakistan has three Agosta 90B submarines: Khalid, Saad and Hamza.Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel had earlier turned down a similar request for supply of the AIP systems to upgrade submarines in Pakistan’s inventory due to its role in promoting terror, particularly Islamabad’s failure to cooperate in identifying the perpetrators of the truck bomb attack on the Germany Embassy in Kabul in May 2017.The French government’s decisions came soon after PM Khan, along with close ally Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, led the charge against President Macron after his statement on the beheading of a teacher near the school where he had shown his pupils caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad, considered blasphemous by Muslims.PM Khan followed up on his sharp criticism with an open letter to leaders of Muslim-majority countries that asked them to unite against “growing Islamophobia in non-Muslim states”. Pakistan’s National Assembly went a step further to pass a government-supported resolution that demanded recall of Pakistan’s envoy to Paris. It later realised that Pakistan hadn’t had an ambassador in Paris for three months.On the streets of Pakistan, there have been calls to boycott French goods. Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan, a hard-line Islamist group, which held a sit-in in Islamabad over republishing the caricatures in France, last week revealed that the government had agreed to boycott French goods. The group had made public an agreement with signatures of the federal minister for religious affairs and the interior minister agreeing to the boycott.The sharp criticism from Islamabad and Ankara is a contrast to the muted response from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt, the traditional Sunni world leaders, over President Macron’s effort to take corrective steps in his country. France and Turkey have been on opposite sides elsewhere as well including Libya, Mediterranean, Syria and Nagorno Karabakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-turns-the-screws-on-imran-khan-declines-upgrade-for-mirage-subs-and-more/story-QOPvQYDfvTfwGyJHQY80dN.html
20-11-2020||World||China’s carbon neutrality pledge hurt by new coal power plans, says climate report||China cannot build more coal-fired power plants after 2020 as planned if it wants to honour its pledge to go carbon neutral by 2060, new research by two environmental groups said on Friday.The Chinese government’s plans to build more coal-fired power plants “contradicts” its carbon neutral targets, Draworld Environment Research Centre of Beijing and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Finland said in the report published on Friday.China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, the country’s President Xi Jinping promised at the general debate of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September.“China will scale up its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions by adopting more vigorous policies and measures,” he had said.China is the world’s largest producer of greenhouse gases, accounting for 28% of global emissions.The rise in global emissions in 2019 was almost entirely due to China, which increased its CO2 output by 0.26GtCO2 (Gt: Gigatonnes), according to data published on the website CarbonBrief last year.The new report, published simultaneously from Beijing and Helsinki, titled “China’s carbon neutrality target implies planned coal power expansion cannot go ahead”, questions the lofty promise given Beijing’s plans to build more coal-fired plants.The report points out that China has around 130GW redundant coal power capacity among the total coal-fired capacity of more than 1,000GW. “However, power industry players have advocated for an expansion to 1,300GW or even higher by 2030,” it said.Here’s what needs to be done, according to the report’s authors.“The report’s authors call for China to initiate a policy process to phase out coal-fired power plants. At the same time, the rate of wind and solar power expansion needs to double over the next ten years to fulfill domestic targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” they said.“Short- and medium-term plans to decarbonise the power sector before 2050 are essential to achieve China’s much-lauded objective for carbon neutrality by 2060,” the authors added.Lead author, Dr. Zhang Shuwei, Draworld Environment Research Centre’s chief economist, said, “The proposed expansion of total installed capacity in a sector already riddled with overcapacity and low returns on assets will result in more than 2 trillion RMB of stranded assets during the entire life cycle.”“The policy on coal-fired power plants needs to consider employment and management of state-owned assets to promote a transition to renewable power. A further expansion of the coal-fired power industry would greatly complicate this challenge, requiring a cliff fall of coal power generation after 2030,” Zhang added.China has nearly 250 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power under development, a study published in June had said.New coal project approvals have accelerated in 2020, the joint study by Global Energy Monitor (GEM) and CREA said in June.“While much of the world is moving away from coal, China continues to make it a central part of its energy mix,” said Christine Shearer, coal programme director at GEM in June.The Draworld and CREA report says that power system planning of the “14th five-year Plan” should include a clear signal to at least double the annual rate of renewable energy installations, to more than 100GW annually. The required scale-up of emission-free power has already been envisioned in official documents: China’s 2016 energy strategy proposed that non-fossil fuel sources should account for at least 50% of total electricity generation by 2030.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-carbon-neutrality-pledge-hurt-by-new-coal-power-plans-says-climate-report/story-lHY7U2cOZCINLkg7qjR4ON.html
20-11-2020||World||Georgia affirms Joe Biden’s victory as Trump attempts to undermine election||After a painstaking recount, Georgia officials confirmed on Thursday that President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump in the battleground state on Nov. 3, further narrowing the president’s dubious effort to overturn the election results.The result of the six-day hand recount of the state’s 5 million ballots had been widely expected, despite baseless allegations from Trump and his allies that Georgia’s vote tallies were suspect because of widespread fraud.Amid a series of losses in court, Trump’s re-election campaign has shifted to a new strategy that relies on persuading Republican state legislators in crucial states to ignore the election results and intervene on Trump’s behalf, according to three people familiar with the plan.The campaign has filed multiple lawsuits to try to challenge the results in battleground states that Biden won, as election officials across the country have affirmed that there is no evidence of major irregularities. Judges in three states delivered new legal setbacks to the campaign on Thursday, rejecting claims of improper vote counting.Biden, a Democrat, has captured 306 electoral votes to the Republican Trump’s 232 in the state-by-state Electoral College that determines the winner of the election, well above the 270 needed for victory.Georgia’s audit, launched after unofficial results showed Biden leading Trump by about 14,000 votes cast, ended with Biden winning by 12,284, according to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s office. The state is expected to certify Biden’s victory on Friday.Trump and his allies, including Georgia’s Republican U.S. senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who both face runoff elections in January, have accused fellow Republican Raffensperger without evidence of overseeing a flawed election, an allegation Raffensperger has angrily disputed.In remarks on Thursday after a call with 10 state governors, Biden called Trump’s attempt to reverse the results “totally irresponsible.”“It sends a horrible message about who we are as a country,” said the president-elect, although he expressed no concern that the gambit would succeed in preventing him from taking office on Jan. 20.While legal experts see Trump’s last-gasp effort as unlikely to succeed, they say the strategy represents an unprecedented assault on the country’s democratic institutions by a sitting president.The Trump campaign has already asked a judge in Pennsylvania, where Biden won by 82,000 votes, to declare Trump the winner, allowing the Republican-controlled legislature to choose the state’s 20 Electoral College voters.Several prominent law firms have pulled out of the campaign’s legal challenges, leaving Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to spearhead the efforts.GIULIANI ALLEGES CONSPIRACYAt a news conference on Thursday, Giuliani said he planned to file more lawsuits and that Democrats had engaged in a “national conspiracy” to manipulate vote totals, although he admitted he did not have any evidence.Other members of the legal team floated a theory involving Venezuela and George Soros, a bogeyman of conservatives, although they said they would probably not pursue it in court.Giuliani said accounts of suspicious activity would ultimately overturn the election, which Biden won nationwide by 5.9 million votes. Some of those accounts have already been thrown out of court.“We cannot allow these crooks - because that’s what they are - to steal this election. They elected Donald Trump. They didn’t elect Joe Biden,” Giuliani said.Giuliani’s agitated performance, featuring rivulets of hair dye running down his face, was widely mocked by Democrats. Others expressed alarm.“That press conference was the most dangerous 1hr 45 minutes of television in American history,” tweeted Christopher Krebs, who headed up the U.S. government’s efforts to combat election disinformation until he was fired by Trump earlier this week.‘NO EXCUSE’Critics say Trump’s refusal to concede has serious implications for national security and the fight against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 250,000 Americans.Biden is not receiving the classified intelligence due a president-elect, and his transition team has not received the funding, office space and briefings from current government officials normally afforded to an incoming administration.He warned the delay could cause additional deaths as the pandemic surges to record levels across the country.“There is no excuse not to share the data and let us begin to plan, because on Day One it’s going to take us time, if we don’t have access to all this data,” he said in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. “It’s going to put us behind the eight ball by a matter of a month or more, and that’s lives.”The former vice president has focused on preparing his incoming administration, naming senior staff members and getting briefed by his advisers. He said on Thursday he had selected a Treasury secretary and could announce his pick as soon as next week.Democratic leaders in Congress sent a letter on Thursday to the administrator in charge of releasing transition funds, Emily Murphy, demanding that she explain why she has yet to recognize Biden as president-elect.Part of the new Trump campaign effort involves trying to delay certification, the normally routine process by which election results are finalized, a senior campaign official said.In Detroit on Tuesday, Republican members of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers refused at first to certify the results, then reversed themselves, then signed affidavits that they wanted to rescind their certification.One of the members told Reuters that Trump called her after she agreed to certify the results.Trump’s campaign dropped a federal lawsuit on Thursday challenging the election results in Michigan, citing the Wayne County officials’ affidavits. Officials said the affidavits were too late to stop certification.Republican legislative leaders from Michigan are scheduled to visit the White House on Friday at Trump’s request, a source in Michigan said, adding the lawmakers planned to hear what the president had to say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-affirms-joe-biden-s-victory-as-trump-attempts-to-undermine-election/story-Ztc014NteYsE8AwA6MgXcL.html

This modus operandi, Interpol said, can also be used to target other vulnerable groups.The international agency did not mention any specific instances of contaminated letters sent to politicians.Interpol said certain individuals may deliberately move from Covid-19 affected areas to non-affected areas despite their medical condition and travel restrictions.It said that instances of individuals claiming to sell contaminated samples of body fluids online have also been reported.Interpol has said that those in-charge of protecting prominent public figures should be made aware of these risks and specialised cyber-crime or counter-terrorism investigators should pay particular attention to online market places.It said postal and front-desk services should be informed of biological threats posed by suspicious packages and follow the regular protection measures.Interpol has also warned that malware and ransomware campaigns infecting computer systems of individuals are currently on rise. It added cyber-criminals were targeting sites where system access or data is critical for the deployment of ransomware.It said criminals are using health related equipment or services business to cover up suspicious transactions to integrate their ill-gotten money into the legal economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/letters-contaminated-with-covid-19-likely-to-be-sent-to-political-leaders-says-interpol/story-itY2M8WS53O7CNslrj1IwL.html
20-11-2020||World||Pfizer and BioNTech to seek emergency Covid-19 vaccine approval in US Friday||An emergency use authorization request for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech was expected to be filed with the FDA on Friday, the US government and BioNTech’s co-founder said.This type of Food and Drug Administration authorization is temporary or conditional and is granted in response to an emergency situation such as a pandemic.“Pfizer’s partner BioNTech has announced that tomorrow they intend to file for emergency use authorization at the FDA,” health secretary Alex Azar told a press conference Thursday in Washington.Click here for latest updates on coronavirus here BioNTech co-founder Ugur Sahin earlier told AFP in a Zoom interview: “The documents will be finalized today and tomorrow and submitted to the FDA.”The FDA did not say how long it would take to review the data on vaccine efficacy and safety, the two main criteria. The scientific head of the US operation to develop a vaccine, Moncef Slaoui said Monday that the green light would probably come in December -- a timeframe echoed by Sahin.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageHe told AFP there is a chance they could receive the green light from the US “this year,” and even starting delivering the vaccine by December.The BioNTech/Pfizer shot and another one being developed by US firm Moderna have taken the lead in the global chase for a vaccine, after large-scale trial data this month showed that their jabs were around 95 percent effective against Covid-19.The twin breakthroughs have lifted hopes for an end to a pandemic that has infected more than 56 million people and caused over 1.3 million deaths worldwide since the virus first emerged in China late last year.“We would expect to see Moderna filing soon also,” Azar said at the press conference.The US, the European Union and a slew of other nations have already placed orders for hundreds of millions of doses of the top vaccine candidates in development.Health workers, carers and people considered at high risk for severe Covid-19 are set to be first in line for the jabs. ‘This is really solid’ Both vaccines are based relatively new technology that uses a synthetic version of a molecule called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.No vaccine based on this platform has ever been approved.The speed at which the vaccines have been developed has raised alarm in some quarters. Traditional virus vaccines use actual viruses that can take months or years to develop.But top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci sought to dispell those concerns during a rare briefing by the White House task force Thursday. “The process of the speed did not compromise at all safety nor did it compromise scientific integrity. It was a reflection of the extraordinary scientific advances in these types of vaccines which allowed us to do things in months that actually took years before,” Fauci said.“It was actually an independent body of people who have no allegiance to anyone -- not to the administration, not to me, not to the companies -- that looked at the data and deemed it to be sound,” he continued.“So we need to put to rest any concept that this was rushed in an inappropriate way. This is really solid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-and-biontech-to-seek-emergency-covid-19-vaccine-approval-in-us-friday/story-W1h5FG5E1DBSF96ADaVFPL.html

Schools, universities, cafes and restaurants are closed, weddings and funerals are banned and mask-wearing is mandatory.“We want to go hard, go early, but get out of it as quickly as we can,” State Premier Steven Marshall said of the measures.Twenty-three people in the state capital Adelaide have been infected after a cleaner at a hotel used to quarantine people arriving from overseas was exposed to the virus, and health authorities say the “circuit breaker” measures are necessary to avoid a wider outbreak.Marshall said the strain of the virus that’s circulating is “nasty” as many of those infected are not showing any symptoms. He said it was highly likely to be transmitted from surfaces and that the incubation period was as low as 24 hours.“It’s a real worry, especially because people who become infected are not showing the typical symptoms that we are used to,” he said.The state of 1.7 million people, who are spread out over a landmass five times the size of the UK, had largely eradicated community transmission of the virus after a nationwide lockdown earlier this year.The cluster, and a more severe outbreak in neighboring Victoria state that triggered a three-month lockdown in the city of Melbourne, show that ongoing vigilance is required to control the virus -- even in a nation that has been spared the scale of infections and deaths experienced in Europe and the U.S.Victoria is proof that hard lockdowns do work. The state, which saw a daily peak of around 700 infections in August, has now gone 20 days without new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-one-of-world-s-toughest-lockdown-in-south-australia-only-one-family-member-allowed-to-leave-home/story-4SjpQJlJQWjwvqztIeceLN.html
20-11-2020||World||Covid-19 could disrupt global recovery, says IMF director||The head of the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that the while the United States and other major economies turned in better-than-expected economic performances in the third quarter, the world now faces slower momentum with a resurgence in coronavirus cases.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a note prepared for a virtual meeting of the leaders of the Group of 20 major economies that significant progress on the vaccines raised “hopes of vanquishing the virus that has taken more than a million lives and caused tens of millions of job losses” around the world.The G-20 virtual leaders summit, which Saudi Arabia is conducting this week in its role as this year’s head of the G-20, will focus on efforts to stabilise the global economy and hopefully, foster a rebound next year.Last month, the IMF forecast that the global economy would contract by an historic 4.4% this year and then mount a partial and uneven recovery, with global growth rebounding by 5.2% next year.“While a medical solution is now in sight, the economic path ahead remains difficult and prone to setbacks,” Georgieva said. Many risks remain, including the threat that new outbreaks may require more stringent shutdowns, she said.Such a development, she wrote in her memo to accompany the IMF’s G-20 surveillance report, would mean that “growth will be lower, public debt higher and the scars on the long-term potential of the economy more severe.” It is important that governments avoid a premature withdrawal of economic support, Georgieva said. She recommended that major economies consider a synchronized investment in infrastructure as a way to provide jobs.“The bottom line is that we can build the impetus for growth, jobs and address climate change far more effectively if we work together,” she wrote.The G-20 leaders’ summits were begun in 2008 in an effort to find ways for the world’s major economies to cooperate to address the global downturn that occurred after the 2008 financial crisis pushed the global economy into a deep recession.In addition to traditional economic powers like the US, Japan, Germany, France and Britain, the G-20 includes major developing countries such as China and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-disrupt-global-recovery-says-imf-director/story-8MjZ35T7w1lELOcwjQtRWK.html
20-11-2020||World||Oxford scientists expect Covid-19 vaccine data by Christmas||University of Oxford scientists expect to report results from the late-stage trials of their Covid-19 vaccine by Christmas, a key researcher said on Thursday as he discussed the team’s latest findings.Dr Andrew Pollard, an expert in pediatric infection and immunity at Oxford, said research was slowed by low infection rates over the summer, but the Phase III trials are now accumulating the data needed to report results as a renewed surge of the pandemic hits countries around the world. Oxford is developing its vaccine in conjunction with the drugmaker AstraZeneca.“I think we’re getting close, and it’s definitely going to be before Christmas based on the progress,” Pollard said in an interview with the BBC.Two other drugmakers, Pfizer and Moderna, this week reported preliminary results from late-stage trials showing that their Covid-19 vaccines were almost 95% effective.Pollard said there is no competition between the various research teams, because several vaccines will be needed to bring the global pandemic under control and allow life to return to normal.Despite recent progress, Pollard said the world is still in the early stages of the effort to protect people against Covid-19. Even after vaccines are approved by regulators, drugmakers and public health officials still face the task of producing billions of doses and administering them to people around the world, he said.Pollard, an amateur mountaineer, compared the task to the work involved in climbing a mountain.“I think we’re still at the bottom of that mountain in some ways,” he said. “We’ve done the route into the bottom of the mountain, the long trek to get to the start. Now we’ve got to get the data about the vaccines in front of regulators for them to scrutinise it and approve the first vaccines. And then we’ve got that huge effort to climb up to the top where we’ve got a vast majority of those who are at risk vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-scientists-expect-covid-19-vaccine-data-by-christmas/story-4mRdHwlq5l2zLwpJiQ4QPK.html
20-11-2020||World||Conspiracy film about vaccines grabs eyeballs||A controversial documentary film questioning the purpose of coronavirus vaccines has gone viral in France after endorsements from politicians and celebrities, some of whom later withdrew their support.Hold Up got more than 4 million views on Google’s YouTube and other platforms over a couple of days last week, helped along on social media by public figures including lawmakers, former first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy and actor Sophie Marceau.Suspicions over the safety and effectiveness of vaccines are widespread in France. In a study released this week by the think tank Fondation Jean-Jaures, 43% of respondents said they would refuse to get a shot - 7% more than in the US, and twice as many as in the UK.The video, which is more than two hours long, suggests the global response to Covid-19 is a plot hatched by big drug companies and governments to create a surveillance state and a submissive population.The film has echoes of the English-language documentary Plandemic that also went viral earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/conspiracy-film-about-vaccines-grabs-eyeballs/story-4apstNUxG6crDoViozaq6I.html
20-11-2020||World||WHO advises against Gilead’s Remdesivir for all hospitalised Covid-19 patients||Gilead’s drug Remdesivir is not recommended for patients hospitalised with Covid-19, regardless of how ill they are, as there is no evidence it improves survival or reduces the need for ventilation, a World Health Organization panel said on Friday.“The ... panel found a lack of evidence that Remdesivir improved outcomes that matter to patients such as reduced mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, time to clinical improvement, and others,” the guideline said.The advice is another setback for the drug, which grabbed worldwide attention as a potentially effective treatment for Covid-19 in the summer after early trials showed some promise.At the end of October, Gilead cut its 2020 revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand and difficulty in predicting sales of Remdesivir .The antiviral is one of only two medicines currently authorised to treat Covid-19 patients across the world, but a large WHO-led trial known as the Solidarity Trial showed last month that it had little or no effect on 28-day mortality or length of hospital stays for Covid-19 patients.The medication was one of the drugs used to treat US President Donald Trump’s coronavirus infection, and had been shown in previous studies to have cut time to recovery. It is authorised or approved for use as a Covid-19 treatment in more than 50 countries.Gilead has questioned the Solidarity Trial’s results.The WHO’s Guideline Development Group (GDG) panel said its recommendation was based on an evidence review that included data from four international randomised trials involving more than 7,000 patients hospitalised with Covid-19.After reviewing the evidence, the panel said, it concluded that Remdesivir , which has to be given intravenously and is therefore costly and complex to administer, has no meaningful effect on death rates or other important outcomes for patients.“Especially given the costs and resource implications associated with Remdesivir ...the panel felt the responsibility should be on demonstrating evidence of efficacy, which is not established by the currently available data,” it added.The latest WHO advice comes after one of the world’s top bodies representing intensive care doctors said the antiviral should not be used for Covid-19 patients in critical care wards.The WHO’s recommendation, which is not binding, is part of its so-called “living guidelines” project, designed to offer guidance for doctors to help them make clinical decisions about patients in fast-moving situations such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The guidelines can be updated and reviewed as new evidence and information emerges.The panel said, however, that it supported continued enrolment into clinical trials evaluating Remdesivir in patients with COVID-19, which it said should “provide higher certainty of evidence for specific groups of patients”.The recommendation may raise further questions about whether the European Union will need the 500,000 courses of the antiviral worth 1 billion euros it ordered last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-advises-against-gilead-s-remdesivir-for-all-hospitalised-covid-19-patients/story-GfooFQ9QGdpWSTw2VbJJ3N.html
20-11-2020||World||Douglas Stuart wins 2020 Booker Prize; Avni Doshi misses out||Scottish writer Douglas Stuart, whose debut novel ‘Shuggie Bain’ described a boy growing up in Glasgow in the 1980s with a mother battling addiction, has won the 2020 Booker Prize for Fiction from a six-member shortlist that included Indian-origin writer Avni Doshi’s ‘Burnt Sugar’.The awards ceremony was broadcast on BBC with the six authors joining virtually. The event included messages from former US President Barack Obama, the Duchess of Cornwall and former Booker winners Kazuo Ishiguro, Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo.Stuart, 44, who won the £50,000 prize after being announced the winner by chair of the judges Margaret Busby, delivered an acceptance speech and received a trophy, a designer-bound edition of his book and a further £2,500 for being shortlisted.Based on his own childhood, Stuart’s book is described as a searing account of the boy growing up in Thatcher’s Glasgow. He dedicated the book to his own mother, who died of alcoholism when he was 16.After graduating from the Royal College of Art, he moved to New York to start a career in fashion design, and started writing in his spare time a decade ago. His work has since appeared in LitHub and in The New Yorker, which has published two of his short stories this year. He is currently finishing his second novel, Loch Awe, also set in Glasgow.Busby, editor, literary critic and former publisher, said: “‘Shuggie Bain is destined to be a classic — a moving, immersive and nuanced portrait of a tight-knit social world, its people and its values. The heart-wrenching story tells of the unconditional love between Agnes Bain — set on a descent into alcoholism by the tough circumstances life has dealt her — and her youngest son”.“Shuggie struggles with responsibilities beyond his years to save his mother from herself, at the same time as dealing with burgeoning feelings and questions about his own otherness. Gracefully and powerfully written, this is a novel that has impact because of its many emotional registers and its compassionately realised characters”, she added.Obama said in his message: “I’ve always turned to writing to make sense of our world … And at their best Booker Prize listed books remind me of fiction’s power to put ourselves in someone else’s shoes, understand their struggles, and imagine new ways to tackle complex problems and effect change”.The 2020 shortlist was: The New Wilderness by Diane Cook (Oneworld Publications); This Mournable Body by Tsitsi Dangarembga (Faber & Faber); Burnt Sugar by Avni Doshi (Hamish Hamilton, Penguin Random House); The Shadow King by Maaza Mengiste (Canongate Books); Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart (Picador, Pan Macmillan); Real Life by Brandon Taylor (Originals, Daunt Books Publishing).First awarded in 1969, The Booker Prize is considered one of the leading prizes for literary fiction written in English. The list of former winners features several of the literary giants of the last five decades: from Iris Murdoch to Salman Rushdie, Kazuo Ishiguro to Hilary Mantel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/douglas-stuart-wins-2020-booker-prize-avni-doshi-misses-out/story-AO1GvCDs0TYpYZzYmmshHL.html
20-11-2020||World||Donald Trump, allies make frantic steps to overturn Joe Biden victory||President Donald Trump and his allies are taking increasingly frantic steps to subvert the results of the 2020 election, including summoning state legislators to the White House as part of a longshot bid to overturn Joe Biden’s victory.Among other last-ditch tactics: personally calling local election officials who are trying to rescind their certification votes in Michigan, suggesting in a legal challenge that Pennsylvania set aside the popular vote there and pressuring county officials in Arizona to delay certifying vote tallies.Election law experts see it as the last, dying gasps of the Trump campaign and say Biden is certain to walk into the Oval Office come January. But there is great concern that Trump’s effort is doing real damage to public faith in the integrity of US elections.“It’s very concerning that some Republicans apparently can’t fathom the possibility that they legitimately lost this election,” said Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky who researches and teaches election law.“We depend on democratic norms, including that the losers graciously accept defeat,” he said. “That seems to be breaking down.”Trump’s own election security agency has declared the 2020 presidential election to have been the most secure in history. Days after that statement was issued, Trump fired the agency’s leader.The increasingly desperate and erratic moves are not expected to change the outcome of the 2020 election, where Biden has now received more votes than any other presidential candidate in history and has clinched the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win.But the president’s constant barrage of baseless claims, his work to personally sway local officials who certify votes and his allies’ refusal to admit he lost is likely to have a lasting negative impact on the country. Legions of his supporters don’t believe he lost.Also Read: Trump’s lawyer alleges voter fraud in ‘big cities’, says loss in Pennsylvania ‘statistically impossible’“It’s about trying to set up the conditions where half of the country believes that there are only two possibilities, either they win or the election was stolen,” said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law scholar and professor at Loyola Law School. “And that’s not a democracy.”The two GOP canvassers in Michigan’s Wayne County said in a statement Thursday they lacked confidence that the election was fair and impartial. “There has been a distinct lack of transparency throughout the process,” they said. But there has been no evidence of impropriety or fraud in Michigan, election officials have said.Trump’s allies have homed in on the way that the president’s early lead in Michigan and some other states on Election Night slipped away as later votes came, casting it as evidence of something nefarious.But a massive influx of mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic leaned largely to Biden, who encouraged his supporters to vote by mail, and those votes were the last to be counted. So it appeared Trump had an edge when he really didn’t.In fact, Biden crushed Trump in Wayne County, a Democratic stronghold that includes Detroit, by a more than 2-1 margin on his way to winning Michigan by 146,000 votes, according to unofficial results.Earlier this week, the county’s two Republicans canvassers blocked the certification of votes there. They later relented and the results were certified. But a person familiar with the matter said Trump reached out to the canvassers, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, on Tuesday evening after the revised vote to express gratitude for their support. Then, on Wednesday, Palmer and Hartmann signed affidavits saying they believed the county vote “should not be certified.”They cannot rescind their votes, according to the Michigan secretary of state. The four-member state canvassing board is expected to meet Monday and also is split with two Democrats and two Republicans.Trump appears intent on pushing the issue. He has invited Michigan’s Republican legislative leaders, Senate Majority Mike Shirkey and House Speaker Lee Chatfield, to the White House, according to two officials familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. The two have agreed to go, according to one official, but they haven’t commented publicly, and it’s not clear what the purpose of the meeting is.The Michigan Legislature would be called on to select electors if Trump succeeded in convincing the state’s board of canvassers not to certify Biden’s 153,000-vote victory in the state. But both legislative leaders have indicated they will not try to overturn Biden’s win.“Michigan law does not include a provision for the Legislature to directly select electors or to award electors to anyone other than the person who received the most votes,” Shirkey’s spokeswoman said last week.During a press conference in Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday, Biden said Americans are “witnessing incredible irresponsibility, incredibly damaging messages are being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions.”“I just think it’s totally irresponsible.”A few hours earlier, Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and others had held a press conference to allege a widespread Democratic election conspiracy involving multiple states and suspect voting machines. But election officials across the country have said repeatedly there was no widespread fraud.Many of the allegations of fraud stem from poll watchers who filed affidavits included with lawsuits in battleground states aimed at delaying vote certification. Those affidavits lean into innuendo and unsupported suggestions of fraud.For example, they refer to suitcases in a polling place, but make no suggestion that ballots were being secretly counted. There are allegations of ballots being duplicated — something routinely done when a ballot is physically damaged. There are claims that partisan poll watchers were too far away to observe well and therefore something fishy was probably going on. But they don’t have proof. Poll watchers have no auditing role in elections; they are volunteer observers.Also Read: Why is President Trump pursuing recount of 2 Wisconsin counties?Giuliani cited a few sworn affidavits that he said showed a vast Democratic conspiracy, but added that he could not reveal much of the evidence. One he cited was from Jessy Jacob, identified as a city employee in Detroit who said she saw other workers coaching voters to cast ballots for Biden and the Democrats.A judge who refused to block certification of Detroit-area results noted that Jacob’s claims included no “date, location, frequency or names of employees” and that she only came forward after unofficial results indicated Biden had won Michigan.Trump legal adviser Jenna Ellis, who joined Giuliani, said more evidence would be forthcoming and that Trump’s allies would have more success in courts going forward. But so far, most of their legal actions have been dismissed.Chris Krebs, the Trump administration election official fired last week over the comments about the security of 2020, tweeted: “That press conference was the most dangerous 1hr 45 minutes of television in American history. And possibly the craziest.”In Pennsylvania, where the Trump campaign is challenging the election results in federal court, a legal team led by Giuliani suggested in a filing Wednesday that the judge order the Republican-led state legislature to pick delegates to the Electoral College, potentially throwing the state’s 20 electoral votes to Trump. A judge canceled an evidentiary hearing in the case.In Arizona, the Republican Party is pressuring county officials to delay certifying results. The GOP lost a bid on Thursday to postpone certification in Maricopa County, the state’s most populous. In northwestern Arizona, Mohave County officials postponed their certification until next week.Judge John Hannah ruled without explanation, except to bar the party from refiling the case. The judge promised a full explanation in the future.Maricopa County officials are expected to certify elections results on Friday.Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes, and Maricopa County put him over the top. The county performed a hand count of some ballots the weekend after the election, which showed its machine counts were 100% accurate. The same was found Wednesday during routine post-election accuracy tests.In Georgia, where officials have been auditing the results of the presidential race, Trump has repeatedly attacked the process and called it “a joke.”He has also made repeated incorrect assertions that Georgia election officials are unable to verify signatures on absentee ballot envelopes. In fact, Georgia requires that they be checked.The secretary of state’s office planned to release results of the audit on Thursday.During the hand tally, several counties found previously uncounted ballots that the secretary of state’s office has said would reduce Biden’s lead to just under 13,000 votes, with roughly 5 million total votes cast. Georgia law allows a candidate to request a recount within two business days of certification if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. That recount would be done using machines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-allies-make-frantic-steps-to-overturn-joe-biden-victory/story-aUgiD7iFs28lcWDe8MdxOJ.html

Past and future cyber operations have and will continue to operate under existing laws, including those granted by the Intelligence Services Act and the Investigatory Powers Act.General Patrick Sanders of Strategic Command, which leads on cyber, intelligence, special forces and information capabilities for Defence, said: “Just over 100 years ago we created a new force to defend the UK from threats in a new domain – the air”.“Today’s announcement of the formation of the National Cyber Force to defend the UK in cyberspace marks a similar milestone and the imperative is just as vital because cyberspace is the most contested domain where our adversaries and our allies will meet over the next decade and beyond”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-16-5-billion-push-ramps-up-uk-s-offensive-cyber-capabilities/story-qlUTwdJE7Wp05k2XVZLR4H.html

I think that would be counterproductive,” Biden, who takes office on January 20, told reporters, according to news agency AFP. The United States continues to be the worst hit country from the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Worldometer figures, 12,017,723 people have been infected whereas over 250,000 have died so far. New York has the maximum number of deaths due to the disease followed by Texas, California and Florida. Biden on Wednesday highlighted that a range of information had not been made available to his campaign, including the distribution plan for coronavirus vaccines.Also Read: CDC recommends Americans don’t travel for Thanksgiving to limit spread of CovidOn Thursday, Democratic senator Chris Murphy said that officials from President Donald Trump’s vaccine distribution effort have not briefed anyone on Biden’s transition team and have no plans to do so. “Just off a conference call with Trump Administration vaccine distribution team. They confirmed that they have not briefed anyone on President-elect Biden’s team and have no plans to do so. This is potentially catastrophic,” Murphy tweeted. Meanwhile, The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended citizens to not travel during the Thanksgiving holiday to curb the spread of coronavirus. The travel recommendation is a “strong recommendation,” not a requirement, a CDC official said. Thanksgiving along with Christmas is the busiest time for domestic travel across the country.

The White House declined to say on Wednesday whether President Donald Trump plans to address the gathering in Malaysia, held virtually this year because of the pandemic.“We will not reverse course or run against the historical trend by decoupling or forming a small circle to keep others out,” Xi said by video. “Opening up to the outside world is a basic national policy, and it will not waver at any time.”Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said after Xi that a US government led by Biden was more likely to adopt a multilateral approach to trade that was supportive of existing international institutions and forums. Lee, whose city-state is dependent on trade as well as US security support, took a swipe Trump’s at “America First” economic policies.“They have not been supportive of trade as a win-win proposition,” Lee said. “The attitude of the Trump administration is that this is a win-lose proposition: ‘If I have a trade surplus with you, that is good for me. If I have a trade deficit with you, that is bad for me.’ Trade is not like that.”Prime Ministers Scott Morrison of Australia, Yoshihide Suga of Japan and Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand were among those expected to speak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-we-will-avoid-decoupling-despite-tensions/story-K3hFWHV0Hr6zCRXnoRUXdL.html
20-11-2020||World||US deaths top 250,000, Tokyo on high alert as Covid-19 cases soar||The metropolis of Tokyo is raising its coronavirus alert to its highest level, following reports of record high new daily cases, governor Yuriko Koike has said. She urged people to take measures to prevent the spread of the deadly disease, but didn’t yet ask businesses to curtail activities.Across the Pacific, US deaths from Covid-19 surpassed 250,000, marking a grim milestone as the nation struggles to contain a new surge in cases. New York City said it will shut all schools after coronavirus infections crossed a critical threshold. New York state has the most US fatalities, at more than 34,000. Texas is second, followed by California and Florida.There was alarm and caution in the southern hemisphere as well. South Australia began one of the world’s toughest lockdowns, with even outdoor exercise and dog-walking banned as the state tries to contain a cluster of Covid-19 infections.In Tokyo, new coronavirus cases reached 534 on Thursday, taking the cumulative total to 36,256. Japan’s daily Covid-19 cases rose to a record of more than 2,000 on Wednesday. Japan’s capital raised its Covid-19 alert to the highest of four levels, as daily infections topped 500 for the first time. New York’s recovery from the outbreak suffered twin blows with the announcement of citywide school closings and the warning of massive cuts to public-transit service. Parents of hundreds of thousands of kids must find alternative arrangements by Thursday, after mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had reached a 3% positivity rate that triggered a temporary halt to in-class instruction.Russia has resumed the vaccination of new volunteers in its trial for its Sputnik V vaccine after a short pause as Moscow moves to accelerate plans to inoculate the population. It comes as Russia topped 2 million Covid-19 infections, pushing its hospital system to the brink.As coronavirus cases surge across West Asia, the regional director for the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday the only way to avoid mass deaths is for countries to quickly tighten restrictions.In a press briefing from Cairo, Ahmed al-Mandhari, director of WHO’s eastern Mediterranean region, which comprises most of West Asia, expressed concern that countries in the area were lowering their guard.The fundamentals of pandemic response, from social distancing to mask wearing, “are still not being fully practised in our region”, he lamented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-deaths-top-250-000-tokyo-on-high-alert-as-covid-19-cases-soar/story-uFLDWZpFttWYWFmTPAfyRO.html
20-11-2020||World||Facebook tagged 167 million user posts for Covid-19 misinformation||Facebook Inc. said it labeled 167 million user posts this year for including information about Covid-19 that was “debunked” by the social network’s fact-checkers.The warning labels on coronavirus falsehoods were added to posts since March for violating the social network’s misinformation policies, executives said Thursday. An additional 12 million user posts were removed entirely from Facebook and Instagram for Covid-19 misinformation that the company believed could lead to immediate physical harm.The numbers were disclosed Thursday alongside Facebook’s quarterly Community Standards report, which details how much content the company removes for rule violations. Misinformation appears to be Facebook’s most widespread problem, though the company removed or labeled millions of posts in other categories as well, including bullying, harassment and spam.Facebook also divulged the prevalence of hate speech on its service for the first time. The company estimates that hate speech content accounts for 0.11% of all content views on the service. Facebook is often criticized for its handling of hate speech and other offensive content, but the company said it removed or labeled 22.1 million posts about hate speech in the third quarter, and detected roughly 95% of those posts before users reported them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-tagged-167-million-user-posts-for-covid-19-misinformation/story-wgaEwy8tPnbEFyAQjOabkM.html
20-11-2020||World||National Science Foundation announces closure of huge radio telescope at Puerto Rico||The National Science Foundation announced Thursday that it will close the huge telescope at the renowned Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico in a blow to scientists worldwide who depend on it to search for planets, asteroids and extraterrestrial life.The independent, federally funded agency said it’s too dangerous to keep operating the single dish radio telescope -- one of the world’s largest -- given the significant damage it recently sustained. An auxiliary cable broke in August and tore a 100-foot hole in the reflector dish and damaged the dome above it. Then on Nov. 6, one of the telescope’s main steel cables snapped, leading officials to warn that the entire structure could collapse.NSF officials noted that even if crews were to repair all the damage, engineers found that the structure would still be unstable in the long term.“This decision is not an easy one for NSF to make, but the safety of people is our number one priority,” said Sean Jones, the agency’s assistant director for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate. “We understand how much Arecibo means to this community and to Puerto Rico.”He said the goal was to preserve the telescope without placing people at risk, but, “we have found no path forward to allow us to do so safely.”The telescope was built in the 1960s with money from the Defense Department amid a push to develop anti-ballistic missile defenses. In its 57 years of operation, it endured hurricanes, endless humidity and a recent string of strong earthquakes.The telescope boasts a 1,000-foot-wide (305-meter-wide) dish featured in the Jodie Foster film “Contact” and the James Bond movie “GoldenEye.” Scientists worldwide have used the dish along with the 900-ton platform hanging 450 feet above it to track asteroids on a path to Earth, conduct research that led to a Nobel Prize and determine if a planet is potentially habitable.In recent years, the NSF-owned facility has been managed by the University of Central Florida.Alex Wolszczan, a Polish-born astronomer and professor at Pennsylvania State University who helped discover the first extrasolar and pulsar planets, told The Associated Press that while the news wasn’t surprising, it was disappointing. He worked at the telescope in the 1980s and early 1990s.“I was hoping against hope that they would come up with some kind of solution to keep it open,” he said. “For a person who has had a lot of his scientific life associated with that telescope, this is a rather interesting and sadly emotional moment.”The announcement saddened many beyond the scientific world as well, with the hashtag #WhatAreciboMeansToMe popping up on Twitter along with pictures of people working, visiting and even getting married or celebrating a birthday at the telescope.Ralph Gaume, director of NSF’s Division of Astronomical Sciences, stressed that the decision has nothing to do with the observatory’s capabilities, which have allowed scientists to study pulsars to detect gravitational waves as well as search for neutral hydrogen, which can reveal how certain cosmic structures are formed.“The telescope is currently at serious risk of unexpected, uncontrolled collapse,” he said. “Even attempts at stabilization or testing the cables could result in accelerating the catastrophic failure.”Officials suspect a potential manufacturing error is to blame for the auxiliary cable that snapped after a socket holding it failed, but say they are surprised that a main cable broke about three months later given that it was supporting only about 60% of its capacity. Engineers had assessed the situation after the first cable broke, noting that about 12 of the roughly 160 wires of the second cable that eventually broke had already snapped, said Ashley Zauderer, program officer for Arecibo Observatory at NSF.“It was identified as an issue that needed to be addressed, but it wasn’t seen as an immediate threat,” she said.She and other NSF officials said that all standard maintenance procedures had been followed.The closure is a blow for many of the more than 250 scientists that have used a telescope that is also considered one of Puerto Rico’s main tourist attractions, drawing some 90,000 visitors a year. It also has long served as a training ground for hundreds of graduate students.“It was my Disney,” wrote Edgard Rivera-Valentín, a Universities Space Research Association scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Texas, in a series of tweets. He recalled first visiting when he was 4 or 5.“Think about what the Golden Gate Bridge means to San Francisco, Statue of Liberty to New Yorkers. Arecibo is this and more to Puerto Rico because it has gone beyond an icon.”The NSF said it intends to restore operations at the observatory’s remaining assets including its two LIDAR facilities, one of which is located in the nearby island of Culebra. Those are used for upper atmospheric and ionospheric research, including analyzing cloud cover and precipitation data. Officials also aim to resume operations at the visitor center.Wolszczan, the astronomer, said the value of the telescope won’t instantly disappear because he and many other scientists are still working on projects based on observations and data taken from the observatory.“The process of saying goodbye to Arecibo will certainly take some years,” he said. “It won’t be instantaneous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/national-science-foundation-announces-closure-of-huge-radio-telescope-at-puerto-rico/story-w2jzixla4NcLrH7OEpKSxL.html
20-11-2020||World||US Senator Chris Murphy says Donald Trump’s vaccine team have no plans to brief Joe Biden’s team||Officials from President Donald Trump’s vaccine distribution effort have not briefed anyone on President-elect Joe Biden’s transition team, and have no plans to do so, a Democratic US senator said after a White House call Thursday.“Just off a conference call with Trump Administration vaccine distribution team,” Senator Chris Murphy said on Twitter. “They confirmed that they have not briefed anyone on President-elect Biden’s team and have no plans to do so. This is potentially catastrophic.”The call, for all senators, was conducted on Thursday morning by General Gustave Perna and Dr. Moncef Slaoui, leaders of “Operation Warp Speed,” the administration’s vaccine-development effort, a Congressional aide said.Asked for comment, White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern did not address whether Biden’s team would be briefed, saying vaccine distribution plans from the Centers for Disease Control and state governors were publicly available.“Manufacturing is well underway, and Dr. Slaoui confirmed that 20 million Americans are on track for vaccinations in December with tens of millions per month thereafter,” Morgenstern said.A wave of coronavirus infection has gripped the United States and the death toll surpassed 250,000 this week. A vaccine may be available in the coming months, but distributing it to over 300 million Americans might be complicated by special storage and transport conditions.Biden said on Wednesday that a range of information had not been made available to his campaign, including the distribution plan for Covid-19 vaccines. His administration is scheduled to take over the US government on Jan. 20, when he is inaugurated.Failure to promptly share critical Covid-19 data with Biden’s team will cause needless, deadly delays in tackling the pandemic, leaders of the US medical establishment said in a letter to Trump Tuesday.Biden’s transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Emily Murphy, administrator of the General Services Administration, a generally little-known agency that keeps the US government running, has so far refused to “ascertain” the winner of the Nov. 3 presidential election between Biden and Trump, a condition for releasing funds and resources to the winner.Despite a clear margin of victory for Biden, Trump has refused to concede, and his legal challenges are fizzling. But he has been backed up by many of his fellow Republicans, both in Washington and around the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-vaccine-team-will-not-brief-biden-administration-says-us-senator/story-ivHzLgVvEraCcnS1IszCdM.html
20-11-2020||World||French court gives deadline to Emmanuel Macron for proving climate actions||France’s highest administrative court on Thursday gave the government three months to show it is enacting climate policies that will ensure it meets its commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The Conseil d’Etat’s ruling raises questions about the credibility of President Emmanuel Macron’s climate plan and affirms the binding nature of greenhouse gas reduction targets that are contained in legislation.France, which brokered the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, has committed to reducing greenhouse gases by 40% of their 1990 levels by 2030. But the court noted that France was already missing targets and had delayed much of the reduction effort until after 2020.“If the justifications so provided by the government were not satisfactory, the Conseil d’Etat may then consider requiring to take further steps in order to achieve the target of 40% by 2030,” the court said in a press release.The case was brought to the court by the commune of Grande-Synthe in northern France. The town is built on reclaimed land and local officials say it risks being inundated by rising sea levels caused by global warming.The court will make a final ruling, which would be binding on the state, after the three-month period expires. Rulings by the Conseil d’Etat cannot be appealed.Climate activists hailed what they called an “historic” ruling.“By affirming the binding nature of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets contained in the law, the highest administrative court is putting the state face to face with its responsibilities in the climate crisis,” Greenpeace and Oxfam said in a joint statement with two other environmental NGOs.Between 2015 and 2018, the rate of decline in greenhouse gas emissions in France was about half as fast as it should have been for the country to be on the right trajectory to achieving its 2030 target.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-court-gives-macron-deadline-to-prove-he-s-serious-on-climate/story-8OCWm1r4tDVtCDlLZjcvVI.html
20-11-2020||World||Joe Biden’s team to meet with congressional panels on transition||Members of Joe Biden’s transition team have begun to contact staff of the congressional appropriations committees for information about federal agencies as President Donald Trump continues to block the president-elect’s efforts to build an administration, people familiar with the meetings said.Because the General Services Administration will not ascertain the results of the election, the incoming administration cannot communicate with federal agencies or begin the transfer of power that happens with every previous new president. Biden is also unable to receive the full national security briefings he is entitled to.The transition team has been finding workarounds. They have been in contact with state and local leaders and private companies. Later Thursday, Biden is meeting virtually with some of the nation’s governors and plans to speak afterward.The president, meanwhile, is standing by his unfounded claims that widespread fraud invalidate the election and insisting he will prevail.A House Democratic aide said that Biden’s transition aides will meet with staff from the House Appropriations Committee, which deals with all federal agencies and their budgets. And a Senate Democratic aide said that phone calls have already taken place between the Senate Appropriations Committee staff and Biden aides.Business groups are joining the list of those clamoring for the presidential transition to begin. US Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Officer Tom Donohue, the National Association of Manufacturers and Joshua Bolten, president of Business Roundtable trade group for CEOs have all said it is time for the process to move forward.The contacts with lawmakers’ staff come as the Trump White House is continuing to push forward with a fiscal 2022 budget proposal on the assumption that Trump will have a second term, and as the appropriations committees are attempting to finish fiscal 2021 funding bills by a Dec. 11 deadline.Biden’s transition team assembled agency review teams, made up of more than 500 people, who are charged with contacting federal agencies to better understand their policies and operations, but those efforts cannot begin until the GSA officially designates that the transfer of power from the Trump administration to a Biden one can begin.Biden advisers have warned of serious consequences if the Trump administration continues to deny access to the federal government, especially real-time data about the coronavirus pandemic and plans for distributing a vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-team-to-meet-with-congressional-panels-on-transition/story-GzMXCqF7LFgx7g6slugMVK.html
20-11-2020||World||Chinese experimental Covid-19 vaccine given to 1 million people||A million people have taken an experimental Covid-19 vaccine developed by the government-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) under an emergency inoculation programme, the company has said.No serious adverse reaction has been reported from those who received the vaccine in emergency use, Sinopharm said in an article on the social media platform WeChat, citing a recent media interview by chairperson, Liu Jingzhen.China launched the emergency vaccine use programme in July, mainly directed towards essential workers and those going abroad.The vaccine has been administered even as clinical or human trials of the vaccine are yet to be completed, leaving question marks on its efficacy and safety.Two vaccine candidates developed by Sinopharm’s subsidiary China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and a third one developed by Sinovac Biotech have been used for the emergency programme, though it remains unclear which vaccine Liu was referring to, Reuters news agency said in a report.Earlier this month, Liu had told a press conference that none of the 56,000 people who were inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine and travelled abroad have contracted the coronavirus.Until the beginning of November, some 100,000 people had been vaccinated with the company’s vaccine and have shown no adverse reactions so far.“Some of the others who received the emergency-use vaccine are employees of China National Petroleum Corporation, China Petrochemical Corporation and Technology giant Huawei,” Chinese state media had reported, quoting Liu.On Wednesday, scientific journal The Lancet said Sinovac Biotech’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine CoronaVac triggered a quick immune response, but the level of antibodies produced was lower than in people who had recovered from the disease, mid-stage trial results showed.While the early to mid-stage trials were not designed to assess the efficacy of CoronaVac, researchers said it could provide sufficient protection and could be used for emergency use.China is among the countries racing to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.China has five vaccines for Covid-19 currently undergoing Phase 3 clinical trials in some foreign countries.A leading Chinese expert on Thursday said that Chinese vaccines are very effective.“Currently, no vaccine has completed Phase 3 clinical trials, but Pfizer and Moderna claimed their vaccines are very effective. Please trust me, and I want to tell the public that China’s vaccines are also very effective,” Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in an online seminar on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-experimental-covid-19-vaccine-given-to-1-million-people/story-Gektan6fyzSg4dRHjEHPQP.html
20-11-2020||World||27-month jail term for Indian-origin builder in UK||Vijay Madhaparia, a London-based builder, has been jailed for 27 months after falsifying documents from UK tax authorities and also banned from running limited companies for 10 years, the Insolvency Service said on Thursday.Madhaparia, 44, was director of Laxmi Development Limited, a building development company incorporated in 2010 based out of northwest London. The company was placed into compulsory liquidation in 2015 after it failed to pay the tax authorities a debt of £124,000, which was later revised to £4.4million.The service said the official receiver was initially appointed as liquidator and further investigations uncovered several instances of misconduct by Madhaparia. In 2012, he was disqualified by the court for three years after committing health and safety offences.However, despite being disqualified, he continued to act as a director and took on various construction and development projects until the company was dissolved in September 2013 after the company had failed to file company records.To get the company reinstated, Madhaparia submitted company accounts in breach of his disqualification, which he falsely claimed had been audited and prepared by regulated accountants.Further enquiries uncovered that Madhaparia had taken on two renovation contracts in 2015 despite the company having been wound up, and he did so without informing the official receiver.The service said that Madhaparia then proceeded to siphon £91,000 worth of payments for the renovation works into his personal account, which he spent on holidays and gambling, depriving his creditors of payment.Judge Dafna Spiro of the Harrow Crown Court described his conduct as “a sustained, deliberate and repeated pattern of calculated deliberate deceit and dishonesty committed over a number of years”.Ian West, chief investigator for the Insolvency Service, said, “Vijay Madhaparia has been jailed for a significant amount of time after the court recognised the severity of his numerous misconduct offences.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/27-month-jail-term-for-indian-origin-builder-in-uk/story-ALEjnxzZC8hXzhZ5Vxc56H.html
20-11-2020||World||Italy’s PM Conte warns of lowkey Christmas as Covid-19 cases pick up||Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned Italians on Thursday they would have to shun “hugs and kisses” at Christmas to help contain the coronavirus, as the country struggles to curb a surge in deaths and infections.Italy registered 36,176 new cases and 653 Covid-19-related fatalities over the past 24 hours with the northern Lombardy region, centred on the financial capital Milan, once again bearing the bulk of the contagion.Many Italian regions are under partial lockdown to try to slow the outbreak, with restrictions due to stay in place until at least Dec. 3.Shopkeepers and restaurateurs are pinning their hopes on a revival of business around the normally busy Christmas period to revive their battered fortunes, but Conte said in a speech there would be no return to normal anytime soon.“We will have to spend the festivities in a more sober way. Big parties, kisses and hugs will not be possible, this would mean an abrupt rise in the (infection) curve in January,” he said, adding: “We hope that we can still buy and exchange gifts.”Italy has seen 47,870 Covid-19 deaths since its outbreak emerged in February, the second highest toll in Europe after Britain’s. It has also recorded 1.309 million cases.The number of excess deaths leapt in October, with the mortality rate more than 20% higher in a string of major cities across the country by comparison to the average of the previous five years, health ministry data released on Thursday showed.Covid-19-related deaths have more than doubled in November by comparison with October, hitting a high of 753 on Nov. 18.Italy managed to beat back the first wave of the epidemic in the spring thanks to a rigid, nationwide lockdown between March and April, and removed most restrictions before the summer as cases steadily decreased.However, autumn has brought a resurgence of infections and while the initial outbreak was largely confined to the north, the second wave has hit almost every region hard, stretching the health service to breaking point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-s-pm-conte-warns-of-lowkey-christmas-as-covid-19-cases-pick-up/story-Mc3BJ8BvPIEZPsE6dT4XAK.html
20-11-2020||World||‘Won’t compromise on how we run Australia’: Morrison’s sharp rebuttal to China’s ‘greivance list’||Australia will not bow to pressure from China, Prime Minister Scott Morrison insisted on Thursday after Beijing released a laundry list of complaints about the country. A Chinese official gave a dossier to Australian media containing 14 grievances, highlighting the increasingly fractious relationship between the two nations.“If you make China the enemy, China will be the enemy,” a Chinese government official reportedly told three prominent outlets on Wednesday.Among the complaints are Australia’s strict foreign interference laws, the country’s ban on Huawei’s involvement in its 5G network and decisions that blocked Chinese investment projects on “national security grounds”.Morrison said the “unofficial document” came from the Chinese embassy and would not stop Australia from setting “our own laws and our own rules according to our national interest”.“We won’t be compromising on the fact that we will set what our foreign investment laws are or how we build our 5G telecommunications networks or how we run our systems of protecting against interference Australia’s way we run our country,” he told Channel Nine. The document also claimed Canberra had engaged in “incessant wanton interference” in China’s affairs while singling out Australia’s call for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.It accused Australia of “siding with the US’ anti-China campaign and spreading disinformation” about where the virus originated -- a particularly sore point for Beijing. The United States weighed in on the diplomatic rift Thursday, with the White House National Security Council saying on Twitter that “Beijing is upset Australia took steps to expose and thwart Chinese espionage & to protect Aussie sovereignty”.“It’s encouraging to see a growing number of countries following Canberra’s lead in taking such steps,” the tweet continued.Relations between Canberra and Beijing have reached a new low in recent months, leaving Australian government ministers unable to persuade Chinese counterparts to even accept their phone calls.The rift has left Australian exporters exposed as their largest trading partner places a series of retaliatory bans on agricultural goods including beef, barley and timber.The latest diplomatic salvo comes just days after Morrison reached an in-principle agreement on bolstering defence relations with Japan’s leader Yoshihide Suga, a move widely viewed as aimed at countering Chinese influence in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/won-t-compromise-on-how-we-run-australia-morrison-s-sharp-rebuttal-to-china-s-greivance-list/story-EZQYmUJJ2GedNwndz9rtZO.html
