They’re slated to join Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris at an in-person event in Wilmington, Delaware, Tuesday afternoon, where they’ll each deliver their first remarks as Biden’s nominees.Outside the realm of national security and foreign policy, Biden is expected to choose Janet Yellen as the first woman to become treasury secretary. She was nominated by President Barack Obama to lead the Federal Reserve, the first woman in that position, and served from 2014 to 2018.Biden’s emerging Cabinet marks a return to a more traditional approach to governing, relying on veteran policymakers with deep expertise and strong relationships in Washington and global capitals. And with a roster that includes multiple women and people of color — some of whom are breaking historic barriers in their posts — Biden is fulfilling his campaign promise to lead a team that reflects the diversity of America.The incoming president will nominate longtime adviser Antony Blinken to be secretary of state; lawyer Alejandro Mayorkas to be homeland security secretary; Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations; and Jake Sullivan as national security adviser. Avril Haines, a former deputy director of the CIA, will be nominated as director of national intelligence, the first woman to hold that post.Thomas-Greenfield is Black, and Mayorkas is Cuban American.Mayorkas might pose the most difficult confirmation challenge from Biden’s early round of nominees.The Senate previously confirmed him in December 2013 by a party-line vote to be the deputy secretary of Homeland Security. The Senate was controlled by Democrats then, and all Senate Republicans voted against Mayorkas’ confirmation mainly because he was then under active investigation by the Obama-appointed DHS inspector general. At the time, according to the Senate Historian, it was unprecedented for the Senate to vote on a nominee who was under investigation.DHS Inspector General John Roth issued a report in March 2015 that found Mayorkas, as director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, appeared to give special treatment to certain individuals as part of the visa program which gives residency preference to immigrants who agree to invest in the US economy and create jobs.Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, on Tuesday broadly slammed Biden’s picks as unworthy.“Biden’s cabinet picks went to Ivy League schools, have strong resumes, attend all the right conferences & will be polite & orderly caretakers of America’s decline,” Rubio tweeted.Those being introduced on Tuesday “are experienced, crisis-tested leaders who are ready to hit the ground running on day one,” the transition said in a statement. “These officials will start working immediately to rebuild our institutions, renew and reimagine American leadership to keep Americans safe at home and abroad, and address the defining challenges of our time — from infectious disease, to terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cyber threats, and climate change.”In the weeks ahead, Biden could also name Michèle Flournoy as the first woman to lead the Defense Department. Pete Buttigieg, the former Indiana mayor and onetime presidential candidate, has also been mentioned as a contender for a Cabinet agency.The Pentagon said Tuesday that Kash Patel, the chief of staff to the acting secretary of defense, is heading the department’s transition work. A transition task force has been assembled, led by Tom Muir, the head of the Pentagon office that provides administrative and management services to all Defense Department facilities in the Washington area. A Pentagon spokeswoman, Susan Gough, said the Pentagon is “in discussions on the next steps” with the Biden agency review team led by Kathleen Hicks.In making the choices public on Monday, Biden moved forward with plans to fill out his administration even as President Donald Trump refused to concede defeat in the Nov. 3 election, has pursued baseless legal challenges in several key states and worked to stymie the transition process.Trump said later Monday that he was directing his team to cooperate on the transition but vowed to keep up the fight. His comment came after the General Services Administration ascertained that Biden was the apparent winner of the election, clearing the way for the start of the transition from Trump’s administration and allowing Biden to coordinate with federal agencies on plans for taking over on Jan. 20.Beyond Rubio’s broadside, Biden’s nominations were generally met with silence on Capitol Hill, where the Senate’s balance of power hinges on two runoff races that will be decided in January.The best known of the bunch is Kerry, who made climate change one of his top priorities while serving as Obama’s secretary of state, during which he also negotiated the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. Trump withdrew from both agreements, which he said represented a failure of American diplomacy in a direct shot at Kerry, whom he called the worst secretary of state in U.S. history.Blinken, 58, served as deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser during the Obama administration. He recently participated in a national security briefing with Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and weighed in publicly just last week on notable foreign policy issues in Egypt and Ethiopia.Blinken served on the National Security Council during the Clinton administration before becoming staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Biden was chair of the panel. In the early years of the Obama administration, Blinken returned to the NSC and was Biden’s national security adviser when Biden was vice president, then moved to the State Department to serve as deputy to Kerry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-set-to-formally-introduce-his-national-security-team/story-HobP2P3kIu8RD7FN0Z00iJ.html
24-11-2020||World||AstraZeneca must prove it won’t profit from Covid-19 vaccine: MSF||AstraZeneca must provide reassurance that it will not profit from its potential Covid-19 vaccine, non-governmental organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Tuesday, urging the company to make public its supply contracts.The British firm said on Monday its Covid-19 vaccine was 70% effective in pivotal trials and could be up to 90% effective, giving the world’s fight against the global pandemic a third new weapon that can be cheaper to make, easier to distribute and faster to scale-up than rivals.AstraZeneca has said it will not profit from sales of its vaccine while Covid-19 is considered a pandemic. The price of its candidate has been set at about $3 per dose, against at least four times more for other candidates.“MSF welcomes AstraZeneca’s commitment to sell the vaccine at a ‘no-profit’ price during the pandemic, but the reality is that it’s an empty promise unless we’re able to substantiate these important claims with data,” said Roz Scourse of medical group MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders.The organisation urged AstraZeneca to disclose the contracts signed with governments for its vaccine, and said there could be clauses that limit the price until the company declares the end of the health emergency, which could be as early as July.AstraZeneca said it would look for international consensus on when the pandemic phase of Covid-19 was over, rather than a particular date.“From the outset, AstraZeneca’s approach has been to treat the development of the vaccine as a response to a global public health emergency, not a commercial opportunity,” an AstraZeneca spokesman said.“We continue to operate in that public spirit and we will seek expert guidance, including from global organisations as to when we can say the pandemic is behind us.”The GAVI vaccine alliance said Monday’s efficacy data was “positive news for the COVAX vision of equitable access” for vulnerable groups.It said the hundreds of millions of doses had been secured on behalf of COVAX, a procurement scheme co-led by the World Health Organization designed to secure rapid and fair global access to Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-must-prove-it-won-t-profit-from-covid-19-vaccine-msf/story-JdRv9YPtJouOefMaosO4bM.html

Yellen served from 2014 to 2018; appointed by Barack Obama and replaced by Donald Trump with Jerome Powell.Biden’s firsts started with Kamala Harris, who is the first Black, woman, and American of Indian, South Asian and Asian descent to become US vice-president. Alejandro Mayorkas, a Cuban-American lawyer, will become the first Latino to head the department of homeland security, which runs immigration.Avril Haines, a former deputy director of the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency), is the first woman named to head the US intelligence community as director of National Intelligence. And John Kerry, the former secretary of state, will be the first special presidential envoy on climate to have a seat at the national security council.Biden’s incoming National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is the youngest person named to the position yet, at 43.The remaining cabinet positions announced so far are Antony Blinken, a close and long-time aide of the president-elect, who will be secretary of state, and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a 35-year foreign service veteran, who will be the next US ambassador to the UN.Biden has only announced a handful of his cabinet picks so far, and he and Harris will introduce them formally later on Tuesday. Remaining appointments, which will include defence, attorney general, health and a few others, will roll out possibly after the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/janet-yellen-set-to-become-the-first-woman-to-head-us-treasury-department/story-pvmLee2xHuVFLEptkoMkwL.html

He said China doesn’t deliberately target a trade surplus, an issue that’s been a source a tension with the US.“We will absolutely not pursue a trade surplus,” Li said. “We will maintain equal importance for imports and exports. We want to achieve trade balance and sustainable development.”China recently laid out its five and 15-year plans for the economy, outlining an ambition to double the size of gross domestic product by 2035, with a focus on self-reliance in technology and boosting domestic consumption. The economy, the second-largest in the world, is the only major one tipped to expand this year -- by about 2%, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg -- after authorities brought the pandemic under control and began easing lockdown restrictions months ago.Strong ReboundAngel Gurria, secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said at the same briefing that China’s economy could expand about 8% in 2021, before easing to about 5%. Li didn’t give a forecast for growth.Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said at the briefing that some countries may be losing momentum as they deal with new waves of virus infections. She added that vaccines and treatments should be made available to everyone.The other officials at the meeting with Li, held via videoconference, were: David Malpass, president of the World Bank, Alan Wolff, deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization, Guy Ryder, director-general of the International Labor Organization, and Randal Quarles, chairman of the Financial Stability Board.According to a separate government statement, Li said at the meeting that China will use reforms to promote the economy’s recovery and will continue its active fiscal and stable monetary policies. He also said China welcomes more countries joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade pact, which was signed earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-economy-returning-to-proper-range-next-year-says-li-keqiang/story-VU7AtCsHcKhCHX7VlKkqqN.html
24-11-2020||World||Putin Can’t Take Russia’s ‘Safe’ Covid Vaccine, Kremlin Says||President Vladimir Putin told fellow world leaders last week that both of Russia’s Covid-19 vaccines, including one he championed as the world’s first inoculation against the disease, are safe and effective. That doesn’t mean he’s taken a jab.“We have not yet begun widespread vaccination and the head of state can’t take part in vaccination as a volunteer. It’s impossible,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday, in response to a question on whether Putin had been inoculated. “The president can’t use an uncertified vaccine.”Developers of Russia’s flagship vaccine, Sputnik V, said Tuesday that initial testing showed it was 91.4% effective in preventing infections, although it has not yet published final results in a peer-reviewed journal. Among volunteers who started the vaccination process earlier, preliminary data indicated efficacy of over 95%, according to the Russian Direct Investment Fund.Russia has the world’s fifth-highest number of cases globally, passing 2 million last week. Putin announced the registration of Sputnik V in August and a second inoculation was approved in October, even as Phase 3 trials to establish safety and efficacy are still taking place.Read more | Sputnik V Covid-19 vacccine 95% effective, says RussiaPutin, 68, is in a higher risk category because of his age. The first group of volunteers aged 60 and over began vaccine trials on Oct. 28, state-run Tass news service reported last month, citing the doctor who is running the tests.Russia has already begun vaccinating medical workers, teachers and officials. By the end of the year, producers aim to make about 2.9 million doses, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova.International deliveries will start in January and Russia plans to produce doses for 500 million people abroad in 2021, according to an RDIF statement. Russia plans to provide the vaccine free to its own citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-can-t-take-russia-s-safe-covid-vaccine-kremlin-says/story-DOt0bUnL2tORxDFk7ZVnzO.html
24-11-2020||World||Covid-19: Limited shipment of Sputnik V vaccine to other countries in December, key deliveries by Jan 2021, says Russia||Limited shipments of Sputnik V, the Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Russia will be done in December while key deliveries will be done in January 2021 to other countries, within the framework of existing contracts, Russian authorities said on Tuesday.“We are going to begin limited shipments for a number of countries in December but key delivery within the framework of the existing contract will be done in January if only those countries who recently provided their request-- we will be shipping in March 2021,” said Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).Dmitriev was responding to an online question on negotiations with drugs regulators of countries including India, Brazil, Singapore, Philippines and Korea.“It is important to know that we working with the regulatory agencies of all of the countries concerned to update them accordingly of all the data of Russian Federation clinical trials are very important for this data to be processed. We are in constant touch with regulatory authorities from over 50 countries on the data and results of our clinical trials preliminary and interim data has already been given to WHO and in a number of other international organizations,” Dmitriev said.“Hence, we working very closely with regulatory agencies from countries concerned and that since January we going to begin large volume of shipments and those countries that have been contracted recently the shipment will be by March 2021,” Dmitriev said at during a webinar held on Sputnik V covid19 vaccine.” It may be noted that Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL) in India has collaborated with RDIF to conduct mid to late-stage human trials for the Sputnik V vaccine candidate in India.Earlier on Tuesday, the Gamaleya National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology and RDIF declared results obtained during the second interim data analysis of the largest double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials in Russia involving 40,000 volunteers.“It has shown a 91.4 per cent efficacy on day 28 after the first dose while preliminary data from volunteers obtained 42 days after the first dose(corresponds with 21 days after the second dose) indicates an efficacy of the vaccine above 95 per cent,” stated press statement issued by RDIF.“Evaluation of efficacy was carried out among volunteers (n = 18,794) 28 days after receiving the first dose (seven days after the second dose) of the vaccine or placebo upon reaching the second control point,” it said.The interim research data will be published by the Gamaleya Center team in one of the leading international peer-reviewed medical journals.There were no unexpected adverse events during the trials. Monitoring of the participants is ongoing, said the statement.As per Russian scientists, the Sputnik V vaccine is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vector platform that has proven safe and effective with no long-term side effects in more than 250 clinical trials globally conducted during the past two decades - while the history of the use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development began in 1953.More than 100,000 people have received approved and registered drugs based on human adenoviral vectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-limited-shipment-of-sputnik-v-vaccine-to-other-countries-in-december-key-deliveries-by-jan-2021-says-russia/story-9aQyFxojpxypGi8cQ9eTWM.html
24-11-2020||World||UNICEF gearing up for ‘mammoth operation’ to deliver Covid-19 vaccines globally||The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is working with more than 350 global partners, including major airlines, shipping lines and logistics associations to deliver billions of COVID-19 vaccines around the world as soon as doses become available, in what is anticipated to be the largest and fastest operation ever undertaken of vaccine procurement and distribution.In order to kickstart preparations for delivering COVID-19 vaccines to over 92 countries, UNICEF together with the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA), briefed major global airlines last week on the expected capacity requirements and discussed ways to transport close to two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021. This is in addition to the 1 billion syringes that need to be transported by sea-freight. More than 350 logistics partners, including air freight operators, shipping lines and global logistics associations participated in the virtual discussion last week, the agency said.“As work continues to develop COVID-19 vaccines, UNICEF is stepping-up efforts with airlines, freight operators, shipping lines and other logistics associations to deliver life-saving vaccines as quickly and safely as possible,” Director of UNICEF’s Supply Division Etleva Kadilli said. “This invaluable collaboration will go a long way to ensure that enough transport capacity is in place for this historic and mammoth operation. We need all hands on deck as we get ready to deliver COVID-19 vaccine doses, syringes and more personal protective equipment to protect front line workers around the globe. By protecting these workers, we are ultimately protecting the millions of children who depend on their critical services.” In the coming weeks, UNICEF is also assessing existing transport capacity to identify gaps and future requirements. The procurement, delivery and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is anticipated to be the largest and fastest such operation ever undertaken. UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and deliver vaccines from manufacturers that have agreements with the COVAX Facility. In collaboration with PAHO, UNICEF will coordinate the purchase and delivery for 92 low- and lower middle-income economies as quickly and securely as possible.UNICEF said these efforts build on UNICEF’s longstanding efforts with the logistics industry to transport supplies around the world despite restrictions related to the pandemic. Since January, UNICEF has delivered more than USD190 million worth of Covid-19 supplies such as masks, gowns, oxygen concentrators and diagnostic test kits in support of countries as they respond to the pandemic.Last week, global drugmaker Pfizer and BioNTech said their Covid19 vaccine candidate is 95 per cent effective, including in adults over 65 years of age.Based on current projections, the companies expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. The major announcement came just days after Moderna said its virus vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.5 per cent. As the largest single vaccine buyer in the world, UNICEF normally procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries. This unparalleled expertise includes the coordination of thousands of shipments with various cold chain requirements, making UNICEF an expert in supply chain management of temperature-controlled products, which is especially needed during this historic undertaking. To minimise disruptions to routine immunisation programmes due to the operations related to the Covid-19 vaccines and syringes, UNICEF and partners will continue to coordinate closely with logistics operators for timely delivery around the world, it said.“The support of governments, partners and the private sector will be paramount to transport vaccines for deadly diseases such as measles, diphtheria and tetanus, as well as for Covid-19, as efficiently as possible,” Kadilli said.Last month, UNICEF began a process to stockpile more than 1 billion syringes by 2021 to guarantee initial supply and pre-position in advance of Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unicef-gearing-up-for-mammoth-operation-to-deliver-covid-19-vaccines-globally/story-dJqHXg99XV8BAcj74quogM.html

Chances are low, study finds||Those flightened about the use of banknotes amid the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) can expect some relief as a study by the Bank of England has found that the risk of catching the viral infection through currency notes is low, Bloomberg reported.The study considered the worst-case scenario where an infected person coughed or sneezed onto a note. The researchers found that the level of virus on the surface began to drop rapidly after an hour and after six hours, it had declined to 5% or less.It was also found that the chances of such direct contamination are relatively low as cash is typically stored securely in tills or wallets. The study added that the chances of an infected person touching notes would result in far lower levels of the virus.The report also highlighted that the survival of Sars-Cov-2 on the banknotes appears relatively less than other surface areas people come in regular contact with. “A few hours after infection, even at high doses, the levels and therefore associated risk of infection appear low,” the report said.“Further, the survival of virus on banknotes is no greater - indeed appears potentially less - than on reference surfaces representative of the many surfaces that people may come into contact with in their routine life,” the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worried-about-catching-covid-19-from-using-cash-chances-are-low-study-finds/story-Tbrqv2ZRoHxEY3csKkUpiK.html
24-11-2020||World||Thanksgiving could make or break US coronavirus response||In Pennsylvania, if you’re having friends over to socialize, you’re supposed to wear a mask — and so are your friends. That’s the rule, but Barb Chestnut has no intention of following it.“No one is going to tell me what I can or not do in my own home,” said Chestnut, 60, of Shippensburg. “They do not pay my bills and they are not going to tell me what to do.”As governors and mayors grapple with an out-of-control pandemic, they are ratcheting up mask mandates and imposing restrictions on small indoor gatherings, which have been blamed for accelerating the spread of the coronavirus. But while such measures carry the weight of law, they are, in practical terms, unenforceable, and officials are banking on voluntary compliance instead.Good luck with that.While many are undoubtedly heeding public health advice — downsizing Thanksgiving plans, avoiding get-togethers, wearing masks when they’re around people who don’t live with them — it’s inevitable that a segment of the population will blow off new state and local restrictions and socialize anyway. Experts say that could put greater stress on overburdened hospitals and lead to an even bigger spike in sickness and death over the holidays.“When this started in early March, we weren’t staring at Thanksgiving and Christmas, and we didn’t have the disease reservoir that we have. And that, to me, is the biggest concern in the next few weeks,” said Dr. David Rubin, the director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He called the risk of a Thanksgiving spike “extremely high.”“I think you’re seeing a lot of resistance here,” Rubin said. “I can’t speculate on what people are going to do, but I can say that to the degree that there isn’t a collective buy-in here, it sort of blunts the impact of the measures themselves.”The nation is averaging 172,000 new virus cases per day, nearly doubling since the end of October, according to Johns Hopkins University. Hospitalizations, deaths and the testing positivity rate are also up sharply as the nation approaches Thanksgiving.In response, elected officials are imposing restrictions that, with some exceptions, fall short of the broad-based stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns seen in the spring.Utah and Vermont have banned all social gatherings. So have local governments in Philadelphia and Dane County, Wisconsin. In Kentucky, no more than eight people from two households are permitted to get together; in Oregon, the gathering limit is six. California has imposed an overnight curfew. More states are requiring masks, including those with GOP governors who have long resisted them. The nation’s top health officials are pleading with Americans to avoid Thanksgiving travel.There’s some evidence the holiday will be quieter.Tamika Hickson, who co-owns a party rental business in Philadelphia, said Thanksgiving was a bust even before her city moved to prohibit indoor gatherings of any size.“Nobody’s calling,” Hickson said. “A lot of people lost a lot of loved ones, so they’re not playing with this. And I don’t blame them.”AAA projects Thanksgiving travel will fall by at least 10%, which would be the steepest one-year plunge since the Great Recession in 2008. But that still means tens of millions of people on the road. On social media, people defiantly talk about their Thanksgiving plans, arguing that nothing will stop them from seeing friends and family.More than 1 million people thronged U.S. airports on Sunday, according to the Transportation Security Administration — the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic.Dr. Debra Bogen, the health director for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, which includes Pittsburgh, said that too many have been ignoring public health guidance and that the result has been unchecked spread of the virus.“For the past few weeks, I’ve asked people to follow the rules, curtail gatherings and parties, stay home except for essentials, and wear masks. I’m done asking,” Bogen said at a news conference, her frustration palpable. She announced a stay-at-home advisory that she said would turn into an order if people didn’t comply.Some people are underestimating the risk to themselves and their friends and families, said Baruch Fischhoff, a Carnegie Mellon University psychologist who has written about COVID-19 risk analysis and communications. Others doubt what health officials are telling them about the virus. And still others are simply irresponsible.Fischhoff said the lack of a cohesive national pandemic strategy; patchwork and seemingly arbitrary restrictions at the state and local level; and ineffective, politicized and contradictory public health messaging have sown confusion and mistrust.“It has been a colossal, tragic failure of leadership from the very beginning that we didn’t find the common ground in which we were working to protect the weakest among us. And once you’ve lost that coordination, you’re scrambling to get it back and that’s the tragic mess that we’re in now,” he said.In York County, Pennsylvania, 51-year-old retail worker Kori Jess tested positive for the virus last week. Long a mask skeptic, her personal experience with COVID-19 has changed her opinion — to a point. She said it’s appropriate to wear a mask when circumstances warrant, but she still doesn’t like the idea of government mandating them.“I’m so torn,” Jess said. “I like that people are fighting for their freedoms, but I understand why people are wearing masks.”In upstate New York, some sheriffs say they have no intention of enforcing Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s recent mandate barring private gatherings of more than 10 people.“There is no need to hide cars and sneak around during your attempt to gather with family. We are not going to exhaust our limited resources obtaining search warrants and counting the turkey eaters in your house,” Madison County Sheriff Todd Hood said in a Facebook post. He encouraged people in the largely rural area to use common sense to keep themselves safe.Kim Collins is among those planning a slimmed-down Thanksgiving. In a typical year, Collins would have as many as 20 people at her home in South Orange, New Jersey. This year, her extended family is staying put. “My husband’s having a hard time with the fact that his mom, who’s on her own, won’t be here,” she said.But Collins wasn’t optimistic that others would be so careful. She said plenty of people are going through “mental gymnastics” to justify their holiday get-togethers. “I think that a lot of people aren’t great at the honor system,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thanksgiving-could-make-or-break-us-coronavirus-response/story-JZbp7GdnJuKpSpTI5mu4qN.html
24-11-2020||World||Pak to bring all spy agencies under ISI chief in sign of military’s tightening grip||Pakistan government has decided to bring both military and civilian intelligence agencies under one umbrella to be headed by the chief of ISI, in what is being seen as one more step towards increasing the military’s control over key institutions in the country.After years of bickering over jurisdiction, Prime Minister Imran Khan approved the setting up of the National Intelligence Coordination Committee (NICC) on Monday, which will bring more than 20 spy agencies under the control of the Inter-Services Intelligence.Most democratically elected prime ministers have relied more on the civilian run Intelligence Bureau, with the exception of the present PM.Civilian governments have tried on more than one occasion to bring the military intelligence agencies under the purview of the PM or interior ministry. In 2008, the then Pakistan Peoples Party government even notified the placement of ISI and IB under the “administrative, financial, and operational control” of the interior ministry. But, the decision was reversed within 24 hours due to strong reservations from one of the organisations.Similar efforts were made during the PML-N government, when Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan headed the interior ministry.Local media reported that the move, which is believed to be the brainchild of Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the head of the ISI, is part of the long-awaited reform of the intelligence apparatus, which aims at clarifying the role of respective agencies, improving their coordination, and optimising their capabilities.Daily Dawn reported that one of the lessons learnt by the country during the fight against terrorism was that effective intel coordination was the weakest link in the entire effort. It importantly resulted in loss of critical time and in some cases, the agencies even could not piece together the information available to them. It was, moreover, a major hurdle to collective strategising.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-to-bring-all-spy-agencies-under-isi-chief-in-sign-of-military-s-tightening-grip/story-Z8j4Lb7ptJF3oWCEmKzL9K.html
24-11-2020||World||Europe hopes for reset, end to ‘damage control’ under Biden||German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Tuesday he hopes a reset of US-European relations under the Biden administration can end years in which Europe was mainly concerned with “damage control.” Maas’ counterpart from Portugal, which will have taken over the European Union presidency when Joe Biden is inaugurated, said Europe wants to be treated as a “full and equal partner” rather than an enemy of the US.Biden’s victory over President Donald Trump has been greeted with relief in Europe, where differences with the outgoing administration ranged from trade tensions to defense spending, relations with China and how to handle Iran’s nuclear program.Biden has made clear that he wants to “repair” the trans-Atlantic relationship, “and that is urgently necessary,” Maas said at a panel event in Berlin.Recent years, he said, were an exercise in “damage control” on international diplomacy and issues such as climate change. “Enough of that — with this, we are not doing justice to the challenges we face at present.” “The result, because the West wasn’t working together any more, was that in many issues a vacuum arose that was used by China or Russia,” Maas said.But he cautioned that the Europeans “will have to get out of our seats” to grasp new opportunities, and offer to do more themselves in their immediate neighborhood as part of what he has termed a “ new deal ” with the US Germany holds the EU’s rotating presidency until the end of December, when it will hand over to Portugal.Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva called for new talks with the US on trade relations. And he noted that a major objection to the Trump administration’s approach was its language.“We were permanently treated by our American friends, and the Trump administration, not as friends and allies but as adversaries or even enemies,” he said. “And we were always asked to choose: either you are with us, the Americans, or you are with China.” “Of course we are with the Americans, but not as the minor partner, not as a follower ... it’s a question of being a full and equal partner of the United States,” Santos Silva said. Europe’s interests include good relations with all world regions, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-hopes-for-reset-end-to-damage-control-under-biden/story-ZL4x5O82wdEAJQJvPJi6WN.html
24-11-2020||World||‘We’re drowning’: Covid cases flood hospitals in America’s heartland||Dr. Drew Miller knew his patient had to be moved. The vital signs of the 30-year-old Covid-19 victim were crashing, and Kearny County Hospital in rural Lakin, Kansas, just wasn’t equipped to handle the case. Miller, Kearny’s chief medical officer - who doubles as the county health officer - called around to larger hospitals in search of an ICU bed. With coronavirus cases soaring throughout Kansas, he said, he couldn’t find a single one.By the time a bed opened elsewhere the following day, the young man was near death. For a full 45 minutes, Miller and his staff performed chest compressions in a desperate attempt to save him.Somehow, Miller said, the patient regained a pulse, and was dispatched in an ambulance to the larger facility about 25 miles away. Miller then prayed with the family, whom he knew “very well” from Lakin, a town of just a few thousand people.“It’s truly a miracle he has survived,” Miller said.After pounding big U.S. cities in the spring, Covid-19 now has engulfed rural and small-town America, seeming to seep into the country’s every nook and cranny. According to Reuters’ interviews with more than a dozen medical care providers and public health officials in the nation’s heartland, many hospitals are severely lacking in beds, equipment and - most critically - clinical staff, including specialists and nurses.Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are spiking nationally. But the Midwest - encompassing a dozen states between Ohio and the Dakotas - has been especially brutalized. Reported case rates are more than double that of any other region in the United States, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer-run data provider. From mid-June to mid-November, reported cases in the Midwest rose more than twentyfold.For the week ending November 19, North Dakota reported an average of 1,769 daily new cases per 1 million residents, according to the tracking project. South Dakota recorded nearly 1,500 per million residents, Wisconsin and Nebraska around 1,200, and Kansas nearly 1,000. Even in New York’s worst week in April - with business closed and panic gripping the public - the state never averaged more than 500 new cases per million people. California never topped 253.Hospital officials in the Midwest told Reuters they’re at capacity or nearly so. Most have tried to increase availability by repurposing wings or cramming multiple patients in a single room, and by asking staffers to work longer hours and more frequent shifts.Facilities like Kearny, known as “critical access” hospitals, weren’t made for this. Often sparsely funded, they mainly provide basic or emergency care to residents who live long distances away from bigger medical centers. Now, “we have to plan on being able to care for whomever comes in,” said Miller, whose specialty is family medicine.As cases spike in many conservative states and counties, medical workers say they often face a challenge just in convincing patients and local leaders that the disease should be taken seriously and isn’t a Democrat-perpetuated hoax.Such viewpoints flow from the top. President Donald Trump often has held shoulder-to-shoulder rallies in the Midwest and elsewhere and treated masks as a matter of personal choice. Although Trump was not re-elected, about two months remain in his tenure, with little sign of change in his coronavirus strategy, even as the crisis grows. The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.Some medical officials and hospital staffers find it hard to reconcile laissez-faire policies with the sickness and suffering they see.“There’s a disconnect in the community, where we’re seeing people at bars and restaurants, or planning Thanksgiving dinners,” said Dr. Kelly Cawcutt, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. As health workers, she said, “we feel kind of dejected.”All told, Covid-19 has claimed more than 256,000 lives in the United States. The virus’ mortality rate has dropped as doctors have learned more about the disease, and vaccines developed by Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and others could hit the market early next year. In the meantime, smaller hospitals say they are employing the same drugs - such as remdesivir and dexamethasone - that big-city facilities do, but don’t have the same access to ICU equipment or specialized expertise.With low temperatures sending people indoors and holiday travel underway, doctors in the region aren’t expecting relief anytime soon.“I don’t think the worst is here yet,” Miller said.FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORSHospital leaders described demoralization among staffers struggling to reckon with overwork, grief and death.Shortages of staff, rather than beds, are the biggest single problem in many hospitals, the health officials said. “Just because you can take a cot and put it in a room doesn’t mean you have the appropriate nursing staff to care for a patient,” said Dr. Anthony Hericks, director of critical care with Avera Health in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.Nurses must observe Covid-19 patients even more closely than others, because of the potential for rapid decline, said Melisa Hazell, a critical care nurse at Hutchinson Regional Medical Center, in Hutchinson, Kansas. She said she recently recovered from Covid-19 herself, returning to work as soon as she was certain she wouldn’t spread the virus.“I was off for 12 days,” she said. “Was I mentally and physically ready to go back to work? No, but my teammates needed me.”Remote hospitals don’t keep a full staff on board in the best of times. They hire traveling nurses as the number of patients surge. Now it’s tough to find any available.Aya Health, a San Diego, California-based nurse staffing agency, was posting around 14,000 open positions in the spring, said April Hansen, an executive vice president. That number has now doubled, she said, and pay rates have shot up with demand.Mary Helland, a chief nursing officer with CommonSpirit Health in North Dakota, said she has put in requests for traveling nurses for the 11 critical access hospitals she oversees in North Dakota and Minnesota. But “bigger hospitals are using them all up,” she said.At Hutchinson Regional, which has 190 beds, Chief Nursing Officer Amanda Hullet has begun taking floor shifts, even though she had long since graduated to a desk job.The physical and emotional fatigue is constant, Hullet said, and even harder when the patient is a close friend or colleague.Hullet recalled the recent deaths of local couple Bill and Judy Mason, just weeks apart, from Covid-19. Judy had taught dance in town for decades, Hullet said, and her students included some of the hospital’s employees.Holly Thomas, 37, who is married to the couple’s grandson, said Judy was the “glue” that kept the family together.Referring to Covid-19 the Midwest, Thomas said “we sat by idly from March to August not seeing a whole lot.” Now she hears of about two deaths a day. “My PE teacher from high school and his wife died within 12 hours of each other, too,” she said.Hazell, the Hutchinson Regional nurse, encountered a patient who was a former bowling buddy. “He’s just fantastic,” she said. “Great heart, always willing to sit down and share a story or two.”He’s on a ventilator now, not doing well. “Over next week or two, there’s going to be some tough decisions,” she said. ‘FED UP’Medical workers told Reuters that denial about the disease is frustratingly common among public officials, community members and even patients.One patient at SSM Health in Janesville, Wisconsin, refused to believe Covid-19 was a serious threat, even as it consumed him, said Dr. Alison Schwartz, an infectious disease physician there. When he died, “the family did not want to admit this patient had died of Covid, because they didn’t believe Covid kills people,” she said.Some Midwestern states and local jurisdictions been loath to mandate masks or social distancing. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, went so far as to say he would not allow municipalities to impose mask mandates.Ricketts’ office declined to comment, but the governor said in a Nov. 13 press conference, “I’m against broad-based mandates in favor of educating people about how to use masks.”“Masks work, but they’re just one tool,” Ricketts said, urging people to also focus on keeping their distance and avoiding large gatherings.South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem has refused to mandate mask-wearing, and has not imposed restrictions on businesses or public gatherings, saying she would leave such matters to “individual responsibility.” In July, she hosted an Independence Day celebration with Trump at Mt. Rushmore, where the crowd was close together and many attendees were maskless.Doctors say trying to change such behavior can feel like a hopeless task. “Everyone [is] continuing to go about their lives,” Schwartz said, but “we sort of feel like we’re drowning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-re-drowning-covid-cases-flood-hospitals-in-america-s-heartland/story-9NmumQixUHdlH72aOvK8VL.html
24-11-2020||World||UK family loses court battle in US diplomatic immunity case||The parents of a British teen who was killed in a car crash lost a court battle with the UK government Tuesday over whether their son’s alleged killer, an American woman, had diplomatic immunity.The family has been seeking justice for 19-year-old Harry Dunn, who died after his motorbike crashed into a car driven on the wrong side of the road outside a US airbase in central England last August.The car’s driver, Anne Sacoolas, left for the US several weeks after the collision. Officials said she was entitled to diplomatic immunity because her husband worked at the airbase.Sacoolas, 43, was charged in December with causing death by dangerous driving, but the US State Department rejected a request to extradite her to Britain to face trial.Dunn’s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, launched the court case to argue that Britain’s Foreign Office wrongly decided Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity.But two judges rejected that Tuesday, ruling that the American “enjoyed immunity from UK criminal jurisdiction at the time of Harry’s death.”The teen’s mother said she was determined to continue finding justice for her son. She was backed by British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who said he stands with the family.“We’re clear that Anne Sacoolas needs to face justice in the UK, and we will support the family with their legal claim in the US,” Raab said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-family-loses-court-battle-in-us-diplomatic-immunity-case/story-budjH1isGCID7UbhutiCKK.html
24-11-2020||World||EU, other donors step up with funds to help Afghanistan||The European Union and other donors offered new funding for Afghanistan on Tuesday, as a UN official declared now is “not the time to walk away” from years of hard work in trying to build peace and stability in a poor country where Taliban fighters have made inroads against the internationally-backed government.A largely virtual, one-day pledging conference in Geneva, co-hosted by Finland, drew representatives from over 70 countries in the first such event in four years. It comes as the COVID-19 crisis has commanded worldwide attention, and the virus outbreak in Afghanistan has compounded persistent ills like corruption and extremist violence.Countries like Britain, the Netherlands and Canada stepped forward with hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of pledges for Afghanistan as the session got under way, after speeches from top officials like Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who hailed the country’s “ambitious agenda for development and reform.”“The United Nations stands with the people of Afghanistan on the path toward peace, development and self-reliance,” Guterres said, expressing hope that donor pledges will “translate into real progress and concrete improvements for the people of Afghanistan.”The European Union pledged 1.2 billion euros ($1.43 billion) in assistance to Afghanistan over the next four years, but like many others made its support conditional on the strife-torn country’s commitment to democracy, the rule of law, human rights and gender equality.“Afghanistan’s future trajectory must preserve the democratic and human rights gains since 2001, most notably as regards women’s and children’s rights,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. “Any attempt to restore an Islamic emirate would have an impact on our political and financial engagement.”The conference came amid a complex situation in Afghanistan, 19 years after an international coalition led by the United States toppled the Taliban government that supported al-Qaida. Taliban rebels and the Afghan government are currently taking part in peace talks in Doha, Qatar, and the Trump administration recently announced a further drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.Deborah Lyons, the UN secretary-general’s special envoy for Afghanistan, said the country was facing “a time of unprecedented opportunity but also deep uncertainty and rising anxiety,” and said Afghans were committed to preserving the gains of recent years.“But they will need the ongoing support of the international community: political, financial, and technical,” Lyons said. “Now is not the time to walk away.”Ghani touted a strategic plan for Afghanistan.“A new Afghanistan has emerged over the past two decades, and with it, an entirely new set of expectations from our citizens,” he said, acknowledging “lessons learned” from abroad and the development of a robust civil society and free press.“The main theme of our development agenda is to meet these new expectations by doing much more with much less in the face of daunting challenges,” he said.Statistics in Afghanistan are still grim after decades of international help. The poverty level during the pandemic has shot up to 70% — up from 54% last year. Despite billions of dollars that have poured into the country in the last two decades, more than half the population lives on $1.14 a day.A U.S. watchdog said over $19 billion of U.S. money alone had been lost to abuse, fraud and waste.Lyons has said that despite some progress, Afghanistan remains one of the worst places in the world to be a woman or a child. She has criticized a sharp rise in casualties in fighting, both from Taliban assaults and U.S. and Afghan bombing raids.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-other-donors-step-up-with-funds-to-help-afghanistan/story-jK53vkPm8ivec8lHD4A5NO.html

24-11-2020||World||China likely inducting more fighter jets for western areas amid India standoff||China is likely commissioning more squadrons of a multirole strike fighter on the border with India, Chinese state media has indicated for the first time, as the militaries of the two countries dig in and deploy latest weaponry along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) amid the ongoing border faceoff.The People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) western theatre command (WTC) – which is in-charge of the LAC – is said to be commissioning the J-16 fighter aircraft in the country’s western regions.It appears to be part of WTC’s efforts to upgrade weaponry and logistics for its forces deployed along the LAC.“A brigade attached to the PLA WTC Air Force recently conducted a confrontational air-to-air combat exercise in order to examine and enhance the unit’s comprehensive combat capability,” the state-backed nationalist tabloid Global Times reported citing an article on the official WeChat account of the PLA WTC.Also Watch l How can India counter China-Pakistan joint ‘mission’ amid Ladakh tension? The jets were being commissioned to “better safeguard China’s territorial integrity in the country’s western regions”.“This brigade is in a key period of switching to use the J-16 heavy fighter jets, and the goal is to finish the process by the end of the year,” the report said.The J-16 is a third-plus generation fighter jet domestically manufactured by China.The reports did not mention the numbers of the fighter jets to be commissioned in the western sector; or which fighters they would be replacing.Both Indian and Chinese militaries have deployed troops and weaponry besides strengthening infrastructure in border areas along LAC amid the worst boundary tension with China in decades in eastern Ladakh, where soldiers from the two countries have been locked in a faceoff since May.The Indian Air Force is operating five newly bought Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh region.Several rounds of diplomatic and military-level talks have failed to resolve the situation and disengage troops.The J-16 is modelled on a Russian fighter jet series but fitted with Chinese equipment.The fighter aircraft is a twin-engine, twin-seat multi-role fighter jet that is also capable of air-to-air combat.It made its debut during the Army Day parade on July 30, 2017 at the Zhurihe military training base in North China’s Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.“Although it uses the classic Russian Su-27 aerodynamic design, everything inside is Chinese, including the WS-10 Taihang engines, an active array radar system and a new generation infrared observation and aiming system,” the WAC report, quoted by Global Times, said.The J-16 is reportedly capable of carrying at least eight tonnes of weapons.Although the J-20 is China’s more advanced fighter jet, the PLA Air Force still needs the J-16 as the two types of fighter jets can complement each other, Chinese military analysts had said earlier.The fighter jet is painted with the latest version of “low observable coatings,” which experts said are developed to lower the chance of the warplanes being detected by radar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-likely-inducting-more-fighter-jets-for-western-areas-amid-india-standoff/story-pKiuj1xJaL8tZ1YwnoBPyM.html
24-11-2020||World||UK cuts quarantine for international arrivals to 5 days from Dec 15||The UK announced reducing the current mandatory 14-day quarantine for international passengers to five days from December 15 if a test taken five days after arrival proves negative, a move welcomed by the struggling tourism and airline sectors as being “long overdue”.Transport secretary Grant Shapps said that passengers arriving into England from countries not on the government’s travel corridor list will have the option to take the test after five days of self-isolation, with a negative result releasing them from the need to isolate.Under the plan called ‘Test to Release’, officials said passengers arriving into England by plane, ferry or train should book their test before they travel; must complete a passenger locator form; and will still need to self-isolate for five days before taking the test.Shapps said: “Our new testing strategy will allow us to travel more freely, see loved ones and drive international business. By giving people the choice to test on day 5, we are also supporting the travel industry as it continues to rebuild out of the pandemic.”The test will need to be booked at the traveller’s expense from an approved list of providers. Those choosing not to take a test when arriving from a non-exempt country must continue to follow the current self-isolation requirements of 14 days.Officials said the update is based on advice from a consortium of expert representatives from the aviation, maritime, international rail, tourism and hospitality industries to boost international travel for all modes, while safeguarding public health in the UK.The government will also continue to work with international partners and representatives across the transport industries to further build on the recommendations in the report, including exploring pre-departure testing pilots with partner countries on a bilateral basis, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-cuts-quarantine-for-international-arrivals-to-5-days-from-dec-15/story-R0lO5l9Kqo9APhEXQwQh7J.html
24-11-2020||World||Germany can fund coronavirus aid into 2021, Merkel lawmaker says||Germany can comfortably afford to provide financial aid to businesses affected by coronavirus lockdown restrictions until well into next year, according to a senior lawmaker in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s bloc.“Of course we can keep going until March, until April,” Carsten Linnemann, a deputy head of Merkel’s CDU/CSU caucus, said Tuesday in an interview with ARD television. “We are a very wealthy country.”The comments from the conservative politician suggest a willingness to dig deeper into public coffers to protect Europe’s biggest economy from the fallout of the pandemic.Officials imposed a partial shutdown this month that closed restaurants, gyms and cinemas, while keeping most of the rest of the economy running. With contagion rates still nearly triple a government target, the restrictions are set to be extended until at least December 20.To ease the impact on businesses forced to close, the government has already made around 15 billion euros ($17.8 billion) available. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said over the weekend that support will be needed beyond the end of this month.The government plans to finance pandemic-related spending by raising more than 160 billion euros in new debt next year, compared with the current target of 96.2 billion euros.The latest restrictions have hurt sentiment among businesses, a monthly survey by the Ifo institute suggested Tuesday.An expectations gauge fell to 91.5 in November from 94.7 the previous month, a steeper drop than economists forecast. More than 70% of companies in the hospitality sector are worried about failing, with almost 20% wondering if they’ll even get through this month, Ifo said, adding that a sub-index for hotels and hospitality “absolutely nosedived.”Ifo President Clemens Fuest said that the government’s strategy appears tailored only for the coming weeks and entrepreneurs would prefer a longer-term plan.“Businesses are more or less resigned to the fact that this uncertainty -- these measures coming in and being lifted again -- is going to stay for some time,” Fuest said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.The number of cases in Germany has tripled since the start of October to more than 900,000, and the amount of people with the disease in intensive care is at record levels.The heads of Germany’s 16 federal states agreed Monday to extend the latest lockdown restrictions, while tightening rules limiting social contact. They will hold talks with Merkel on Wednesday to finalize the measures, which would be rolled over for periods of two weeks if contagion rates remain above the government’s target level.Merkel has said the seven-day incidence per 100,000 citizens needs to come down to around 50 before restrictions can be loosened. It edged up to 143 on Monday, from 141 the previous day, according to the latest report from Germany’s public health authority.The regional leaders agreed to restrict the number of people allowed in private gatherings to five from a maximum of two households.The goal remains to allow Germans to celebrate Christmas with their families. According to the latest proposals, contact restrictions would be loosened for the Dec. 23 to Jan.1 period, with gatherings of up to 10 people from different households allowed and children up to the age of 14 exempted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-can-fund-coronavirus-aid-into-2021-merkel-lawmaker-says/story-JAq3HQkzbTRVXrO8VaVHhN.html
24-11-2020||World||China criticizes pope over comment on Uighur Muslim minority||China criticized Pope Francis on Tuesday over a passage in his new book in which he mentions suffering by China’s Uighur Muslim minority group.Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Francis’ remarks had “no factual basis at all.”“People of all ethnic groups enjoy the full rights of survival, development, and freedom of religious belief,” Zhao said at a daily briefing.Zhao made no mention of the camps in which more than 1 million Uighurs and members of other Chinese Muslim minority groups have been held. The U.S. and other governments, along with human rights groups, say the prison-like facilities are intended to divide Muslims from their religious and cultural heritage, forcing them to declare loyalty to China’s ruling Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping.China, which initially denied the existence of the facilities, now says they are centers intended to provide job training and prevent terrorism and religious extremism on a voluntary basis.In his new book “Let Us Dream,” due Dec. 1, Francis listed the “poor Uighurs” among examples of groups persecuted for their faith.Francis wrote about the need to see the world from the peripheries and the margins of society, “to places of sin and misery, of exclusion and suffering, of illness and solitude.”In such places of suffering, “I think often of persecuted peoples: the Rohingya, the poor Uighurs, the Yazidi — what ISIS did to them was truly cruel — or Christians in Egypt and Pakistan killed by bombs that went off while they prayed in church,” Francis wrote.Francis has declined to call out China for its crackdown on religious minorities, including Catholics, much to the dismay of the Trump administration and human rights groups. The Vatican last month renewed its controversial agreement with Beijing on nominating Catholic bishops, and Francis has been careful to not say or do anything to offend the Chinese government on the subject.China and the Vatican have had no formal relations since the Communist Party cut ties and arrested Catholic clerics soon after seizing power in 1949.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-criticizes-pope-over-comment-on-uighur-muslim-minority/story-nuggUDzrwRjWTAdDR5KUJP.html
24-11-2020||World||Oil rises past August high on vaccine progress, Joe Biden transition||Oil extended gains after closing at the highest level since August on signs Covid-19 vaccines could be rolled out within weeks and as the start of the US presidential transition process aided markets in general.Futures in New York rose around 1% after settling above $43 a barrel on Monday. A vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc that prevented a majority of people from getting the disease could be deployed as soon as next month. That follows successful trials of two other anti-virus drugs. The triggering of a formal transition process to US President-elect Joe Biden buoyed stock markets and pushed down the dollar.Vaccine optimism has oil heading for its best month since May, with investors looking past a worsening second wave that’s spurring more lockdown measures. Covid-19 is forecast to claim another 30,000 American lives by mid-December, Japan is moving toward boosting restrictions to contain the virus and Hong Kong is set to close bars and nightclubs, according to local media.The prospect of imminent drug rollouts is reshaping the oil futures curve. Global benchmark Brent’s prompt timespread flipped into backwardation -- a bullish structure where prompt contracts are more expensive than later-dated ones -- on Monday for the first time since June. A rebound in Chinese local flights is also aiding demand for jet fuel, the hardest-hit oil product.“The AstraZeneca vaccine is really a big deal as most developed markets will be able to immunize their most at-risk population to Covid-19 by spring,” said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at Axi. “The continuing increase in infections in the US and elsewhere has been the primary source of oil demand uncertainty.”The firming of the oil futures curve is a sign the market expects a rapid tightening of supplies ahead, RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a report. However, the forward curve for West Texas Intermediate looks overvalued with inventories still brimming at the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub, they said.WTI’s discount to Brent widened to the most since May amid expectations for OPEC+ to extend current output cuts into next year. Some members of the group are showing signs of strain, however. Iraq is seeking upfront payments of about $2 billion in exchange for a long-term crude-supply contract, the latest sign of Baghdad’s growing desperation for cash.Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, confirmed that Houthi rebels in Yemen targeted an oil facility in northern Jeddah province, a reminder of the ever-present risk of instability in the region. The attack on Monday caused a fire at an oil tank inside a fuel-distribution center, the kingdom’s energy ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oil-rises-past-august-high-on-vaccine-progress-joe-biden-transition/story-xJr6neu3kp9OlRqT5hAAbP.html
24-11-2020||World||Saudi Aramco says no one hurt in blast, fire from missile strike||Saudi Aramco needed about 40 minutes to put out the fire caused by a missile strike on a fuel depot in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, with evidence pointing to a sophisticated attack on the kingdom’s energy infrastructure.No one was hurt in the explosion or blaze, and supplies from the facility in Saudi Arabia’s second-biggest city were not interrupted, an Aramco official said Tuesday, asking not to be identified due to company policy.Monday’s attack, for which Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen claimed responsibility, was “similar” to the one on Aramco’s Abqaiq oil-processing plant and Khurais field in September 2019, the official said. Missiles and armed drones temporarily knocked out about half of Saudi Arabia’s oil-production capacity in last year’s attack.Aramco is still assessing the extent of the damage from Monday’s strike, which tore a hole measuring roughly two square meters in a diesel storage tank containing about 480,000 barrels, the official said. The depot has 13 tanks holding diesel, gasoline and jet fuel for domestic distribution. Aramco was distributing products again three hours afterward, the official said.The Houthis have been fighting Yemen’s United Nations-backed government in a civil war since 2015, when a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an effort to roll back the rebels’ gains. They frequently fire missiles into Saudi Arabia, some of which are intercepted. They used a Quds 2 rocket in the Monday attack, their spokesman, Yahya Saree, said in a statement.Saudi Arabia condemned the strike, saying “terrorist and sabotage acts committed against vital installations target the security and stability of energy supplies to the world,” the official Saudi Press Agency reported.The missile landed a few miles from Jeddah’s main airport and would’ve traveled at least 370 miles (595 kilometers) if fired from Yemen, suggesting a high degree of expertise on the part of the Houthis.The Houthis, a Shiite group, also claimed responsibility for the attacks last year on Abqaiq and Khurais, which temporarily halted about 5% of global oil supply and caused crude prices briefly to soar. The UN concluded that those missiles probably came from Iran, which backs the Houthis.Human rights groups have documented repeated cases of bombings by Saudi-led forces of civilian targets in Yemen, including schools and hospitals. The war there has caused what the UN described in 2018 as the world’s worst man-made humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-aramco-says-no-one-hurt-in-blast-fire-from-missile-strike/story-BibcoLuLh8dYGrZLhHjJ3N.html

The four-per-table rule at restaurants and mandatory mask-wearing would remain in place, she said, and the government would urge employers to allow work-from-home arrangements.Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday morning that Hong Kong would shutter more indoor entertainment venues as cases rose. She’s scheduled to deliver her delayed annual policy address on Wednesday.“The direction is to cover this kind of premises because according to the WHO, we have to avoid three things: Avoid closed areas, avoid crowds -- the ‘three C’s’ -- and avoid close contacts,” Lam said at a weekly briefing.Hong Kong reported 80 coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the most since Aug. 7, including 10 that were of unknown origin, according to Department of Health official Chuang Shuk-kwan. Concerns are rising about a new wave of infections in a city that has largely avoided major outbreaks seen elsewhere in the world.“Unfortunately we see a rebound, so we need to do our best to keep it under control,” Lam said. Still, “we have to look at it globally because this is a global pandemic,” she added. “Hong Kong is not doing bad at all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-close-bars-nightclubs-from-thursday-due-to-coronavirus/story-RQmIey8ClgfD4V9QnGNPIP.html
24-11-2020||World||US charities raise millions in wake of Beirut port blast||When Manal Saab heard that a massive explosion had struck Beirut, she grabbed her phone, frantically trying to reach loved ones there.The news she received was good: Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law, both of whom live not far from the Lebanese capital’s port that was devastated by the Aug. 4 blast, were vacationing at the time.“Otherwise, they wouldn’t have survived it,” said Saab, an American citizen who lives in Fenton, Michigan, near Flint, but was born in Lebanon.Knowing that her family and friends were safe, a feeling of relief washed over Saab.That changed quickly, though. And her focus turned to a different kind of relief.Within a few days, she and her daughter, Rashal Baz Zureikat, a lawyer, had created the Lebanon Relief Project and were starting to solicit contributions from across the USSanta Barbara, California-based humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief has sent more than $20 million in medicine, personal protective equipment and supplies to Beirut. More than half of that amount was delivered via a FedEx-donated airlift that also included relief supplies from the American Task Force on Lebanon and the Lebanon Relief Project.“People were just waiting to help. They just wanted something to immediately give to, they wanted all that pain to basically get out and give something positive,” Saab said. “They wanted to turn all that negative energy into something that will give them some satisfaction that they’re able to reach Lebanon somehow.”The massive blast killed nearly 200 people and injured more than 6,000 when 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate detonated at Beirut’s port. It also devastated several neighbourhoods, shattering thousands of residential, historic and other buildings. It is considered to be one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever recorded.The cause of the explosion still is not known, but it is widely seen as the culmination of decades of corruption and mismanagement by Lebanon’s ruling class. It came on top of an unprecedented economic crisis. Poverty and unemployment are soaring, made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. And the medical community was left reeling as it continues to navigate and keep up with the explosion’s devastating long-term effects.The dire situation in a nation once known as a regional hub for banking, real estate and medical services has drawn intense interest in Michigan, which is home to one of the largest concentrations of Arabs outside the Middle East.US Rep. Rashida Tlaib raised “a significant amount of money” via an email campaign, said the Detroit Democrat, who added that she even knew of a girl who brought in some cash for the people of Beirut earned through a lemonade stand.“Even if you are not Lebanese, just being an Arab American … I felt the connection in a big way to what happened and the need to help,” said Maha Freij, director of the Dearborn-based Center for Arab American Philanthropy.CAAP has partnered with the ATFL/Lebanon Relief Project in fund raising to support the expense of logistics and shipments.Everyone involved in relief efforts says more needs to be done to assist Lebanon because, as Saab points out, the situation has gone “from bad to worse,” due to a Covid-19 surge and strained resources in the aftermath of the explosion.“We’re not going to stop,” Saab said. “Because if we don’t (help), who will?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-charities-raise-millions-in-wake-of-beirut-port-blast/story-HPCr7zV2KbKxRpAhD0Q4YO.html
24-11-2020||World||Japan to express concern over China maritime activities, Hong Kong during Chinese top diplomat’s visit: Report||Japan is planning to express concerns China’s maritime activities and its tightened control on Hong Kong during the visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Japanese Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi said on Tuesday.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is arriving in Japan on Tuesday for talks with his counterpart Motegi Toshimitsu. He is also expected to meet Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide the following day, NHK reported. The visit comes amidst mounting concerns over Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the region.This will be the first time since the launch of Suga’s Cabinet that a high-ranking official from China is coming to Japan.Japan also wants to reaffirm with China the importance of high-level communication between the countries in order to build stable bilateral ties.“There are various complicated issues in the relations of Japan and China, it is important to solve them one by one during high-level negotiations. The trends in the Chinese military cause serious concerns from the regional security point of view, which includes our country. It is important to clearly and sincerely express this concern and try to look for common ground,” Sputnik quoted Kishi as saying.The Japanese side also plans to express concerns over China’s maritime activities and its tightened control on Hong Kong, the NHK broadcaster reported.The visit is also unlikely to dilute major differences between the two regional powers, South China Morning Post reported citing analysts, adding that it was uncertain whether Wang could nail down a date for Chinese President Xi Jinping’s much-delayed trip to Japan.Chinese vessels have repeatedly intruded into Japan’s territorial waters off the Senkaku Islands in Okinawa Prefecture.Japan controls the islands. The Japanese government maintains that the islands are an inherent part of Japan’s territory.Since the imposition of the national security law on Hong Kong earlier this year, many countries including Japan have expressed concerns on Beijing’s clampdown on dissent in the former British colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-express-concern-over-china-maritime-activities-hong-kong-during-chinese-top-diplomat-s-visit-report/story-hXInHvzcOE9UFJPiz6wULO.html
24-11-2020||World||Janet Yellen as treasury secretary sets up Biden to go big on stimulus||President-elect Joe Biden’s selection of Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary signals that he plans to act aggressively to revive the world’s biggest economy, putting a former Federal Reserve chair who’s not shied away from stimulus at the helm of his economic policy.Also Read | Joe Biden taps ex-Fed chair Janet Yellen to lead treasuryWith Yellen in charge, Biden’s Treasury department will be prepared to join Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s policy of lower-for-longer interest rates with extended, expansionary government spending.While her reported pick was applauded both on Wall Street and in much of official Washington -- even by some of President Donald Trump’s allies -- Yellen is sure to be tested in her Senate confirmation hearings. Conservatives will probe her views on stimulus spending, as well her less confrontational position toward China, a nation many Republicans view as an economic adversary.A front-row witness to the increasingly partisan battles over government spending in Washington over the past quarter-century, Yellen now stands to become a combatant for the first time in her career.Legislative NegotiationsThe Fed is a consensus-based institution, where colleagues typically use polite, diplomatic language when they disagree. In her new job, Yellen can expect GOP lawmakers to pull no punches in assailing the large-scale coronavirus relief package Biden promises, while any concessions to the opposition are sure to draw broadsides from the liberal wing of her own party.Yellen lacks experience in hammering out legislation with Congress, and she also didn’t perform anywhere near the outreach to lawmakers when she was Fed chair that Powell has chalked up, a hole in her resume that could create a learning curve next year.Biden’s plans to nominate her, confirmed by people familiar with the matter, are expected to culminate in an announcement next week.Unified FrontHer first step is expected to be seeking unity between the Fed and Treasury, the two institutions at the front lines of any economic crisis.Trump’s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, last week opened a rift between the agencies when he declined to extend several crisis-lending programs at the Fed created by the Cares Act, the stimulus signed into law earlier this year.The Fed said it opposed ending the programs but agreed to return hundreds of billions of dollars in backstop money to Treasury, where Mnuchin wants Congress to put it to what he considers better uses.Yellen is seen reversing that move early next year, after the Biden campaign criticized Mnuchin’s decision.“Instead of a dissonance and the break we’ve seen recently between Treasury and the Fed, this is a unified front, but a unified front in the right direction,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. “We need this.”Big StimulusThe leaders of the two institutions have years of shared working history between them, which could smooth their efforts to support the fragile recovery from the pandemic. Powell served on the Fed board as governor when Yellen was chair, then took over for her when Trump tapped him for the Fed’s top job.A meticulous macroeconomist who’s specialized in the study of the labor market, the 74-year-old Yellen recently said the Fed’s policy of lower-for-longer interest rates should coincide with greater government spending.“While the pandemic is still seriously affecting the economy we need to continue extraordinary fiscal support, but even beyond that I think it will be necessary,” Yellen said Oct. 19 on Bloomberg Television. “We can afford to have more debt,” she added, because interest rates will probably be low “for many years to come.”Before she can turn to mending relations with the Fed and negotiating stimulus, though, Yellen can expect Republican criticism for her past comments on Chinese trade policy. Biden returns to the federal government with a Congress far more antagonistic to China than four years ago and united in its desire to punish Beijing for unfair trade practices.China ViewsEconomic negotiations with one of the U.S.’s largest trading partners have traditionally been handled by the U.S. Treasury chief. During a 2018 congressional hearing as Fed chair, Yellen said China was not to blame for America’s big worldwide trade deficit.“I do not see unfair trade practices in China, or anywhere in the world, as what is responsible for the U.S. trade deficit,” she said at the time.But Yellen has extensive experience dealing with Chinese economic officials from her time as Fed chair, when she attended Group of 20 meetings.“Yellen’s understated style should not be mistaken for lack of political savvy or softness in negotiations,” said Cornell University’s Eswar Prasad.Financial Crisis MistakeWriting as an academic with her husband, Nobel-prize winning economist George Akerlof, Yellen has authored papers on such topics as job satisfaction and fair wages in the labor market.“She understands the labor market implications much better than someone from Wall Street would,” Swonk said.Yellen and Biden may seek to avoid a repeat of what many economists considered a policy mistake following the 2008-09 financial crisis, when a premature return to fiscal austerity by Congress held back the recovery even as the Fed sought to spur growth through controversial quantitative easing programs.It’s a misstep Powell is well aware of and which Biden observed first-hand as President Barack Obama’s number two.The trouble – at least from Yellen and Biden’s point of view – is that the shape of fiscal policy will largely be determined by which party controls the Senate, something which won’t be known until early January run-offs for two seats in Georgia’s.Should Republicans retain a majority, Yellen’s considerable reputation as a policy maker likely won’t be enough to persuade Biden’s opponents to adopt his vision of greater federal spending and a reshaped U.S. economy.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/janet-yellen-as-treasury-secretary-sets-up-biden-to-go-big-on-stimulus/story-N9mYsmByXUxVjmOb5QCagN.html
24-11-2020||World||Hundreds of flights cancelled as Shanghai tackles Covid-19||Hundreds of flights at one of China’s busiest airports were cancelled Tuesday as Shanghai raced to bring a local coronavirus outbreak under control.Health officials have tested thousands of staff at Pudong International Airport since a small cluster of Covid-19 cases in the city was linked to several cargo handlers.China -- where the virus first emerged late last year -- has largely brought the pandemic under control through travel restrictions and lockdowns, but it is now battling a number of domestic outbreaks in different cities.Shanghai has reported seven local infections linked to the airport this month, with most cases found in the past few days.The outbreak has sparked plans to give high-risk workers at the travel hub an experimental vaccine China has already been providing to state employees, international students and essential workers heading abroad since July.On Tuesday, figures from data services firm VariFlight showed that over 500 flights out of Pudong Airport had been called off -- nearly half the day’s scheduled flights.Also Read: 2 viruses closely related to coronavirus found in Japan, CambodiaAlmost half of scheduled inbound flights were also cancelled.More than 17,700 people had been swabbed by Monday morning at part of a drive to test airport cargo staff, state news agency Xinhua reported, with those infected including employees at logistics firms FedEx and UPS.Videos shared Sunday night on social media appeared to show a large crowd at the airport trying to push their way into a multi storey car park where the testing was taking place and being held back by a row of people wearing full hazmat suits.Later footage published by Shanghai health officials showed rows of people queuing at what appears to be the same location and being ushered to testing stations by health workers.Nearly half of all scheduled flights were also cancelled at Tianjin International Airport, a northern port city testing around 2.6 million people to try and bring a local cluster under control.Also Read| Covid-19: All you need to know about global QR code proposed by ChinaTianjin reported five local cases on Saturday and another on Tuesday.China has been rolling out mass-screening campaigns in response to the emergence of local Covid-19 cases, in some instances collecting test samples from entire districts or cities.Authorities have in recent days shifted their focus to imported frozen food and other inbound shipments, which have been blamed for a resurgence of local infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-flights-cancelled-as-shanghai-tackles-covid-19/story-z4uGsL5gzw4DoMp223zLmL.html
24-11-2020||World||NYC’s first African-American mayor, David Dinkins, has died||David Dinkins, who broke barriers as New York City’s first African-American mayor, but was doomed to a single term by a soaring murder rate, stubborn unemployment and his mishandling of a riot in Brooklyn, has died. He was 93.Dinkins died Monday, the New York City Police Department confirmed. The department said officers were called to the former mayor’s home in the evening. Initial indications were that he died of natural causes.Dinkins’ death came just weeks after the death of his wife, Joyce, who died in October at the age of 89.Dinkins, a calm and courtly figure with a penchant for tennis and formal wear, was a dramatic shift from both his predecessor, Ed Koch, and his successor, Rudolph Giuliani — two combative and often abrasive politicians in a city with a world-class reputation for impatience and rudeness.In his inaugural address, he spoke lovingly of New York as a “gorgeous mosaic of race and religious faith, of national origin and sexual orientation, of individuals whose families arrived yesterday and generations ago, coming through Ellis Island or Kennedy Airport or on buses bound for the Port Authority.”But the city he inherited had an ugly side, too.AIDS, guns and crack cocaine killed thousands of people each year. Unemployment soared. Homelessness was rampant. The city faced a $1.5 billion budget deficit.Dinkins’ low-key, considered approach quickly came to be perceived as a flaw. Critics said he was too soft and too slow.“Dave, Do Something!” screamed one New York Post headline in 1990, Dinkins’ first year in office.Dinkins did a lot at City Hall. He raised taxes to hire thousands of police officers. He spent billions of dollars revitalizing neglected housing. His administration got the Walt Disney Corp. to invest in the cleanup of then-seedy Times Square.In recent years, he’s gotten more credit for those accomplishments, credit that Mayor Bill de Blasio said he should have always had. De Blasio, who worked in Dinkins’ administration, named Manhattan’s Municipal Building after the former mayor in October 2015.“The example Mayor David Dinkins set for all of us shines brighter than the most powerful lighthouse imaginable,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who herself shattered barriers as the state’s first Black woman elected to statewide office.“I was honored to have him hold the bible at my inaugurations because I, and others, stand on his shoulders,” she said.Results from his accomplishments, however, didn’t come fast enough to earn Dinkins a second term.After beating Giuliani by only 47,000 votes out of 1.75 million cast in 1989, Dinkins lost a rematch by roughly the same margin in 1993.Political historians often trace the defeat to Dinkins’ handling of the Crown Heights riot in Brooklyn in 1991.The violence began after a black 7-year-old boy was accidentally killed by a car in the motorcade of an Orthodox Jewish religious leader. During the three days of anti-Jewish rioting by young black men that followed, a rabbinical student was fatally stabbed. Nearly 190 people were hurt.A state report issued in 1993, an election year, cleared Dinkins of the persistently repeated charge that he intentionally held back police in the first days of the violence, but criticized him for not stepping up as a leader.In a 2013 memoir, Dinkins accused the police department of letting the disturbance get out of hand, and also took a share of the blame, on the grounds that “the buck stopped with me.” But he bitterly blamed his election defeat on prejudice: “I think it was just racism, pure and simple.”Born in Trenton, New Jersey, on July 10, 1927, Dinkins moved with his mother to Harlem when his parents divorced, but returned to his hometown to attend high school. There, he learned an early lesson in discrimination: Blacks were not allowed to use the school swimming pool.During a hitch in the Marine Corps as a young man, a Southern bus driver barred him from boarding a segregated bus because the section for blacks was filled.“And I was in my country’s uniform!” Dinkins recounted years later.While attending Howard University, the historically black university in Washington, D.C., Dinkins said he gained admission to segregated movie theaters by wearing a turban and faking a foreign accent.Back in New York with a degree in mathematics, Dinkins married his college sweetheart, Joyce Burrows, in 1953. His father-in-law, a power in local Democratic politics, channeled Dinkins into a Harlem political club. Dinkins paid his dues as a Democratic functionary while earning a law degree from Brooklyn Law School, and then went into private practice.He got elected to the state Assembly in 1965, became the first black president of the city’s Board of Elections in 1972 and went on to serve as Manhattan borough president.Dinkins’ election as mayor in 1989 came after two racially charged cases that took place under Koch: the rape of a white jogger in Central Park and the bias murder of a black teenager in Bensonhurst.Dinkins defeated Koch, 50 percent to 42 percent, in the Democratic primary. But in a city where party registration was 5-to-1 Democratic, Dinkins barely scraped by the Republican Giuliani in the general election, capturing only 30 percent of the white vote.His administration had one early high note: Newly freed Nelson Mandela made New York City his first stop in the US in 1990. Dinkins had been a longtime, outspoken critic of apartheid in South Africa.In that same year, though, Dinkins was criticized for his handling of a black-led boycott of Korean-operated grocery stores in Brooklyn. Critics contended Dinkins waited too long to intervene. He ultimately ended up crossing the boycott line to shop at the stores — but only after Koch did.During Dinkins’ tenure, the city’s finances were in rough shape because of a recession that cost New York 357,000 private-sector jobs in his first three years in office.Meanwhile, the city’s murder toll soared to an all-time high, with a record 2,245 homicides during his first year as mayor. There were 8,340 New Yorkers killed during the Dinkins administration — the bloodiest four-year stretch since the New York Police Department began keeping statistics in 1963.In the last years of his administration, record-high homicides began a decline that continued for decades. In the first year of the Giuliani administration, murders fell from 1,946 to 1,561.One of Dinkins’ last acts in 1993 was to sign an agreement with the United States Tennis Association that gave the organization a 99-year lease on city land in Queens in return for building a tennis complex. That deal guaranteed that the US Open would remain in New York City for decades.After leaving office, Dinkins was a professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs.He had a pacemaker inserted in August 2008, and underwent an emergency appendectomy in October 2007. He also was hospitalized in March 1992 for a bacterial infection that stemmed from an abscess on the wall of his large intestine. He was treated with antibiotics and recovered in a week.Dinkins is survived by his son, David Jr., daughter, Donna and two grandchildren.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyc-s-first-african-american-mayor-david-dinkins-has-died/story-9VYleQknYIceWuAbNq6RSO.html
24-11-2020||World||Australia opens up more borders in domestic travel boost, eyes vaccine||Australia will lift more internal border restrictions in a boost for tourism as new coronavirus infections slow to a trickle, while first vaccines could be available in March, a government minister said on Tuesday.Queensland state, a popular holiday destination, will allow visitors next week from the country’s two most populous states, New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, after closing its borders in August.NSW has since notched a month without any Covid-19 cases where the source is unknown and restrictions on arrivals from Sydney will be eased on Dec. 1, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said.Residents of Victoria, previously the country’s coronavirus hotspot, will also be welcomed if the state has no new cases on Wednesday, which would mark 26 days without community transmission.“Queensland is good to go,” Palaszczuk told reporters in Brisbane.NSW and Victoria opened their border on Monday, while the South Australia-Victorian border opens fully next week, in welcome news for local airline companies, Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia.Qantas said it will run more than 1,200 return flights from Victoria and NSW into Queensland in the run-up to Christmas.The moves will please Prime Minister Scott Morrison who has pushed state leaders to relax some curbs to help revive the economy, which shrank 7% in the three months to end-June, the most since records began in 1959.Looking further out, Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australia - which has agreed to buy nearly 34 million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine - is increasingly confident it can complete a vaccination programme after the release of preliminary trial results.“Our vaccine timeline is beginning to strengthen. The news from overseas is that we are on track for first vaccines in March,” Hunt told reporters in Sydney. AstraZeneca said its Covid-19 vaccine, cheaper to make, easier to distribute and faster to scale-up than its rivals, could be as much as 90% effective.Australia has reported more than 27,800 cases of Covid-19 and 907 deaths since the pandemic began, but estimates there are fewer than 100 active Covid-19 cases remaining, mostly people in hotel quarantine.Victoria said on Tuesday it had zero active cases for the first time in over eight months following a strict lockdown after daily infections peaked at more than 700 in early August.Qantas, meanwhile, said it will insist in future that international travelers have a Covid-19 vaccination before they fly, describing the move as “a necessity”.“We are looking at changing our terms and conditions to say, for international travelers, that we will ask people to have a vaccination before they can get on the aircraft,” Chief Executive Alan Joyce told broadcaster Channel Nine.Australia closed its international borders in March and currently requires returning travelers from overseas to quarantine for two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-opens-up-more-borders-in-domestic-travel-boost-eyes-vaccine/story-tyQgwDP6wQQudDqiJr8xcN.html
24-11-2020||World||Elon Musk overtakes Bill Gates to grab world’s second-richest ranking||Elon Musk’s year of dizzying ascents hit a new apex Monday as the Tesla Inc. co-founder passed Bill Gates to become the world’s second-richest person.The 49-year-old entrepreneur’s net worth soared $7.2 billion to $127.9 billion, driven by yet another surge in Tesla’s share price. Musk has added $100.3 billion to his net worth this year, the most of anyone on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking of the world’s 500 richest people. In January he ranked 35th.His advance up the wealth ranks has been driven largely by Tesla, whose market value is approaching $500 billion. About three-quarters of his net worth is comprised of Tesla shares, which are valued more than four times as much as his stake in Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX.Musk’s milestone marks only the second time in the index’s eight-year history that Microsoft Corp. co-founder Gates has ranked lower than number two. He held the top spot for years before being bumped by Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos in 2017. Gates’s net worth of $127.7 billion would be much higher had he not donated so prodigiously to charity over the years. He has given more than $27 billion to his namesake foundation since 2006.With Monday’s move, Musk unseats an occasional verbal sparring partner in Gates, who the Tesla billionaire has ridiculed on Twitter for, among other things, having “no clue” about electric trucks. The two have also traded barbs over Covid-19. Gates, whose charitable foundation is one of the preeminent bodies backing vaccine research, has expressed concern over Musk’s stated suspicion of pandemic data and embrace of certain conspiracy theories.The year has been a lucrative one for the world’s richest people. Despite the pandemic and widespread layoffs that have disproportionately affected the world’s working class and poor, the members of the Bloomberg index have collectively gained 23% -- or $1.3 trillion -- since the year began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-overtakes-bill-gates-to-grab-world-s-second-richest-ranking/story-laXG078Xu347FOvE3bTeIM.html
24-11-2020||World||Trump relents finally, tells officials to cooperate with Biden transition team||US President Donald Trump finally relented on Monday, 16 days after he was projected to lose to President-elect Joe Biden, and instructed his officials to cooperate with the incoming administration, but he did not concede defeat and vowed to keep up the “good fight”, referring to his efforts to stay in office.Trump’s refusal to concede is growing less consequential every passing day because of his failing legal challenges and political manoeuvres. Michigan certified Biden the victor in the state earlier in the day, becoming the third of the battleground states to do so after Georgia and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania followed later in the day, all but killing Trump’s hopes of reversing the poll outcome and somehow win a second term.Trump’s decision to allow the transition process to go ahead was seen by political commentators and experts as the most he will do to acknowledge his defeat.But the president insisted he was not giving up. “Our case STRONGLY continues, we will keep up the good fight, and I believe we will prevail!” he wrote in a tweet, adding, “Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily [Murphy, head of the administration that flags off the transition process] and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same.”Murphy, the chief of General Services Administration, had already issued a letter by then, allowing the transition process to start finally, getting out of the way. “I take this role seriously and, because of recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results, am transmitting this letter today to make those resources and services available to you,” she wrote.The Biden transition team promptly declared the GSA statement as an “ascertainment”, a technical recognition of President-elect Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris as “apparent winners” pending finalisation by electors next month, and said in a statement, “This final decision is a definitive administrative action to formally begin the transition process with federal agencies.”The transition team said that in the days ahead it will start discussing with the Trump administration its “pandemic response, have a full accounting of our national security interests, and gain complete understanding of the Trump administration’s efforts to hollow out government agencies”.In the absence of the ascertainment, President-elect Biden had been denied national security intelligence briefings, which he should have been getting as part of the transition process, and his team was denied access to the Trump administration’s preparedness to tackle the epidemic and distribution of vaccines that are expected to start rolling out around the middle of December, initially for first responders and those at high-risk.The Biden transition team will also be entitled to federal funding for its operations and most importantly, start the routine process of background screening of the president-elect’s cabinet nominations, the first bunch of to be announced Tuesday, and the 4,000 federal positions to be filled with political appointees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-relents-finally-tells-officials-to-cooperate-with-biden-transition-team/story-Boz6xyADmQqxb7rDqN4nxM.html
24-11-2020||World||Carl Bernstein says 21 GOP senators contemptuous of Donald Trump||Former Watergate sleuth Carl Bernstein took to Twitter to list the names of 21 Republican senators who he says have “repeatedly expressed contempt” for Donald Trump and his fitness to be president.Bernstein’s post was condemned Monday by some of those involved. It was an eyebrow-raising modern twist on journalism from the former Washington Post reporter who, with partner Bob Woodward in the 1970s, penned scoops that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.Bernstein said he wasn’t violating any confidentiality pledges in listing the senators. He said he learned of the politicians’ supposed private feelings through conversations with some of their colleagues, staff members, lobbyists and White House aides.“With few exceptions, their craven public silence has helped enable Trump’s most grievous conduct — including undermining and discrediting the US electoral system,” he tweeted late Sunday.Bernstein, a CNN political analyst, declined a request to talk about his posts.Many Washington reporters have talked about lawmakers who have privately expressed reservations about Trump but rarely attached names to their stories. Bernstein said he believed several of the Republicans on his list were privately happy about Democrat Joe Biden’s victory.Also Read: Trump relents after steady drumbeat of Republicans urge start of Biden transitionMichael Zona, a spokesperson for Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who was on Bernstein’s list, said the characterization was untrue.“Sen. Grassley has been a strong supporter of the president and at the same time has made it no secret when he disagrees with the president,” Zona said. “There is no difference between what Sen. Grassley says publicly and privately. Washington journalists might be wise to reconsider trafficking in baseless second- and third-hand rumor. It may restore some lost credibility.” Ohio Sen. Rob Portman “has never talked to Mr. Bernstein and we don’t know where he’s getting his false information,” said Emily Benavides, the senator’s spokesperson.Portman, in a column written for the Cincinnati Enquirer on Monday, called on Trump to begin cooperating with President-elect Biden on a transition.There was no article on CNN’s website about Bernstein’s list on Monday. The veteran reporter appeared on CNN’s “New Day” on Friday and named 15 of the 21 senators he tweeted about two days later.Roy Gutterman, a Syracuse University professor who specializes in journalism law and ethics, said Bernstein’s approach was unusual and noted the journalist’s frequent criticism of Trump.“I don’t know if what he did today would fit the model of what he staked his reputation on, which was hard-core investigative reporting,” Gutterman said.It was unsurprising to find Utah Sen. Mitt Romney on Bernstein’s list. Romney said last week of Trump’s pressure to overturn the election results that it was “difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American president.” “The senator’s views about the president are well known by the public,” spokeswoman Liz Johnson said.In a statement, a spokesperson for Indiana Sen. Todd Young said Bernstein’s “unsourced rumors” don’t deserve a response and that Young has a great working relationship with Trump.Meanwhile, Sean Smith, communications director for South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, said his boss “has never met, talked to or considered interacting with Mr. Bernstein, so no one should give any weight to the baseless accusations of someone who clearly has an axe to grind with the president.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/carl-bernstein-says-21-gop-senators-contemptuous-of-donald-trump/story-5zktF3XO2qltJr9MtC2NLO.html
24-11-2020||World||EU and Canada along with 11 other nations push trade plan to help in Covid-19 battle||The European Union(EU), Canada, and 11 other countries agreed on Monday to measures such as eliminating export curbs they believe should form the basis of a global deal to help tackle Covid-19 and future pandemics.The “Ottawa Group” will present its proposals to the World Trade Organization(WTO) in mid-December in the hope its 164 members will sign up early in 2021.“If we adopt something in early spring of next year, say March, that would still be a moment when this would be relevant for the management of the pandemic,” a European Commission official said, adding this would cover a busy period when vaccines were being made and distributed.The group, which does not include the United States or China, wants WTO members to commit to removing export restrictions on medical supplies - some 70 still have them in place, according to EU officials.Any such restrictions should be targeted and temporary and not disturb the COVAX initiative to provide equitable access to Covid-19 drugs.WTO members should, they say, take steps to ease trade flows, such as streamlining customs, and not impose on pandemic-related goods during the crisis.They also urge greater transparency and believe the WTO, World Health Organization and World Customs Organization can work more closely to be ready for future pandemics.The Ottawa Group’s other members are Australia, Brazil, Chile, Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland.The group’s initiative is not the only one related to the pandemic at the WTO.India, South Africa and other developing countries want to waive intellectual property rules to improve access to affordable drugs.The European Union, the United States and other wealthy nations oppose this, saying pharmaceutical companies need financial incentives to develop vaccines and therapies and there is sufficient flexibility under existing trade rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-and-canada-along-with-11-other-nations-push-trade-plan-to-help-in-covid-19-battle/story-LhImxdAHqBGlhk6GJC27EI.html
24-11-2020||World||The woman behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine||The University of Oxford and pharma major AstraZeneca on Monday said their vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) was up to 90% effective in late-stage clinical trials, bringing hope to millions across the world. This would not have been possible without professor Sarah Gilbert at the university’s Jenner Institute and her indispensable team.This Irish-born virologist started her journey in 1994 with malaria vaccine research and has since then worked on shots against Ebola and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). According to the BBC, all these might not have materialised if Dr Gilbert had given up on science during her PhD days. But she decided not to give up on a career in science because it provided a stable source of income.Gilbert has always preferred interdisciplinary research and she told the BBC that the lack of “diversity of thought” and “tunnel-like focus” during her doctoral years at the University of Hull almost caused her to give up on science. Coming from a family of musicians, Dr Gilbert juggled a plethora of careers, from working at brewing research to human health and now she and her team are about to embark on their most awaited challenge yet.Sarah Gilbert was born in Kettering, Northamptonshire in April 1962, both her parents were not in STEM fields. She started working on vaccine research in 1994 with Adrian Hill, who is now the director of the Jenner Institute. Their very first collaborative effort was on the malaria vaccine and as mentioned by the Lancet, this helped hone her skills in creating recombinant viral vector vaccines, that could itself trigger positive responses from T-cells and not rely exclusively on antibody response, like the majority of vaccines at that time.The Oxford Covid-19 vaccine’s foundation is built on the research work painstakingly put together by Gilbert and Hill over the years and which they successfully patented. Gilbert’s team was awarded a grant of £2.2 million from the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health Research and the UK Research and Innovation in March 2020. The Oxford vaccine, which is called AZD1222, is cheaper to make, can be conveniently stored at fridge temperature and is easier to transport.

24-11-2020||World||French ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy’s trial for corruption suspended||The trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for corruption and influence peddling was suspended Monday less than two hours after it started, to allow a medical report on one of the defendants.Sarkozy is accused of having tried to illegally obtain information from a magistrate about an investigation involving him in 2014.This is the first trial for the 65-year-old politician, who has faced several other judicial investigations since leaving office in 2012.He stands trial in a Paris court along with his lawyer Thierry Herzog, 65, and the magistrate, Gilbert Azibert, 73. They face a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a maximum fine of 1 million euros ($1.2 million.) They deny any wrongdoing.Sarkozy and Herzog are suspected of promising Azibert a job in Monaco in exchange for leaking information about an investigation into suspected illegal financing of the 2007 presidential campaign by France’s richest woman, L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.Sarkozy arrived at the court surrounded by his lawyers and bodyguards, in the presence of dozens of journalists. The Paris court has been placed under high security as hearings in the case, scheduled until Dec. 10, are taking place at the same time as another key trial — that of the 2015 attacks at the Charlie Hebdo offices and a kosher supermarket.The trial started Monday in the absence of Azibert, whose lawyer requested the hearings to be postponed. He argued his client’s bad health makes it risky for him to travel and appear in court amid the coronavirus pandemic, leading the court to suspend proceedings pending an expert medical report. The trial will resume on Thursday.In 2014, Sarkozy and Herzog used secret mobile phones — registered to the alias name of “Paul Bismuth” — to be be able to have private talks as they feared their conversations were being tapped.Sarkozy and Herzog explained that they bought the phones to avoid being targeted by illegal phone tapping. Investigative judges, however, suspect they actually wanted to avoid being tapped by investigators.Judges have found that discussions between Sarkozy and his lawyer suggested they had knowledge that judicial investigators at the time tapped their conversations on their official phones — they mentioned “judges listening.”Sarkozy argued that he never intervened to help Azibert, who never got the job and retired in 2014.Investigative judges consider that as soon as a deal has been offered, it constitutes a criminal offence even if the promises haven’t been fulfilled.Legal proceedings against Sarkozy have been dropped in the Bettencourt case.Sarkozy, a lawyer by training, pointed at judicial harassment, accusing judges of breaching lawyer-client privilege via wiretapping.“I don’t want things that I didn’t do to be held against me. The French need to know... that I’m not a rotten person,” he told BFM TV earlier this month.He said he was facing the trial in a “combative” mood.Sarkozy’s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was found guilty in 2011 of misuse of public money, breach of trust and conflict of interest and given a two-year suspended prison sentence for actions during his time as Paris mayor, before he was president from 1995 to 2007.Sarkozy’s name has appeared for years in several other judicial investigations.Allegations, which include illegal financing of his 2007 campaign by then-Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, cast a shadow over Sarkozy’s comeback attempt for the 2017 presidential election.After failing to be chosen as candidate by his conservative party, he withdrew from active politics.Sarkozy remained the most popular figure amid French right-wing voters in recent years. His memoirs published this summer, “The Time of Storms,” was a bestseller for weeks.Sarkozy was handed preliminary charges including “illegal campaign financing” in the Libyan investigation, which has been underway since 2013 — and prompted the wiretapping of his phones.Earlier this month, French-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine retracted his previous statements that he delivered suitcases from Libya containing 5 million euros ($5.9 million) in cash to Sarkozy and his former chief of staff, Claude Gueant.Instead, he told news broadcaster BFM and magazine Paris-Match that there were “no Libyan financing.”Sarkozy said that the truth “finally comes out.”Financial prosecutors said in a statement that charges in the Libyan case are based “on strong or corroborated evidence that are not limited to one person’s statement only.”Meanwhile, the former president will stand another trial in spring 2021 along with 13 other people on charges of illegal financing of his 2012 presidential campaign.His conservative party and a company named Bygmalion are accused of using a special invoice system to conceal unauthorized overspending.They are suspected of having spent 42.8 million euros ($50.7 million), almost twice the maximum authorized, to finance the campaign, which ended up in victory for Socialist rival Francois Hollande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-ex-president-nicolas-sarkozy-s-trial-for-corruption-suspended/story-JIsMyCz4XMfUtc4j1E6cNL.html
24-11-2020||World||Covid-19 on rampage, east to west||Chinese authorities are testing millions of people, imposing lockdowns and shutting down schools after multiple locally transmitted coronavirus cases were discovered in three cities across the country last week.As temperatures drop, large-scale measures are being enacted in the cities of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Manzhouli, despite the low number of new cases compared to the United States and other countries that are seeing new waves of infections.Many experts and government officials have warned that the chance of the virus spreading will be greater during the cold weather. Recent flare-ups have shown that there is still a risk of the virus returning, despite being largely controlled within China.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageOn Monday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Shanghai over the last 24 hours, bringing the total to seven since Friday. China has recorded 86,442 total cases and 4,634 deaths since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.The two latest cases confirmed in Shanghai were close contacts of another airport worker who was diagnosed with Covid-19 earlier in November. On Sunday night, the city’s Pudong International airport decided to test its workers, collecting 17,719 samples through the early hours of Monday morning. Plans call for testing others in surrounding communities if further cases are detected.Videos on social media purportedly from workers showed what appeared to be chaotic scenes at the airport as they were given last-minute orders to get tested. In the videos, people are seen standing in large groups pushing back and forth against officials in hazmat suits.Shanghai has been more selective with mass testing, targeting people associated with a particular place, such as the airport or the hospital where a confirmed individual had worked, rather than an entire district.In Tianjin, health workers have collected more than 2.2 million samples for testing from residents in the Binhai new district, after five locally transmitted cases were discovered there last week.In Manzhouli, a city of more than 200,000 people, local health authorities are testing all residents after two cases were reported on Saturday. They also shut down all schools and public venues and banned public gatherings such as banquets.China has resorted to its heavy, top-down approach each time new cases of local transmission are found — shutting down schools and hospitals, locking down residential communities and entire neighborhoods, and testing millions.Tianjin authorities shut down a kindergarten and moved all the teachers, family and students to a centralized quarantine space. They also sealed the residential compound where the five cases were found.China’s approach to controlling the pandemic has been criticized for being draconian. It locked down the city of Wuhan, where cases were first reported, for more than two months to contain the virus, with the local government shutting down all traffic and confining residents to their homes. Domestically, however, China has called its strategy “clear to zero” and has boasted of its success.“In the entire world, only China has the ability to get to zero. Other countries don’t have this ability,” Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a webinar hosted by Chinese media in September. “It’s not just getting to zero, even for them to control the first wave of the epidemic is hard.”“‘Clearing to zero’ is actually the most economically effective way to do epidemic prevention. If you don’t do that, then this problem will get more troublesome,” he said. “Use a heavier hand, and get to zero, then people will feel reassured.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-on-rampage-east-to-west/story-f3xdjkOhbXFbznpifkFMTL.html
24-11-2020||World||White House planning holiday parties despite warnings against gatherings during Covid-19 pandemic||All those warnings from public health officials begging Americans to limit gatherings this holiday season amid a surge in coronavirus cases aren’t stopping the White House from planning a host of festivities and holiday parties in the midst of a pandemic.Monday’s delivery of an 18-and-a-half-foot tall Fraser fir by horse-drawn carriage signalled the kickoff of the usual array of White House holiday events that will include the annual turkey pardon and Christmas and Hanukkah events.“Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,” said Stephanie Grisham, first lady Melania Trump’s spokeswoman and chief of staff, referring to the plans. “It is a longstanding tradition for people to visit and enjoy the cheer and iconic décor of the annual White House Christmas celebrations.”The decision to move forward with indoor gatherings and project a sense of normalcy comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), top White House advisers and public health professionals across the nation have been pleading with Americans not to travel for Thanksgiving or spend the holiday with people from outside of their households.As the weather has cooled, the virus has been spreading out of control, with cases and hospitalizations surging across the nation and more than 250,000 people dead.The White House has already been the site of several suspected “super-spreader” events and dozens of staff — along with the president, his wife and two of his sons — have been infected, along with a long list of campaign aides, other advisers and allies in Congress.Grisham said the White House would be taking precautions to provide “the safest environment possible” for those who choose to attend events. That includes smaller guest lists, requiring masks, encouraging social distancing on the White House grounds and hand sanitizer stations placed throughout the State Floor.“Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass protected food stations. All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines,” she said.Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, warned once again on Monday of the potentially dire consequences of gathering this holiday season.“We’re in a very difficult situation where the rate of infection, the slope of infections, are really very, very steep. So you might want to reconsider travel plans,” Fauci said in an interview with Washington Post Live. He added that indoor holiday gatherings “as innocent and wonderful as they sound” should be kept to a minimal number of people, preferably “just members of a household” and also warned of a potential “surge superimposed upon a surge” if precautions aren’t taken.Fauci predicted the country could see “well over” 300,000 deaths by the end of the year “if we don’t we turn things around.”US Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Monday repeatedly evaded questions about indoor holiday parties scheduled at the White House while calling other Americans’ indoor gatherings potential “super-spreader” events.“I want the American people to know that we are at a dire point in our fight with this virus, by any measure: cases, positivity, hospitalizations, deaths,” he said on on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” “So I’m asking Americans — I’m begging you — hold on just a little bit longer. Keep Thanksgiving and the celebrations small and smart this year do it outdoors if you can, keep it small, ideally less than 10, and prepare beforehand.”Pressed on whether he had concerns about White House holiday plans, Adams said that best practices “apply to the White House, they apply to the American people, they apply to everyone. We want you to stay safe so we can get to a vaccine.”Not long after, the first lady attended a small outdoor ceremony on the White House driveway to mark the arrival of the large Christmas tree that will adorn the White House Blue Room.Mrs. Trump inspected the Fraser fir tree, smiled, waved to cameras and chatted with masked drivers of a carriage pulled by Clydesdale horses as the brass section of the US Marine Band played Christmas carols.The National Christmas Tree Association(NCTA) said that, in normal years, “the selection of the White House Christmas tree is a media event at the NCTA Champion Grower’s farm attended by 100 or more people to observe the White House team select the perfect tree for the Blue Room.”It added that “2020 is far from a normal year — there was no selection event this year.”On Tuesday, the holiday events will continue at the White House as President Donald Trump participates in the annual pardoning of the National Thanksgiving Turkey at a ceremony in the Rose Garden.The turkeys – Corn and Cob – arrived Sunday at the luxury Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington and photographers were invited there Monday, as they are every year, to capture the fowl strutting around inside their hotel room.The first family has cancelled its annual Thanksgiving week trip to Florida and will be gathering at the White House instead of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, where he is typically joined by hundreds of dues-paying members.President-elect Joe Biden, meanwhile, has said that there will be only three people at his Thanksgiving table this year because of the virus“I got a big family you’ve probably heard a lot about. We do everything together,” he said during a virtual roundtable with health-care workers. This year, however, “There are going to be three of us because you can’t mix the families that have been away, that haven’t been quarantining.”Trump has remained largely behind closed doors since he lost his bid for re-election. He has refused to concede, lodging baseless allegations of voter fraud in an attempt to subvert the results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-planning-holiday-parties-despite-warnings-against-gatherings-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-b7purljz71YrHNIATTyh3O.html
24-11-2020||World||Hong Kong campus rocked by protest becomes ‘prison’ a year later||One year ago, Hong Kong Polytechnic University was in flames.Police and student protesters faced off at the campus -- one of the Hong Kong’s best-known -- in a chaotic 16-day siege last November that became a symbol of the battle between the city’s China-backed administration and anti-government protesters.Today, what had once been a bustling, freely accessible campus is locked down, its protest movement extinguished in a series of aggressive moves to stifle dissent in the Asian financial hub.On a recent weekday, uniformed security guards stood at entrances blocked by gates. To enter, students, faculty and staff must tap their university ID cards, while visitors are not allowed unless they receive permission in advance. Though many universities in the US and Europe have been locked down because of Covid-19, PolyU’s restricted campus is rare in the city -- others including Hong Kong Baptist University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong still allow students and visitors on campus without prior approval.Even so, students at all universities in Hong Kong have had to adjust in the wake of national security legislation imposed in June by Beijing, including a tip line to report suspected violations. The dismissals of professors who supported the pro-democracy movement have added to concerns about a loss of academic freedom in an education system that has long contributed to Hong Kong’s status as a business hub by luring international professors and students while enticing local high achievers to stay home.“On the one hand, professors are more cautious about what they say and cover in class, a situation that has been aggravated by the National Security hotline initiative,” said Peter Baehr, a professor of social theory at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “This is creating a rat’s nest of informers and some of them, sadly, may be students and colleagues. On the other hand, university administrations are becoming ever more tyrannical.”Baehr and other experts on the city’s university system say they are seeing what they call a replication from the mainland of strict Chinese Communist Party control. Patriotism and fealty to the party are key. “This system rewards loyalty over competence, opportunism over principle,” Baehr said. “Academics are expected to take orders from administrators and lump it. They generally do.”PolyU accessA spokeswoman for PolyU said in an emailed statement that the university restricts access to the campus to maintain normal operations and reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus. The university also has an obligation to take appropriate action if there’s any improper use of its premises, she added.“The university firmly upholds academic freedom,” the spokeswoman said in the statement. “However, any acts that violate laws and regulations will not be tolerated.”PolyU said it offered almost 2,200 undergraduate seats in the local admission program for the 2020-2021 academic year, and almost 90% accepted the offer and completed the registration. The registration rate is similar to the previous year, PolyU said.Job worriesSome students said they are worried that the campus’s reputation as a hotbed of student activism could hamper their hunt for a job. Kate Chan, a 22-year-old business student at PolyU -- which has had one of the best reputations in Hong Kong among employers, according to the QS World University Rankings -- said she has been grilled in job interviews about the protests.“Sometimes, I feel embarrassed in interviews because of my identity,” she said, adding that potential employers had asked whether she had ever supported or joined “riots” on the campus. “Some people are very against university students. They assume what we are doing is damaging society -- devaluing our existence and contribution.”Kelvin Cheng, a mechanical engineering student who is the PolyU student union’s external vice president, said the physical landscape of the campus has become “a prison from students’ perspective.” He added: “The school is inherently an open, public space. What they are doing now violates the values a university is supposed to have.”PolyU’s “Democracy Wall” -- a notice board managed by the student union where messages were freely posted -- has been monitored by university officials since the security law was implemented in June, Cheng said. A year after the protests, he said, “it’s like there is a deep wound, a crack, but the crack could never be erased.”Among materials on the wall censored by the university: A satirical cartoon depicting Chinese President Xi Jinping with his head in the shape of a virus cell, and a note that said “harbor” in a Chinese character, a reference to Hong Kong.Academic freedomAlso worrisome to the university community have been the dismissals of prominent professors in recent months. Chief among them was Benny Tai, an activist and scholar who initiated the 2014 Occupy Central movement -- the precursor to last year’s protests -- who was fired by the University of Hong Kong in July, despite having tenure. HKU did not disclose the reasons for the decision, saying it was “an internal personnel matter.”His termination will have far-reaching effects, Tai said in a Facebook post. “It marks the end of academic freedom in Hong Kong,” Tai said. “Academic staff in education institutions in Hong Kong are no longer free to make controversial statements to the general public about politically or socially controversial matters.”Social work lecturer Shiu Ka-chun, a pro-democracy lawmaker and fellow Occupy Central leader, said he had been unable to renew his contract with Baptist University in July. The university didn’t give a reason, he said in a Facebook post at the time.A spokesman for Baptist University said in an email that the school “follows established policies and procedures in handling all contract matters” and could not disclose details about a specific case, citing privacy reasons.Tai and Shiu had been sentenced to 16 and eight-month jail terms, respectively, for their roles in the 2014 demonstrations. Tai is on bail awaiting appeal after four months in jail, while Shiu has completed his sentence.Lokman Tsui, an assistant professor at Chinese University who studies freedom of expression, said his tenure application was rejected in June, and he thinks his support of the democracy movement was a factor. He is teaching for the 2020-2021 academic year yet must leave after. He worries that such actions have a chilling effect.“There is a pattern that seems to become clear, where more critical, more vocal teaching staff, research staff are either not getting their contacts renewed or not getting tenure,” Tsui said. “It’s problematic that even the perception of that exists, because that’s a strong incentive to practice self-censorship if you are still teaching or researching.”Academic freedom is protected by the Basic Law -- the city’s mini-constitution -- and is a cornerstone of the higher education sector, a spokesperson for the Education Bureau said in an emailed statement. Universities have institutional autonomy on matters such as selection of staff and students, the spokesperson added, and the national security law should not alter that.“The NSL does not affect normal exchange activities between academics or higher education institutions and their foreign or external counterparts,” the spokesman said.Mainland influenceHKU drew criticism in October when it proposed to appoint a pair of mainland Chinese academics as vice presidents. Zuo-Jun Shen, one of the scholars, was reported by online local media outlet Citizen News to be a Communist Party member, which he denied.Thousands of students, staff and alumni signed a petition protesting the decision, saying it would damage the university’s academic freedom. If the school’s administration hired the pair of academics, “it declares the end of the university’s institutional autonomy,” the petition letter reads.They were both appointed.“There is still more academic freedom in Hong Kong than on the mainland,” said Jeffrey Wasserstrom, a professor of history at the University of California, Irvine, and author of “Vigil: Hong Kong on the Brink. “But what was once a chasm is now quickly becoming merely a gap.”There will be more mainland academics coming to Hong Kong, Baehr said. Hong Kong authorities are more comfortable with academics from mainland China than their Western peers, given their link with Chinese rule, he added.Students coming to Hong Kong from the mainland have been affected, too. “I feel like some classmates, especially local, further distance themselves from us. For mainland students, we increasingly avoid discussing issues linked to political controversies in Hong Kong, which are too sensitive,” said Kevin Hau, a Hong Kong University of Science and Technology student from the Chinese province of Fujian.Hau said he feels like he’s being “monitored by both sides: Local students and mainland authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-campus-rocked-by-protest-becomes-prison-a-year-later/story-d75UoIP2xq2pbDR5UK7jcK.html
24-11-2020||World||Pope, for first time, says China’s Uighurs are ‘persecuted’||In a new book, Pope Francis for the first time calls China’s Muslim Uighurs a “persecuted” people, something human rights activists have been urging him to do for years.In the wide-ranging “Let Us Dream: The Path to A Better Future,” Francis also says the Cobvid-19 pandemic should spur governments to consider permanently establishing a universal basic income.In the book, a 150-page collaboration with his English-language biographer, Austen Ivereigh, Francis speaks of economic, social and political changes he says are needed to address inequalities after the pandemic ends. It goes on sale on Dec. 1.He also says people who see wearing masks as an imposition by the state are “victims only in their imagination” and praises those who protested against the death of George Floyd in police custody for rallying around the “healthy indignation” that united them.“I think often of persecuted peoples: the Rohingya, the poor Uighurs, the Yazidi,” he said in a section where he also talks about persecuted Christians in Islamic countries.While the pope has spoken out before about the Rohingya who have fled Myanmar, and the killing of Yazidi by Islamic State in Iraq, it was the first time he mentioned the Uighurs.Faith leaders, activist groups and governments have said crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place against Uighurs in China’s remote Xinjiang region, where more than 1 million people are held in camps.Last month, during a conference at the Vatican, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted China over its treatment of Uighurs.Beijing has rejected the allegations as a attempt to discredit China, saying the camps are vocational education and training centres as part of counter-terrorism and deradicalisation measures.Many commentators have said the Vatican was reluctant to speak out on the Uighurs earlier because it was in the process of renewing a controversial accord with Beijing on the appointment of bishops. The accord, which Pompeo urged the Vatican to abandon, was renewed in September.Francis also gives his clearest support to date in the book to universal basic income (UBI), a controversial policy espoused by some economists and sociologists in which governments give a fixed amount of money to each citizen with no conditions attached. UBI was a cornerstone of the campaign of Andrew Yang last year during the Democratic presidential primaries in the United States.“Recognising the value to society of the work of nonearnersis a vital part of our rethinking in the post-Covid world. That’s why I believe it is time to explore concepts like the universal basic income (UBI) ...” he said.“By providing a universal basic income, we can free and enable people to work for the community in a dignified way,” he said.Francis again criticised trickle-down economics, the theory favoured by conservatives that tax breaks and other incentives for big business and the wealthy eventually will benefit the rest of society through investment and job creation.He called it “the false assumption of the infamous trickle-down theory that a growing economy will make us all richer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-for-first-time-says-china-s-uighurs-are-persecuted/story-B1ZuSAAauvA961UGYL1oJO.html
24-11-2020||World||Millions of Americans expect to lose their homes as Coronavirus rages||Millions of Americans expect to face eviction by the end of this year, adding to the suffering inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic raging across the USAbout 5.8 million adults say they are somewhat to very likely to face eviction or foreclosure in the next two months, according to a survey completed November 9 by the US Census Bureau. That accounts for a third of the 17.8 million adults in households that are behind on rent or mortgage payments.The CARES Act, signed into law last March, allows homeowners to pause mortgage payments for up to a year if they experience hardship as a result of the pandemic. Borrowers who signed up at the start of the program could face foreclosure by March.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s(CDC) nationwide temporary suspension on evictions -- aimed at stemming the spread of coronavirus -- is slated to end December 31. The timing is far from ideal given millions of people are also set to lose their unemployment benefits at year-end without an extension from Congress.Roughly half of households not current on their rent or mortgage payments in Arkansas, Florida, and Nevada think there’s a “strong chance” of eviction by early January. This equates to more than 750,000 homes where an eviction is the biggest worry, according to the survey.By metro area, the threat of eviction is most pressing in New York City, Houston, and Atlanta.Coronavirus, which has killed more than 256,000 Americans so far, is on track to claim another 30,000 lives by mid-December, according to forecasts from the CDC. The model shows weekly cases and deaths both rising every week for the next month, the maximum range of the agency’s projection.President-elect Joe Biden in March expressed his support for rent freezes and eviction moratoriums due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-of-americans-expect-to-lose-their-homes-as-coronavirus-rages/story-fxv0n1eXLRBtWCnIkO28tM.html
24-11-2020||World||Michigan certifies Joe Biden as winner after Donald Trump’s bid to toss results||Michigan’s Board of State Canvassers voted to certify the state’s election results, practically ensuring former Vice President Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump in the state.The vote means that only a possible Republican request for a recount stands in the way of assuring that Biden will win the Wolverine State and its 16 electoral votes. The board didn’t ask for a recount after certifying the results.One of the board’s two Republican canvassers, Aaron Van Langevelde, sided with Democrats to certify the vote 3-0, while Norm Shinkle, the other Republican member, abstained and called on the Michigan legislature to conduct a full audit of the result.Van Langevelde said that he believes that any irregularities should be investigated, but added that the Board of Canvassers is not the entity to do that. “We have a clear legal duty to certify the results of the election as shown by the returns that were given to us,” he said.The Grand Old Party(GOP) canvassers can request an audit or petition for a recount, but it would be tough to see either overturning Biden’s 150,000-vote margin of victory.Also Read| US Election 2020: Where do things stand in key states?Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who has clashed with Trump over her handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, praised the board’s vote. “The people of Michigan have spoken. President-elect Biden won the State of Michigan by more than 154,000 votes, and he will be our next president on January 20th.”“Democracy has prevailed,” said Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in a statement. “Today’s vote of the State Board of Canvassers to certify Michigan’s November election confirms the truth: the election was fair and secure, and the results accurately reflect the will of the voters.”As in other swing states, including Pennsylvania and Georgia, Michigan Republicans have been challenging the vote since Election Day, arguing that there were “irregularities” or out-and-out fraud that muddy the results. In Michigan, the argument was especially tense in Wayne County, home of Detroit and predominantly Black, where Biden won by a large margin.Republican canvassers have been under pressure from the Republican National Committee, which on Saturday asked them not to certify the votes until there is a “full transparent audit” in Wayne County.The fight in the county centered on the fact that 70% of the precincts were out of balance, which typically means there were clerical errors, said Mark Brewer, a Michigan attorney who works with the Democratic Party on voting issues.Those precincts had from one to four votes that were unaccounted for, meaning that the entire fight is over about 450 votes in a county where 862,000 people cast ballots. Biden had a 332,000-vote advantage there.The Trump campaign had filed a lawsuit in Michigan but withdrew it when Wayne County canvassers initially voted against certification.On Friday, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and House Speaker Lee Chatfield, both Republicans, said they had “not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan.”The pair issued a joint statement after meeting at the White House with Trump amid the president’s effort to overturn the state’s vote for Biden. “We will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan’s electors,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/michigan-certifies-joe-biden-as-winner-after-donald-trump-s-bid-to-toss-results/story-L1ua6skKwj4vqnkuZqAhdK.html

The drug, called REGN-COV2, received clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in adults and some children of at least 12 years of age.Earlier this year, Regeneron agreed to a $450 million supply deal with Operation Warp Speed, the US program to accelerate the development of vaccines and treatments for Covid-19. The treatment was given to President Donald Trump last month after he contracted the virus.Regeneron said on Saturday it expects to have treatment doses of its drug ready for approximately 80,000 patients by the end of this month, about 200,000 patients by the first week of January, and about 300,000 patients total by the end of January.Patients will require a positive Covid-19 test and a prescription from their physician, government officials said at a Monday briefing. For those who lack a physician, some emergency departments will prescribe it.Sites are also being set up for the medication, which is given as an infusion, including a convention center in Baltimore, Maryland, said Janet Woodcock, director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the FDA.Shares of Regeneron were up 0.5% at $521.09 at 2:53 p.m. on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/regeneron-covid-19-drug-to-roll-out-in-30-000-dose-shipment/story-dbhAylvfejna1caxKuWQOP.html
24-11-2020||World||China launches robotic spacecraft to retrieve rocks from the moon||China on Tuesday launched a robotic spacecraft to bring back rocks from the moon in the first bid by any country to retrieve samples from the lunar surface since the 1970s, a mission that underscores Chinese ambitions in space.The Long March-5, China’s largest carrier rocket, blasted off at 4:30 am Beijing time (2030 GMT on Monday) in a pre-dawn launch from Wenchang Space Launch Center on the southern Chinese island of Hainan carrying the Chang’e-5 spacecraft. The Chang’e-5 mission, named after the ancient Chinese goddess of the moon, will seek to collect lunar material to help scientists understand more about the moon’s origins and formation. The mission will test China’s ability to remotely acquire samples from space, ahead of more complex missions.State broadcaster CCTV, which ran live coverage of the launch, showed images of China National Space Administration staff in blue uniforms applauding and cheering as they watched the spacecraft climbing through the atmosphere, lighting up the night sky. If successful, the mission would make China only the third country to have retrieved lunar samples, joining the United States and the Soviet Union.Upon entering the moon’s orbit, the spacecraft is intended to deploy a pair of vehicles to the lunar surface: a lander and an ascender. The landing is due to take place in about eight days, according to Pei Zhaoyu, a spokesman for the mission. The probe is due to be on the lunar surface for about two days, while the entire mission is scheduled to take around 23 days. The plan is for the lander to drill into the lunar surface, with a robotic arm scooping out soil and rocks. This material would be transferred to the ascender vehicle, which is due to carry it from the surface and then dock with an orbiting module.The samples then would be transferred to a return capsule for the return trip to Earth, with a landing in China’s Inner Mongolia region.“The biggest challenges ... are the sampling work on the lunar surface, take-off from the lunar surface, rendezvous and docking in the lunar orbit, as well as high-speed re-entry to Earth,” said Pei, also director of the space administration’s Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center.“We can conduct sampling through circumlunar and moon- landing exploration, but it is more intuitive to obtain samples to conduct scientific research - the method is more direct,” Pei added. “Plus, there will be more instruments and more methods to study them on Earth.”China, which last year carried out the first landing on the far side of the moon and in July of this year launched a robotic probe to Mars, has other space goals in its sights. It aims to have a permanent manned space station in service around 2022.“From next year, we will carry out the launch mission of our national space station,” said Qu Yiguang, deputy commander of the Long March-5 carrier rocket. Asked when China was planning to put astronauts on the moon, Pei said any decision would be based on scientific needs, as well as technical and economic conditions, adding: “I think future lunar exploration activities should be carried out by a combination of man and machine.”Matt Siegler, a research scientist at the Arizona-based Planetary Science Institute who is not part of Chang’e-5 mission, said the Mons Rumker volcanic area of the moon where the spacecraft is due to land is 1-2 billion years old.“That is very young for the moon - most of our samples are 3.5 billion years old or more,” Siegler said in an email, noting that the area and other similar ones represented “late-stage volcanism” when the moon had enough internal heat for such activity.“We want to find out what is special about these regions and why they remained warm longer than the rest of the moon,” Siegler added. The United States, which currently has plans to return astronauts to the moon by 2024, landed 12 astronauts there in its Apollo programme over six flights from 1969 to 1972, and brought back 382 kg (842 pounds) of rocks and soil. The Soviet Union deployed three successful robotic lunar sample-return missions in the 1970s. The last, the Luna 24, retrieved about 170 grams (6 ounces) of samples in 1976 from a region called Mare Crisium.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-robotic-spacecraft-to-retrieve-rocks-from-the-moon/story-dnlRLTGtCpZGZVw8buoZiJ.html
24-11-2020||World||Joe Biden taps ex-Fed chair Janet Yellen to lead treasury||President-elect Joe Biden has chosen former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to serve as treasury secretary, a pivotal role in which she would help shape and direct his economic policies at a perilous time, according to a person familiar with the transition plans.Yellen, who is widely admired in the financial world, would be the first woman to lead the Treasury Department in a line stretching back to Alexander Hamilton in 1789. Her nomination was confirmed to The Associated Press by a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss Biden’s plans.If confirmed as treasury secretary, Yellen would inherit a shaky U.S. economy, weakened by the pandemic recession and now in the grip of a surging viral epidemic that is intensifying pressure on businesses and individuals. Concern is rising that the economy could slide into a “double-dip” recession this winter as states and cities reimpose restrictions on businesses and consumers stay home to avoid contracting the disease.Also Read | Ex-Homeland security official Alejandro Mayorkas returns under Joe BidenA path-breaking figure in the male-dominated economics field, Yellen, 74, was also the first woman to serve as Fed chair, from 2014 to 2018. She later became an adviser to Biden’s presidential campaign in an unusual departure for a former Fed leader.The treasury post would add another new chapter to Yellen’s varied career in financial policymaking. She would represent the administration in global financial affairs and lead a sprawling department whose responsibilities range from the government’s finances and tax collections to global currency markets, bank regulation and the printing of money.Yellen would also take on the formidable task of helping negotiate economic policy with Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who will remain Senate majority leader if his party wins at least one of two Senate runoff elections in Georgia in early January. Those talks would likely focus most urgently on a new stimulus package that most economists say is vital to sustaining an economic recovery.Also Read | Joe Biden to name Antony Blinken as US secretary of stateJaret Seiberg, a banking industry analyst at Cowen, described Yellen as a “pragmatist” who would likely pursue a relatively moderate path on banking regulation. Stock markets, which had already risen Monday, rose further after news leaked of her selection.Yellen enjoys a close working relationship with Jerome Powell, who succeeded her as Fed chair, something that would likely improve coordination between the Fed and Treasury and perhaps result in additional support for the economy. Powell and the current treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, last week publicly disagreed over Mnuchin’s decision to cancel several Fed emergency lending programs at the end of this month.Yellen has consistently favored further stimulus spending for the economy, including for state and local governments, which she has said need “substantial support” to avoid further job cuts. Such rescue aid has been a key sticking point in congressional negotiations on stimulus, with McConnell resisting the larger amounts sought by Democrats.Before leading the Fed, Yellen was its vice chair for four years and previously was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for six years. Earlier, under President Bill Clinton, she led the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, after serving a stint on the Fed’s board.Yellen is well-known on Capitol Hill after years of testifying as Fed chair to Senate committees about the economy and interest rate policy. During those years, she frequently clashed with Republican lawmakers who accused her of keeping rates too low for too long after the 2008 financial crisis. Some of them charged that Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, had elevated the risk of runaway inflation and asset bubbles that could destabilize financial markets.None of those fears came to pass. On the contrary, under Bernanke and Yellen — and later, under Powell — the Fed’s more difficult challenge became raising inflation merely to the Fed’s annual 2% target level. It has yet to do so consistently.Yellen, a Democrat, had served only one four-year term as Fed chair when President Donald Trump decided to replace her with Powell, a Republican. That move broke a four-decade tradition of presidents allowing Fed chairs to serve at least two terms even if they had first been nominated by a president of the opposing party.Biden had said last week that his choice for treasury secretary would be “someone who I think will be accepted by all elements of the Democratic Party, progressives through the moderate coalition.”Yellen won the support of many progressive groups during the search process, said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a left-leaning organization, in part because she has endorsed a carbon tax as a way to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.She is also an expert on unemployment and wages. Under her fenure, the central bank began shifting much of its policy focus from fighting inflation, which has been quiescent for decades, to trying to maximize employment, the second of its two congressional mandates. Yellen won praise for her attention to disadvantaged groups including the long-term unemployed. She made numerous visits to employment training centers to spotlight the need for training programs to equip people for good jobs..When she stepped down from the Fed in early 2018, Shawn Sebastian, co-director of the Fed-Up coalition, a collection of progressive groups, called Yellen’s departure “a loss for working people across the country.” He hailed her efforts to take on “economic inequality, racial disparities in the economy, the role of women in the workplace and the need for more diversity at the Fed.”Yet some progressives have also criticized Yellen for the Fed’s December 2015 decision to raise its benchmark rate from near zero, where it had been pegged since late 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis. That rate hike, which caused a sharp increase in the value of the dollar, contributed to a slowdown in U.S. economic growth in 2016 and is now seen by many economists as having been premature.After leaving the Fed, Yellen became a distinguished fellow in residence at the liberal Brookings Institution in Washington. She did not initially comment about Trump’s decision not to offer her a second term. But in a 2019 interview, Yellen said she didn’t think Trump had a firm grasp of economic policy “or even knows the Federal Reserve’s mandates” to stabilize prices and maximize employment.Yellen is married to George Akerlof, a Nobel Prize-winning economist whom she met in a Fed cafeteria in 1977. They have one son, Robert, who is an economics professor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-taps-ex-fed-chair-janet-yellen-to-lead-treasury/story-5LKC70t7Xi1sXrKWEwjgPK.html

24-11-2020||World||Hong Kong activists including Joshua Wong in custody after guilty protest plea||Three young Hong Kong dissidents including Joshua Wong were remanded into custody on Monday after pleading guilty to inciting a rally during last year’s pro-democracy protests, deepening the crackdown against Beijing’s critics.Hong Kong was convulsed by seven straight months of huge and often violent democracy rallies last year in which millions took to the streets.Beijing has refused demands for free elections and authorities have pursued democracy supporters with criminal cases and a sweeping new national security law. Wong, 24, was prosecuted alongside fellow activists Ivan Lam and Agnes Chow over a protest which took place last summer outside the city police headquarters.“We will continue to fight for freedom -- and now is not the time for us to kowtow to Beijing and surrender,” Wong told reporters on his way to court. ‘Add oil!’Once inside Wong pleaded guilty to inciting and organising an illegal assembly. Lam pleaded guilty to incitement while Chow, 23, admitted inciting and joining the protest.All three were remanded into custody pending sentencing on December 2, meaning a jail term is all but guaranteed.The maximum sentence a magistrate’s court can hand down is three years. “Everyone hang in there. I know it’s tougher for you to remain out there,” Wong shouted inside court. Small groups of supporters surrounded their prison van as they were driven away shouting “Add oil!” and “No rioters, only tyranny!”Add oil is a popular phrase of encouragement in Cantonese while authorities dismissed both peaceful and violent protesters alike last year as rioters.Wong and Lam were later filmed leaving a police van, handcuffed together, and entering a detention facility.‘Mentally prepared’Despite his youth, Wong has already spent time in prison for leading democracy protests and told reporters that he was ready to return. “Emotionally I am reluctant in every way to be jailed but rationally I have absolutely no space to complain in comparison with many others,” he said outside court, in a reference to the hundreds of protest-linked prosecutions already concluded.Chow appeared less self-assured. “If sentenced, this will be my first time in prison,” she wrote in a Facebook post on Sunday. “While I say I have mentally prepared for this, I am still a bit scared.”Wong became an activist when he was in his early teens, organising successful rallies in 2012 against plans to make Hong Kong’s education system more “patriotic” and similar to the mainland. In 2014 he and Chow helped inspire and lead the “Umbrella Movement” -- a 79-day peaceful occupation of three busy intersections by a largely student-led campaign calling for universal suffrage.Wong was jailed for his involvement in those protests, alongside most of that movement’s main leaders.He was still in jail when last year’s much larger democracy protests kicked off, though he made appearances at numerous rallies after his release.However the protests were deliberately leaderless, mostly organised by social media and encrypted chat forums.They were also much more violent. Riot police unleashed thousands of rounds of tear gas and rubber bullets and were frequently filmed using batons to beat arrested demonstrators. Their headquarters was besieged on multiple occasions with crowds hurling eggs and daubing its walls with graffiti.Small groups of hardline activists resorted to rocks, petrol bombs and even bows and arrows.More than 10,000 people were arrested and most of Hong Kong’s leading activists and opposition figures now face prosecution.Arrests and gatherings bannedThe demonstrations petered out at the start of the year thanks to fatigue, mass arrests and the emergence of the coronavirus.An anti-pandemic ban on more than four people gathering in public has remained in place for most of this year.Beijing has also imposed a broad security law which ramps up its direct control over the semi-autonomous city and outlaws certain political views.Demosisto, the pro-democracy party that Wong, Lam and Chow were in, disbanded when the security law came in because their desire for greater self-determination was now illegal.Pro-democracy lawmakers have also been disqualified and local legislature elections delayed for a year.Authorities say they have returned much-needed stability to the global trade hub.Critics counter that opposition to Beijing’s rule remains widespread despite the lack of street protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activists-including-joshua-wong-in-custody-after-guilty-protest-plea/story-PqUiZ3RLeNNRzrmzsYWJLP.html
24-11-2020||World||Joe Biden to name Antony Blinken as US secretary of state||US President-elect Joe Biden will name Antony Blinken - a long-time national security and foreign policy expert who is enthusiastic about ties with India and sees China as a “common challenge” - as his secretary of state on Tuesday, according to an announcement by his transition team.Biden will also name other members of his national security team: Alejandro Mayorkas as secretary of the department of homeland security who is the first Latino to be named to this position; Linda Thomas-Greenfield as UN ambassador; former secretary of state John Kerry as special presidential envoy for climate who will sit on the National Security Council; Avril Haines as director of National Intelligence who will be the first woman to lead the US intelligence community; and Jake Sullivan.“We have no time to lose when it comes to our national security and foreign policy. I need a team ready on day one to help me reclaim America’s seat at the head of the table, rally the world to meet the biggest challenges we face, and advance our security, prosperity and values,” Biden said in a statement, announcing these names. “This is the crux of that team. These individuals are equally as experienced and crisis-tested as they are innovative and imaginative. Their accomplishments in diplomacy are unmatched, but they also reflect the idea that we cannot meet the profound challenges of this new moment with old thinking and unchanged habits - or without diversity of background and perspective. It’s why I’ve selected them,” Biden added.Vice-president-elect Kamala Harris said, “These crisis-tested national security and foreign policy leaders have the knowledge and expertise to keep our country safe, and restore and advance America’s leadership around the world. They represent the best of America.”Blinken, who served as deputy secretary of state in the Obama-Biden administration, has been a front-runner for the position of Biden’s top diplomat. He was also the Biden campaign’s chief foreign policy official.In an outreach to the Indian-American community in the run-up to the election, Blinken had described China as a “common challenge”, taking into cognizance China’s “aggression” towards India at the Line of Actual Control.Speaking generally on ties with India, he had said, “We will be an advocate for India to play a leading role in international institutions, and that includes helping India get a seat on a reformed United Nations Security Council. We will work together to strengthen India’s defence.”Blinken had gone on to reiterate long-running US commitment to combating terrorism, making common cause with India. “We have no tolerance for terrorism in South Asia or anywhere else, cross-border or otherwise,” Blinken had said, adding, “We used every tool at our disposal to make sure that our citizens, and the citizens of our partners, are safe. And that’s something we will build on in a Biden administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-name-antony-blinken-as-us-secretary-of-state/story-VcSdAiW9xBAEyiQaaHAprI.html
24-11-2020||World||Joe Biden’s likely secretary of state pick Antony Blinken sees China as a ‘common challenge’ for India, US||US President-elect Joe Biden is expected to appoint Antony Blinken, a long-time national security and foreign policy expert who has been enthusiastic about ties with India and called China a “common challenge”, as his secretary of state, US media has reported.Blinken, who served as deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration, had been a front-runner for the position of Biden’s top diplomat. He was also the Biden campaign’s chief foreign policy official.In an outreach to the Indian-American community in the run-up to the election - on August 15, to commemorate the Indian Independence Day - Blinken described China as a “common challenge”, taking into cognizance China’s “aggression” towards India at the Line of Actual Control.Speaking generally of ties with India, he had said, “We will be an advocate for India to play a leading role in international institutions and that includes helping India get a seat on… United Nations Security Council. We will work together to strengthen India’s defence.”Blinken had gone on to reiterate long-running US commitment to combating terrorism, making common cause with India. “We have no tolerance for terrorism in South Asia or anywhere else, cross-border or otherwise,” Blinken had said, adding, “We used every tool at our disposal to make sure that our citizens and the citizens of our partners are safe. And that’s something we will build on in a Biden administration.”Outgoing President Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his defeat to Biden continued in the meantime. His campaign has challenged the dismissal of a lawsuit last weekend and removed a member of the legal team, Sidney Powell, who had made wild claims about election fraud and levelled corruption charges against Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, a state that Trump lost in the 2020 contest.Michigan board of canvassers is scheduled to vote on Monday to certify Biden’s victory by more than 154,000 votes. Its two Republican members can deadlock the four-member body by asking for a delay to audit the result, which could result in litigation or delays.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-likely-secretary-of-state-pick-antony-blinken-sees-china-as-a-common-challenge-for-india-us/story-vTdGrWqlx9lVKFTrjLpgQK.html
