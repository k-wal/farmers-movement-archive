13-11-2020||Gurugram||Children’s Day celebrations go virtual||Students and teachers across city schools celebrated Children’s Day this year virtually due to the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. From dance preparations to plays, a plethora of activities was live-streamed by teachers for students on Friday — a day before Children’s Day on Saturday, November 14. City schools decided to hold early celebrations this year as the day coincides with Diwali, when all schools are shut. Routinely, schools celebrate Children’s Day with functions, where teachers present skits and ensemble performances or take students on outings. This year, however, teachers tried to replicate the activities virtually. Schools across the country closed in March in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, following which most institutes decided to take the online route for imparting lessons. Both classes and celebration of important days, such as Teachers’ Day and Children’s Day, have gone online since then. Last year, schools had to call off Children’s Day celebrations after they were asked to shut down on account of air pollution and heavy smog. This year, schools decided to mark the day virtually through online activities such as plays, special assemblies and interactive sessions with teachers. Teachers said that while virtual celebrations seemed odd until last year, rising environmental and health concerns had compelled them to embrace virtual celebrations. Anshu Arora, school principal, Amity International School, Sector 43, said that Covid-19 had caused a big change in the ways of engaging with students, who, in turn, are also getting used to virtual festivities. “We may not be in the same physical space but are connected digitally. In fact, this was a more one-on-one experience. Students were also appreciating the creativity of the teachers amid the changed circumstances,” said Arora. She added that it had been nine months into the pandemic and virtual celebrations have helped to motivate children who have been missing school. The school organised a digital celebration for Children’s Day spread over two days. “My teachers and I recorded videos for the whole school. Besides the videos, teachers of different grades came online and regaled students with different activities. They sang songs, poems and skits. It was a vibrant experience,” said Arora. At Kunskapsskolan International, teachers organised virtual parties for students for younger grades that saw the participation from parents, while senior students took part in online games and quizzes. “For younger students, we had a game party. Even the parents were involved in such celebrations. For grades 2 and above, teachers had planned other activities such as quizzes,” said Ramanjit Khinda, school headmistress. Yash Handa, a student at KR Mangalam World School, South City-1, said that while the nature of celebrations had changed due to pandemic restrictions, online platforms were used by teachers to make the day special for students. “This year, we marked Children’s Day virtually. Our teachers prepared videos, one-act plays, interactive sessions that were shared with us online. It’s definitely not the same as regular celebrations but our teachers went out of their way to use technology and do the best they could in the times of pandemic,” said Handa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/children-s-day-celebrations-go-virtual/story-U7ettcHOkacjaOLqDPhFlN.html
13-11-2020||Gurugram||Realtors hopeful tax rebate on circle rate differential will revive market||Developers and real estate experts in Gurugram said on Friday the union finance ministry’s decision not to impose additional tax liability on buyers and sellers where the differential between market price and circle rate is up to 20% will help in reviving the realty sector. The developers said this decision will help in making houses cheaper, reduce registration charges and help buyers in under-construction projects as GST will also get reduced. The move is likely to boost market sentiment as till now, buyers and sellers had to pay an income tax penalty if the difference in market and circle rates is more than 10% due to which there was reluctance to transact in property. Circle rate is the rate at which property transaction is registered by the revenue department. It is fixed by the state government. Realtors said not only in Gurugram but in many markets across the country, the market value of property had gone down almost 20 to 30% and there was reluctance to transact in real estate because of the income tax for a property differential over 10%. Under the new regime, there will be no penalty if price differential is up to 20% for properties up to Rs 2 crore. “The differential of up to 20% in collector rate and market rate allowed for primary residential transactions of up to Rs 2 crore without income tax penalty will make home buying more attractive. Developers will be able to liquidate their unsold inventory at up to 20% below circle rate. Home buyers will enjoy triple benefit of reduced property price, lower GST and less registration charges,” said Vinod Behl, a city-based real estate expert.Realtors said property prices are stagnant in the city and across India and developers were working on thin margins due to which there was no flexibility regarding price. “The decision will allow us to reduce prices or offer tax benefits to buyers, which earlier was not possible. The announcements regarding price differential or funding boost for real estate sector will help in reviving realty,” said Pravin Jain, chairman, Naredco, Haryana. Prashant Solomon, managing director, Chintels, and spokesperson, CREDAI, NCR, said they have been asking the government to increase the permissible difference between market price and circle rate for quite long. “This move will help reduce the inventory lying with builders without any liability and reduce the pressure on home buyers,” he said. Rajat Goel, joint managing director, MRG Developers, said tax relief on residential units priced up to Rs 2 crore is a great step as most of the housing units fall under this price category. “Owing to this, homebuyers will surely be able to take a decision of purchasing their own house,” said Goel.Overall, the stakeholders were of the opinion that the realty market in the city could see a revival in the next six months as more end-users could enter the market to buy houses enthused by this announcement .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/realtors-hopeful-tax-rebate-on-circle-rate-differential-will-revive-market/story-ERPeJmPltSlVE6e7SRitXL.html
13-11-2020||Gurugram||Health department told to increase ICU beds for Covid patients||Keeping in mind the consistent upward trend of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram and fast occupancy of hospital beds, the district health department has been told to urgently increase intensive care unit beds (ICU) reserved for coronavirus patients. The department will prepare a micro-plan to tackle the current Covid-19 situation as directed by Niti Aayog on Friday in a meeting held with officials of the Delhi-NCR region regarding a record spike in Covid-19 cases. On Friday, Gurugram recorded 797 new infections, taking the tally to 38,368. Out of these, 6,219 are active cases currently in home isolation or in hospital. At least 31,910 people have recovered and 239 have succumbed to the illness, with three deaths in the last 24 hours. With cases growing at a weekly positivity rate (the percentage of positives out of the total samples tested in a day) of nearly 18%, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus has accelerated. The hospitalisation data shows that on Friday, 744 beds out of 1,975 reserved for Covid-19 patients in different hospitals were occupied, including 408 patients from Gurugram and the remaining from Delhi, parts of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and other states. Data also shows 70% of the allocated intensive care unit beds (260) were also occupied. “Niti Aayog has suggested a set of urgent actions to be taken, including immediate increase of ICU and overall beds. The decision will be taken after Diwali, with a notification likely to be issued next week on increased bed capacity,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, who attended the meeting along with other district administration officials. Yadav did not mention the increase in reserved bed capacity. Currently, it is 35% in 42 hospitals. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, said, “The decision will be taken as per the local needs. Since the numbers vary across districts, there is no blanket order as of now.” The district health department will work on the micro strategy to focus on other urgent steps such as strengthening surveillance of home-isolated patients. “Even asymptomatic or those with mild symptoms have to follow strict isolation measures to prevent entire family from getting positive. The plan is to enforce strict quarantine of contacts, increase testing, mobilising doctors and nurses and enforcement of standard operating procedures in containment zones,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-told-to-increase-icu-beds-for-covid-patients/story-I54VlPo4NARvJX96ktxz2J.html
13-11-2020||Gurugram||Man arrested from Chennai for murdering live-in partner||Four days after a woman’s partially decomposed body was recovered from a house in Sector 5, the police arrested her live-in-partner from Chennai on Friday. He was taken on police remand after being produced before the district court, said the police. According to the police, they had received a call on November 10 about a woman’s decomposed body lying in a house in Ashok Vihar in Sector 5. The police said the woman was identified as Nancy (35). Her live-in partner was found to be missing and, despite repeated attempts, he could not be contacted. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the house from where the body was recovered belonged to an officer of Haryana Police, who had given it on rent. “The first floor of the house was rented out to a couple who used to run a street food stall in the area. They had introduced themselves as husband and wife. It was found during investigation that they were not married and had met four years ago through a common friend,” he said. On the morning of November 10, the house owner visited the building and found that the main gate was locked. He called the tenants on the phone but neither of them answered. After waiting for half an hour, he jumped across the gate and informed the police when he noticed foul smell emanating from the building. Sukhpal Singh, the owner, said that he informed the police control room and the Sector 5 police station regarding the foul smell and waited for them to arrive. Sangwan said a team of officials reached the building, broke open the door and found a woman lying dead on a bed. “Forensic experts, dog squad, and finger print experts were called on to the spot. A crime team also visited the spot and started investigation,” he said. The body was sent for post-mortem investigation and the autopsy revealed that she had been strangulated to death, said the police. The police said they suspected the live-in-partner as he was the only one who was missing and had switched off his mobile phone possibly to evade arrest. Sangwan said, based on technical surveillance, the police traced the location of the accused in Chennai and a team was sent to nab him. “After killing his partner, he went to New Delhi railway station and boarded a train for Chennai. His friends lived there. He too used to work there earlier. As such, he contacted them and asked them for possible job opportunities,” he said. The police said the suspect was identified as Bharat Thapa of Nepal, who lived in Gurugram for the last two years and had set up a stall with the deceased in Sector 5 area. They used to sell momos. During the investigation, it was revealed that the couple often landed in a tiff and were often spotted abusing and fighting with each other. On the day of the incident, they had an argument over some issues and the accused strangulated her to death. Fearing arrest, he locked the gate from outside and went to Delhi to board a train to Chennai, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-arrested-from-chennai-for-murdering-live-in-partner/story-kvI7nOCDE3MD4NJckT80eP.html
13-11-2020||Gurugram||City air deteriorates to ‘very poor’, likely to worsen over the weekend||Air quality in the city deteriorated on Friday, clocking in a “very poor” reading of 334 (up from Thursday’s “poor” reading of 293) on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin. Pollution levels are expected to rise over the weekend and may improve after the passage of a western disturbance, causing rain over parts of north India after November 15, as per official forecast. After a recent spate of “severe” air, pollution levels in Gurugram improved considerably over Tuesday and Wednesday. “This was thanks to easterly winds of up to 12kmph, which helped disperse some of the pollutants. However, these gains were lost on Friday, when winds started blowing from the west once again, at a slower pace, about 6 to 8kmph,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist. Experts also said that air quality is predicted to deteriorate from Diwali night on November 14. Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said, “With this change in wind direction and velocity, more pollutants will accumulate over Delhi-NCR. However, we may also witness a spell of rain after November 15, which will improve conditions.” Around this time, temperature is also expected to reduce by at least 4°C as a result of the rain, he added.The level of ultrafine particulate matter, PM2.5 — the city’s primary pollutant — was 316ug/3 on Friday, up from 241.12 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Thursday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. A similar increase in concentration was observed across all four air quality monitoring stations in Gurugram, with Sector 51 remaining the most polluted, with an average 24 PM2.5 reading of 351ug/m3. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, “The air quality is likely to deteriorate and remain in upper end of very poor to severe category on 14.11.2020. The air quality is likely to improve and remain in severe to very poor on 15.11.2020. The significant improvement in air quality is likely from 16.11.2020 under the influence of a Western Disturbance.” As per the CPCB’s central control room for air quality management, Gurugram is expected to clock in an AQI between 330 and 360 (very poor) over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-air-deteriorates-to-very-poor-likely-to-worsen-over-the-weekend/story-klv7gqFJD5ZA2E9eiJSJZM.html
13-11-2020||Gurugram||Real estate developers asked to expedite transfer of land for EWS projects||The department of town and country planning(DTCP) has issued directions to 26 developers in the city, asking them to explain the status of transfer of land for economically weaker section (EWS) housing projects to the state housing board, so that these can be developed and apartments allotted to the applicants. The department issued the directions after a review of the existing EWS projects. The department observed that only a handful of developers had handed over the EWS project land to the state housing board so far. As per the rules, developers are required to transfer the land meant for EWS projects to the housing board within six months after getting environmental clearance for their realty projects. While the transfer of project takes place through DTCP, the developers have to arrange for water, power, roads, sewage and other basic infrastructure before handing over the project land to the DTCP. Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, said that 26 developers have been issued notices to explain the status of their EWS projects in the next 15 days. “The EWS projects are important as a large number of people under this category want basic housing. Many of these projects are delayed because land has not been transferred. Therefore, land needs to be handed over at the earliest,” said Mann. The completion of EWS housing projects is important because the state government has planned to auction houses for EWS category across the state, said officials. On Thursday, the Haryana government also announced the e-auction of 579 flats in Panchkula, Hisar, Gurugram, and Faridabad on November 18, 2020, in a bid to implement chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s vision of providing houses to all the people in the state. After this, 7,312 flats will be e-auctioned for EWS / BPL category people, followed by the auctioning of 84 commercial sites.Anshaj Singh, chief administrator, Housing Board of Haryana, said that the board will be e-auctioning flats constructed by the housing boards of Ambala, Hisar, Faridabad, Panchkula, Sirsa, Sonipat, Gurugram, Bahadurgarh, Nagal Sothian (Himshikha), Matlauda, Bhiwani, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Kaithal, Rewari, and Dharuhera. He said that detailed information about the auctions is available on the board’s website.He further said that the registration for the flats meant to be e-auctioned on November 18, 2020 has started from October 1, 2020 and will continue till 4pm on November 17, 2020. A registration fee of ₹1,000 will be charged from applicants of the general category while the registration for EWS/BPL category will be waived off, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/real-estate-developers-asked-to-expedite-transfer-of-land-for-ews-projects/story-eOf6Nqb4pmZFYFiRMcEy2N.html
13-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra farmers to write letters to PM Modi over import, export policies||Farmers of more than 23 districts in the state will write letters to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi to protest against the central government policies over the import and export policies of the agriculture produce. The farmers will post the letters by resorting to the street in processions at tehsil level on November 16.Farmers outfit All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), which has organised the protest, said thousands of farmers from across the state will write letters to the PM.The organisation has said that the central government has, on one hand imposed an export ban, and on the other has been importing agriculture produce in large quantities. The organisation, affiliated to left parties, has said that the policies have been crippling the farmers and agriculture sector.“After onion was excluded from the list of the essential goods recently, the export was banned and import was opened up by relaxing fumigation, quarantine protocol of Covid-19 pandemic. Over 60,000 tonnes of onions were imported, of which 25,000 tonnes arrived before Diwali. The procedure of the import of 10 lakh tonnes of potatoes under TRQ (tariff rate quota) has begun by reducing import duty up to 10%. Around 30,000-tonne potatoes are being imported from Bhutan. The agreement with Mozambique for the import of 2 lakh tonnes of tur per year has been given an extension, while a proposal is ready for the import of 2.5 lakh tonnes of udad from Myanmar. This has been resulting in the fall in the procurement prices of the agriculture produce in the country hitting the farmers very badly,” the statement issued by AIKS stated.Ajit Nawale, state general secretary of AIKS, said that the Modi government was safeguarding the interest of the industrialists with its anti-farmer policies. “While passing the three farm laws in September, the central government boasted about its efforts to set farmers free from the clutches of the middlemen and have been talking about doubling farmers income. But in reality, the central policies are ruining the farmers and agriculture. Now they have proposed a bill to bring electricity charges for farmers as par with that of the industrialists. These are nothing but the attempts of crushing the farmers. The government is not giving any assurance about the minimum support price and at the same time its import and export policies result in the drastic fall in the procurement prices,” Nawale said.District units of the AIKS have organised to avail postcards for the farmers to make sure that the farmers were able to write a letter to the PM. “At least 45,000 letters will be posted on November 16. There would be other demands related to the laws, use of technology, policies related to the eco-sensitive zones and transfer of land to the tillers, will be raised in ‘letter to PM’. We know that it hardly matters to the PM, but we want to bring awareness among the farmers about the policies that are directly hurting their interests,” said Nawale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-farmers-to-write-letters-to-pm-modi-over-import-export-policies/story-67IJwdpJKZYUq3iBxtsNUK.html
13-11-2020||Gurugram||World Diabetes Day: Almost half of Covid deaths suffered from diabetes in Haryana||On World Diabetes Day, which falls on November 14, data from Haryana’s Covid-19 bulletins are telling -- almost 48% of the 1,900 people who died had diabetes as a co-morbidity factor, and about 1 in 8 of those who died had only diabetes.Diabetes can be categorised into type-1 (occurs when there is insufficient production of insulin, which controls blood sugar) and type-2 (inefficient processing of insulin). It is considered to be a lifestyle disease that is caused by, among other things, lack of exercise. “Apart from these people suffering from these two, there are also those who do not yet know that they have the disease. Covid-19 shows severe symptoms in all three ,” said Dr. Atul Luthra, additional director, diabetes and endocrinology, Fortis Hospital, Gurugram. “Several studies done in the last six months to evaluate effects of the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) on diabetic patients show that it has an adverse outcome. There is a higher chance of hospitalisation, intensive care requirement and multi-organ failure. Those having uncontrolled diabetes are largely at risk considering the high mortality.” According to Luthra, although proper medication can help a diabetic Covid-19 patient to recover just like any other patient, they would require higher dose of medicines after treatment to keep complications at bay.“Despite the rising burden of diabetes, awareness about risk factors, timely disease detection and effective management remains low. Lack of routine check-ups and inadequate understanding of symptoms implies that many people keep living with the undetected disease for years,” said Dr Shankar Narang, COO, Paras Healthcare. “A cross-sectional study conducted jointly by several organizations including the Public Health Foundation of India in 2019 estimated that almost 47% of Indians with diabetes do not know they have the condition. This makes it almost half the total diabetic population. This highly dangerous situation.”The key factors that increase fatality among Covid-19 patients with diabetes are defects in T-cell immunity, baseline high levels of cytokines and comorbidities such as obesity, coronary heart disease, hypertension and chronic kidney disease, among others.Dr. Yatin Mehta, chairman, Institute of Critical Care, Medanta Hospital, who has published a paper on Covid-19 causing complications in case of pre-existing diabetes, said that due to coronavirus disease, sugar level can go out of control even in patients having undiagnosed diabetes. “It leads to something we call diabetic ketoacidosis, a severe form of diabetes. Our study found it in a significant number of Covid-19 patients. Therefore, chances of mortality are always higher,” said Mehta. “Covid-19 can also lead to pancreatitis which can possibly make a patient diabetic even if he/she is not diabetic before the infection. It can happen on its own.”Doctors advice people to maintain a healthy lifestyle, daily exercise and proper medication to keep the disease in check.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/world-diabetes-day-almost-half-of-covid-deaths-suffered-from-diabetes-in-haryana/story-q4zxQ2xInj6ezz1i4yd07L.html
13-11-2020||Gurugram||Police crackdown on cracker sale, 360 kg recovered after multiple raids||Twenty people from different places in Gurugram were arrested for allegedly selling crackers despite the ban on sale and bursting of crackers of any kind in the city, said police on Friday. City police commissioner KK Rao said that they have alerted their informers and deployed police personnel in plainclothes across the city in a massive crackdown on cracker sale. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) earlier this month had ordered zero tolerance on such activities this month in the national capital region (NCR) in view of the deteriorating air quality.“We had prepared a list of shopkeepers who used to sell crackers and were history sheeters. Our teams are deployed at all suspected locations and are keeping an eye on the same and bursting crackers including residential areas. Although it is the festive season, violators will not be spared,” said Rao. He said the station house officers of 40 police stations have contacted the resident welfare association members and shopkeepers to ensure no illegal activity is carried out in their area. Police arrested shopkeepers from Sector 40, Sector 10, Sector 56, Sohna Road, Pataudi, Sohna , Badshahpur, Golf Course Road and Sadar market between Thursday and Friday, for storing and selling firecrackers. They seized 360kg of the banned items. Police booked the suspects under section 9B of the Explosive Act at respective police stations, said police. The crackers seized were packed for delivery to shopkeepers in posh areas and had already taken advance from them, said police.“We are also seeking the records of storage of crackers in shops and godowns everyday and the teams are visiting them twice. They have been informed any mismatch found in the stock, legal action will be taken against them,” said Rao. A total of nine teams with 230 personnel are deployed in Sadar market where most of the known cracker shops are located. Since Thursday, special teams are conducting surprise checks in markets and residential areas to enforce the ban. Similar arrangements were made in rural areas as well, said police. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police said that the teams have recovered crackers which were mislabelled as green crackers that are said to cut down emission by a third. “The shopkeepers had kept the stock to sell before Diwali and make good profits as it was banned and not easily available in any open market,” he said. Police control room vans and motorbikes are taking rounds across the city to see if anyone is bursting crackers. Police said they have intensified checking at all the borders and major intersections to control the traffic movements and are checking all suspected vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/police-crackdown-on-cracker-sale-360-kg-recovered-after-multiple-raids/story-8tZNgrVrD0xiD4IbXDAyXN.html
13-11-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC restrains mother from evicting constable son from Thane flat||The Bombay high court (HC) recently refused to allow a woman from executing an eviction order against her son passed by a sub-divisional officer (SDO) under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act. The order had authorised the woman to evict her son and his family so that she could live peacefully with her daughter at her Thane home. While observing that the SDO had failed to consider that the woman was getting a pension of ₹10,000 and her son had a liability of repaying a loan which he had taken for repair of the house in question, the HC passed the restraining order on the mother. A single bench of justice Nitin Sambre, after hearing the petition of the son and his wife, was informed by advocate Shubham Misar that the petitioner was employed with the police department as a constable after his father’s demise in 1991. The constable’s father had acquired two flats, and after his demise, one of the flats was transferred to the petitioner. In 1992, the constable’s mother’s name was entered into the property card of both flats. It was further submitted that the constable was living with his mother, three sisters and his own family in one of the two flats till 2015. He later moved into the second flat after spending around ₹8 lakh on repairs. However, one of his three sisters was insisting on selling the flat he occupied, and hence he sought an interim stay against the eviction order issued by the SDO in January. The SDO had also ordered him to pay maintenance of ₹10,000 per month to his mother. The constable, while pointing to the lacunae in the SDO’s order, stated that though his mother was receiving a pension of ₹15,000 and his sister who stayed with their mother was also earning, the SDO had failed to take note of the same and had put the burden of maintenance on him. In light of this and the fact that he would be left without a roof over his head, the constable sought direction from the court to set aside the SDO order. The constable further submitted that in view of the order of the HC full bench restraining eviction, dispossession and demolition during the pandemic situation, the mother should be restrained from executing the eviction order. After hearing the submissions of the constable, the bench observed that the SDO order did not deal with the contentions raised by the constable. Granting interim relief, the bench said, “In view of the above, respondents [the mother and SDO] are restrained from executing the order impugned against the petitioner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-restrains-mother-from-evicting-constable-son-from-thane-flat/story-R6WlrOJ5vXM5PdZZ4jDByN.html

One bus was going to Bareilly while the second was on route to Shikohabad depot in Firozabad. Rajveer Singh Chauhan, SHO Dadri police station, said the accident happened at about 11:45 pm when the first bus driver suddenly applied brakes and the second bus hit it from behind near Anandpur Mor. “Both the buses belonged to UP Roadways and they were moving in the same direction. The buses had passengers going from Noida to their native places in Western UP. It appeared the second bus driver could not spot the bus moving ahead due to fog, which led to the collision,” Chauhan said. Police said that 11 passengers – eight male and three females – of both buses were injured in the accident. The passengers informed the police and a team from the Dadri police station soon reached the spot. The police team rushed the victims to a private hospital. “The victims received minor injuries in the accident. They were discharged after treatment.

13-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai reports over 24 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome which causes paralysis in recovered Covid-19 patients||City neurologists have come together to conduct a study on a rare Covid-19 related neurological complication. More than 24 Covid patients in Mumbai developed paralysis due to Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disorder that can be life-threatening without timely treatment. The study hopes to establish a correlation between Covid-19 and GBS. It is being conducted by a team of city-based neurologists and is the first of its kind in India.The aim of the India-specific study is to develop an India-specific database regarding Covid-19 and GBS that will be sent for scientific publication. “There haven’t been many studies on Covid-19-associated GBS in India. Our study will be first-of-its-kind where the sample size will also be large. Along with hospitals, we are also collecting data from nursing homes,” said Dr Megha Dhamne, principal investigator, and consultant, neurology at L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai. Dr Dhamne is heading the study. She refused to give any additional information as the paper is yet to be published. “GBS is considered the prototype of post-infectious neuropathy that usually develops within two to four weeks after an acute infection. It is mainly observed in the last stage of Covid-19 recovery or among completely recovered patients,” said Dr Pankaj Agarwal, senior consultant, neurology, head of movement disorders clinic, Global Hospital, in Parel. He is part of the team of doctors researching the incidence of GBS among Covid patients. Conventionally, GBS, an auto-immune disorder, is triggered by either respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infections where a patient may go from normal to paralysis in two to three days. The paralysis while reversible if treated early can become permanent if ignored. Symptoms of GBS are similar to those of a stroke with the body’s own immune system attacking its cells instead of protecting them. Afflicted by GBS, nerves of hands and legs are affected, leading to sudden paralysis. In severe cases, breathing may be affected and the patient may require ventilator support. Over the past three months, city doctors have observed an increase in GBS cases among Covid-19 patients. “In August, neurologists received around seven reported GBS cases among Covid-19 patients in Mumbai. By September-end, the number increased to 24, and I am sure many cases haven’t been recorded as yet,” said Dr Agarwal who has treated two such patients as of November 10. While GBS is not an uncommon neurological disease – city doctors said they treat around approximately three cases every month – there appears to be a rise in its incidence among Covid patients. Within five to 10 days of the onset of symptoms of Covid-19, cases of GBS have been identified among some patients. Doctors have recommended regular follow-ups by recovered patients. Among the diagnostic tests that help diagnose GBS are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, chest scans, cerebrospinal fluid examination as well as tests for blood inflammatory markers and nerve conduction velocity.“If diagnosed and treated on time with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis, life-threatening complications can be averted. Plasmapheresis helps remove antibodies and other potentially injurious factors from the bloodstream,” said Dr Kedar Toraskar who heads up the critical care section at Wockhardt Hospital, in Mumbai Central. He has treated one Covid-19 patient with GBS. “GBS can occur even among children. In a stroke, we generally observe unilateral paralysis, but GBS can affect both sides of the body. This is a rare neurological complication which can lead to respiratory failure and even death,” said Dr Kedar Toraskar. Internationally, the incidence of GBS suggests the possibility of a correlation with Covid-19. In June, the United States of America (USA) reported its first case of GBS related to Covid-19. On November 9, Indiana University reported the country’s first pediatric case of GBS in an eight-year-old boy with Covid-19, in the American Academy of Paediatrics. Recently, a study published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry found higher-than-expected numbers of GBS cases during the Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy and a high frequency of GBS among Covid-19 patients. ‘I thought I would not be able to walk again’Madhavi Dhariya, a 49-year-old resident of Mahad in Raigad, contracted Covid-19 in August. Three weeks after recovery, she complained of excruciating back pain. Within a few days one side of her face had suffered paralysis and she was referred to Global Hospital in Mumbai on October 17. “The patient came to me in a wheelchair. She had severe back pain which made me suspect GBS,” said Dr Agarwal. On October 26, she was discharged from hospital and is currently undergoing physiotherapy. “I thought I would not be able to walk due to the weakness in my legs,” said Dhariya. ‘Couldn’t move hands, both legs were frozen’Mahalaxmi resident Jyotsna Maru, a 38-year-old Bharatanatyam dancer, started complaining of numbness in her hands and face in August. She did not show other conventional symptoms of Covid-19 but tested positive and was admitted to Wockhardt Hospital on August 13. Soon, her condition started deteriorating and she became completely paralysed. “I couldn’t move my hands to drink water and my legs were completely frozen,” said Maru, who was worried she wouldn’t be able to dance again. Maru was diagnosed with GBS and doctors immediately began treatment. She was discharged on August 29 and is currently undergoing physiotherapy. “I will take around five months to start dancing again, but I am happy that I am not bedridden,” said Maru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-reports-over-24-cases-of-guillain-barre-syndrome-which-causes-paralysis-in-recovered-covid-19-patients/story-pYR4gA49lYJQSKbTXMWlLM.html
13-11-2020||City||Delhi riots: Court seeks action taken report on complaint against 22 persons||New Delhi: A Delhi court has sought an action taken report (ATR) from the police on a complaint seeking lodging of an FIR against 22 persons, including a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA, for their alleged involvement in the north-east Delhi riots that left 53 dead and around 400 injured.Metropolitan Magistrate Rakesh Kumar Rampuri directed the station house officer (SHO) of the Khajuri Khas police station to file the ATR on the complaint by December 10.The court was hearing the complaint filed by a man named Mohd Mumtaj through advocate Mehmood Pracha, alleging 22 persons were part of the mob that attacked people and vandalised properties.The court said in its November 11 order that Mumtaj’s counsel has said the complainant had approached the police for getting his case lodged. “The SHO concerned is directed to file an action taken report on the complaint of the present applicant (Mumtaj) on the next date of hearing,” it said.The complaint alleged Mumtaj was at his shop on February 23 when he saw a mob of 100-150 people, armed with sticks and stones, coming towards the market. The mob allegedly vandalised his shop, looted it and set it on fire, the complaint said adding, the mob shouted inflammatory slogans and threatened to kill everyone.According to the complaint, the mob allegedly looted several shops, hurled petrol bombs at houses in his area. Mumtaj alleged that BJP MLA Mohan Singh Bisht from Karawal Nagar, along with his driver and another person, had reached the spot on February 24 , after which people started shouting slogans. Mumtaj accused the MLA of leading the mob. In response to the allegations and the complaint filed by the man in court, Bisht said, “I vehemently deny these allegations. I was not even there (crime scene) The complaint is false and motivated. I know nothing about the cases as I was not even there.” The Delhi unit of the BJP had earlier denied allegations that their leaders had instigated the riots. A senior Delhi police officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “We will have to check our records. Police have registered around 700 cases so far and arrested more than 2,000 persons. Police have conducted a fair probe and the case developments are being monitored by the courts. If the court has asked for an action taken report, then we will definitely check our records(related to this case) and submit it before the court.” Delhi Police have in the past denied allegations of impartial probe or that they did not register cases filed against some political leaders. Police maintained they have registered more than 700 cases related to the FIRs, and have arrested people from both communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-court-seeks-action-taken-report-on-complaint-against-22-persons/story-GNODRZrJ6fIZav8tazCwMN.html

13-11-2020||Noida||Pollution board inspects industrial areas, finds violations||Noida: In a bid to control local emissions, officials of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) conducted a surprise inspection at several industries and industrial areas, during which they found violations such as garbage burning. According to officials, open waste and garbage burning – mostly in industrial areas under UP State Industrial Development Authority (UPSIDA) – continues unabated. The UPPCB team on Friday compiled a report naming eight such random inspections done a day earlier, during which violations were found at four spots, all falling under UPSIDA. “Out of eight spots that we inspected, four industries were found using safe and permitted fuel for combustion. However, violations were found in UPSIDA area, where waste was being burnt at two factories, whereas un-burnt and semi-burnt pile of garbage was spotted at two other locations within site-C under UPSIDA,” said Archna Dwivedi, regional officer, UPPCB, Greater Noida. She added that the fire was doused and the source of the waste was traced, based on which an environment compensation of ₹25,000 each was recommended against the two factories and a notice was sent to UPSIDA to manage their waste. “We had been instigating the UPSIDA for at least two years to make a proper waste management scheme. The incidents of garbage or waste burning that leads to local emissions, thereby dropping the air quality of the region, happens because UPSIDA doesn’t have a garbage disposal system,” added Dwivedi. Managed and controlled by the UPSIDA for past 15 years, the industrial area that has about 4,000 industries registered with them in Greater Noida in Gautam Budh Nagar. “We are under process of selecting an agency to collect and manage the solid waste from our sites. The selection process will be completed soon,” said Anil Kuma Sharma, regional manager, UPSIDA, Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/pollution-board-inspects-industrial-areas-finds-violations/story-pCsboujMVo9gsqgvd7WOUL.html
13-11-2020||Noida||This year’s pre-Diwali pollution levels worst since 2018 in Noida, G Noida and Ghaziabad||Every winter, air quality in the national capital region (NCR) plummets with unfavourable weather, stubble burning and pollution from local sources. This gets worse around Diwali with people bursting crackers, unmindful of the emissions they commit. Central pollution control board’s (CPCB’s) air quality data of the 14 days prior to the festival suggests that, since 2018, this year has been especially bad for the cities of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad.According to the data, the average AQI during this period this year was: Ghaziabad 400, Greater Noida 390 and Noida 378, all in the “very poor” category . Last year, the three cities’ average AQI ranged from 267 to 284 when Diwali fell on October 27. In 2018, this was between 330 to 357 when the festival fell on November 7.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.”  “The pre-Diwali pollution levels have been on higher side this year as the instances of stubble burning started early in October and the monsoon this year also retreated early. Further, we also had unfavourable meteorological conditions which combined with local pollutants added to higher pollution levels,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UP-pollution control board. He added that although the date on which Diwali fell in each year was different, it would not be significant as the weather played an important role in determining pollution levels and was more or less similar every year. Severe daysThis year also saw the highest number of “severe” days-- six-- in the fortnight before Diwali in the three cities. In 2019, there were none, while in 2018 there were five for Ghaziabad, one for Greater Noida and three for Noida. “The pollution levels year after year have persisted and threatening to go higher side. Post-Diwali period will be litmus test for ban on use and sale of fire-crackers. If the pollution level continues to be high, the authorities will have to face a lot of questions. The ‘good’ and ‘satisfactory’ days of are only observed when there is rain. Otherwise, ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’ categories have become a norm,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. According to official statistics of the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space Laboratory, the three states of Punjab, Haryana and UP have contributed 80007 instances of crop residue burning during the period October 1 to November 12 with share of Punjab alone at 91.26% with 73020 instances. The total counts were 54671 during the same period in 2019 and 60759 in 2018 with Punjab’s share being 46211 (84.52%) and 49387 (81.28%), respectively. “This year we are also conducting sampling of contribution of metals in air which are generally released through bursting of crackers. This sampling will help us assess reduction due to ban on fire-crackers. This sampling will go on for about 10 days,” said a scientist from UP pollution control board. However, the Diwali day is predicted to remain under “very poor” to “severe” quality on Saturday. The three cities remained under “poor” category AQI on Diwali day in 2018 while the AQI went worse to “very poor” category on Diwali day in 2019. According to Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi from the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the air quality will remain in upper end of “very poor” to “severe” quality on November 14, the day of Diwali, and it is likely to remain similar on November 15 as well. “The significant improvement in air quality is likely from November 16 under the influence of a western disturbance, isolated rainfall over plains of northwest India and adjoining central India is likely on November 15,” the forecast, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/this-year-s-pre-diwali-pollution-levels-worst-since-2018-in-noida-g-noida-and-ghaziabad/story-c1vMB1DeB9i738SxLw4z0O.html
13-11-2020||Noida||Slight slip in air quality on Diwali’s eve||Noida: The air quality of Noida and Greater Noida settled in the ‘very poor’ category on the eve of Diwali as the weather conditions changed with the winds now carrying smoke from neighbouring states. On Friday morning, the wind direction changed from easterly to north-westerly, with smoke coming from neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, leading a hike in the share of PM2.5 levels and deteriorating the air quality. According to weather analysts, the air quality could slip further on Diwali, as the wind speed is likely to fall further but the direction will remain the same -- north-westerly. “The wind direction changed from easterly to north-westerly around 9.30am in the region in Friday due to which the ventilation of the pollutants stopped. The NW winds came at a speed of maximum 8 kmph. On Diwali, the wind speed will drop to 5 kmph, due to which the pollution could rise further,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). Srivastava said due to a approaching western disturbance, the day after Diwali may see light to moderate rainfall after which the wind speed will catch-up to 15 kmph, leading to better ventilation of the pollutants. According to the system of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the current wind directions are not good for the region. “The stubble burning-induced impact in AQI is expected to increase from negligible to moderate for the next two days. Although the level of PM2.5 is predicted to be at the edge of very poor to severe, it is expected to be much better as compared to the past four years around the Diwali period with 0% firecracker emission scenario. The biomass plume transport-level winds have become north-westerly by early Nov 13 and forecast to continue until November 14, which is not good and predicted to have high potential to transport biomass plume in the next 2 days to Delhi and surrounding regions,” said the SAFAR repot on Friday. Meanwhile, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 337 against 305 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 336 against 327 a day earlier, while the AQI for Ghaziabad was 382 against 328 a day earlier. The average PM2.5 for Noida increased to 206.62 microgrammes per cubic metres from 180.62 microgrammes per cubic metres a day earlier. The PM10 for Noida dropped to 308.89 against 342.17 units a day earlier. For Greater Noida, the PM2.5 was 186.85 units against 180.63 units a day earlier. The PM10 for Greater Noida was recorded at 416.51 units against 385.57 units a day earlier. “Combustion is a major source for PM2.5, while dust is for PM10,” said Shambhavi Shukla, program officer, air pollution, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/slight-slip-in-air-quality-on-diwali-s-eve/story-lwemtZBgZxr7DEPHiT2FXP.html
13-11-2020||Delhi||Traffic snarls in Delhi on Dhanteras||Snarls dogged several parts of the national capital on Friday, a day ahead of Diwali, with traffic police officers saying vehicular traffic went up 50% as compared to usual.Most of these jams, the traffic police said, were reported near Metro stations and popular markets, forcing them to deploy their entire traffic staff on the streets, unlike regular days when around 75% officers are out.Taj Hassan, special commissioner of Delhi Traffic Police, said he estimated the vehicular increase on the city’s roads to be almost 50% on Thursday and Friday. He added that the traffic situation on Friday, when Dhanteras was celebrated, was marginally better than Thursday and commuters should expect relatively lesser traffic on Saturday. Delhi Metro services to be available till 10pm on DiwaliThe officer said that traffic police personnel were deployed at all choke points and insisted that the vehicular movement was slow rather than completely chock-a-block. However, some commuters complained that police personnel were missing from several bottlenecked stretches and that several traffic signals were not working. Ankur Singh tweeted the traffic police to complain about such a situation in Dwarka Mod, where he said neither was the traffic signal was functioning, nor were police officers around.A 26-year-old resident of South Delhi’s CR Park, who did not wish to be named, said it took him over 25 minutes to cross the Lala Lajpat Rai Road stretch from Moolchand till Oberoi Hotel, on his way to office in Connaught Place.“It usually takes me no more than 10-12 minutes to cross that stretch. Initially, I thought the traffic was due to police barricades usually placed near the Lajpat Nagar Metro station, but that was not the case on Friday,” he said.Commuters also complained about people parking their cars on the roadsides near popular markets and shopkeepers spreading out on the roads to do the festive business.This year’s pre-Diwali pollution levels worst since 2018 in Noida, G Noida and Ghaziabad“Festivities can’t mean parking on roads,”Pradeep Sachdeva, a Twitter user who was stuck in a jam between Madhuban Chowk and Netaji Subhash Place, wrote to the traffic police. The traffic police said that they received most calls of traffic jams from places such as Barapulla Flyover, Aurobindo Marg, Sarita Vihar, Chhatarapur, Keshavpuram, Shakarpur, Dwarka Mod, etc“The next bad traffic situation we are preparing for is during Chhath (on November 20). But since there are a lot of restrictions due to Covid-19, hopefully there will be less jams,” said Hassan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-snarls-in-delhi-on-dhanteras/story-ks65zXNMcrQI4XmY0JWTjJ.html
13-11-2020||City||Govt school kids turn teachers for a day, take ‘happiness classes’||HTC New Delhi: On the eve of Children’s Day, students of Delhi government schools turned teachers during a special happiness class held on Friday morning attended by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. The event began with students leading a session of mindfulness, followed by storytelling session. Though the classes were conducted in an online mode, the education minister discussed the impact of happiness classes on the well-being of children, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Happiness Class is a new and unique curriculum launched by the state government in 2018 to develop self-awareness and mindfulness among students. In April, the government had announced online happiness classes for students to cope with the stress induced by the Covid-19 crisis. “...Our students have now become teachers of the happiness curriculum, by engaging their family members, and even their friends, spreading the message of the class in their own unique way,” Sisodia said. Students shared their experience of attending happiness classes during the pandemic.

Areas around Dandi Swami Chowk, Ghumar Mandi, Jawahar Nagar Market, and Model Town also witnessed similar scenes as shopkeepers kept benches on the roads to display their commodities.City residents were irked by the chaotic situation.“Visit any place in the city and, you will find a traffic jam owing to the encroachments by the shopkeepers. The sweetshop owners as well as the crockery shopkeepers displayed their goods outside their establishments to attract customers at Rani Jhansi Road and Sham Singh Road near HIG Flats,” said Munish Dogra, a resident of Durgapuri in Haibowal.The residents also complained that not only did the shopkeepers encroach upon the roads but also occupied the parking space.“Little do they know that by encroaching upon the roads, they are losing customers instead of attracting them. If customers will not find parking space then how will they shop,” questioned Kiran Punni, a resident of Model Gram.On the other hand, a shopkeeper in Ghumar Mandi, while justifying the encroachments, said, “Covid has impacted the businesses badly. Many establishments had to be closed while several others were on the verge of shutting down therefore we have put all our goods on display and expect to revive from losses this season.”Recently the MC officials had taken a tough stance against encroachments in the city and had written to the police department seeking registration of FIRs against defaulters.MC secretary Neeraj Jain said some relaxation was given to the shopkeepers keeping in view the losses they had incurred due to Covid.“However, strictness will be maintained soon after Diwali celebrations are over and no encroachments of any kind will be allowed,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/festive-fervour-rampant-encroachment-leads-to-chaos-in-ludhiana-mc-looks-other-way/story-nP5oJIYmpY0YGbFVygpQdO.html

13-11-2020||Kolkata||Actor Soumitra Chatterjee in critical state||Veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee’s condition deteriorated fast on Friday with his neurological function in its worst state since admission on October 6, doctors treating him at a private hospital in south Kolkata said in the evening. “The situation is not that good. His condition has deteriorated. The neurological condition is the worst since his admission. The GCS count is around five. An EEG examination showed very little activity in the brain. There were no convulsions though. His heartbeat rate was very high but it has now been controlled. His blood pressure was also high. For the first time his oxygen requirement has gone up,” said Dr Arindam Kar, head of the team of doctors treating Chatterjee. “Chatterjee’s kidney functions are not good and he is on dialysis. The coagulation function is the only good part in this entire scenario. But overall it seems that the situation will not be good in the coming 24 hours. For the first time we are expecting an unfavourable outcome. We are giving our best but it seems our best may not be adequate for the recovery of Chatterjee,” said Dr Kar. The 85-year-old actor underwent his first plasmapheresis procedure on Thursday. Late on Thursday night, the doctors said that he was running fever but was stable. Chatterjee, who was infected by the coronavirus, is suffering from Covid encephalopathy. He is in a drowsy state for the past two weeks. Plasmapheresis is a process in which the plasma is separated from the blood cells for two purposes. The plasma is either replaced or treated and injected back into the body. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award winner was hospitalised on October 6 after he tested positive for Covid-19. Chatterjee tested negative on October 14 but his neurological system was affected by Covid encephalopathy. As a result, Chatterjee’s condition drastically deteriorated over the past two weeks. Also Read: Bengal man kills three in their sleep, bystanderOn Thursday night, Dr Kar said that the plasmapheresis went off well but the actor had fever which was the reason for the deterioration in his condition. The fever could be due to the multiple transfusions which are required for plasmapheresis, said the doctor. Earlier this week, the actor’s kidney functions took a toll. He was put on alternated dialysis to improve the renal function. The doctors subsequently decided to go for plasmapheresis and tracheostomy.

Shafiq Mir on Thursday was welcomed into Apni Party by Altaf Bukhari and the former had announced the merger of AJKPC with Apni Party. However, Anil Sharma rejected Mir’s claims that AJKPC has merged with Apni Party. “AJKPC continues to pursue its activities and there is no question of merging the apex body with any political party,” he said at a press conference here. Sharma informed that Shafiq Mir has joined the Apni Party in his individual capacity but All Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference as an organisation has nothing to do with his joining and there is no question of merging the decade-old representative body of elected panches and sarpanches with any of the political party. Sharma also said that AJKPC was a legally registered body having its own constitution and charter. AJKPC also owns trademark rights over the title and no person is allowed to infringe the legal right of this organisation and whosoever was found indulging in violation of this right may have to face legal consequences including civil suit and criminal prosecution, he said. Sharma regretted that Altaf Bukhari was misled and misinformed by Shafiq Mir, a self-styled leader, who sometimes calls himself chairman and convenor of the AJKPC. “Having highest regards for senior political leader Altaf Bukhari, I request him to be careful from individuals who misrepresent and distort facts for petty gains,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-merger-of-j-k-panchayat-conference-with-any-political-party-clarifies-anil-sharma/story-Hfr325Zqad9ixkwEfwvOrL.html

The fair committee in the wake of Covid-19 has decided not to hold the fair. “This year we are breaking off from the tradition for the first time. The annual fair has been cancelled,” said Kanwar Jagdeep Singh, scion of the Dhami royal family.The participants, mostly youth and teenagers, relentlessly hurl stones at each other during the day-long festival. The violent stone pelting continues for more than half an hour at open areas close to the temple dedicated to goddess Bhadra Kali at Dhami. The temple was built by the royal family at Dhami.Ahead of starting the festival, members of the fair committee along with members of the erstwhile royals worshipped the goddess Kali. A large number of people, particularly youth, tourists both domestic and foreigners had gathered at the sports ground to witness the fierce ritual that lasted for about 15 minutes. Stone pelting continues till a tilak of human blood that drip on the ground is smeared on the forehead of the goddess in the village.The locals widely believe that the festival of stone-throwing brings good fortune. The stone-throwing is held between villagers of Jamog and Kateru. “we would perform only customary puja this time, stone-pelting will just be symbolic,” said Kanwar.The legend has it that the practice of stone pelting was introduced after the tradition of human sacrifice that prevailed in the village was stopped. The tradition is continuing from the time of the Satti tradition. One of the queens in Dhami opposed human sacrifice and later evolved this tradition where only villagers participate. People believe that the erstwhile queen of Dhami sacrificed her life to end the practice of human sacrifice and asked people to start a fair in which people of two clans will throw stones at the sky and continue until someone is hit, and the blood of that person would be then offered to the goddess.Another belief is that a woman from Halog village was engaged in the neighboring princely state of Rangaoli. But due to old bitterness, residents of Jamog village poisoned the prince just before the marriage was to be solemnised. The distressed woman burnt herself on the pyre of her fiancé. Angry villagers of Halog and Jamog fought with each other with stones. Being injured in the stone-pelting festival is considered auspicious. In the past many years, the local administration and human right activist have made several attempts to discourage the people from pursuing the tradition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-dampens-spirit-of-centuries-old-tradition-of-stone-pelting-in-himachal-s-dhami-village/story-DDinrCA3uPfMQU0erRixSK.html

People are suffering due to rising unemployment and inflation in the state, but the state government is busy misleading the people for its own political advantage” said Rathore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/worry-about-real-issues-instead-of-blaming-congress-kuldeep-rathore-to-jai-ram/story-5YLXIAwEaT6OWz0FcVbKEP.html

13-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra to see another tussle between MVA government and governor BS Koshyari?||Another tussle is likely between the three- party ruling coalition Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and state governor BS Koshyari, this time over nominating 12 members to the state legislative Council. Of the 78 members of the Upper house of state legislature, 12 are nominated by the governor on the recommendation of the state government. More than a week after the MVA government recommended the 12 names, Koshyari is yet to take a decision. Although the issue is likely to lead to political friction between the state and Koshyari, constitutional experts feel it is binding on the governor to accept the recommendations within reasonable time and has no right to replace them with his choice of names. There was no reaction from Raj Bhavan (governor’s office-cum-residence) on the issue. Each party in the MVA, comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, has recommended four names. According to the provision in Article 171(5) of the Constitution, people nominated from the quota must possess ‘special knowledge and practical experience’ in literature, science, art, cooperative movement and social service. The Sena has recommended the names of actor Urmila Matondkar, Nitin Bangude Patil, Chandrakant Raghuvanshi and Vijay Karanjkar; NCP has recommended Eknath Khadse, farmers’ leader Raju Shetti, folk singer Anand Shinde, and Yashpal Bhinge. The Congress has recommended the names of Rajni Patil, Muzaffar Hussain, Sachin Sawant and Aniruddha Wankar. Also read: Row between Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari and CM Uddhav Thackeray may not end soon“All these names have been recommended with due deliberation in all three ruling parties after ensuring they fit in the given categories. All five categories have been given representation, as each one of them fits into one of the categories. We also studied the precedents and cases from at least five other states. The governor has to approve the names recommended by the government,” said a senior Congress leader. A Sena minister said the three ruling parties would wait for some more time before expressing their views on the issue. “It’s been a week since we sent the names to the governor. We will wait for some more time. In case of CM Uddhav Thackeray, the governor had refused to accept the state cabinet’s recommendation to nominate him to the Upper house and we had to approach Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In this case, we will raise the issue of propriety and precedents if it comes to that,” he said. Not the first timeThe first major friction between the MVA government and governor was witnessed in April, when the latter refused to accept the state cabinet’s recommendation to nominate Thackeray to the Council. Thackeray had to get elected to either of the two houses of legislature within six months of swearing in as the CM. The cabinet recommended Thackeray be nominated to the Council, but Koshyari refused to accept it. It was only after the CM reached out to PM Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah, the election for nine seats was announced. Koshyari also refused to accept state’s decision to not hold examinations for final-year students, met actor Kangana Ranaut who complained to him against BMC’s move to demolish parts of her office, met a retired naval officer who was assaulted by Sena men for circulating a post against CM. He also wrote a strongly worded letter over reopening of temples and questioning CM’s Hindutva credentials. It was the first time in the tussle that Thackeray retorted with strong language.In the current composition of the legislative Council, MVA has majority. It has 31 legislators, while BJP has 22. There are three legislators from smaller parties or outfits and four independents who are divided between ruling and opposition, when it comes to support on the floor of the house. In all, there are 18 vacant berths due to various reasons. Ulhas Bapat, constitutional expert, said the names are expected to be approved by the governor within “reasonable timeframe”. “Applying the doctrine of silence, the reasonable time according to me could be two weeks. The governor has every right to seek explanation or advice on the names recommended as per the provisions in Article 167, but he cannot strike down the names suggested by a government which enjoys a clear majority in the Assembly. In one of the rulings, the SC has clarified that politics is part of the social service, and thus even political names fit into the category of social service,” he said. According to officials from the law and judiciary department, the governor may point at the delay in recommending names by the government if he was asked to approve them immediately. The official said the names were recommended almost five months after the seats fell vacant in June and the governor cannot be expected to take a call immediately. Bapat said the ruling parties will have the legal recourse to move the Supreme Court. “Secondly, they can also write to the President of India.” Also read: Governor BS Koshyari asked Uddhav Thackeray if he had turned secular. He delivers a biting responseShrihari Aney, former advocate general of Maharashtra, said the Upper house exists in perpetuity and the governor is bound by the Constitution to fill certain categories of vacancies. “Leaving these seats vacant indefinitely would amount to failure on his part to perform his Constitutional duty. I don’t know of any precedent where a governor picked his own names, and in the current scenario too, Maharashtra governor is likely to go with the age-old set practice. However, he has the discretion under Article 171(1) read with 171(5) of the Constitution to select his own names. This exercise of discretion can be subject to limited judicial review, and may be challenged if the person he appoints fall outside the prescribed categories, or if his exercise of power is tainted by factual malice,” he said. The governor also has the option of approving the names in batches like was done by then governor of Uttar Pradesh Ram Naik in 2015. “The governor cannot replace the names as the recommendation by the cabinet is binding on him, but he can seek clarification from the government on the proposal. I released the first list of four out of nine recommendations after three months and refused to clear the remaining as there were criminal and income-tax related cases against them. Then chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had to replace the names, which were later approved,” said Naik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/another-flashpoint-between-maharashtra-government-and-governor-bs-koshyari/story-sGLqgEmIQeDHILaimM0p8O.html

13-11-2020||Mumbai||This Mumbai-based NGO got classes on MP3 players for Maharashtra’s rural students||As students from remote parts of Maharashtra struggle to become a part of online learning six months after schools started, a city-based NGO has come up with an easy learning solution for these kids. In the past two months, Chirag Foundation, founded by educationist Pratibha Pai, has successfully piloted the use of solar lamps-cum-MP3 players for learning in the remote hamlet of Bharanapada in Mokhada, Palghar. The NGO, which mainly works to transform villages with the help of solar power, realised that after Covid-19 and the resultant closure of schools, children from remote areas were facing hurdles in online learning. Also read: No school due to Covid-19 pandemic may mean no study for rural students across Maharashtra, warn experts“Initially, we made speakers available to students and content would be played for children in small groups. However, a large section of children who belong to the shepherd community would be out all day and hence found it difficult to assemble in one place. We thus came up with preloaded MP3 players which could be carried anywhere. Students found it very useful as they could listen to content whenever they got the time without requiring a network connection,” said Pai. The NGO now plans to replicate the model in other villages across the state. Shraddha Shringarpure founder of Diganta Swaraj Foundation, a local partner of the NGO which helped with its on-ground implementation, said students have benefitted immensely from the initiative. “We have been able to make learning capsules for students from anganwadi to Class 7 and students are happy with the content. In this village, most people are below the poverty line and cannot afford smartphones. An intervention like this is very crucial to continue the learning of such students,” she said. Also read: ‘Only 57% Maharashtra students have internet connectivity’The NGO, through its initiative Project Chirag, has also made thousands of solar lights available to students across Maharashtra and in other rural parts of the country. Mainly working towards electrification of villages, the foundation has supported 500 villages so far. “Even during the pandemic, we managed to work with 46 villages to help them with various things, ranging from providing lighting solutions to sustainable livelihoods. We think that if villages are made sustainable, people living in rural parts won’t have to migrate to cities and work with meagre incomes. We have thus started creating livelihood opportunities for people in their own villages,” said Pai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/this-mumbai-based-ngo-got-classes-on-mp3-players-for-rural-students/story-y9fR54sCfxRywcVOAFoP9L.html

Though traditionally Pune’s graduate constituency has been dominated by BJP, the Maha Vikas Agadi is planning to challenge the BJP.Jayanti Patil, state unit president, NCP, said, “ We are hoping for victory. BJP said that the MVA government will not complete it’s tenure but that is just false hope.”Chandrakant Patil, the party’ state unit president, on Wednesday, said, “Pune graduate constituency has always been dominated by the BJP. Except one time, it was always represented by BJP and I myself represented it for two terms.”As the BJP state president Chandrakant Patil has completed his tenure, the post of MLC was vacant from Pune division. A total of five districts come in the graduate and teacher’s constituency. The candidates will be elected from Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur districts.Pune district has the highest number of voters followed by Kolhapur so most political parties will focus to campaign in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/mva-poses-big-challenge-to-bjp-in-pune-graduate-constituency/story-MZ5itA1XTvVL2jVYerQvMK.html
13-11-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: BJP suspends former minister for seeking suspension of CM Rawat||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has suspended former minister Lakhi Ram Joshi for writing a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat’s removal over corruption charges.State BJP chief Bansidhar Bhagat, who ordered the suspension, said Joshi’s letter amounted to gross indiscipline. “He has also been served a show-cause notice to which he has to reply in seven days. No member of the party; no matter how big can indulge in indiscipline as the discipline is the most important aspect of our party,” he said. “If anyone has any issue, he should raise it before me. I would take it to the proper platform, if needed, but would not tolerate any indiscipline.”Joshi’s letter dated November 11 came to light after Opposition Congress leaders shared it on social media. HT has a copy of the letter.Also Read: Uttarakhand fines firm Rs 15 cr after it fails to account for debris on Char Dham roadThe letter came days after the Uttarakhand high court ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe against Rawat over corruption charges. The Supreme Court later stayed the order for four weeks.Joshi cited the high court order in his letter and said Rawat’s decisions and statements have left the party red-faced since he came to power three years earlier. “The recent high court order on the CBI probe against him further maligned the image of the party.”Joshi accused Rawat of helping some people close to him with their alleged black money when Rs 500 and Rs 1,00 notes were demonetised in 2016. “Considering the corruption allegations which are maligning the image of the party daily, I request you to immediately relieve Rawat from the position of the chief minister to allow a fair probe against him.”Rawat’s media advisor, Ramesh Bhatt, called the allegations against the chief minister completely baseless. “Anyone can make any allegations but that does not prove that the chief minister is indulging in corruption.”Joshi could not be reached for comments immediately.Opposition Congress leader Garima Dasauni said Joshi has echoed them and accused Rawat of “rampant corruption”. “Now this letter from the BJP leader has just proved us right.”Dasauni said in BJP, speaking the truth is indiscipline. “If anyone tries to show the mirror to the leadership, he is shown the door. There is no democracy in the BJP but autocracy.”Earlier, BJP lawmaker Puran Singh Fartyal raised the issue of corruption in the assembly. He was later served a notice and the matter was later said to have been resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-bjp-suspends-former-minister-for-seeking-suspension-of-cm-rawat/story-AsHDnDr2yz3dooWIxcAoCN.html

It can be worse if there are additional emissions. AQI will improve after Diwali and there are chances of drizzle and rain on 15th November,” Dr VK Soni, Head, Environment and Research Centre, IMD said.Delhi woke up to “very poor” air quality on Friday morning. The AQI was 328 this morning, while on Thursday the AQI was 314.Delhi’s AQI was ‘severe’ for six days, starting November 6. Due to a change in wind speeds, Delhi’s air quality had marginally improved on Wednesday and Thursday but scientists have warned that respite from severe pollution will be short-lived. The System of Air Quality and weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, has released a similar forecast for Delhi’s air quality for the Diwali weekend. “The stubble burning induced impact in AQI is expected to increase from negligible to moderate for the next two days,” the SAFAR forecast read.The forecast added that even if residents do not burn any crackers, the PM 2.5 level is still expected to be on the higher-end of ‘very poor’ or the lower-end of ‘severe’ category. However, despite unfavourable weather conditions, the forecast said the AQI is expected to be better this year, as compared to Diwali day and the days after the festival for the past four years.On Thursday, Delhi’s minimum temperature, recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official reading for the city, was 11.6 degree Celsius – two notches below normal.

13-11-2020||Jaipur||Ashok Gehlot cites Rajasthan model, urges PM Modi for mandatory FIR policy across India||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure that all states adopt a mandatory FIR registration policy for ‘effective’ maintenance of law and order while emphasising that the high rate of crime registration in Rajasthan didn’t mean the state had a high crime rate. In a letter to PM Narendra Modi, the CM claimed that the state had adopted police reforms for dispensation of speedy justice and for prevention of crime and asserted that other states could also benefit from the ‘effective and sensitive’ system. Gehlot, in the letter, stated that in order to remove complexities in crime registration, Rajasthan in May 2019 had implemented a system of uninterrupted registration of crimes. Under the system, if the crime is not registered at any police station then an FIR can be registered at the office of superintendent of police. The state government, he said, has ensured disciplinary action against police officers for dereliction of duty. The CM also mentioned other initiatives for providing transparent and accountable police administration.Gehlot said encouragement to crime registration in the state is bound to increase the number of registered crimes as seen in the state and acknowledged in the ‘Crime in India-2019’ report, recently published by the national crime records bureau (NCRB). Also Read: Congress leader Sachin Pilot tests positive for Covid-19Gehlot said that some people have mistakenly termed the increase in registration of FIRs in the state as an increase in crime; whereas the NCRB report clearly states that there is a difference between the two.Gehlot also said that according to the NCRB, the increase in crime registration figures may be due to ‘people-centric’ schemes and policies in the state. All the states should make crime registration mandatory and crime data should not be used for political gain, he said. Also Read: WHO to set up Global Centre on Traditional Medicine in India: PM ModiHe argued that making the number of registered crimes a measure of success and failure of the police force reinforces the tendency not to register a crime. Due to this, many types of disorders in the working of the police also arise. He has said that this is not the time to oppose registration, but to strongly support this policy of providing justice to every person. Otherwise, in future, the government of any state of the country will shy away from taking such steps that provide relief to the common man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/ashok-gehlot-cites-rajasthan-model-urges-pm-modi-for-mandatory-fir-policy-across-india/story-iEDxIbplMY9iACNLm8KaGI.html

The calf struggled in the well for over four hours and was rescued by the village men, who jumped into the well, tied a rope around the calf and pulled the animal out. Forest ranger Amarender Kumar Singh said, “The calf was with a herd of six elephants. The herd was passing through the farm. But, the calf fell into the small well, dug for agricultural purpose in the village, on the way.” He said a team of forest staff was sent to the village with an excavator. However, the calf had already been rescued by then, he said. The mukhiya (village head) of Rakuwa panchayat, under the jurisdiction of which the village is, Suresh Rajak said a 40-year-old man spotted the herd and the struggling calf in the well around 7am when he went out to relieve himself. “He was injured by the herd and has been admitted to a hospital,” Rajak said. The herd damaged the paddy, potato, beans and bottle gourd crops on a large scale in the village, he said. “Despite this, the villagers came out to rescue the calf. We have demanded compensation from the government for the crop loss. ” Jageshwar Mahto, a resident of Lipia village who was part of the rescue team, said, “During the rescue operation, our main challenge was to protect ourselves from the herd of six elephants, which was around 200 metres away from the well. However, some men were brave enough to jump into the well and tie the animal with a rope safely. Then, we all pulled the rope up and rescued the elephant.” He said they released the elephant calf in the forest area where the herd was staying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-five-month-old-elephant-rescued-from-well/story-eBCv7J0Ub2oxpBrQZSV4JK.html
13-11-2020||Chandigarh||With snow, rain forecast, Kashmir awaits date with winged guests||Bird lovers and wildlife experts are eagerly awaiting the snowfall forecast over the weekend to welcome the migratory birds that will flock the wetlands of Kashmir. Owing to the extended dry spell in summer and autumn this year, the water level in the rivers, lakes and wetlands of the Kashmir Valley has been low, affecting the arrival of the avian visitors. “We are expecting the winged guests to arrive in flocks after the rain and snowfall expected between Friday and Sunday. So far, the wetlands of Shalbough, Hokersar and Hygam have few birds because of the low water level,” says Ifshan Dewan, Kashmir’s wildlife warden, wetlands. The weather office has forecast light to moderate snowfall in the plains of Jammu and Kashmir and moderate to heavy snowfall in the higher reaches between November 13 and 15 after months of dry weather in the valley. KASHMIR HOME TO 9 OF 13 WETLANDS IN J&K Kashmir has about 400 water bodies of which the officials and avian watchers observe the birds in 25 big and notified water bodies. The valley is home to nine of the 13 wetlands in Jammu and Kashmir. Shalbough in central Kashmir’s Ganderbal district is the biggest wetland spread over 16 sq km, while Hokersar on the city’s outskirts covers an area of 13.5 sq km and Hygam wetland in north Kashmir is spread across 9 sq km. Dewan said that the Jhelum and the Doodh Ganga rivers feed these wetlands but both have low water levels this year. “There has been no rain since June. The water table is low but we are hopeful that within the next one or two weeks we will see a good arrival of birds,” she said. OCTOBER ARRIVAL DELAYED Traversing continents in flocks, the birds arrive from Europe, Central Asia, China and Japan to spend the winter in the Himalayan valley. Mostly Mallards, Greylag Geese, Pochards, Common tails, Shovellers, Pintails and Gharwals visit the region between October and April. Dewan said necessary plugging of the wetlands has been done in anticipation of the rain. “We have done whatever management intervention was needed. Now we only want this dry spell to end,” she said. In 2018 and 2019, the birds arrived early owing to the early snowfall. Dewan said that thousands of birds have been already started flocking the lakes, particularly Dal Lake. “Birds have made their presence felt in Dal Lake and the Chatlam wetland in Pampore where the water level is good,” she said. ENCROACHMENTS REMOVED Officials say the migratory birds shuttle between wetlands and lakes of Kashmir during their stay. After the onset of militancy, the wetlands witnessed large-scale encroachment and poaching of migratory birds but of late, vigilance has been stepped up and the encroachments have also come down to a large extent. “Last year, around 7 lakh birds had visited the region,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-snow-rain-forecast-kashmir-awaits-date-with-winged-guests/story-GKvI5AOxENj7SjouHnDmAM.html

The SIT handed over a 3,500-word report to the state government last week, recommending action against police personnel and administration officials. It submitted 36 recommendations, giving details of the alleged role of some officers and 80 police personnel in the Kanpur episode. However, the government is yet to take any action against these officials. “It came to the fore that policemen used to give tip-offs to Dubey and on the night of the ambush, he was aware that a police team was coming to Bikru,” a senior officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-suspends-senior-ips-after-sit-report/story-aQtK8jnuXBc749830zVf0H.html
13-11-2020||City||Assam journalist killed in hit-and-run case; TV channel alleges murder||Allegations of murder have surfaced following the death of a journalist of an Assamese news channel in a hit-and-run case in Tinsukia district of upper Assam. Parag Bhuyan, the Kakopathar correspondent of Pratidin Time, was critically injured after he was hit by a vehicle near his home on NH-15 on Wednesday around 8.15pm, close to the Kakopathar police station. The 53-year-old, the brother of former minister Jagadish Bhuyan, was initially admitted to a local hospital and later shifted to a private hospital in Dibrugarh where he succumbed to his injuries in Thursday morning. In a statement, Pratidin Time blamed the local police for being slow in pursuing the case and acting only after intervention of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal. Also Read: Top ULFA militant’s surrender marks end of insurgency in Meghalaya: DGP“The initial lacklustre approach of the police gave us reason to be suspicious about the whole incident and we suspect that the brave journalist was murdered as he had been doing a series of reports exposing illegalities and corruption around Kakopathar. He had received personal threats for these reports,” the statement read. “We suspect it is a planned murder and demand a detailed inquiry into the whole incident and give justice to the family of late Bhuyan and Pratidin Time,” it added. Chief minister Sonowal handed over the probe on Bhuyan’s death to the state’s criminal investigation department (CID) on Thursday evening.In a statement, Sonowal mourned the untimely death of Bhuyan and conveyed his sympathy to the journalist’s family. In a press release issued on Thursday, Assam Police said that two persons, James Murha and Baba Bordoloi, the driver and helper of the vehicle which hit Bhuyan, were nabbed from Namsai in Arunachal Pradesh on Thursday morning. “During interrogation, the driver admitted to having caused the accident due to negligence while returning after unloading tree leaves collected from various areas around Doomdooma,” the police release said. “The driver said that they fled from the scene after the accident as they were afraid that the public might assault them. The vehicle involved in the accident has been seized and further investigation is on,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/assam-journalist-killed-in-hit-and-run-case-tv-channel-alleges-murder/story-sdfuCdFl2Xiq1nM4Vs3ZVL.html
13-11-2020||Kolkata||Stones hurled at Bengal BJP chief Ghosh’s convoy; TMC says staged||The convoy of Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh was attacked at Jaigaon in Alipurduar district on Thursday, party workers said. Stones were hurled at the cars and the leader was shown black flags, the workers said. While nobody was injured, three cars were damaged, they said. A team of officers were able to bring the situation under control.The BJP leader, who was on a three-day visit to north Bengal, accused the ruling Trinamool Congress of orchestrating the attack. “Such attacks are not new to me. Several of my cars were vandalized in the past. The TMC is scared of our growth. It knows that its days are numbered. These attacks cannot stop the BJP,” Ghosh said.“The TMC and their friends are getting desperate as they can sense defeat in the upcoming assembly polls. However such tactics won’t work. People are with us,” Ghosh said. Assembly elections in the state are due early next year.The BJP’s state youth wing president Saumitra Khan said, “We will stage demonstrations in all towns of the state from 4 pm onwards.” Refuting the allegations, district TMC chief Sourav Chakraborty said that Ghosh was trying to foment trouble in north Bengal.TMC leader and urban development minister Firhad Hakim said, “Whoever is involved in the incident will face action. The administration will take steps. I condemn the attack but our party is not involved in this.” “The TMC is not all involved in the incident. The attack was staged because the BJP wants to stay in the limelight. Our party does not believe in violence,” tourism minister Gautam Deb, legislator from the Dabgram-Phulbari constituency in north Bengal, said.Kuntal Banerjee, Alipurduar additional superintendent of police refused to comment on the incident. Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar also condemned the attack. “No political leader should face such attacks. This is deplorable,” Dhankhhar told mediapersons.The governor, who is visiting neighbouring Cooch Behar district, said that an atmosphere of political violence and vendetta is prevailing in the state.“There is no sign of abating of political violence. The reason for this is public servants have become political workers,” Dhankhar told reporters.Dhankhar had alleged earlier also that the police and bureaucracy are being politicised in West Bengal and asked public servants not to work as political functionaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/stones-hurled-at-bengal-bjp-chief-ghosh-s-convoy-tmc-says-staged/story-grvfL8ynKiOK6bWYbH0dPL.html
13-11-2020||Bangalore||BS Yediyurappa’s son emerges as new leader||Karnataka chief minister’s son BY Vijayendra has ensured two significant victories in for the Bharatiya Janata Party in the last one year. While the bypoll win of party candidate Narayan Gowda on the KR Pete seat last year was dismissed as a fluke by many analysts, the result in the favor of BJP’s Rajesh Gowda in Sira assembly constituency has pitched Vijayendra as a likely inheritor of BS Yediyurappa’s legacy in the state. Significantly, both KR Pete in Mandya district and Sira in Tumakuru are dominated by the Vokkaligas – the second largest community in the state. The community has tended to vote for the Janata Dal (Secular) and the Congress whenever the JD(S) fell out of favor. The BJP, meanwhile, has been seen as a Lingayat party due to the leadership of CM Yediyurappa. Analysts believe that Vijayendra has his father’s knack of taking people along unlike his elder brother, Shivamogga MP BY Raghavendra, who is perceived to be more reserved. Political Analyst Manjunath said, “While Vijayendra is yet to hold any elected office while Raghavendra has already been an MLA and an MP, it is a fact that it is Vijayendra who has the charisma, a natural political instinct which marks him out as the one most likely to inherit his father’s legacy.”Vijayendra, however, had dismissed any speculation of taking the reigns from his father, saying that the family is united and there is no internal rivalry. The vice president of the party’s state unit has dealt with his share of controversies, with the opposition accusing him of having a major say in the administration even thought he does not hold any post. He has also been accused of corruption, but he dismissed the charges as the “price I pay for being the bridge between the CM and people as well as party workers”.Responding to the growing clamour for him to contest the Basva Kalyan bypoll, Vijaydenra said “will take up any responsibility given by the party”, even as the chief minister dismissed the speculations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/bs-yediyurappa-s-son-emerges-as-new-leader/story-cv083Dsi9AghpuGMT7wNLL.html
13-11-2020||Delhi||HT Spot Check: Not far from the madding crowd||Despite new Covid-19 infections in the Capital spiralling, and experts urging people to avoid crowding, markets have swelled during the festive season. HT is conducting spot checks in different parts of the city to check whether social distancing norms and mask hygiene are being followed, and questioning the authorities about why they are being unable to put measures in place, and how they plan to address the problem. Need we remind you, the coronavirus disease has already infected over 465,000 people in the city, and taken more than 7,000 lives.LAXMI NAGAR MARKETRavinder Yadav, president of Laxmi Nagar market association, said: “Police are issuing fines for not maintaining distance inside the shops, but there is no check on the streets. This is the only time we can do some business. After several requests, we got the entry of four-wheelers inside the market banned.”Arun Kumar Mishra, DM East, said: “We have regulated the entry and exit of vehicles at the market, and they are not allowed in the inner lanes. Strict action is being taken against shops and people who are not adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour.” Deputy commissioner of police (east) Jasmeet Singh said: “Vehicular movement and presence of street vendors and hawkers on the road are the main causes of overcrowding in the market. We put barricades on the main entry and points of the market to stop the entry of vehicles. Joint teams of police, district administration and MCD officials, along with civil defence volunteers regularly remove and fine street vendors and hawkers. Prosecution for not wearing masks and violating distancing norms has been increased.”Ajay Bajaj, advisor, Karol Bagh Traders’ Federation, said: “Streets are flooded with people, largely due to illegal hawkers. Traffic on Arya Samaj Road has gone up due to the closing of Ajmal Khan Road.”Balram Meena, SDM, Karol Bagh, said: “The administration along with police and municipal staff is conducting daily flag marches urging people to follow social distancing.”DCP (Central) Sanjay Bhatia said: “It is a large market with high footfall. We are doing our best to ensure no crowding.”Devraj Baweja, general secretary, Confederation of Sadar Bazaar Traders Association, said: “The biggest problem was encroachments, which have been removed. We have told all traders not to allow people who are not wearing masks.”Nagendra Tripathi, ADM (Central): “We have set up six incident command posts with 6-8 civil defence volunteers. We have issued close to 200 challans to people who are violating the Covid norms.”DCP (North) Anto Alphonse said: “Vehicle entry is restricted inside.

13-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Blue sky sighting||The sky has lost its blue. The pollution has covered it in a haze. But there is still one place in the city where you can find the most beautiful shade of that lost blue.It’s on the wall of Malik Naan House, in Old Delhi’s Turkman Gate neighbourhood. Founded 40 years ago, the naan and roti making establishment is very small, and looks totally unremarkable from outside, until the gaze falls on the blue wall. Tonight, many plastic bags are hanging on the wall, along with shirts and pants, and even a gamcha — it must all belong to the roti cooks, traditionally known as Naanbai.It’s 7.30 pm, busy hour for the stall as folks from across the neighbourhood are coming up to get tandoori rotis or naans for their dinner. Indeed, the stall is distinguished by one specific additional aspect, apart from its beautiful wall. It retains a link to Delhi’s longtime culinary culture, in which the households would cook their own gravies and subzis but the rotis would be sourced from neighbourhood bakeries. Such businesses, satisfying the need of the neighbourhood residences, have greatly diminished over the years, as more and more home kitchens opt to cook flat rotis on their gas chulha rather than have big thick tandoor-baked breads.Malik Naan House employs about half a dozen men, and all are from Lucknow in UP. The most venerable “kaarigar” (cook) is the one with the responsibility to handle the tandoor. Taufik Khan remarks that even in the days when the air is clear, he and his cooks have no time to look at the blue sky. “There are other important things, like making rotis,” he says, chuckling. The other much younger cooks laugh. The playful Muhammed Sonu, rolling out the dough, picks up his giant wooden rolling pin and holds it like a film star clutching the rifle in the climactic scene of an action film. The customers standing outside clap like single-screen cinema audience.Gesturing towards the wall, Mr Khan clarifies that it isn’t always decked up with so many bags. “Today the boys went for shopping to Matia Mahal,” he says, referring to a nearby bazar. “The bags have their new clothes.... they came straight to work from the shopping, and so hang their purchases on the wall.”The stall will close about an hour later and the cooks will return to the room they share together. “We’ll take all our thaile (bags) to our room, and the wall will become empty.” The clear blue sky shall become clearer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-blue-sky-sighting/story-RiKpL3Yaj8lh3lSqg6tBeM.html

The bamboo sky lamps are made by tribal women from Bhalivali, Bot, Durvesh and Goje villages in Palghar district. The gesture will help in promoting rural bamboo products as well, officials from Raj Bhavan said. Koshyari had visited the Bamboo Project run by Vivek Rural Development Centre in Palghar district in February. He had appealed to citizens to buy the bamboo products manufactured by tribal women to support their income and livelihood and had announced that he will make start the initiative by buying these products for Raj Bhavan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-governor-gifts-bamboo-lamps-made-by-tribal-women-to-raj-bhavan-staff/story-85lIIjYesmkEw4VbKjBWtK.html
13-11-2020||Mumbai||Cricketer Krunal Pandya detained at Mumbai airport||Indian cricketer Krunal Pandya was stopped and questioned by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) at the Mumbai international airport on Thursday. DRI sources said based on specific intelligence, the all-rounder and his wife were detained at Terminal-2 of the airport after their return from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on an Indigo flight around 5pm, following the conclusion of the Indian Premier League (IPL), over suspicion of possessing undisclosed valuables. DRI officers said Pandya had not declared four expensive watches. Customs officers privy to the probe said the watches cost around Rs75 lakh. A senior DRI officer said the case has been handed over to the air intelligence unit of airport customs. Further action will be taken by customs officers. Speaking on the issue, Pandya’s mother Nalini said, “I haven’t heard anything about it. I did not speak to him today.”Under the Customs Act, a passenger can carry items worth Rs50,000 or less as ‘free allowance’ and need not declare it to the customs. However, if a passenger carries an item worth more than Rs50,000, it has be declared to the customs in the red channel area of arrivals and pay around 36% customs duty before exiting the airport. If a passenger is caught with goods worth Rs20 lakh, the customs officers impose a fine. But if a passenger is found carrying goods ranging from Rs20 lakh to Rs1 crore, a fine is imposed on them and they also face arrest. However, in such cases, a passenger can be granted spot bail against cash deposit. But if items above Rs1 crore are not declared, the passenger is arrested and produced before magistrate to seek judicial custody.

13-11-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court upholds Union cabinet committee’s approval for disinvestment of government’s share in BPCL||The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday upheld the November 20, 2019, decision of the cabinet committee of economic affairs (CCEA), headed by the prime minister, to grant in-principle approval for disinvestment of government share in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) – India’s second-largest public sector oil and gas company. The division bench of justice SC Gupte and justice Madhav Jamdar dismissed separate petitions filed by the Federation of all Maharashtra Petrol Dealers Association, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (Refinery) Employees Union, Petroleum Employees Union and some individuals, questioning the validity of the in-principle approval. The petitioners primarily contended that the original business and undertaking of BPCL’s predecessor, Burmah Shell – acquired through an Act of parliament and vested in BPCL by a notification in pursuance of that Act – cannot be disinvested without specific legislative approval from the Parliament. Relying on the Supreme Court (SC) judgment for public interest litigation, they argued that as the original acquisition is under an Act of Parliament, it was not legally permissible for the central government to disinvest its shareholding in BPCL without legislative mandate of the Parliament. They also claimed that the Burmah Shell Acquisition Repelling Act does not amount to such parliamentary approval for the disinvestment. Their counsel, senior advocate Navroz Seervai, submitted that an informed parliamentary approval to disinvestment had to precede any strategic disinvestment by the Union of its controlling stake in the company. The HC, however, said that the Apex court judgment did not support the case of the petitioners. The bench said what the SC held was that if an undertaking was acquired through an Act of Parliament, it cannot be disinvested so long as the law remained on statute book. The SC said that for such disinvestment, the law would have to be repealed or suitably amended to enable the Centre to disinvest its controlling stake or change the public character of the company. The HC also said that the parliament had repealed the Burmah Shell Acquisition Act in 2016. “Absent the statute of acquisition, there is no legal impediment for disinvestment by the Union of its controlling stake in BPCL,” said the bench. The HC also noted that the decision had undergone an elaborate process of consideration at the hands of experts and key government functionaries. The court said the policy decision of acquiring Burmah Shell was based on the economic theory and socio-economic policy prevailing at the time. The central government then considered it to be in public interest, the court said, adding that those considerations have made way for new considerations, informed by a new economic theory and socio-economic policy of efficiency improvement and consumer benefit by making of the current oligopoly of petroleum producers and marketers competitive through a private or non-government player. “The present governing dispensation is well within its powers to take such decision,” said the bench, approving the in-principle approval. The HC noted that Niti Aayog identified BPCL as an ideal undertaking for disinvestment. Niti Aayog recommendations were deliberated at the Core Group of Secretaries on Disinvestment (CGD). The CGD, after taking into account various inputs from expert bodies and different ministries, recommended strategic disinvestment in BPCL, and thereafter the CCEA accorded in-principle approval for the disinvestment. “All this can only lead to conclusion that the policy decision is an informed decision; it cannot be termed as an arbitrary or capricious decision; and it does not offend any constitutional or statutory provisions,” HC concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-upholds-union-cabinet-committee-s-approval-for-disinvestment-of-government-s-share-in-bpcl/story-bbwrf0KOEIxFV70IVpXlWO.html
13-11-2020||Delhi||80% pvt ICU beds to be reserved for Covid-19 care||The Delhi high court allowed the state government on Thursday to reserve 80% of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in 33 private hospitals for Covid-19 patients for two weeks, lifting its own legal hold after noting that the coronavirus outbreak was at alarming new levels in the national Capital. The Delhi government first ordered private hospitals to keep ICU beds aside for critical Covid-19 cases in an order on September 12. A group representing some of these establishments challenged the order, resulting in a stay on September 22 by a single-judge bench that criticised the government’s distinction between Covid and non-Covid critical patients. “In view of the present situation and the spiralling situation that has radically changed in the last three months, the order of September 22, passed by the single judge, is vacated,” a bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said on Thursday.Figures from Delhi government’s hospital resources monitoring showed that as on Thursday morning, a little under 17% of the city’s ICU beds for Covid-19 patients were free. This came a day after the Capital recorded a peak of new cases at 8,593 on Wednesday. On Thursday, new infections were at 7,053 and the city added 104 deaths -- its highest one-day fatality -- since the outbreak began in March. These numbers represent Delhi’s most serious wave of infections yet. In the last week, Delhi added 7,148 cases every day, up from 3,697 in the week ending September 12 when the government first tried to reserve ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. The Delhi government’s legal representatives, additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain and additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, accepted the court’s criticism that the September 12 notification seemed outdated and premature, but pressed on with the request since the situation had now become much more critical.“Empower me (Delhi government) today to address the dynamic situation. Kindly let me enforce for 15 days. We will take steps to complete the deficiency,” the ASG said – a request that was eventually granted. The government representatives faced questions on the preparedness and the timing of its responses on several accounts. “What is the rationale behind selecting these 33 hospitals? What is the density exercise that you have conducted? Is it a random selection? What is the density exposure and how many of the hospitals have been reserved in the Central district of the city with the fourth sero survey report showing increase in the cases? How have the beds been divided,” the judges asked.Responding to these, the ASG said three factors had been taken into account while choosing the 33 hospitals: these had the largest chunk of ICU beds (a total of 2,217), they were popular among residents, and were better equipped to segregate Covid and non-Covid patients as well be able to increase the number of ICU beds if required.Appearing for the Association of Healthcare Providers(India) (AHPI), which challenged the Delhi government order, senior advocate Maninder Singh and advocate Sanyam Khetarpal said the 33 private hospitals already reserved 67% of their ICU beds for Covid patients. Girdhar Gyani, director general of AHPI, said reserving beds creates problem for specialised treatment. “The problem is these are some specialised treatments -- like transplants and complex surgeries -- that do not happen in hospitals other than these 33. Now, it is a fact that more ICU beds are needed and the government could have reserved the same number of ICU beds in 60 other hospitals easily. Treatment for Covid-19 is not that complicated. Now, with these hospitals being forced to reserve the beds, patients who need a liver or kidney transplant might have to travel outside Delhi to avail it,” he said.Gyani hit out at the government, saying there are beds vacant in many government hospitals “because nobody wants to go there”. “The government should be punished for that. Instead, the private players are being punished,” he said.Delhi government representatives did not respond to requests for a comment.The court was also critical of some other aspects of the government’s preparations. “Have you set up helpdesks outside the hospitals? You say that you are running an ambulance facility but how many patients , who are Covid-19 infected, and cannot travel in the public transport, have been ferried and sent to the Radha Soami Beas Satsang facility,” the court asked, referring to one of the city’s largest Covid treatment centres.After hearing the government’s submissions, the court said “no citizen with a health emergency should be made to run from pillar to post if there is a bed available in a hospital”. Before Thursday’s lifting of stay, the matter of reserving beds for Covid-19 patients reached the Supreme Court. On Tuesday, the top court, while refusing to interfere with the Delhi high court’s order, asked the government to again approach the Delhi HC. At the time, ASG Jain had said: “If possible, please understand my predicament. The city is facing an extraordinary situation. Lots of people from other states are coming into Delhi for better health care. A large number of people in the middle class segment in the city prefer to get admitted in private hospitals.” To this, the top court judges said: “We are aware that the situation in city is worsening. Delhi has a problem, sometimes 5,000, sometimes 10,000, this is a fluctuating situation... You can bring this matter to the attention of the high court.” “If the hospitals are overwhelmed and the beds get exhausted, naturally the mortality of the disease will go up. People who are in need of ICU care or oxygen support need it in a timely manner. Also, if we look at Covid-19 cases, most people are preferring to stay in home isolation. These days people also have the oxygen saturation monitors at home. So, chances are those who reach the hospitals are in need of immediate medical attention. If they do not get it, they are likely to die,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of virology at AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/80-pvt-icu-beds-to-be-reserved-for-covid-19-care/story-urx0QEHXj8Fxc5QlRFgxOJ.html

Proprietor of New Mittal Bartan Store, Ghumar Mandi, Ashok Mittal said, “I stocked on a gamut of utensils in steel and brass, expecting a high response, but in vain. Hopefully, this will improve with two days to go for Diwali.”“In my 20 years in this trader, I never saw such a lack-lustre response on Dhanteras. The few customers that did turn up, purchased limited articles. If this continues till Diwali, it will be a bummer, as I was expecting to surmount my losses due to the pandemic during the festive season,” said Sunil Kumar, a shopkeer in Jawahar Nagar.“I have added new stock of mugs, glasses and dinner sets, as people prefer them for Diwali gifting, but due to lack of resources, customers are far and few in between. I am worried about my survival if this continues,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/poor-sales-on-dhanteras-dent-hopes-of-utensil-traders-in-ludhiana/story-aWsql56iNK7grMx2HBCjnO.html
13-11-2020||Mumbai||Round 1 of placements in December: Indian Institutes of Technology see surge in offers||With placements at the premier Indian Institutes of Technology less than a month away, students and the institutes are feeling optimistic with the rise in pre-placement offers (PPOs). The first phase of placements are scheduled to begin on December 1 and will last for seven or 15 days, depending on the number of students registered for placements and the companies that have registered to make job offers.So far, 186 students of IIT Bombay (IIT-B) have received PPOs this year, bypassing last year’s total PPOs of 113. “Most PPOs are a direct outcome of summer internships because this is where companies witness the students’ ability first-hand. For most companies, a student’s score doesn’t matter as much as their work ethic and more often than not, students who performed well during internships get job offers before the placement season kicks off,” said a student representative from IIT-B’s placement cell.At IIT Madras (IITM), 172 PPOs have been offered till date, surpassing last year’s total of 170 PPOs. Pre-placement training is an important aspect of preparation for students. Despite limitations imposed by the ongoing pandemic, most IITs managed to conduct virtual training sessions this year. “Even with the lockdown, the student team was able to organise a soft-skill session for students who are participating in placements this year,” said CS Shankar Ram, advisor (training and placement), IITM.PPOs at IIT Roorkee and Hyderabad also rose compared to last year. Vinay Sharma, professor-in-charge of placements at IIT Roorkee, said that as of November 1, students of IIT-Roorkee have received 149 PPOs, which is higher than the 140 PPOs received by the previous batch by the first week of November last year.Similarly, PPOs received by students of IIT-Hyderabad stood at 37 last year but this year, 46 offers have already been received. Students expect these numbers to rise. Fifteen students at IIT-Patna have received PPOs this year, compared to 23 last year.A handful of IITs are currently waiting for more PPOs to be confirmed, especially since this process goes on until a day before the first phase of placements begins on December 1. A spokesperson for the placement cell of IIT Delhi (IIT-D) told HT that the number of PPOs received by the institute as of November 2 was above 135. “PPOs are looking great, despite the prevailing situation [of economic slowdown],” said the spokesperson. Last year, IIT-D had received over 164 PPOs. This year due to the lockdown, placement interviews, group discussions and tests will be conducted online across IITs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/round-1-of-placements-in-december-indian-institutes-of-technology-see-surge-in-offers/story-wjVU6ka1khvx4NM3IJHRkJ.html

13-11-2020||Chandigarh||Two proclaimed offenders arrested, sent to judicial custody||A couple, which was declared proclaimed offender in 2014, has been arrested, police said on Thursday. The accused are Tapasvi Bhardwaj and his wife Pooja Bhardwaj, both 45 and residents of Sector 49. But presently, they were staying in Kurukshetra, the police said. The accused are directors of Yum Travel Services based in Chandigarh’s Sector 34 and used to deal in booking of air tickets. The accused had reportedly bought tickets from Vikaram Kaushal of Blue Sky Worldwide Travel in Sector 34 and issued a cheque of ₹5 lakh that was dishonoured. A case under Sections 406, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at the Sector-34 police station on the complaint of Kaushal and five others in February 2008. The police said that they all were victims of forged tickets and dishonoured cheques. Another case was registered on the complaint of Mukhitar Singh and nine other complainants in September 2008. Mukhtiar said he had purchased a ticket from the accused in September 2007 and on reaching Delhi airport the next month, he found that the Thai Airways ticket issued to him was fake.

13-11-2020||Chandigarh||Gangster Dilpreet arranged weapons used to kill Bishnoi’s aide outside Chandigarh mall: SSP||After initial denial, gangster Dilpreet Singh Dhahan, alias Baba, 28, has admitted to have supplied weapons to eliminate members of the rival Lawrence Bishnoi gang, Chandigarh Police said on Thursday. During his sustained interrogation into the Gurlal Brar murder case, Dilpreet — who was brought to Chandigarh from the Sangrur jail on production warrants on November 6 — reportedly told police that he had procured “a large consignment of arms and ammunition from Madhya Pradesh” before being arrested in a police encounter at Sector 43, Chandigarh, in July 2018.Brar, 26, a close aide of Lawrence Bishnoi and a former student leader, was gunned down by bike-borne men outside a mall in Chandigarh’s Industrial Area past midnight on October 11. Hours after the incident, slain gangster Davinder Bambiha’s group had taken responsibility.After Bambiha’s encounter in 2016, Dilpreet along with Sukhpreet, alias Budha, had been running the gang. With both in jail, their accomplice Gaurav Patial, alias Lucky, is now calling the shots from Armenia.Running an extortion racket in the tricity area, the Bambiha group are at loggerheads with Lawrence Bishnoi and Sampat Nehra gang, both of whom are also lodged in different jails.“The Bishnoi gang had been extorting businessmen, from whom the Bambiha group had been collecting protection money. This pitted the two gangs against each other,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh, adding that Dilpreet supplied weapons to his gang members to eliminate the rivals and “these were used” for the purpose.Dilpreet, Sukhpreet on same track Both Dilpreet and Sukhpreet, who too has been brought on production warrants, have named Brar’s shooters as Neeraj Gupta, alias Chaska, and Ajay, alias Maan, alias Mani, said Gurmukh Singh, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, east). “Their possible hideouts are being raided. The duo, who belong Jaiton in Faridkot, are also wanted by Punjab Police in many murder cases registered in various districts,” said the DSP. Both Dilpreet and Sukhpreet have reportedly admitted that Brar was killed on the directions of Gaurav Patial and another gang member Vinay Deora. The main motive was to avenge the murder of their associate Lavi Deora, who was allegedly killed by Bishnoi’s gang at a fair in Faridkot’s Kotkapura in 2017, in which Brar had reportedly played an active role. Lavi was Vinay’s younger brother. Sukhpreet was brought to Chandigarh from the Sangrur jail on production warrants, to interrogate him in another case, pertaining to the murder of bouncer-turned-financier Surjit Singh in Sector 38 in March this year. Both Dilpreet and Sukhpreet were produced in court on Thursday. While Dilpreet has been sent to judicial custody, Sukhpreet’s police remand has been extended by a day. More weapons recoveredOn disclosure’s made by Dilpreet, police have recovered four illegal weapons. A .32 bore pistol was recovered from one Gurdeep Singh, alias Deepa, of Raipur village in Ropar, who was arrested at a naka in the Industrial Area on November 9, following information provided by Dilpreet. Police said Gurdeep, who hails from Dilpreet’s adjoining village, is into mining and had taken the weapon from the gangster. Two .32 bore pistols and one countrymade weapon were recovered from near a drain in the Industrial Area, where they had been hidden by Dilpreet, said police. Police said the weapons were kept for further distribution to the gang member, as and when required by them to kill active members of the rival group. Separate FIRs have been registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gangster-dilpreet-arranged-weapons-used-to-kill-bishnoi-s-aide-outside-chandigarh-mall-ssp/story-tkKSKNEXdeIDDV2WQl0lhI.html

The order was passed by a high court bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh during resumed hearing of the case, which was brought to the high court last week.“The petitioner may bring his produce within the territory of Haryana or Punjab, however, he shall not be entitled to sell his produce at any designated grain market, market yard, market place or any other area notified as principal market or sub-market yard of the market, special market or any other place meant and notified for the sale or purchase of the agricultural produce; under the Haryana Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961 and the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961,” the bench said. The matter has been adjourned till December 9 and a response has been sought from the Centre, Punjab and Haryana.The farmer, Virender Kumar, had approached the high court on November 4, stating that though the Centre’s new agriculture law permits sale of crops in any part of the country, he was not being allowed to bring produce from Uttar Pradesh into Haryana. He had told court that Section 3 of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, provides absolute freedom to farmers to sell produce anywhere in the country. But he was not being allowed to sell his produce in Haryana.The farmer belongs to Karnal and he had sown paddy on around 75-acre land owned by his family in Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh. He had harvested about 1,650 quintals of paddy from his fields and intended to sell it in Haryana, where the Food Corporation of India and other agencies are purchasing it at a minimum support price of ₹1, 888 per quintal. He could not register himself on the Haryana government’s portal, ‘Meri fasal, mera byora’. When he was bringing around 650 quintals of paddy in four trolleys to sell in Karnal, he was stopped on October 24, stating that produce from UP cannot be sold in the state, he had told the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-allows-karnal-farmer-to-bring-produce-from-up-but-not-sell-it-in-apmc-mandis/story-OiP5aPadMRyFleP7abkNqN.html

13-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh can host domestic games comfortably amid pandemic, says UTCA official||Having hosted a number of under-19, under-23 and Ranji Trophy matches successfully last season, the UT Cricket Association (UTCA) is keen on organising games in the upcoming domestic season as well, by making a bio-bubble.This was stated by UTCA joint secretary Yuvraj Mahajan, who was invited by the Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) to attend the final of the 13th Indian Premier League (IPL 13) in Dubai on November 10. A meeting in this regard was to be held in Dubai, but was postponed and will now be held post Diwali.Sharing his experience of meeting BCCI chief Sourav Ganguly, secretary Jay Shah and treasurer Arun Dhumal, Mahajan said, “BCCI officials successfully organised IPL 13 creating a bio-bubble, and set an example for others. They are very optimistic about the upcoming domestic season and IPL 13 will give them a boost.”Mahajan thinks Chandigarh is the best bet to provide a bio-bubble for domestic matches as there are more than five grounds here, a lot of hotels and the travelling time is less. “Ganguly was very impressed with Chandigarh’s debut season. He praised and lauded UTCA. We are going to push Chandigarh’s name for hosting domestic matches amid the pandemic. We have the resources and can do it,” said Mahajan.The domestic season was postponed owing to the outbreak. It was earlier slated to get underway in September, but now the BCCI president has said in an interview that it will be held in January 2021.A meeting in the runup to the domestic season will be held after Diwali. Chandigarh had received BCCI affiliation last season and several of its men and women teams had also qualified to the Elite group from the Plate group.Mahajan said he also met officials from the Chhattisgarh Cricket Association, Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association and Punjab Cricket Association and all agreed, he added, on organising practice matches in the coming months among their state teams in Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-can-host-domestic-games-comfortably-amid-pandemic-says-utca-official/story-nnLTPvtz2Q8pMkVA6Vd3CL.html

While two-wheeler sales were down by half as compared to past few years, four-wheelers saw a better response, yet remained limited to around 90% of the expected sales.Sanju Chawla, manager at Honda Pioneer, near Dholewal Chowk, said, “The financial crunch being faced by consumers was taking a toll on the automobile business as well. While earlier, we used to remain busy all day on Dhanteras, we recorded barely half the sales this year.” “Apart from the Covid-19 pandemic, the high cost of BS-VI vehicles as compared to BS-IV vehicles and closure of colleges has also affected the sales, as the younger target group is not buying two-wheelers this year,” he added.The usual festive rush was indeed missing, said Ramesh, manager at Kailash Hero on GT Road near Sherpur Chowk, adding that the middle class was their primary customer base for two-wheelers, but they had called off their purchases due to the outbreak hitting their budgets. On the other hand, four-wheeler dealers reported a better response, saying the festive season had given them a reason to cheer as opposed to the post-lockdown period when the sales had dived severely. “The business is getting back on track gradually due to festivals. Though not a perfect 100%, we still achieved 90% of our sales targets on Thursday,” said Goldy Beri, sales manager at Gulzar Motors Private Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/festive-season-drives-auto-sales-in-ludhiana-but-dealers-still-left-wanting-for-more/story-O0cBVHEELNe4ROyP7o8NtL.html

13-11-2020||Delhi||LSR to extend fee deadline, says will disburse scholarships faster||Days after the death by suicide of a Lady Shri Ram College student, who was reportedly struggling to cope with her online education, the college administration has agreed to some of the demands put forward by students who had gathered to protest outside the campus on Thursday morning, including swift disbursal of scholarships and extension of the deadline for fee payment. The college has also agreed to make available the services of two online counsellors for students, throughout the week.The undergraduate student died by suicide on November 2 in Telangana after being stressed for days as the college had asked second-year hostellers to vacate their rooms by November 10, her parents said. In 2019, the college had introduced a new policy limiting its hostel to first-year students only. This was done to ensure reservation for students from other backward classes (OBC) and economically weaker section (EWS) categories.It has been a longstanding demand of students to revoke that policy and they reiterated the demand on Thursday as well. Students also submitted a memorandum of demands to the college administration and these included distribution of tablets and data packs for online classes; allowing students to pay only tuition fee this year and no other fee components, option to pay fee in instalments and extension of the last date of payment deadline. They have also asked for recording of class lectures and extension of the last date for submission of assignments.They also asked the college to form a committee with student representation to look into issues faced by marginalised students and to introduce more need-based scholarships.Unnimaya P, general secretary of LSR students’ union and a member of Students Federation of India (SFI), said, “The principal has assured us that the administration will ensure swift disbursal of scholarships and provide more scholarships (for needy students). The deadline for fee payment has been extended and the college would consider a fee waiver as well.” She also said the college is also reviewing its hostel policy.“Submission dates for internal assessment have been extended and (the college) will make available the services of two online counsellors throughout the week,” Unnimaya said.LSR principal Suman Sharmas did not respond to repeated requests for comment from HT.Mudra, a member of SFI’s LSR unit, said, “The LSR administration has never heeded the pleas of the student community. The response from the administration now is welcome but there are more demands to be met.”A group of students, affiliated to the All India Students’ Association (AISA), also protested outside the University Grants Commission headquarters on Thursday demanding the disbursal of pending fellowships and fee waiver for students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lsr-to-extend-fee-deadline-says-will-disburse-scholarships-faster/story-gfhXVIZLyRBZVtGifpFo4L.html
13-11-2020||Mumbai||BJP urges Maharashtra government to challenge acquittal of Mumbai’s Kamala Mills fire accused||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has urged the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to challenge the acquittal of the two accused in the Kamala Mills fire case. BJP’s former Mumbai unit chief and member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) from Bandra Ashish Shelar raised concerns over the acquittal of the owners of the Mills and questioned if this will help other accused to escape scot-free from the case that claimed 14 innocent lives in 2017. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said the Mumbai civic body and state government would consider the details of the court order and then plan the future course of legal action.Shelar wrote to Thackeray on Thursday demanding to appeal against the acquittal of accused in the high court. Shelar said that the owners of the Kamala Mills Compound - Ramesh Gowani and Ravi Bhandari have been acquitted by the session court two days ago and this could lead to the acquittal of other ten accused if the case was not properly represented by the police, civic body and the state government.Over 14 people were killed in a massive fire that erupted at 1 Above restaurant and Mojos Bistro pub on December 29, 2017. Twelve people including owners of the Mills were booked holding them responsible. The owners had claimed to be innocent and said that they couldn’t be held responsible for the fire.“Both of them appeared to be prime accused in the fire case. Their acquittal is serious. We had raised questions over the floor space index (FSI) fraud in the Mills compound after the incident. Our government had put the culprits behind the bars, but they have now been acquitted in Thackeray government’s rule. People will raise questions if the government was shielding owners of the restaurants and pubs. To avoid any such blame, the state government should move the upper court challenging the acquittal,” he said.Shelar has said that the panel appointed to probe the fire had stated in the report that the FSI scam had taken place in the Mills compound.He has also demanded to inquire into if the government pleaders failed to argue properly in the case. He has expressed the need to appoint eminent lawyers in the high court to take the case to the logical end.Mayor Kishori Pednekar said that the state government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will look into the case and move the upper court if the need be.“This is a decision given by the court and one should not politicise it. BMC, state government and their legal departments will look into the court ruling and also check if the case was properly represented in court. Shelar should not play politics into it and take a convenient stand,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-urges-maharashtra-government-to-challenge-acquittal-of-mumbai-s-kamala-mills-fire-accused/story-6qozfbwvvq121P4M0vfSSO.html
13-11-2020||City||This Dhanteras, gold jewellery loses gleam, silver shines in Ludhiana||Even as residents turned up in large numbers to purchase gold and silver jewellery, considered auspicious on the occasion of Dhanteras, jewellers said the response was limited to around 60% as compared to previous years.This, they attributed to the economic crisis due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the high rates of the precious metals. But, what further dented the sales was confusion among residents about the date of Dhanteras, with some believing it’s on Friday and not Thursday.The fact that the rate of gold (22 carat) dropped by over Rs 2,000 over the last two days to settle at Rs 48,900 for 10 grams didn’t reflect in the sales, which were dominated by silver, available for Rs 64,700/kg.“The footfall is obviously lower this year due to the financial crunch being faced by residents. Customers’ purchase capacity has reduced and there was also some confusion about when Dhanteras actually is, with some saying it is on Friday. So, we may see some sales then,” said Naveen, owner of Star Jewellers on Cemetery Road, near Fountain Chowk.Special festive offers also failed to elicit shopping enthusiasm, as residents stuck to lower quantities.“Despite announcing offers, the response at my store was limited to 60% as compared to previous years, primarily due to high gold prices,” said Karan Arneja, owner of White Dazzle on Char Khamba Road in Model Town.However, Prince Babbar, president of the Ludhiana Swarnkar Sangh (Sarafa Bazar), said, the response may be lower, but was still appreciable, as the jewellery sector was going through a slump since the lockdown.President of the Ludhiana Jewellers’ Association, Anand Sikri said, “The actual response can be gauged after Friday when more customers are expected to turn up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/this-dhanteras-gold-jewellery-loses-lustre-silver-shines/story-M9D2x83UP9AHGcRn2RvZAJ.html
13-11-2020||Delhi||104 more Covid-19 fatalities in Delhi, highest in a single day||Even as the number of new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the city dipped to 7,053 on Thursday, Delhi recorded the most deaths due to the infection in a single day, amid fears that the city’s medical infrastructure was struggling to keep up with the sharp spike in cases. With 104 deaths, the city’s toll reached 7,332.So far, the most deaths reported in a day was 101 during the June-July surge in cases, when protocols for treatment were still being worked out. The highest number of deaths recorded in the daily health bulletin had been on June 16, when 437 deaths were added to the toll while the city reconciled its fatality data. Despite the increase, Delhi’s case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of people who die among those who test positive – remained at 1.57%, slightly higher than the national CFR of 1.47%. The 10-day average disease CFR, however, tipped over 1% — increasing from 0.99% on Wednesday to 1.03% on Thursday. Experts have said the CFR had dropped in the city and across the country as doctors realised non-invasive ventilation worker better than mechanical ventilators and that giving steroids reduced deaths. However, experts said the non-availability of intensive care unit beds (ICU) could increase mortality. “If the hospitals are overwhelmed and the beds get exhausted, naturally the mortality of the disease will go up. People who are in need of ICU care or oxygen support need it in a timely manner,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of virology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). To mitigate the problem, the Delhi government had increased 500 beds — of which 110 were ICU beds — in eight of its hospitals. The Delhi high court’s decision to allow the government to reserve up to 80% of the total ICU beds in 33 big private hospitals will add several beds to the city’s total 16,609 in the coming days. The Delhi government had on Wednesday also written to the Centre to increase Covid-19 beds by 1,000 and ICU beds by 300 in its hospitals “We still have around 8,000 Covid-19 beds available across hospitals in the city. And, for the treatment of Covid-19 patients we do not need ventilators. But ICU beds are needed to monitor the patients and provide oxygen and non-invasive ventilation,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday during a media interaction. To reduce mortality due to the infection, the state government has also ordered all its testing centres to check the patients’ oxygen saturation to prevent deaths from “happy hypoxia”, where a person does not have any apparent breathlessness even as their oxygen saturation drops. “The biggest reason for death due to Covid-19 is a drop in oxygen saturation. So, we have asked our centres to test the oxygen level of the patients undergoing Covid-19 test so that even if they do not feel other symptoms they can receive timely treatment,” Jain had said a day ago. This comes even as the city recorded the highest number of the more accurate RT-PCR tests — 19,752 — on Thursday. The alternate rapid antigen test, which accounted for over 67% of the total tests conducted on Wednesday, are known to throw false negatives. This also reduced the positivity rate to 11.7% on Thursday from 13.40% recorded a day ago. As long as this number is above 8%, the outbreak is believed to be bigger than what the current number of tests can effectively identify. “”The general rule of thumb to check whether testing is adequate is a sustained positivity rate of 5% or less. What are you testing with matters as well? The ICMR testing strategy has to be followed. Anyone outside the containment areas have to be tested using RT PCR which is much more accurate. Another thing we need to see is how many tests are needed for us to find one positive cases. If that number is coming down, then we aren’t testing enough,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology and infectious diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-records-104-covid-19-fatalities-most-in-a-single-day/story-4FUOvqWqFNIqOksKdBu02L.html
13-11-2020||Delhi||Man kills sister-in-law, walks to DCP office with her daughter||An electrician killed his widowed sister-in-law on Tuesday afternoon and walked with the woman’s three-year-old daughter to the office of the deputy commissioner of police to confess and surrender, the police said.The suspect and his sister-in-law were to be married soon, but the woman did not want to stay with her mother-in-law, the police said about the alleged dispute that would trigger frequent quarrels and eventually led to the murder.Ved Prakash Surya, DCP (north-east), whose office premises the suspect visited to confess, said the alleged killer has been arrested and booked for murder.The DCP identified the suspect as 26-year-old Rohit alias Monu, a resident of Karawal Nagar.“Rohit’s older brother had married the victim in 2013. The couple had a six-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter,” the DCP said.But in 2017, Rohit’s brother died by suicide. The DCP said the reason behind the step is not known.After her husband’s death, the woman had moved to her parents’ home with her two children. But in January, Rohit brought the woman and her two children back to his home.“Rohit and his sister-in-law had been living together for the past many months. They planned to get married soon,” the DCP said.But along with them lived Rohit’s mother, which the police said the woman was allegedly not comfortable about. “The victim had been compelling Rohit to either send his mother to live elsewhere or move to a rented home away from her,” the DCP said, quoting the suspect.The police are questioning Rohit’s family and neighbours to find the reason behind the quarrels.Around 2.30 pm on Tuesday, the duo again fought over the same issue at their home in Karawal Nagar.“During the quarrel, Rohit strangled his sister-in-law to death. Her son was at a relative’s home and daughter was playing outside their house,” said the DCP.The suspect locked the house from outside, picked up the little girl and walked to the DCP’s office. “As soon as he confessed to the murder, we alerted the local police,” the DCP said.The suspect accompanied a police team to the crime scene where the victim was found lying dead.The two orphaned children have been handed over to their maternal grandparents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-man-kills-widowed-sister-in-law-walks-to-dcp-office-with-her-daughter-to-confess/story-eQ8CmA96RAFtBzSdaOTyKO.html
13-11-2020||Delhi||A slight breather for Delhi but Diwali may be ‘severe’||Experts on Thursday warned that violations of the ban on firecrackers on Diwali, coupled with slower, north-westerly winds carrying stubble burning smoke, will likely push Delhi’s air pollution back into the ‘severe’ levels it witnessed earlier this week. Scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that even though the city’s air quality index (AQI) improved to the lower range of ‘very poor’ on Thursday, thanks to stronger winds, the situation will likely deteriorate from Friday. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that on Thursday, Delhi’s overall AQI was 314, in the ‘very poor’ category. On Wednesday, the AQI was 344, also very poor. Firecrackers could lead to Mumbai’s worst air pollution post-Diwali in 6 years: SAFARDiwali will be celebrated on Saturday.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said winds blowing over Delhi will start slowing down from Friday, and their direction will switch to north-westerly, which will increase the contribution of stubble-burning smoke from Punjab and Haryana. “Even though we have forecast that this Diwali is likely to be better compared to the last few years, the weather is expected to be unfavourable. If people in the city burst crackers, then the pollution level could slip to ‘severe’ on Diwali day and a day after,” Soni said. The Capital’s AQI was ‘severe’ for six days, starting November 6. The city got minor relief on Wednesday and Thursday, when the AQI was very poor category after winds shifted direction, blowing in from the east, and carrying minimal smoke from farm fires.Smoke from farm fires contributed to just 3% of Delhi’s PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter) levels on Wednesday, the lowest since October 14.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that from Diwali afternoon the wind speed will dip to nearly 6kmph. “From Diwali evening the air quality is likely to start deteriorating. However, from Sunday night the wind direction is expected to change again to easterly and there is also a possibility of light rain,” Srivastava said. The IMD forecast said that wind speeds are likely to improve from Monday. The Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), also released a similar forecast for Delhi’s air quality for the Diwali weekend. “The stubble burning induced impact in AQI is expected to increase from negligible to moderate for the next two days,” the Safar forecast read. The forecast, however, said that even if residents do not burn any crackers, the PM2.5 level is still expected to be on the higher-end of ‘very poor’ or the lower-end of ‘severe’ category. However, despite unfavourable weather conditions, the forecast said the AQI is expected to be better this year, as compared to Diwali day and the days after the festival for the past four years. “Even a smaller increment in the local additional emission is likely to have significant deterioration impact on November 14 and November 15, and may push the AQI in the severe category,” read the Safar forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/weather-likely-to-be-unfavourable-on-diwali-weekend-crackers-to-make-it-worse-warn-imd-and-safar/story-qy4bvcfmfoM6IiWTbzCB7K.html
13-11-2020||Delhi||Man dies in judicial custody a day after assault over bid to steal truck||A 24-year-old man died in judicial custody on Thursday, a day after he was allegedly caught stealing a truck and assaulted by its owner and the public in north-east Delhi’s Kabir Nagar, the police said. His family has alleged that he was tortured at Welcome police station. Deputy commissioner of police (north-east) Ved Prakash Surya denied this. Surya said Mesar was medically examined before being sent him to Mandoli jail. “A judicial inquiry by a metropolitan magistrate has been initiated,” Surya said. On Wednesday, around 2.50am, the DCP said, police were informed that a vehicle thief was caught on the 100 feet road in Kabir Nagar. A team from the Welcome police reached the spot and met one Hira Lal Kamra, who produced Mesar. Kamra told police that he caught Mesar with the help of locals and they assaulted him before informing the police, the DCP said. “Mesar was sent to Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital where he was examined. A case under sections 379 (theft) and 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) of the IPC was registered,” said Surya. Around midnight, the DCP said, Mesar complained of pain and was admitted to Hedgewar Hospital, where he died. Mesar’s relative Abdul Waseem said he was a cab driver and lived in Pul Prahladpur. “We went to the police station but were not allowed to meet him. We spoke to him over an officer’s phone. He told us that he was in pain. We suspect that he succumbed to injuries caused by police torture,” Waseem said. DCP Surya said, “Mesar was not assaulted by police. We are initiating legal action against the truck owner and others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-caught-for-theft-dies-in-judicial-custody-family-alleges-torture/story-4HLdxEvsFpqvejKQMD9p6I.html
13-11-2020||Delhi||FB officials stepped in to bend rules: Ex-employee||A former employee of social media company Facebook deposed on Thursday before the Delhi Assembly’s peace and harmony committee, recounting what he said were instances of the company’s top officials intervening to bend content policing rules. The remarks were made by Mark S Luckie, who worked as a manager with Facebook’s Global Influencers department between October 2017 and November 2018 – a stint during which he claimed to be involved with several teams that handle the company’s core functions.“Mr Luckie affirmed that there have been repeated interferences by top officials of Facebook teams, including their policy heads at the instance of the political parties upon the content moderation teams which has caused eventual compromise in the execution of their own community standards… Thus, in turn contributes in disruption of peace and harmony in the society. He also asserted that there would be more peace and a harmonious situation if the Facebook was allowing its content moderators to work freely and true to the guidelines,” said the committee’s chairperson Raghav Chadha in a statement after the deposition.The committee is looking at the possible role Facebook played in fanning the communal violence in north-east Delhi in February that claimed 53 lives. The committee’s scrutiny came following a string of reports from news outlets that accused Facebook executives of bending rules on hate speech and unlawful content in order to protect business and political interests.“Mr Luckie also spoke about the recruitment process of the top heads of the company where he signified that for an extremely important post like that of Public Policy Head, persons having cordial government relations or having special political affiliations and who have strong hold on lobbying within the government are preferred, a practice which in itself casts a shadow of doubt on the ‘politically agnostic management’ stance which Facebook often tries to shields under,” the panel’s statement added. It said that “he (Luckie) also asserted the events like Delhi communal clashes, Myanmar genocide and Sri Lanka Communal violence could have been easily averted had Facebook acted in a more proactive and prompt manner.”Facebook representatives did not respond to requests for comment.Luckie’s deposition is the latest in a string of people who have looked into Facebook’s operations. The committee also summoned Facebook India vice-president and managing director Ajit Mohan, who challenged it in the Supreme Court. The panel told the court that it had summoned Mohan as a “witness”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/facebook-officials-stepped-in-to-bend-rules-former-employee-tells-delhi-house-panel/story-sdLaxDBgON9Fe3H2k6sFwL.html

13-11-2020||Delhi||Teachers to check Covid violations in North MCD areas||The North Delhi Municipal Corporation has prepared a plan to keep a check on Covid-19 violations ahead of Diwali at markets and shopping complexes. The municipal body has roped in teachers and officials from the engineering department to deploy additional monitoring teams in public places. The drive, which will continue till November 17, and the enhanced vigil will cover not just main markets but also shopping areas at ward and local levels.In a circular issued Wednesday, the corporation said that in view of crowding in market places and shopping complexes, teams will stay on the field from 1pm-11pm to enforce Covid-19 guidelines. “These teams will comprise six primary teachers per ward and all the assistant engineers and junior engineers of their respective wards. Apart from them, licensing inspectors, officials from health and malaria departments, and enforcement department will also be part of these vigilance teams. We are short of staff and this is an “all hands on the deck” situation,” a senior official of the north body said, requesting anonymity.The official added that the vigilance teams of this “Diwali Plan” will not only ensure that people are maintaining social distancing and wearing masks, but also educate them about the pandemic and issue fines to violators, be it a shopper or shopkeeper. They will also have to submit an action taken report comprising information on the number of fines issued and the amount collected. Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said the number of coronavirus cases are spiking in the city and due to the festival season the crowd has also increased in markets. “It is an unprecedented scenario where we need to crowd control and ensure their exposure to the virus remains minimal. So special teams have been formed in each zone. Generally, the enforcement related to Covid-19 is handled by the health, malaria and licensing departments, but now we have included teachers and engineers in the vigil so that we can cover the maximum area and fine violators,” Prakash said.However, the decision did not go down well with the teachers’ body in the north municipality.“We don’t support this decision as teachers are already engaged in online classes and are working without salary. Sending them into crowded markets during a pandemic is not fair,” Kuldeep Khatri, president, Shikshak Sangthan Samanvay Samiti, North Corporation, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-civic-body-ropes-in-teachers-engineers-to-step-up-covid-vigil-in-markets/story-OqDbtOoeRAVvxOkxWTNK5O.html
13-11-2020||City||121 stubble burning incidents, 60 FIRs in Mohali in one month||Even as the district administration appointed rapid response teams to curb stubble burning, as many as 121 cases have been reported in Mohali in the past one month, up from 82 throughout the season last year. More than half the cases (66) have been reported from the Dera Bassi subdivision, while Kharar accounts for 32 and Mohali for 23 cases.“In the survey, teams found 50% of the total fields are under stubble burning. Till November 12, we have imposed a fine of ₹3 lakh as environmental penalty on 121 farmers found burning stubble in their fields,” said Girish Dayalan, deputy commissioner, Mohali. Last year, fines worth ₹2.55 were imposed.Also, as compared to just eight FIRs registered last year, the Mohali police have booked 59 farmers under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and one under the air pollution Act in the past one month.The area under paddy cultivation in the district is around 25,800 hectares, which is expected to result in 1.29 lakh quintals of crop residue.Fine for stubble burning on farmland of less than two acres is ₹2,500; for fields of two to five acres, it is ₹5,000; and for over five acres, it is ₹15,000.“We are trying our level best to control stubble burning, but farmers continue to flout rules. Directions have been issued to the revenue department to make red entries in the land records of offenders,” said a senior official of the district administration, not wishing to be named. Red entry means the farmer will not be eligible for any government facility or loan from any bank or institution. As part of efforts to curb stubble burning, rapid response teams were constituted along with appointment of village-level nodal officers to monitor the area under their jurisdiction and report stubble burning. The teams have been trained to use a mobile app, through which they will share on-the-spot action taken. It is mandatory for every official to update the action taken in a stipulated period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/121-stubble-burning-incidents-60-firs-in-mohali-in-one-month/story-Fgwvzm4bbwohuvPR9qaPBK.html
13-11-2020||City||Residents of housing society in Mohali struggle for basic amenities||The residents of Emaar, Sector 108, have been struggling with proper access to basic amenities for the past several months. The residents are facing problems due to bad road conditions, accumulated water in foundations of plots under construction, and poor drainage system. Around 100 families are residing in the locality. PL Garg, who is constructing his house on plot number 197, said, “We have been suffering for the past several months due to the poor drainage system. Despite several complaints to the concerned authorities, no action has been taken so far.” He further said, “Last week, a truck loaded with sand got stuck near our plot as the road/ drainage system caved in due to poor quality of work.” Another resident Daljit Singh said that the internal roads are in bad shape. “They are charging Rs 1,000 per month for maintenance but are not repairing them. I have even written to the chief minister of Punjab to intervene,” he said. The residents alleged that the authorities have left the water drainage system outlet open near the plots as a result of which water gets accumulated between the locality and the railway line. It has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes/insects and may spread diseases like dengue etc., besides emanating foul smell. The spokesperson of Emaar could not be contacted for comments even after repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/residents-of-housing-society-in-mohali-cry-for-basic-amenities/story-FipNyxYVNxobVznJnyHitL.html

Speaking about this, union president Bhag Singh Kairon said, “The promotion cases of teachers were announced two years back, yet they still haven’t been promoted even as some of them have started retiring now. The senior secondary classes are being taught by junior basic trained (JBT) and TGTs in most of the schools due to an acute shortage of lecturers. “ Adding to this, chairman Savinder Singh said, “The department is planning to restrict teachers to avail two C-leaves each for November and December, which is highly objectionable. There is strong resentment in the teaching community. Teachers are already overburdened as they are taking online classes as well as offline.” Secretary Ranbir Rana added that if promotion orders of eligible TGTs are not issued within this month, the union will call a general house meeting of teachers in the first week of December to discuss the next course of action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-teachers-union-demands-promotion-of-tgts/story-XXLP2CAFE3O3fXTQE8FczN.html
13-11-2020||Mumbai||Second Covid-19 wave likely in Maharashtra in January-February: Health department advisory||Anticipating a possible second wave of Covid-19 in Maharashtra around January 2021, the state health department has issued an advisory for municipal bodies and district administrations in the state to be prepared for a surge. Maharashtra achieved a peak in infections in September and is now seeing a downward trend in the daily number of cases for four-five weeks. However, with further relaxations on the movement of people, festive season and ongoing winter, there is a fear of a possible surge is cases.In the advisory dated November 11, the department cited the second wave in European nations and said, “Like in European nations, we could face a second wave in January-February…” The advisory called for increased testing up to the capacity of laboratories and also for a firecracker-free Diwali, as it would add to the discomfort of coronavirus patients and those suffering from lung ailments.Also read: Don’t step out, celebrate Diwali from homes: Maharashtra CM Uddhav ThackerayMeanwhile, Maharashtra added 4,496 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday, pushing the tally to 17,36,329. Maharashtra also reported 122 fatalities, taking the toll to 45,682. Of the 122 deaths, 85 occurred within the past 48 hours, while 37 deaths occurred in the past week, a state health department statement said. The active cases in the state stood at 84,627, while the recovery rate improved to 92.44%. Mumbai added 858 new cases on Thursday, taking its tally to 267,606. It also reported 19 deaths, pushing the toll to 10,525.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the health infrastructure was prepared to tackle the surge, but added that the possibility of a second wave is low. Members of the state-appointed Covid-19 task force said the second wave, if it does happen, could hit by December-end. Health experts said aggressive Covid-19 appropriate behaviour was the only way to mitigate it, while continuing aggressive testing tracing and isolation.Tope said people should celebrate Diwali, but while doing so, they must follow all protocol and rules that are in place to contain the spread of Covid-19. “It is not some rocket science — social distancing, masks and sanitising are what people have to follow. I have given instructions [to all district and municipal bodies] to remain prepared. The peak Maharashtra achieved was about 25,000 [cases in a day], even if it [the second wave] goes above that by 10%-20%, we are prepared for it, in terms of doctors, other staff, drugs, hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen etc,” Tope said.The health minister said the possibility of a second wave hitting the state is low. “But since winter has set in, and viruses get a boost in this weather, we have to remain more vigilant and prepared,” he said.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Covid-19 task force, said that with the temperature in many parts of Maharashtra going below 10 degrees, with pollution, and further unlocking, Maharashtra is likely to have a second wave. “I am predicting that the second wave will be from December-end to January-end. But everybody has a different prediction model,” he said.The member on the task force added that people have not followed Covid-appropriate behaviour during the festive period. “There is zero masking and zero physical distancing for Diwali shopping across Maharashtra. Secondly, there is crowding and there is a lot of cross migration from villages, towns and cities. More the transportation of people, more would be the spread of the virus. People think Covid has gone, it is irresponsible behaviour. The way Delhi has seen a surge with dropping temperatures, even we can see that. We should not remain off guard.”According to Joshi, the situation in Mumbai has improved, but the risk has not passed for Mumbai. He said that the slum population might have been more exposed to the virus in the first wave, only about 20% of the people living in high-rises have been exposed to the virus, keeping the threat intact.“There is a large exposure of virus in the lower economic strata like slums. Already 70-80% of them are exposed to the virus and whether they have developed some sort of immunity or not we will know in the next by December-end. Most of the Mumbai high-rises, the exposure is 10-20%, the risk for Mumbai still stays. Many people migrate from the north to Mumbai because of the cold wave, we have to remain on guard,” he said.Also read: Mumbai sees dip in daily Covid-19 tests ahead of Diwali: BMC dataThe advisory from the health department has stressed on continuing testing as per the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). “There should not be any negligence in testing. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has stated that 140 tests should be done daily for every 10 lakh people. It is mentioned in our rules as well, and therefore it must be followed,” the advisory stated.Joshi said that state lacks in testing and tracing and only utilises 50% of the testing capacity in the state. “We are still poor at testing and tracing. We are only using 50% of our testing capacity. The other disturbing trend is that people are not testing at all. If they see symptoms, they start treatment. So we do not pick up the true number of cases,” he said.According to public health experts, masks are the only medicine so far to combat the virus. Dr Sanjay Pattiwar, a public health expert said, “People have to wear masks, maintain sanitisation and physical distancing.” Joshi added, “It is still 12 to 18 months for Maharashtra to get a vaccine so the only way now is masking.”In terms of health infrastructure, Mumbai and Pune are better prepared, Joshi said. “We have a shortage of ICU beds. Rather than making temporary structures, we need to strengthen current infrastructure and build permanent structures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/second-covid-19-wave-likely-in-maharashtra-in-january-february-health-department-advisory/story-ZOmXSubTpRHqZa4GvlXIDP.html

That is lower than last week’s estimate of 1.1-1.3, which means the virus is still spreading exponentially but at a slower rate.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage England is currently under its second national lockdown, with non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants closed for four weeks until Dec 2, in order to curb the spread of the virus.The latest figures offer a glimmer of hope that the most stringent restrictions will be eased for Christmas, in welcome news for shuttered businesses as well as for politicians. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to avoid another lockdown and held out against one until modeling projected the health service would be overwhelmed without action.The Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE), which advises the government on pandemic strategy, warned levels of coronavirus remain “very high.” The panel said “significant levels of healthcare demand and mortality will persist until R is reduced to and remains well below 1 for an extended period of time.”SAGE said the R rate is lowest in the north-west of England, at 0.9-1.1, where some areas such as Manchester and Liverpool were already under tight restrictions due to a surge in cases before the nationwide lockdown was enforced on Nov 5.A separate study from the Office for National Statistics on Friday appeared to echo SAGE’s findings. The proportion of people testing positive for coronavirus in England has continued to rise, but more slowly than in the past, the ONS said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-19-infections-are-now-slowing-say-govt-scientists/story-4RWk7uIsDVvnhTO4AHjIgK.html
13-11-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine could make social divisions worse||The Pfizer vaccine, along with its likely successors, is a very good thing for the US and the world. Yet it’s also likely to reshape America in some unsettling ways, segregating society more tightly into rational and irrational responders, especially in the short run.The first issue will be how Americans respond over the course of the next few months. Simple logic suggests that when a good vaccine is pending, you should play it much safer. Instead of putting off that vacation indefinitely, just wait until you’re vaccinated, possibly as soon as next summer. In theory that should be an easier adjustment to make, as indicated by what economists call “intertemporal substitution”: waiting for a short time is easier and less costly than waiting for a long time.Many people will behave in such a rational fashion. But many will instead take more risk. As the prospect of a post-Covid America becomes more vivid, the temptations of going out and socializing now will become more powerful. Once people start thinking about the imminent prospect of partying and fine dining, they might find it harder to resist the idea of just going ahead with it now, despite the higher risk. The giddiness occasioned by a vaccine might have some counterintuitive and negative effects.Of course, some truly rational and forward-looking people will realize that some of their friends and contacts will behave in this less responsible manner. The more rational among us thus will take greater care to avoid those whom they do not trust, as well as those who have front-line service jobs and thus cannot avoid contact with these less responsible individuals. The rationalists will cocoon themselves more, most of all from strangers and known irrationalists. Another possibility is that norms of social scorn will weaken, and confusion will reign for a while. Currently, if you shop without a mask or hog the middle of the jogging path in the park, you will be asked to leave or given dirty looks. These are healthy social reactions that help to keep the virus under control.Will that remain the case once 10% or 20% of the population has been vaccinated? Furthermore, by then a higher percentage of the population already will have had Covid-19. You could imagine that, by February or March, 30% to 40% of the American population either will have had Covid (a form of vaccination in fact, albeit a dangerous one), or have received a proper vaccine. Many of them will take off their masks in public spaces.Will you still be so inclined to give non-mask-wearers dirty looks? Their behavior might be just fine and pose no risk to others or you. And the vaccinated will themselves be less likely to give dirty looks to other non-mask-wearers, because they will not personally feel so threatened.In other words, some highly useful norms may end up weaker during the transition phase. People who remain unvaccinated and vulnerable may temporarily face higher rather than lower risks.Or what if three vaccinated family members or friends propose going to a movie with a fourth unvaccinated person? Will she so readily say no? The possibility of such situations — the fear of the unknown — will make rational, unvaccinated people all the more determined to limit their social interactions, at least for a while.These forms of segregation will be reinforced by the economics of the vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine requires extreme cold storage at about minus 70 degrees Celsius. Many rural hospitals cannot afford that expense, and so many communities will receive the vaccine much more slowly. Covid-19 might persist as a largely rural phenomenon.Or how about colleges and universities? Students should be back on campus by the fall semester, and they will demand that all students and faculty and staff be vaccinated —and they may also help supply the vaccine. Thus a vaccine divide will form between educated and non-educated young Americans. And given that no vaccine is likely to prove 100% effective, many educated Americans will remain risk-averse and avoid contact with rural, lower-income, less-educated Americans.It almost goes without saying, of course, that a partially vaccinated population is far better than no vaccine at all. So celebration is entirely appropriate. But along the way we are going to face a new set of problems, and now is the time to start thinking about them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-could-make-social-divisions-worse/story-8xpMcRa2ait0lmf0dwn81J.html
13-11-2020||World||EU threatens more Belarus sanctions after protester’s death||The European Union threatened to add sanctions against Belarus over the “outrageous” death of a 31-year-old man died following his detention by the police in the capital, Minsk.Raman Bandarenka was taken away by police on Wednesday following a clash between locals hanging ribbons on a park fence in support of the opposition, and a group tearing them down, news website Tut.by reported, citing unidentified eye witnesses. An hour and a half later he was hospitalized, and he died Thursday evening, according to the site.“This is an outrageous and shameful result of the actions by the Belarusian authorities,” the European Union’s diplomatic service said in a statement Friday. “The European Union has already imposed sanctions on 55 individuals responsible for violent repression and intimidation, and stands ready to impose additional sanctions.”The country’s Investigative Committee said Bandarenka was injured during the fight.The death threatens to escalate a standoff between the authorities and the protesters that has continued since President Alexander Lukashenko claimed to win by a landslide on August 9 in a vote the opposition says was rigged. The opposition has called for a national minute of silence Friday and for people to attend Sunday protests that regularly attract over 100,000 people in Minsk. Police crackdowns have intensified in recent weeks damping the size of the weekend meetings.The political crisis is the worst of Lukashenko’s 26 years in power and has forced him closer to Russia, which has provided financial support as the protests and coronavirus pandemic have slowed the economy. The US and the European Union have not recognized the election’s result.The EU last week added Lukashenko to a blacklist of Belarusian authorities implicated in ballot fraud and a subsequent crackdown on protesters. The penalties involve asset freezes and travel bans.The opposition has rallied around Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko’s main challenger in the election. A former English teacher who joined the race after her husband was jailed and barred from running, Tsikhanouskaya has since fled to Lithuania and was awarded the European Union’s top human rights prize last month.The Russian leadership has refused to meet with Tsikhanouskaya, although the country’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, said he attended an informal meeting with her, organized by Estonia, according to RIA Novosti.Russia’s position has not changed in regards to Tsikhanouskaya, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-threatens-more-belarus-sanctions-after-protester-s-death/story-M11lnevtqa0CrnzKzwMTsM.html

The beef was delivered from another Chinese city.Control and management of resources will be strengthened, Bi Kexin, head of the import and export food safety bureau of the General Administration of Customs, was quoted as saying.The Chinese customs will further enhance their inspection of cold-chain imported foods in a bid to prevent the risk of imported coronavirus infections, Bi said.China has communicated with the authorities of 109 countries that export cold-chain food products to the country, with suggestions and requirements receiving active responses from the respective departments, Bi said, adding that 140 cold-chain food producers from 50 countries have been inspected, and 22 companies have been dealt with regarding unqualified products.It has been estimated that there have been over 25 novel coronavirus cases detected in imported food cold chains since the first case was found in July, mostly from major frozen food exporting countries including Ecuador, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, and Norway, the report said. The novel coronavirus, which originated from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, has claimed nearly 1.3 million lives and infected over 52 million people globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-halts-imports-of-seafood-products-from-indian-firm/story-vHbi0MCtgxqFo8Vka6TLaK.html

Amnesty International said scores and possibly hundreds of civilians were stabbed and hacked to death in the region on November 9, citing witnesses.“If confirmed as having been deliberately carried out by a party to the current fighting, these killings of civilians would amount to war crimes, and there must be an independent investigation and full accountability for what has happened,” she said.Colville added that there were concerns that the killings which he described as “really, really horrific” were done along ethnic lines, although said it was too early to say this was the case.A spokesman for the UN refugee agency Babar Baloch said that the number of refugees seeking safety in neighbouring Sudan are increasing rapidly, with over 4,000 crossing the border in one day.There are also concerns that the violence will cause the mass displacement of thousands of Eritrean refugees in a camp in Ethiopia, he added, saying that aid agencies were overwhelmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-of-ethiopian-conflict-spiralling-into-war-crimes/story-7rGOlzvGjucJagcyJCmJVP.html

Debt transparency is extremely important,” Aso told reporters after a G20 conference call.The new framework also goes further than the debt freeze by requiring all public creditors to participate, after China was criticised by G20 partners for not including debt owed to its state-owned banks.China has become a major creditor to developing countries in recent years, often by lending through institutions like China Development Bank and China EXIM.But China is wary about debt write-offs and Beijing has defined the state-owned China Development Bank as a private institution, resisting calls for full participation in debt reliefThe Paris Club, which is organised by the French Finance Ministry, and G20 countries already agreed last month to extend this year’s debt freeze under which they deferred $5 billion in debt servicing to help the world’s poorest countries cope with the coronavirus crisis.G20 leaders are expected to endorse the common framework at a virtual summit meeting next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-finance-ministers-accept-debt-framework-for-countries-in-need-of-covid-19-deep-relief/story-KUFncaTBE98rkPAYYiZ2SK.html

Breton brought up the leaked document and showed it to Pichai during the call and said that there was no need to use old century tactics and to play one unit at the Commission against another, a person familiar with the call said.Pichai apologised for the way the document came out, a paper which he had not seen nor signed off, saying that he would engage directly with Breton if he sees language and policy that specifically targets Google, another person familiar with the call said.Google said the two had a frank but open conversation.“Our online tools have been a lifeline to many people and businesses through lockdown, and Google is committed to continuing to innovate and build services that can contribute to Europe’s economic recovery post-COVID,” spokesman Al Verney said in a statement.The incident underlines the intense lobbying by tech companies against the proposed EU rules, which could impede their businesses and force changes in how they operate.Breton will announce new draft rules known as the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act together with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager on Dec. 2.The rules will set out a list of do’s and don’ts for gatekeepers - online companies with market power - forcing them to share data with rivals and regulators and not to promote their services and products unfairly. “The Internet cannot remain a ‘Wild West’: we need clear and transparent rules, a predictable environment and balanced rights and obligations,” Breton told Pichai.“Everything that is allowed offline should be authorised online; and everything that is forbidden offline should be banned online,” he said.Breton told Pichai that he would increase the EU’s power to curb unfair behaviour by gatekeeping platforms, so that the Internet doesn’t just benefit a handful of companies but also Europe’s small- and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs.“Europe’s position is clear: everyone is welcome on our continent – as long as they respect our rules,” he told Pichai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sundar-pichai-apologises-to-eu-industry-chief-for-leaked-secret-document/story-22RGiOBfBM4KWBsgesI01K.html

He was 94.Koshiba, a distinguished professor at the University of Tokyo, died at a Tokyo hospital on Thursday, the university announced Friday. It didn’t provide a cause of death.Koshiba devised the construction of giant underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from the sun.Neutrinos offer a unique view of the sun’s inner workings because they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes the sun to shine.He shared the prize with two other scientists — the late Raymond Davis Jr. of the University of Pennsylvania, who also worked on neutrino detectors, and the late Italian-born scientist Riccardo Giacconi, who was cited for X-ray telescopes that provide sharper images of the universe.Also Read | Nobel laureate Carol Greider’s inspiring journey to success with dyslexiaKoshiba worked at the Kamiokande neutrino detector, a huge facility built in the mountains in central Japan. He confirmed and extended Davis’ work, and also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of the brightest objects in the universe.Koshiba’s contribution led to subsequent discoveries. His student, Takaaki Kajita, won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2015 for research at the Super-Kamiokande facility that found neutrinos have mass.Koshiba was active in science education for young people, and established a basic science foundation using his Nobel Prize award to provide learning experiences for high school and college students.A native of Toyohashi in central Japan, Koshiba graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1951 and studied in the United States before returning to Japan in 1958 to pursue his research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-nobel-laureate-koshiba-who-found-neutrinos-dies-at-94/story-Ezw4kJeLkviv9crujEEuQI.html

But the largest study on remdesivir’s efficacy, run by the World Health Organization (WHO), showed on Oct 15 it had little or no impact, contradicting previous trials.In light of the new interim data from the WHO’s Solidarity trial “remdesivir is now classified as a drug you should not use routinely in Covid-19 patients,” the President of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), Jozef Kesecioglu, said in an interview with Reuters. Kesecioglu said the recommendation would be discussed in a scientific paper on Covid therapies that ESICM is preparing with the Society of Critical Care Medicine, another intensive care body, expected to be published by January.The first version of the paper, released in March, said there was not enough information to recommend the use of remdesivir and other antivirals in critically ill Covid-19 patients.Gilead, which has questioned the WHO’s findings, said in an emailed statement: “We are confident that doctors on the front lines recognise the clinical benefit of Veklury based on robust evidence from multiple randomized, controlled studies.” ESICM represents thousands of anaesthesiologists, respiratory physicians, nurses and other critical care professionals in more than 120 countries.While doctors and hospitals are not obliged to follow its advice, its recommendation could curb the use of remdesivir. At the end of October, Gilead cut its 2020 revenue forecast, citing lower-than-expected demand and difficulty in predicting sales of remdesivir.WIDELY USED The drug remains, however, widely used in hospitals. It is authorised or approved for use in more than 50 countries and was one of the medicines administered to US President Donald Trump when he tested positive for coronavirus in October.The European Union signed a 1-billion-euro ($1.2 billion)deal with Gilead for 500,000 courses of remdesivir at 2,070 euros each, days before the Solidarity results.The deal does not oblige European countries to buy remdesivir, but governments decided to place large orders even after the Solidarity results, with Germany buying a big stock in November, saying the drug was useful, especially early in the course of the disease.Kesecioglu said there was not enough data available about when remdesivir might be effective or for which patients, leading to the decision to discourage its routine use in intensive care. This means doctors should use remdesivir only occasionally, and not as a standard treatment for Covid-19 patients.Also Read | South Korean firm to produce 150 mln doses a year of Russian Covid-19 vaccine: RDIFBecause of remdesivir’s unclear benefits, the critical care department at the University Medical Center of Utrecht in the Netherlands, where Kesecioglu works, has not used it to treat Covid-19 patients, he said.POSSIBLE SIDE-EFFECTSTen months into the pandemic, a debate continues to rage in the medical industry about which drugs are best to treat hospitalised Covid-19 patients. Remdesivir has potential side-effects on the kidneys, according to data shared by Gilead with the European Medicines Agency, which is assessing its possible toxicity.Arnaud Hot, head of medicine at Edouard Herriot hospital in Lyon, France, told Reuters that some patients at his hospital had experienced kidney injury and so it was no longer using remdesivir, except in rare cases.Kesecioglu said convalescent plasma, which is also experimentally administered to some Covid-19 patients despite not having been approved, was also not recommended by ESICM for routine intensive care use, as its benefits were unclear.He added the potential side-effects of convalescent plasma - the liquid part of blood extracted from Covid-19 patients - were also not clearIn contrast, Kesecioglu said dexamethasone was recommended for use in hospitalised patients because there was sufficient information on its efficacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-s-top-intensive-care-body-advises-against-remdesivir-for-sickest-covid-patients/story-mKjeDLGENCdjutBfoO3EwO.html
13-11-2020||World||China-Australia spat strands 400 seafarers as human crisis looms||An estimated 400 seafarers and roughly 2 million tons of coal are stuck on ships off the northeast coast of China, as a spiraling diplomatic row with Australia threatens to turn into a humanitarian crisis.At least 21 bulk carriers are anchored off the Port of Jingtang, unable to offload their Australian coal cargo that could be worth around $200 million, depending on its quality. Fifteen of the ships have been waiting since June, according to an analysis of shipping data conducted by Bloomberg. The remainder have been delayed at least four weeks.Mumbai-based Great Eastern Shipping Co.’s Jag Anand bulk carrier arrived around mid-June and has been in limbo ever since. China customs hasn’t cleared its cargo, according to a company spokesperson who asked not to be named due to internal policy. Jingtang isn’t allowing crew to get on or off the vessel, citing Covid-related protocols, and the ship’s charterer has refused to allow the vessel to sail to another port to relieve seafarers, said the spokesperson, who declined to name the charterer.China Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin acknowledged the plight of one Indian ship berthed near Hebei, telling a briefing Friday that authorities had not restricted the ship from leaving. Wang blamed the situation on the freight-forwarder’s reluctance to adjust sailing plans “due to commercial interests.”The standoff at the port, roughly 230 kilometers east of Beijing, compounds a broader threat to the shipping industry. Some 400,000 mariners are overdue to get off their boats; Covid-19 protocols at ports, cancelled flights and, increasingly, charterer mandates have made it more difficult for ship owners to arrange swaps. The crisis has exacerbated labour violations, threatening seafarers’ safety and global supply chains.Seafarers on the Indian-flagged Jag Anand are being supplied with food, water and medicine from local agents, said the Great Eastern Shipping spokesperson. China’s General Administration of Customs didn’t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment. A Jingtang port official said she wasn’t aware of the issue and declined to comment. The terminal is owned by the Tangshan Port Group Co.Under normal conditions, ships typically take a few days to berth at Jingtang, although the duration can increase to 15 to 20 days if it’s busy, according to the Great Eastern spokesperson. The northern port is one of the nation’s key gateways for metallurgical coal imports used in steel production. Nine of the cargoes originated from Hay Point in Australia, with eight from Gladstone and four cargoes from Dalrymple Islet.The political spat between Beijing and Canberra is escalating into a one-sided trade war, with China blacklisting commodities and foodstuffs from coal to lobster. Trade this year had also been snared in virus measures amid port restrictions to halt the spread of Covid-19.The ships, which mostly consist of Capesize and Panamax Dry bulk carrier vessels, typically require a crew of about 20 people. Australian coking coal for November on the Singapore Exchange traded near $104 a ton on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-australia-spat-strands-400-seafarers-as-human-crisis-looms/story-uaLvZYZvWnVnRMB3VQ4UVK.html

The other accused all tested negative.The trial will pick up where it left off with lawyers representing the victims stating their case. Thirty lawyers now need to be heard by Wednesday morning -- but the suspension has meant the timetable for the trial has been shifted back.Anti-terror prosecutors will give their summing up on Wednesday and Thursday before defence lawyers are heard until November 25. The verdict -- which initially had been awaited this week -- is now expected to be handed down on November 27.Fourteen suspects -- including three in absentia -- have been standing trial since September over the January 2015 massacre of staff at Charlie Hebdo, the killing of a policewoman and the deadly hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher market which left a total of 17 dead.To mark the start of the trial, Charlie Hebdo defiantly republished the cartoons of the prophet Mohammed that had angered Muslims worldwide. France is on its highest security alert after a spate of attacks in the last weeks blamed on Islamist radicals, including a stabbing outside its former offices, the beheading of a teacher and a killing spree inside a Nice church.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/charlie-hebdo-trial-to-resume-in-paris-after-covid-19-suspension/story-yOSUiLY70l1w0TBbHMmIaL.html
13-11-2020||World||Forgot what made them successful: Donald Trump attacks news channel, might start his own network||Fox News faces an array of challenges after President Donald Trump leaves office: a potential ratings decline, Trump’s tweets attacking the network, and the threat that he could start a rival media outlet.Yet Fox News has faced many obstacles during its 18 years as the No. 1 cable news network, and has managed to maintain its lead. It has weathered a sexual-harassment scandal, the death of founder Roger Ailes, the departure of stars Glenn Beck, Bill O’Reilly, and Megyn Kelly, and the arrival of right-leaning rivals, Newsmax and One America News Network.Few observers expect Trump’s barrage of attacks to knock Fox News off its throne anytime soon.“They have the distribution, talent and resources to be successful no matter who is president,” said Christopher Balfe, chief executive officer of Red Seat Ventures, which helps build businesses for media personalities like former HLN star Nancy Grace.Still, Fox News’s resilience could be put to the test like never before. Axios reported Thursday, citing unidentified sources, that Trump is planning a subscription-based streaming platform similar to Fox Nation, a $6-a-month service launched two years ago.Meanwhile, Trump is stepping up his attacks against the network after an election loss that he has steadfastly rejected. Fox News, like nearly all major media, has declared Joe Biden the presidential winner.On Thursday, Trump tweeted that Fox’s daytime ratings have “completely collapsed” because the network “forgot what made them successful, what got them there.” Fox News was the biggest difference between the 2016 and 2020 elections because the network forgot its “Golden Goose,” he said.Trump also amplified a series of Twitter posts from users criticizing Fox News as insufficiently loyal to the president and urging conservatives to switch to competitors such as Newsmax.Shares of Fox News’s parent company declined more than 6 per cent Thursday amid the attacks and speculation that Trump might back or launch a rival news service.Newsmax, which was founded by Trump ally Christopher Ruddy, has seen an uptick in viewers in recent days. It still hasn’t declared Biden the president-elect and has used that decision to curry favour with Trump supporters who are skeptical of the results and angry that Fox News made an early call for the Democrat in the key state of Arizona.On Thursday, Ruddy tweeted that Trump called him and “congratulated Newsmax on our ratings explosion.” Trump is “watching Newsmax,” he said, “and also wants every vote counted!”Negotiating ToolTrump’s relationship with America’s most-watched news channel has waxed and waned over the years. He was a frequent Fox News guest long before he decided to run for president, and the network’s evening commentators have been ardent supporters of him throughout his time in office. With the ties fraying, Fox would be wise to patch things up quickly, said Jon Klein, a former president of CNN’s US operations and current co-chairman of the streaming company Tapp Media LLC.“Many Fox News viewers adore President Trump,” Klein said. “If Trump undertook a concerted ongoing anti-Fox News campaign, that would have a real impact on Fox’s numbers because those Trump loyalists will do as they’re told.”Still, the real estate mogul behind a book called “The Art of the Deal” could be using his attacks against Fox as a bargaining tool, Klein said.“Everything for him is about the negotiation,” Klein said. “Once the dust settles, I’m sure he will make the best deal he can, whether it’s starting his own company or getting paid a lot of money to appear on someone’s else air.”Trump has continued to praise Fox News’s prime-time hosts, which he sees as more sympathetic to his cause. On Thursday night, he recommended a segment by commentator Sean Hannity about voting machines.Fox management remains upbeat that it can weather the latest turmoil. On an earnings call last week, CEO Lachlan Murdoch pointed out that the network has led the cable news industry through a number of administrations.“We love competition,” Murdoch said. “We have always thrived with competition, and we have strong competition now.”In response to Trump’s tweets on Thursday, Fox News said its daytime audience is up 62 per cent -- averaging 2.7 million viewers for the seven days through Wednesday -- from the same period last year, citing Nielsen data. The network also was the most-watched on election night, with an audience of 14.1 million.Other OptionsIf Trump wants to start his own media company, he could follow the path of former Fox News star Glenn Beck, relying on his large base of grassroots supporters to pay him monthly subscriptions.But while Beck was able to attract tens of thousands of subscribers to TheBlaze, former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin shut down her online TV channel only a year after its launch.Trump could create a meaningful media business with his own streaming service -- which would be less of a major threat to Fox.“I think a lot of people would sign up for a $5 or $6 a month subscription service to watch his show and support him,” Balfe said. “I don’t think it’s a Fox News channel competitor, but it could be a very successful streaming channel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forgot-what-made-them-successful-donald-trump-attacks-news-channel-might-start-his-own-network/story-pOexM2mUd4Au0B9X2cE3HP.html

In her criticism of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, the PML-N vice president said that if authorities can break into a room and arrest her in front of her father Nawaz Sharif and launch personal attacks on her, then no woman is safe in Pakistan.“A woman, whether she is in Pakistan or anywhere else, is not weak,” she said.Geo News reported that Sharif had said that her party is open to dialogue with the military establishment within the ambit of the Constitution, provided that the incumbent PTI government is removed from power.She further stated that she was not against state institutions but stressed that there would be no dialogue in secret. She also said the idea of dialogue through the platform of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) can be deliberated upon. The PML-N leader was arrested last year in the money laundering case, where she had claimed that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has arrested her by violating the law and that she was being politically victimised.In a press conference last year, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Accountability Shahzad Akbar had said that the Sharif family had used Chaudhry Sugar Mills for money-laundering and illegal transfer of its shares.More than Rs 7 million worth of shares were transferred to Maryam Nawaz in 2008 through the mill’s shares, which were later transferred to Yousaf Abbas Sharif in 2010, Akbar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maryam-nawaz-sharif-shares-struggles-she-faced-in-jail/story-6iqEuBf0LxcVnay0iBWkqL.html

According to him, he was on a “mission from god” to kill prostitutes. He was serving the sentences in the Frankland jail in County Durham.A Prison Service spokesman said: “HMP Frankland prisoner Peter Coonan (born Sutcliffe) died in hospital on November 13. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been informed.”The spate of killings led to one of the largest manhunts in British history, with the identity of the killer long remaining a mystery. The investigation was at times misled but he was finally apprehended and jailed.Richard McCann, son of Sutcliffe’s first victim Wilma McCann killed in October 1975, told BBC: “The attention he’s had over the years, the continuous news stories that we’ve suffered over the years, there is some form of conclusion to that”.“I am sure a lot of the families, surviving children of the victims may well be glad he has gone and they have a right to feel like that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yorkshire-ripper-notorious-1970s-serial-killer-dies-in-jail/story-oEFx1QcPizuTGQSrrzJqsM.html

The doses will be intended for global distribution, it said.GL Rapha has been in talks with RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev for several months this year after the sovereign fund approached it first, a spokesperson for the South Korean firm said.Dmitriev had planned to visit the company, but the plan was put off due to the pandemic, the official said. The biotech company, founded in 2007, offers fill and finish of vials and oversees the whole process of vaccine production.RDIF, which is backing the vaccine’s development and is responsible for its marketing abroad, said it had orders for more than 1.2 billion doses of Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-firm-to-produce-150-mln-doses-a-year-of-russian-covid-19-vaccine-rdif/story-FYmCGKwz2mjA7SPIXKTZGI.html

13-11-2020||World||Hope Sri Lanka will revisit policy to ban burials of Covid-19 victims: UN||The UN has expressed hope that the Sri Lankan government will revisit their policy to ban burials for the victims of the Covid-19 pandemic that has so far claimed the lives of 48 people in the island nation. In a letter to Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, UN Resident Coordinator in Colombo Hanaa Singer has reiterated concerns with the existing Sri Lankan Ministry of Health guidelines, which stipulate cremation as the only method for the disposal of bodies.Sri Lanka since the outbreak of the pandemic in March had adopted the policy of cremating the victim, citing dangers of further spreading the virus through the underground water table if allowed to be buried.The island’s Muslim minority has protested the move and has been urging the government to allow burials, claiming that cremation goes against their religious rituals for the deceased.Also Read | 66 Indian nationals tested Covid-19 positive in Sri LankaMuslim religious organisations have been making representations on the issue. The government said it has appointed a panel of health experts to advise on the issue and until such time recommendations are made to the contrary the policy of cremations would continue.Singer has said that across the world, the safe and dignified handling of those patients whose life has been tragically claimed by this virus has been an important part of the Covid-19 response.“I am following with encouragement recent media reports that the current prohibition of burials of Covid-19 victims in Sri Lanka could be revisited shortly. In this context, I wish to take the opportunity to reiterate the concerns of the United Nations with the existing Ministry of Health guidelines, which stipulate cremation as the only method for the disposal of bodies suspected of Covid-19 infection,” she said in the letter.The UN official also drew Rajapaksa’s attention to the World Health Organisation issued guidelines dated March 24, 2020 and subsequent updated interim guidance on September 4 2020 on the “Infection prevention and control for the safe management of a dead body in the context of Covid-19”.She insists that based on current knowledge of the symptoms of Covid-19 and its main modes of transmission (droplet/contact), the likelihood of transmission when handling human remains is low.“The common assumption that people who died of a communicable disease should be cremated to prevent spread is not supported by evidence. Instead, cremation is a matter of cultural choice and available resources,” she added.The WHO had outlined that people who have died from Covid-19 can therefore be buried or cremated according to local standards and family preferences, with appropriate protocols for handling the body. Sri Lanka has so far reported 15,723 cases of coronavirus and 48 deaths due to it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-sri-lanka-will-revisit-policy-to-ban-burials-of-covid-19-victims-un/story-w3BxqBUU54Azfei0ah37HL.html

The two sides have made little progress.The attack on the army checkpoint follows weeks of violence, including an attack by gunmen earlier this month claimed by the Islamic State group affiliate at Kabul University that killed 22 people, mostly students.The government’s head of peace negotiations, Abdullah Abdullah, on Friday urged the Taliban to reach to understanding, finding a peaceful solution to the ongoing war. “we have offered ways but Taliban are not trying to reach to an understanding”Also Read | Al Qaeda leader dies, Afghan forces accuse Taliban of harbouring himOn Thursday, Taliban fighters attacked a government security forces checkpoint in northern Kunduz province, killing five soldiers and wounding two others, said Esmatullah Muradi, provincial governor’s spokesman.

A 45-year-old volunteer said that she suffered side effects similar to the flu jab but that her symptoms were ‘more severe’ after her second jab, according to a Daily Mail report. The report also cited another 44-year-old participant Glenn Deshields, who said the Pfizer’s vaccine shot a ‘severe hangover’. The symptoms, however, quickly cleared up, he said. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageA publicist from Missouri too had joined the study. She said she received her first shot in September and her second last month. She suffered a headache, fever and aches all over her body, comparable to the flu jab, with the first one. Following the second shot, these became ‘more severe’, she told the Daily Mail. The accounts come at a time when Pfizer announced that the Covid-19 vaccine that it was developing in collaboration with BioNTech SE prevented more than 90% of infections in a study of tens of thousands of volunteers. This puts the US company on track to apply later this month for emergency-use approval from the Food and Drug Administration.Pfizer and BioNTech’s announcement that the messenger RNA, or mRNA, vaccine had at least 90% efficacy among 94 confirmed cases means that at least 84 of the people who developed symptomatic Covid from over 43,000 trial volunteers had received the placebo. This includes people who got two doses of the vaccine as well as those who received a placebo shot. Protection in patients was achieved seven days after the second of two doses, and 28 days after the first, according to preliminary findings. The companies are expecting to supply 50 million vaccine doses globally by the end of this year. Up to 1.3 billion doses will be supplied in 2021.

13-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson seeks green jobs for UK as unemployment surges||Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeking advice from industry on how to create green jobs in the U.K. as unemployment rose at the quickest pace in a decade.The government is gathering a green jobs taskforce that seeks to create employment for 2 million by 2030. Johnson is planning a major speech on how he will spur an industrial revolution in clean-energy technologies, part of a series of initiative leading up to global talks on climate change the U.K. will host next year.The move also is aimed at helping the U.K. economy recover from the battering delivered by coronavirus lockdowns, with the number of workers being made redundant hitting a record. With the government weighing a ban on diesel cars by 2035, it’s seeking to spur new technologies like electric vehicles and offshore wind power that can absorb workers from industries that are being wound down.“Businesses desperately need a framework to plan and there’s been a lack of certainty about the future direction of travel,” said Kate Bell, head of rights, international, social and economic at the Trades Union Congress. “There is a need to get moving quickly.”The government has once again delayed a much anticipated energy policy paper that will set a direction for how the U.K. will meet its target to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. It will be key for investors who want to create jobs in technologies such as nuclear, hydrogen and carbon capture that are key to reducing pollution but too expensive to work without subsidy. Energy Minister Kwasi Kwarteng on Thursday said it will be published by December.The urgency to create more jobs is building. Despite unprecedented government support to help pay workers wages, U.K. unemployment rose the most since the financial crisis over the summer, taking the jobless rate to 4.8%.Job cuts, known as redundancies in the U.K., increased by a record 181,000 in the third quarter and look set to peak when the furlough program is withdrawn at the end of March. With the pandemic reshaping the jobs landscape, these lay offs risk becoming entrenched unemployment if workers aren’t able to find or fit the skill requirements of newly created roles.The TUC has identified 1.24 million jobs that could be created across the U.K. in two years by investing 85 billion pounds in areas such as home insulation, electric car charging, and planting trees.The new taskforce will meet for the first time on Thursday and seeks to create jobs for both now and in the long term. It will include representatives from Orsted AS, Nissan Motor Co., Tata Steel Ltd., BP Plc and the TUC.One of the biggest challenges will be to find new jobs for the people working in dirty industries. It’s a problem the U.K. faced three decades ago when then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher closed coal mines in the north of England and South Wales, leading to mass unemployment in industrial heartlands -- the effects of which are still felt today.Drax Group Plc, which runs what was once the U.K.’s biggest coal plant will cut more than 200 jobs when it closes its final coal units at the end of March. “The next generation of green jobs that will come with carbon capture and storage won’t become a reality for 3 or 4 more years,” said Will Gardiner, Drax’s chief executive officer.Research by Cambridge Econometrics, on behalf of Greenpeace, this week found a 2030 ban on petrol, diesel and hybrid cars and vans could create 32,000 new jobs by the same year and increase gross domestic product by 0.2% -- or 4.2 billion pounds.That could help more people follow in the footsteps of George Hull, an engineer who left his job building diesel engines for Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc to focus on electric cars.Now he works at the U.K. Battery Industrialization Centre -- a 130 million pound government backed project that helps to scale up new battery technologies and teach people the skills needed to work in the industry.When Hull joined JLR in 2011, the company was betting millions on the future of the internal combustion engine. But a decade later it’s ceased production of diesel and petrol cars to focus on batteries.“You could tell the end of the road is coming for internal combustion engines. I was keen to learn new skills,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-seeks-green-jobs-for-uk-as-unemployment-surges/story-FqRh5404rje3JgJ3x230rJ.html

Wijemuni said the construction site workers, all Indians, “were found coronavirus positive from random tests conducted -- the first batch of 19 was followed by another 47”. All of them are being treated at the interim treatment centre at Dharga Town, he said.The National Operations Centre for Prevention of Covid said the fish market cluster has emerged as the biggest source of the deadly viral infection in Lanka. By Friday morning, the cluster has recorded a total of 9,120 positive cases out of the nationwide tally of 15,722.Lanka has so far recorded 48 coronavirus-related deaths. When the island experienced its second wave on October 4 there was only 3,396 cases with just 13 deaths. The infected figure has jumped four times since then. The Western province, which is also the capital province, is the current area with highest infections. The province after a 10 day lockdown was re-opened early this week. However, travel restrictions continued in the province. The capital city has recorded multiple coronavirus cases since early October when the island was hit by two large clusters of infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/66-indian-nationals-tested-covid-19-positive-in-sri-lanka/story-z74AU5QLkh06Di2s9Z613J.html
13-11-2020||World||Saudis say they thwarted attack on oil facility near Yemen||Saudi Arabia claimed late Thursday it thwarted an attack by Yemen’s Iran-backed rebels that sparked a fire near an Aramco oil distribution center, involving unmanned boats loaded with explosives dispatched into the Red Sea.In remarks carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, an unnamed official at the Ministry of Energy reported that Saudi security forces had intercepted and destroyed two explosives-packed boats that it said Yemen’s Houthi rebels were using to target a major refinery and terminal in the southern Saudi province of Jizan.The attempted attack took place late Wednesday near an offloading platform and caused the floating hoses that unload oil to catch fire, according to the energy official, who added that the blaze had been brought under control and caused no injuries.The official sharply condemned the attack as threatening commercial shipping routes near the vital Bab al-Mandeb strait, used for oil shipments from the Gulf to Europe, as well as goods from Asia to Europe.There was no immediate acknowledgement from Yemen’s rebels, who have repeatedly fired drones and missiles targeting oil installations, airports and cities in the Saudi mainland over the course of a grinding five-year war against a Saudi-led military coalition. In September 2019, drone attacks claimed by the Houthis struck two key oil installations in Saudi Arabia, halting about half of the supplies from the world’s largest exporter of oil. Saudi Arabia and the U.S. attributed the assault to Iran, which has denied involvement.Saudi Arabia often claims to foil Houthi cross-border attacks, but evidence is scarce, making it extremely difficult to independently verify the accounts.The Houthis, which Saudi Arabia considers to be Iranian proxies, overran Yemen’s capital and much of the north in 2014, driving the internationally recognized government into exile. The war in the Arab world’s poorest country has killed over 100,000 people, pushed millions to the brink of famine and precipitated what the U.N. calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudis-say-they-thwarted-attack-on-oil-facility-near-yemen/story-REDbAgryGYPlA423Sf5n9M.html
13-11-2020||World||China halts imports from Indian firm after frozen seafood packages test Covid-19 positive||China has suspended importing seafood from an Indian company after three frozen product packages tested positive for Coronavirus, local customs authorities said on Friday.The frozen cuttlefish packages imported from a Kolkata-based company tested positive for the coronavirus, the General Administration of Customs of China said in a statement.The statement, quoted by Chinese state media, said as per law, China has suspended all imports from the company for a week.The suspension of import is likely to be followed by testing of all workers involved in the import of this particular batch of cuttlefish.State media reports said that it wasn’t the first time that frozen food imported from India had tested positive for Coronavirus in China.Earlier this month, packages of frozen hairtail fish tested positive in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province in north China.According to a report in national broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV), a sample of frozen hairtail imported through the port of Tianjin to Taiyuan tested positive.“Taiyuan City immediately launched an emergency plan for the prevention and control of cold chain food epidemics, and seized all frozen hairtails involved in this batch,” the report said.Local authorities had subsequently launched nucleic acid testing and centralised quarantine for the workers involved, the report said, adding results of all nucleic acid tests were negative.China imports aquatic products from 88 countries including 23 from Asia and 26 from Europe.Till now, frozen aquatic products from at least six countries - India, Indonesia, Russia, the Netherlands, Norway, and Ecuador – have tested positive for the coronavirus.On Friday, official news agency Xinhua reported that authorities in Wuhan, capital of central China’s Hubei province, found that three frozen beef samples had tested positive for Covid-19, local health authorities said on Friday.The batch of products dispersed in 1,006 boxes, weighing 27 tonnes, were imported from Brazil to customs in the east Chinese city of Qingdao on August 7. They arrived in a warehouse in Wuhan on August 17 and have not entered the market.“The local authorities have sealed the products, quarantined and conducted tests on relevant personnel and disinfected the area,” the Xinhua report said.It is estimated over 25 novel coronavirus cases have been detected in imported food cold chains since the first case was found in July, mostly from major frozen food exporting countries including Ecuador, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil and Norway.Tianjin, a city neighbouring Beijing and North China’s Hebei, shut down a wholesale market after finding Covid-19 on its imported cold-chain products for two consecutive days.“A Tianjin worker in the cold chain industry was confirmed to have contracted Covid-19 this week. Two Chinese cities have been involved in Tianjin’s cases as some batches of frozen goods sold in these cities were delivered from Tianjin,” a state media report said.By the end of Thursday, a total of 3,662 imported Covid-19 cases had been reported on the mainland. Among them, 3,308 had been discharged from hospitals following recovery, and 354 remained hospitalised. No deaths had been reported among imported cases.Confirmed cases on the mainland reached 86,307 by Thursday, while deaths stand at 4,634, according to the national health commission’s daily bulletin on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-halts-imports-from-indian-firm-after-frozen-seafood-packages-test-covid-19-positive/story-8gE2KkiHVCRl4pGlSCJTnI.html
13-11-2020||World||Israel’s settlement movements could test bond with Joe Biden||On a visit to Israel in 2010, Biden was caught off guard when authorities announced plans to build hundreds of new homes in the sprawling Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem. The incident embarrassed Biden and sparked a diplomatic rift with the Obama administration that never quite healed. Yet despite Biden’s opposition to the project, a decade later Ramat Shlomo has ballooned.The episode could foreshadow what lies ahead under the Biden administration — with a US president opposed to Israeli construction on occupied lands claimed by the Palestinians but seemingly limited in his ability to stop it, particularly when dealing with a changing Middle East and preoccupied by domestic priorities.The coming two months provide a key test for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the matter. The Israeli leader, a longtime supporter of the settlements, may seek to take advantage of the final days of the settlement-friendly Trump administration and push through a flurry of last-minute construction projects. But doing so could antagonize the incoming administration.Both settlement supporters and critics expect Netanyahu to proceed with caution. With the Biden administration expected to re-engage with Iran over its nuclear program, Netanyahu’s top security concern, he seems unlikely to pick a fight with the president-elect. Netanyahu’s office did not respond to a request for comment.Martin Indyk, a former US peace negotiator during the Clinton and Obama administrations, said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is no longer a “vital national interest” for Washington and that he did not expect Biden to make it a priority. Nonetheless, he said Biden still has a strong familiarity with the region.“I don’t think he’s going to want to have a fight over settlements. But if Bibi makes it an issue, then there will be a problem there,” said Indyk, using Netanyahu’s nickname.Trump has delivered a number of diplomatic gifts to Netanyahu, including the withdrawal of the US from the international nuclear deal with Iran, recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the US Embassy there. Trump recently brokered three normalization deals between Israel and Arab countries, shattering a longstanding position by Arab states that have traditionally withheld recognizing Israel until it made major concessions to the Palestinians.In a break from his Republican and Democratic predecessors, Trump also has taken a much softer line toward the settlements. Surrounded by advisers with close ties to the settler movement, Trump’s administration declared last year that it did not consider the settlements to be illegal under international law. Then, in January, he unveiled a Mideast plan that envisions placing parts of the West Bank, including all of the settlements, under permanent Israeli control.Israel this year appeared poised to begin annexing West Bank territory under the Trump plan but was dissuaded as part of the deal establishing ties with the United Arab Emirates. Nonetheless, Israel has ramped up plans to build thousands of new homes throughout the West Bank. Anti-settlement monitoring groups expect additional settlement approvals in the West Bank and east Jerusalem before the end of Trump’s term.Biden, while claiming to have “ironclad” support for Israel, has already indicated he will reverse many of Trump’s decisions. He has come out against unilateral annexation and supports a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Although he has said he will not move the embassy back to Tel Aviv, he is expected to reopen the US Consulate in Jerusalem that managed relations with the Palestinians and restore hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to the Palestinians that Trump cut off.Palestinian official Hanan Ashrawi called on the incoming administration not to return to “mistakes of the past” and said the traditional US condemnations of settlement expansion would not be enough.“There must be accountability and consequences if Israel continues its settlement policies,” she said. “Otherwise, what will be the benefit of statements of condemnation if Israel continues with expansion and settlements?”The Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek all of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967, as parts of a future independent state. With nearly 500,000 settlers now living in the West Bank, and over 220,000 more in east Jerusalem, the Palestinians say the chances of establishing their state are quickly dwindling.Previous American administrations viewed settlements as illegitimate and obstacles to peace. President Barack Obama took an even harsher tack and repeatedly clashed with Netanyahu over new construction. Weeks before leaving office, Obama allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution declaring the settlements illegal.A nadir in those ties came at Biden’s expense with the 2010 Ramat Shlomo incident. As he held friendly meetings with Israeli officials, Israel’s Interior Ministry approved the construction of 1,600 new apartments in the neighbourhood. Netanyahu said at the time that he had been blindsided by the announcement by low-level technocrats and tried to contain the damage at a late-night dinner with Biden.Nonetheless, Biden issued a harshly worded statement, saying the approvals undermined trust.At the time, Ramat Shlomo had about 2,000 apartments, according to Ir Amim, a group that tracks settlement building in Jerusalem.Today, the area, which Israel considers a neighborhood of its capital, is undergoing a construction boom, with nearly 600 homes being built, according to Peace Now, another anti-settlement monitoring group. Ir Amim says over 700 additional apartments are in the pipeline. This week, bulldozers shoveled dirt and cranes whirred in the neighborhood’s building frenzy.Brian Reeves, a spokesman for Peace Now, said the group expects Biden to change the tone on settlements but not to put enough pressure on Israel to stop.“The US will resume its condemnations of settlements but it’s not going to take any drastic action against it, so it’s going to seem like it’s ringing hollow,” he said.Settler leaders, disappointed to be losing a friend in Trump, said they hope Biden will be different than Obama and not push for curbs on construction.“I would hope that they don’t fall back into the old approach that led us into a deadlock,” said Oded Revivi, mayor of the Efrat settlement.For now, Israel seems unlikely to make too many bold moves in the settlements if it wants to curry favor with an administration likely to renegotiate the Iran nuclear deal.“The No. 1 issue for Israel is Iran. Not the settlements, not the peace process, not the Palestinians,” said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on US-Israel relations. “Anything that could disrupt collaboration with the United States on Iran is going to be off.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-s-settlement-movements-could-test-bond-with-joe-biden/story-8F59JAQXr5srthkzCoxcxL.html

Happy Diwali to everyone celebrating!”The 2020 celebration organised by the ruling Liberal Party was hosted by Canada’s Minister of Public Services and Procurement Anita Anand, the first Hindu Cabinet member in the country’s history, along with MPs Raj Saini from the city of Kitchener in Ontario and Gary Anandasangaree from Scarborough in Toronto.A host of prominent Canadian politicians also joined another celebration, including the Leader of the Official Opposition in the House of Commons, Conservative Erin O’Toole, who also lit a diya.This was the 20th year of the annual event that first took place in 1998 and was started by late MP Deepak Obhrai, to bring Diwali to Parliament Hill, the seat of power in Canada. It was organised by British Columbia MP Todd Doherty in association with the Deepak Obhrai Foundation and the Canada-India Foundation.Thanking Trudeau for being “gracious” in joining the online festivity, India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria tweeted, “Diwali is now so much a Canadian festival!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-joins-virtual-celebration-of-diwali/story-YKWe1iSCyCTqPR4CiQJ3AK.html
13-11-2020||World||39 dead after typhoon Vamco leaves high water, mud in Philippines||Thick mud and debris coated many villages around the Philippine capital Friday after a typhoon caused extensive flooding that sent people fleeing to their roofs and killed at least 39 people.Thousands of people have been rescued, though waters have mostly receded. The military was rescuing people in places where waters remained high.Amphibious assault vehicles usually used in counter-insurgency operations were deployed for the rescue work, military chief of staff General Gilbert Gapay said in an emergency meeting with disaster-response officials.“We’ll continue to look for the missing, help in damage assessment,” Gapay said. He reported 39 deaths and 32 other people missing.Typhoon Vamco passed north of Manila between Bulacan and Pampanga provinces overnight Wednesday and early Thursday, toppling power poles and trees and damaging homes.More than 350,000 people had been evacuated to safety, mainly residents fleeing vulnerable coastal and low-lying areas before the typhoon hit. Philippine National Police said more than 100,000 people had been rescued, including 41,000 in the capital region.At least 3.8 million households lost power in metropolitan Manila and outlying provinces, but crews have restored electricity in many areas and power was expected to be fully restored in about three days. Government offices were closed and classes suspended for public schools Friday.Vamco hit the Philippines on the heels of Typhoon Goni, one of the strongest typhoons in the world this year, which left more than 30 people dead or missing and damaged or destroyed 270,000 houses. Tens of thousands of people remain displaced.The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and tropical storms each year and also had active seismic faults and volcanoes, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/39-dead-after-typhoon-vamco-leaves-high-water-mud-in-philippines/story-mIKMYrstW9zwH3cUcZenzO.html

It has also created a new pathway to permanent residency for Hong Kongers who are in Canada and meet specific eligibility criteria like minimum language and education levels and a year of work experience in the country. This opportunity will come into effect next year.Another pathway will expedite study permits to residents of Hong Kong, and offer a “dedicated” route to permanent residency to those who complete their studies.The Canadian government is also expediting issuance of required documents to Canadians and Canadian permanent residents in Hong Kong, and to “speed up processing of permanent residence applications, including family sponsorship, which will benefit Hong Kong residents, and to encourage Hong Kong youth to study or work in Canada,” according to a release from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).Mendicino “reassured Canadians and Canadian permanent residents in Hong Kong that they can return to Canada at any time, and any documents they require will be expedited.”“We find ourselves at a challenging moment. Canada remains deeply concerned about China’s passage of the new national security law,” he said. “We have unequivocally stated that this legislation and the unilateral powers within it are in direct conflict with China’s international obligations.”Earlier, foreign affairs minister François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement, “China’s decision to remove four democratically elected lawmakers from office in Hong Kong is a further assault on Hong Kong’s high degree of freedoms under the Sino-British Joint Declaration.”Adding that he was “deeply disappointed”, he said, “This action clearly demonstrates a concerning disregard for Hong Kong’s Basic Law and the high degree of autonomy promised for Hong Kong under the ‘one country, two systems’ framework.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-give-hong-kongers-asylum-even-if-charged-under-chinese-security-law/story-8gASpqNXIgwpPlHErnsbwL.html
13-11-2020||World||Mike Pompeo refuses to acknowledge Joe Biden as president-elect, heads to Europe, Mideast||After refusing to acknowledge President Donald Trump’s loss in last week’s election, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is leaving Friday on a trip to Europe and the Middle East, to countries where leaders have all congratulated former vice president Joe Biden for his victory.The seven-nation trip is aimed at shoring up the outgoing Trump administration’s priorities, notably its anti-China and -Iran policies, and will include visits to Israeli settlements in the West Bank that have been avoided by previous secretaries of state.But the usual foreign policy issues are likely to be overshadowed by the extraordinary moment in global politics: Most of the world has accepted the results of America’s election, while the United States’ top diplomat — as well as its president and much of his Republican Party — have not.Pompeo’s trip comes days after he raised eyebrows by dismissing a reporter’s question about the presidential transition by saying “there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.” He appeared to be speaking in jest and went on to say, in a more serious tone, that the world should be assured that the State Department will be functional and successful with the president who takes office January 20. But those comments and subsequent statements in interviews with conservative media did not acknowledge that it’s Biden who will become president then.Pompeo’s weeklong tour takes him to France, Turkey, Georgia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The leaders of each of those countries have offered public congratulations to Biden.Four of those countries — France, Turkey, Georgia and Qatar — have had a fractious relationship with the Trump administration and it was not clear if Pompeo would hold public engagements with any of their leaders. Pompeo has had a notoriously frosty relationship with the press and it was also unclear if he planned to take questions from reporters.In keeping with Trump’s refusal to concede and orders for Cabinet agencies not to cooperate with the Biden transition team, the State Department has not been involved with facilitating Biden’s calls to foreign leaders, according to officials familiar with the process.Pompeo’s ardent support for Trump, who has claimed without evidence that the election was beset by fraud, threatens to hurt America’s standing in making pronouncements about other countries’ democratic shortcomings.On Thursday, Pompeo weighed in on Hong Kong’s legislature, and he has in recent weeks denounced alleged electoral problems in Belarus, Tanzania and Ivory Coast.Yet, at his news conference Tuesday, Pompeo roundly dismissed a question about whether Trump’s unfounded protests have created problems for US credibility. “You asked a question that is ridiculous,” he responded. “This department cares deeply to make sure that elections around the world are safe and secure and free and fair, and my officers risk their lives to ensure that that happens.”Biden has already spoken with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea and fielded congratulatory notes on social media and elsewhere from others.Yet, Pompeo said he would carry on as if there was no change.“I’m the secretary of state,” he said. “I’m getting calls from all across the world. These people are watching our election. They understand that we have a legal process. They understand that this takes time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-refuses-to-acknowledge-joe-biden-as-president-elect-heads-to-europe-mideast/story-KZZ63BwzFpx6DQj7bQgp9L.html

The Shan, whose homeland is in eastern Myanmar, are the country’s largest ethnic minority.An unofficial count by Yway Mal, an independent vote counting service, gave the NLD 397 seats and the USDP 28, with 44 going to other parties.Majority control of Parliament does not give the NLD full control of government. The army-drafted constitution of 2008 grants the military 25% of the total seats, enough to block constitutional changes. Several key ministerial positions are also reserved for military appointees.Also Read | Myanmar’s opposition party demands re-election as Aung San Suu Kyi heads for victoryThe USDP has called the election unfair and refused to accept the election results, but the election commission rejected its claim and its demand for a fresh vote.Independent rights groups have criticized the disenfranchisement of the Muslim Rohingya ethnic minority and cancellation of the vote in certain areas. The Union Election Commission cited the dangers of ongoing combat between government forces and ethnic minority guerrillas, but critics suggested certain areas were singled out for cancellation because they were certain to elect lawmakers from parties hostile to the current government.One of the guerrilla groups, the Arakan Army, said Thursday it would extend a unilateral ceasefire to Dec 31 to allow by-elections to be held in areas of Rakhine province where voting had been cancelled. It urged Myanmar’s army and government to halt military actions and declare a ceasefire encompassing the whole country so voting could take place.

This year, Diwali’s message has a special significance,” Morrison said in a video message released recently.“Every nation on earth is responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. Lives and livelihoods have been lost as we have witnessed the most dramatic shock in generations. Despite this, we have a common hope. Throughout 2020, despite our own fears, we have supported each other, encouraged each other, and stood with each other.“We have drawn strength and inspiration from our medical professionals, teachers, cleaners, retail staff, police and defence force personnel and so many more who have responded to the crisis with compassion and professionalism,” he said.He said Australia is the most successful multi-cultural nation on earth and “at this Diwali, I pay tribute to all those who have brought this tradition to our shores.” “Yes, we have seen darkness this year, but the light is overcoming that darkness. There is light ahead, and there is hope. Warmest greetings to everyone celebrating Diwali, the festival of lights. It’s a special moment for people of many faiths,” Morrison said in his message.Other politicians who extended their greetings include Opposition leader Anthony Albanese who said he hoped next year people will be able to celebrate the festival of lights together.“I wish all of you a wonderful Diwali festival. As a celebration of the victory of light over darkness, it is a most welcome and timely antidote to the uncertainty that surrounds us,” Albanese said, adding “we have all had to adapt to the realities of the coronavirus pandemic, yet even amid all this upheaval, Diwali will stand tall as a striking expression of your tradition and your spirituality, your devotion and your faith.” Albanese said, “I sympathise with those who aren’t able to return to their ancestral homes, and to those unable to celebrate with their families this year.” Australia is home to over 7,00,000 Indian-origin people, while Indian migrants are the top source of new Australian citizens with over 28,000 Indian nationals becoming Australian citizens last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-scott-morrison-s-diwali-message-has-special-significance-this-year/story-sDERJu1qUZ9vJwA1bbFogJ.html

But the Democrat was getting growing recognition from Republicans who are demanding equal access for him to classified briefings as the president, which has been blocked by Trump along with other practices routinely associated with transition from one administration to another.“The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history,” said a joint statement by a top official of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with other officials. “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”They added: “While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too.”CISA is part of the sprawling Department of Homeland Security created in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks. It joined a small but growing pushback from senior officials to the president’s efforts to use his powers to subvert the established practice of a smooth transfer of power.A top official of the department of justice’s election crimes wing quit last week in protest against Attorney General William Barr’s nod to federal investigators around the country to seek and prosecute “substantial allegations” of election fraud in support of Trump’s claims.Even as the American president has used these wild claims to refuse to acknowledge defeat, he is reported to have expressed growing interest in recent days in running again in 2024, arguing this election was stolen from him. But he is also mulling a digital TV channel to take on Fox, according to other reports.The Trump family, meanwhile, appears divided on the way forward. The president’s adult sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump are reported to be pushing their father to not give up, but his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, both advisers to the president, are seeking an early closure with an eye on their own future. And Trump is known to favour his daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-officials-refute-trump-s-poll-fraud-allegations/story-Q45lEjlO5m2StNV8abHDbP.html
13-11-2020||World||Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna among potential candidates to succeed US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris||Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna, who was recently elected for a third consecutive term from the congressional district representing Silicon Valley, is being considered as a potential contender to fill the US Senate seat from California that will fall vacant in January after Kamala Harris is sworn in as the country’s vice president.Click here for full US Election 2020 coverage Daughter of an Indian-American mother and African-American father, Harris was elected a US Senator from California in 2016. The seat will become vacant after she is sworn in as the vice president in January. Under California law, the vacancy would be filled up by Governor Gavin Newsom for the remaining two-year term of the Senate seat. State media is reporting various names, including that of Khanna, that are being considered by Newsom to fill up the vacancy. Among the potential contenders are California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, whose election to Senate will make him the first Latino senator from the State; Congresswoman Karen Bass, who was on vice presidential short-list for President-elect Joe Biden; Congresswoman Barbara Lee; Congressman Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee; Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia; State Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins of San Diego; Treasurer Fiona Ma; and State Controller Betty Yee. “I am honoured that my name is in the mix. But I also represent a very powerful constituency....Silicon Valley. So, we’ll see where things go. I am open to whatever opportunity...where I can be most effective,” Khanna told PTI when asked about news reports. According to a recent poll by University of Southern California, 14 per cent want a Latino as the next Senator. But 29 per cent of those interviewed want someone having experience in Washington. As per the poll, 11 per cent of the respondents preferred Barbara Lee and eight per cent picked Ro Khanna. “I think there are a lot of great people out there, but what I hope is that the governor picks someone clearly with a progressive views,” Khanna told ABC News. Khanna was co-chair of the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders. On Thursday, IMPACT, a leading Indian-American advocacy and political action committee, endorsed Khanna to fill the seat to be vacated by Harris. “IMPACT urges Governor Newsom to consider Representative Ro Khanna. He has the essential qualities to meet this moment: At a time when we are deeply divided, Ro has demonstrated an ability to bring together progressives, moderates, and even some Republicans,” Impact executive director Neil Makhija said. “As an Indian American, Ro also represents the fastest growing community in California. As millions of Black and Brown children around the country see the promise of America in the new Vice President-elect, her replacement should offer the same hope and representation for Californians,” Makhija said.

13-11-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine access to low, middle income nations crucial for economic recovery: WHO||The access of low and middle-income countries to vaccines against the coronavirus is important to fight the consequences of the pandemic, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday.“As global public goods, COVID vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics must be available on the basis of equitable and affordable access for all, especially for health workers, the elderly and other at risk groups,” Tedros said at a panel on Covid-19 vaccines at the Paris Peace Forum.According to the WHO chief, this is not just a moral or a public health imperative but also an economic one, as it is in the interest of each and every country across the world.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“In our interconnected world if people in low- and middle-income countries miss out on vaccines, the virus will continue spreading and the economic recovery globally will be delayed. Equitable access is in the national interest of each and every country. Vaccine nationalism will prolong the pandemic, not shorten it; making vaccine work requires a broad collaboration, not just across sectors, but across partners. No country can address these challenges alone,” Tedros added.To ensure equitable distribution of equipment and materials necessary to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, the WHO, European Commission, France and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation launched the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator in late April.However, despite these efforts, the pandemic is still disproportionately affecting low-income countries as they lack access to vital equipment, including ventilators and protective equipment, and need more health care workers. The initiative by the WHO is not fully operating as needs more funding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-access-to-low-middle-income-nations-crucial-for-economic-recovery-who/story-6b8R9e56ZRrIZMTfayYjEO.html

That means the program identified about one case per 85,000 travellers screened,” CNN reported the CDC as saying.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe reasons for the failure of this style of screening were -- coronavirus has a number of nonspecific symptoms common to other infections, high number of asymptomatic cases, travellers may deny symptoms or take steps to avoid detection and passenger data was limited.Quoting the CDC report, CNN said that travellers and their local communities would be better protected if there was “more efficient” collection of contact information for international air passengers before they arrive and real-time data that could be sent to US health departments.According to the latest data by Johns Hopkins University, the United States has reported 10,523,260 cases of coronavirus and 242,577 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/screening-travellers-at-airports-for-covid-19-symptoms-ineffective-report/story-uJgq3yNP2oFIA4t7FZ6P4O.html
13-11-2020||World||Donald Trump bans investments in firms controlled by China military||Donald Trump signed an order prohibiting US investments in Chinese firms determined to be owned or controlled by the country’s military, the latest bid by the White House to pressure Beijing over what the president has described as abusive business practices.China is “increasingly exploiting” US capital for “the development and modernization of its military, intelligence, and other security apparatuses,” posing a threat to the US, according to the executive order, signed on Thursday.Also Read: US warns of more China sanctions over Hong Kong movesRelations between the US and China have deteriorated following the signing of a trade deal early in the year. Trump also has repeatedly vowed to punish Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic, its treatment of Muslim minorities and the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong. Chinese officials have threatened to retaliate with their own blacklist of US companies.Shares of top Chinese firms -- including China Mobile Ltd and China Telecom Corp Ltd. -- tumbled Friday on reports of the impending decision. The executive order will prohibit US investment firms and pension funds from buying and selling shares of 20 Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon as having military ties in June, as well as an additional 11 companies added in late August.China Mobile, whose controlling shareholder China Mobile Communications Group is on the list, dropped 5.8% in Hong Kong opening, the biggest intraday loss in almost eight months. China Telecom slumped 4.8%.The prohibition will go into effect on Jan. 11, and allows US investment firms and pension funds to divest their holdings in companies linked to the Chinese military over the next year. If the US determines additional companies have military ties in the future, American investors will be given 60 days from that determination to divest.US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien said in a statement that many of the companies at issue are traded on exchanges around the world. American investors can unknowingly provide funds through passive investments such as mutual funds and retirement plans, he added.The order “serves to protect American investors from unintentionally providing capital that goes to enhancing the capabilities of the People’s Liberation Army and People’s Republic of China intelligence services,” O’Brien said.In a move earlier this year to restrict the flow of money, the administration sent a letter to Michael Kennedy, then chairman of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, telling him to “halt all steps” associated with putting government employees’ savings in a fund that includes stakes in Chinese companies.Also Read: China’s military lays out technology roadmap to catch up with US by 2027: ReportSeparately, O’Brien on Wednesday said China’s latest clampdown in Hong Kong shows that the one country, two systems arrangement for the territory amounts to a “fig leaf” for dictatorship, and warned of new sanctions.The warning came after China’s top legislative body on Wednesday passed a resolution allowing for the disqualification of any Hong Kong lawmakers who were not deemed sufficiently loyal. Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s government immediately banished four legislators, prompting the remaining 15 in the 70-seat Legislative Council to resign en masse hours later at a joint press briefing.While the US has imposed sanctions against Lam and some officials in Beijing, it has so far held off punishing the country’s senior hierarchy. Such a move would infuriate Beijing and accelerate a deterioration in relations between the two nations on a variety of issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-bans-investments-in-firms-controlled-by-china-military/story-sQSjA6SARPqLGS9EM7RY8N.html
13-11-2020||World||Japan has worst day of Covid-19 cases yet amid fears of winter wave||Japan hit a new daily record of coronavirus infections Thursday as authorities began hinting they may take stronger measures to arrest the increase.A total of 1,661 cases were recorded nationwide, according to a tally by national broadcaster NHK, topping the previous high set during a surge in August. While numbers are low in absolute terms compared to many other countries, a spike in northern Japan is leading to concerns cases could spread as winter sets in.Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister overseeing the country’s coronavirus response, said more stringent steps would be needed if infections continued to rise. That’s the strongest warning yet from the national government in a country that has largely escaped the worst of the pandemic.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“If it continues like this, the medical system could become overstretched,” Nishimura said at a briefing in Tokyo. “It’s not at the point where we need to call for a state of emergency, but we need to have the strongest sense of caution.”Nishimura said that in some regions, several criteria used to evaluate the situation -- such as the pace of new infections and the proportion of cases with an unknown route of infection -- had entered the second-most serious stage on the government’s monitoring scale.Crisis ManagementThe government is considering forming a new post that would coordinate its crisis management of the pandemic, NHK also reported.Speaking Friday, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he had ordered the government to be on the highest alert in its virus response, but said another state of emergency, or the halting of a popular domestic travel campaign, were not something that experts said were needed now.The northern island of Hokkaido and Kanagawa, near Tokyo, were among regions that saw record numbers of new cases. The Hokkaido government has already asked bars and other establishments to close early in the regional capital’s nightlife district. Tokyo saw 393 infections, one of the heaviest days to date.“This could be the beginning of a sharp increase in infections,” said Norio Ohmagari, an infectious disease specialist advising Tokyo authorities, at a local government meeting. “We need to be on alert.”Japan has drawn attention from other nations for its ability to control the spread of the virus without mass-testing or enforced lockdowns. Despite two previous flareups, deaths and serious cases remain low, and hospitals haven’t been pushed to capacity. Life had been returning to normal, with sporting matches resuming and workers returning to offices.But in recent weeks, officials have expressed concern over the increasing variance of infection clusters, with cases rising in nursing homes, hospitals and schools. Experts have pointed to an increased spread among younger adults tired of social distancing, as well as within foreign communities, which may struggle due to language barriers and more limited access to health services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-has-worst-day-of-covid-19-cases-yet-amid-fears-of-winter-wave/story-sM4pBEDhpiiNOs0qEgfo6J.html
13-11-2020||World||Donald Trump, stewing over election loss, silent as Covid-19 surges||President Donald Trump has publicly disengaged from the battle against the coronavirus at a moment when the disease is tearing across the United States at an alarming pace.Trump, fresh off his reelection loss to President-elect Joe Biden, remains angry that an announcement about progress in developing a vaccine for the disease came after Election Day. And aides say the president has shown little interest in the growing crisis even as new confirmed cases are skyrocketing and hospital intensive care units in parts of the country are nearing capacity.Public health experts worry that Trump’s refusal to take aggressive action on the pandemic or to coordinate with the Biden team during the final two months of his presidency will only worsen the effects of the virus and hinder the nation’s ability to swiftly distribute a vaccine next year.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe White House coronavirus task force held its first post-election meeting Monday. Officials discussed the rising case numbers and the promise of a vaccine in development by Pfizer, and they recognized the service of Navy Rear Adm. John Polowczyk, a member of the task force who retired Monday.But Trump, who does not take part in the task force meetings, remains preoccupied with last week’s election results. He has yet to weigh in on the recent spike in virus cases that has state and local officials scrambling and hospitals concerned about their ability to treat those stricken.With more than 100,000 new confirmed US cases reported daily for more than a week, Trump has been more focused on tracking the rollout of a vaccine, which won’t be widely available for months. He has fumed that Pfizer intentionally withheld an announcement about progress on its vaccine trial until after Election Day, according to a White House official who was not authorized to publicly comment and spoke on condition of anonymity. Pfizer said it did not purposely withhold trial results.Although the president has consistently played down the pandemic, which has killed more than 240,000 Americans and infected more than 10 million people in the US, public health experts expressed worry about Trump’s silence on the troubling spike in cases, as well as his refusal to begin coordination on virus issues with Biden’s transition team.“It’s a big problem,” said Dr. Abraar Karan, a global health specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. “The transition is not going to happen until January, and we are in a complete crisis right now. We already know where this is headed. ... It’s not good enough to say we’re going to wait until the next president to address this.”The president’s silence comes as numerous White House and campaign officials have tested positive for the virus in recent days.White House chief of staff Mark Meadows tested positive last week after attending an election night party at the White House. Others at the party also have tested positive, including White House political director Brian Jack, former White House aide Healy Baumgardner and Trump campaign advisers David Bossie and Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski said Thursday that he believes he contracted the virus in Philadelphia while assisting the president’s election challenge there.Meanwhile, state and local officials around the country are scrambling in the midst of mounting caseloads. While Trump stays silent, they are urging their residents to step up mask wearing and social distancing, as they brace for what many epidemiologists worry is the beginning of a tumultuous period.In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has issued an order starting Friday for bars, restaurants and gyms to be closed by 10 p.m., and has set a cap of 10 people for private gatherings. In Illinois, public health officials asked employers to allow their personnel to work from home when possible and urged residents to stay at home as much as possible and skip nonessential travel.In Iowa, Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who resisted coronavirus restrictions, announced earlier this week that masks will now be required at indoor events of more than 25 people, and she banned outside events of 100 or more people unless all attendees wear masks.Trump hasn’t answered questions since before Election Day. That hasn’t slowed his Twitter habit, but he’s used it almost exclusively in recent days to rage over the election results and spread unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud.By late Thursday afternoon, Trump had tweeted or retweeted more than three dozen times that day. Just one was related to the virus — a retweet of a posting by Sen. David Perdue about Georgia receiving 2,000 vials of a new antibody treatment.White House officials declined to comment Thursday on when Trump last engaged with members of the coronavirus task force but insisted he remains focused on the pandemic“The president is regularly briefed about the coronavirus,” said White House spokesperson Sarah Matthews. “The relevant information is brought to him on the big decisions, and then he moves forward in the way that’s best for our country.”In the closing days of the campaign, Trump sought to reassure Americans that the country was “rounding the corner” on the virus, and he wrongly predicted that Democrats’ focus on the disease would go away right after the election. The president pushed a sunny public tone even after he tested positive for the virus in early October and was hospitalized for three days after contracting the virus. His wife, Melania, and teenage son, Barron, also contracted the virus.Biden, for his part, largely framed the election as a referendum on Trump’s handling of the pandemic. He has made addressing the virus his top priority as he moves forward with his transition. He spoke by phone Thursday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about the intensifying pandemic and prospects for passage of a Covid-19 relief bill in the lame duck session of Congress.Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris met virtually with his new coronavirus advisers this week, and Biden delivered remarks warning Americans that ’’the challenge before us right now is still immense and growing.”“We could save tens of thousands of lives if everyone would just wear a mask for the next few months. Not Democratic or Republican lives, American lives,” Biden said in a speech this week. “Please, I implore you, wear a mask.”Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University’s law school, said Biden will only be able to “scratch the surface” of tackling a pandemic that could be a “raging forest fire” by the time he takes office on Jan. 20.He added that even the good news on Pfizer’s development of a vaccine that showed 90% efficacy in early trial results could be diminished if Trump doesn’t begin coordination efforts with Biden’s team on how to roll out the vaccine. Some public health experts believe the task of persuading Americans to take the vaccine and widely distributing it could be as complicated as the vaccine’s development.“I fear the next three months ahead could be the worst we’ve faced during the pandemic,” Gostin said. “America is like a ship at storm, and the captain has decided to go play golf.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-stewing-over-election-loss-silent-as-covid-19-surges/story-u3VpTOE3jQ4feIUbMbr48K.html
13-11-2020||World||3 dead, 2 missing from flooding at North Carolina campsite||Three people are dead and two more, including a child, are missing after floodwaters from a nearby river overtook recreational vehicles at a North Carolina campsite Thursday, an official said. In addition to the three deaths at the Hiddenite Family Campground in Alexander County, a motorist was killed in the county while travelling on a road which was washed out by rising water, said Doug Gillespie, county director of public services. “Just massive amounts of flooding,” Gillespie said. “We’ve had approximately 50 roads across the county (which) have been compromised. Four bridges have been washed away.” According to Gillespie, the floodwaters either covered or swept away the recreational vehicles at the campground, which is next to the South Yadkin River and is home for many of the people caught in the flood. “It was a massive amount of water. Now, there’s a massive amount of debris,” he said, Swift water rescue personnel and local fire departments saved 31 people from their vehicles, some of them hanging onto their campers, according to Gillespie. He said three people were taken to the hospital for treatment, and two have been released. Of the two people still missing, one of them was a child approximately 1 year old, Gillespie said. Fixing the roads and bridges will take time, he said. “This is not going to be a two-day fix, a two-week fix,” Gillespie said. “It will be a months-to-a-year fix.” The campground is approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Charlotte, where a portion of Interstate 85 was closed because of flooding, and city officials said emergency personnel were performing water rescues. The University of North Carolina at Charlotte told students not already on campus to stay away because of widespread flooding. To the east, some school systems dismissed classes ahead of schedule because of the rain. Duke Energy said approximately 3,100 customers were without electricity across North Carolina as of Thursday afternoon. National Weather Service meteorologist Nick Tatro said the rain was the result of a band of tropical moisture moving up ahead of Tropical Storm Eta in the southeast and interacting with a cold front moving across the Carolinas. The cold front passage was going to occur regardless of Eta, but the flow around the tropical storm helped move the moisture northward toward the Carolinas. Forecasters said North Carolina could expect between 2 and 5 inches (5 and 12 centimeters) of rain, with heavier amounts locally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-dead-2-missing-from-flooding-at-north-carolina-campsite/story-YUzSjlpRjknJlLL9BiOPFI.html
13-11-2020||World||UK Prime Minister’s top aide Dominic Cummings quits, will leave by year-end||Dominic Cummings quit as Boris Johnson’s most powerful aide and will leave by the end of the year, a person familiar with the matter said.The news will plunge the prime minister’s leadership into crisis at a critical time for the UK as it navigates the closing stages of Brexit. Cummings earlier told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg that his position “hasn’t changed” since he wrote in January that he wanted to be “largely redundant” within a year.He is the second key adviser to Johnson to go in the space of a day, after tensions blew up over the way the prime minister’s inner circle operates. Late on Wednesday, Communications Director Lee Cain announced he was standing down.Brexit MastermindCummings has been at the premier’s side since he took power in July 2019, and was the mastermind of the successful Brexit referendum campaign that catapulted Johnson into the front rank of British politics three years earlier. His departure will deprive the premier of his most important adviser and strategist, who has wielded huge influence over all aspects of government policy, from its pandemic response to Brexit and economic reform.Johnson’s Senior Aide Resigns Amid Tensions in UK GovernmentCain and Cummings were the two closest aides to Johnson in his political team and he will feel their absence. It’s a critical time for the UK: with the country in a second national lockdown and the pandemic death rate rising again, Johnson has just a few days left to finalize a Brexit trade deal with the European Union before it’s too late.With Cain already gone, Cummings’s departure at year end will dovetail with the U.K.’s departure from its post-Brexit transition arrangements.Divisive FigureHis presence alongside Johnson at the top of government has always been controversial. In the first turbulent months of Johnson’s premiership in 2019, Cummings waged a campaign against anti-Brexit sympathizers inside the governing Conservative Party, forcing some rebels out for good and ripping up political conventions.Then Cummings helped steer the prime minister toward a historic election victory last December, winning the biggest Tory majority in more than 30 years on his platform to “level up” economically neglected regions of the U.K.But when the pandemic hit at the start of the year, the Cummings project ran into a wall. All government focus was turned to combating coronavirus and Cummings himself inevitably became part of the story.In May Johnson put his own authority on the line to defend Cummings, who was accused of breaking lockdown rules by driving more than 250 miles to seek childcare help when the public were being ordered to stay at home.The premier was so determined to keep Cummings that he appeared in public at press conferences and in parliament to answer questions and repeatedly defend his adviser’s actions.CainCain announced he was standing down as Johnson’s director of communications in a statement on Wednesday evening. “It was an honor to be asked to serve as the prime minister’s chief of staff,” Cain said, following reports that he had been lined up for the role by Johnson.It is not clear why Cain did not take up the role of chief of staff. According to one version of events, Cain and Cummings lobbied the prime minister to make Cain chief of staff. But Johnson was unhappy that the appointment was made public in Wednesday’s newspapers before he had reached a final decision, people familiar with the matter said.It remain unclear throughout Thursday if Cummings would follow Cain out the door. The answer came, in staggered fashion, late on Thursday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-prime-minister-s-top-aide-dominic-cummings-quits-will-leave-by-year-end/story-YATvHlhRWeE5zNxwunS3QP.html
13-11-2020||World||China under pressure to reveal Covid-19 vaccine data after Pfizer success||Western politicians have faulted China for initial delays in providing information as the coronavirus spread around the world. Now as Beijing develops a vaccine, the need for transparency is proving essential to win back trust.American drugmaker Pfizer Inc. and German biotechnology firm BioNTech SE announced this week that its vaccine appears more than 90% effective in stopping Covid-19 infections. The preliminary finding spurred a global stock rally and put the companies at the head of the pack in the race for the vaccine.At around the same time, China saw the final-stage trial of one of its top vaccine candidates halted in Brazil due to a serious adverse event. While Brazil reversed its decision in less than 48 hours, the episode underscored the fraught geopolitical tensions around vaccine development: Last month President Jair Bolsonaro said China lacks credibility and people wouldn’t feel safe with the shot “due to its origin.”Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“As China continues to push its own vaccines through the final stage of clinical trial in the midst of Pfizer’s announcement, the need for Beijing to address public perception about its vaccine safety issues is more pressing now than ever,” said Xiaoqing Lu Boynton, a consultant at Albright Stonebridge Group who focuses on health care and life sciences.For China, the stakes in developing a successful vaccine are high after a year that saw the outbreak in Wuhan further roil relations with the US, Europe, India and Australia. While Beijing quickly got the virus under control and sought to distribute aid to other countries, complaints followed about faulty materials and strings attached.The race to develop a vaccine has since become a way for China to show the world its technological superiority as the Trump administration urges countries around the globe to avoid Chinese companies for 5G networks, computer chips and big infrastructure projects. Distributing it widely would also help China regain some lost soft power: President Xi Jinping has promised that vaccines developed by China will be a global “public good,” and he joined a World Health Organization-backed effort to inoculate everyone against Covid-19.‘China Public Good’The “problem for me is global public good or China public good -- it’s two different notions,” said Nicolas Chapuis, the European Union’s ambassador to China. While he praised China’s decision to join the WHO-backed vaccine program, he said many questions remain on distribution, price and international certification.“To be certified samples have to be given,” he said. “Samples have not been given.”China has promised to prioritize providing doses for more than 60 countries, including governments that have received infrastructure loans under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative. Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Morocco have formal agreements with China’s major vaccine manufacturers, and countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have been promised a $1 billion loan to purchase doses from them.Still, China’s setback in Brazil combined with Pfizer’s breakthrough “puts China’s vaccine diplomacy in jeopardy,” said Yongwook Ryu, assistant professor of East Asian international relations at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.‘Lack of Transparency’“The issue is the lack of transparency,” Ryu said. “So the right thing for the Chinese government to do is to make its trial results and related information public, so that experts can scrutinize them.”China has already administered the vaccine, including the one from Sinovac Biotech Ltd. whose trial was just paused in Brazil, to hundreds of thousands of people under an expansive emergency use program. But none of the Chinese frontrunners have published any preliminary data from Phase 3 trials as Pfizer has done. Brazil’s health regulator is sending a mission to China this month to inspect facilities of some companies involved in vaccine production.Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have hailed the progress of the country’s vaccines over the past week and said safety was of paramount importance. Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui said China was “at a rather front position in the world,” while spokesman Wang Wenbin said Thursday the country’s vaccine program “has been commended by many countries.”Deep-Freeze Hurdle Makes Pfizer’s Vaccine One for the RichChinese companies could still emerge as leaders in vaccine distribution: The inactivated vaccines would be easier to distribute in poorer countries than the double-shot from Pfizer, which requires costly deep-freeze production, storage and transportation networks. The setback in Brazil might actually reinforce the notion that China is serious about the safety of its vaccine, according to Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.“It’s still too early to say that the U.S. has won the race,” he said.For the moment, however, governments across Asia are getting in touch with Pfizer to secure the vaccine and learn from the company. Pfizer’s results “have given hope” for many research programs that use similar technology, Nakorn Premsri, director of Thailand’s National Vaccine Institute, said in a briefing on Tuesday.‘Tall Order’Even China is jumping on board. Its drug regulator accepted an application from domestic drugmaker Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. to conduct a bridge trial that would pave the way for the Pfizer vaccine to be approved in China. Fosun said it could spend tens of million yuan to build cold-chain logistics needed to store and supply the shot in China.With vaccine nationalism set to rise, it’s all the more important for Chinese companies to publish all their data and have it subjected to peer review, said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor in public health at the City University of Hong Kong.“If the world is going to trust a Chinese vaccine, then the information will have to be transparent,” he said.Yet even then, it still may be hard to get China’s adversaries to accept the vaccine. In India, where vaccine distribution to more than a billion people will prove a challenge no matter where it comes from, public anger with China is the highest in recent memory following a deadly border standoff that has dragged on for months.“Cooperation will be difficult given current levels of trust,” said Biren Nanda, a former Indian ambassador who spent a decade in China. “When not only India but even other nations can’t seem to trust China with their work on our telecom systems and electronics, it would be a tall order to expect trust in a Chinese vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-under-pressure-to-reveal-covid-19-vaccine-data-after-pfizer-success/story-4mga4HNrPUIZrPDNagVPwN.html
13-11-2020||World||Post-election rancor clouds chances for Covid-19 relief bill||President-elect Joe Biden’s top allies on Capitol Hill adopted a combative posture on Covid-19 relief on Thursday, pressing their case for a $2 trillion bill that’s a nonstarter for Republicans and faulting the GOP for dragging its feet on acknowledging Biden’s victory.The message from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. — both of whom witnessed disappointing outcomes in House and Senate races last week — was that Republicans should concede Biden won and immediately return to negotiations on Covid relief, with the Democrats’ $2.4 trillion “HEROES Act” as the starting point.“It’s most unfortunate that the Republicans have decided that they will not respect the will of the people,” Pelosi told reporters. “It’s like the house is burning down, and they just refuse to throw water on it.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., reiterated that Republicans controlling the Senate simply won’t accept a bill of the size that Schumer and Pelosi want.“That’s not a place I think we’re willing to go. But I do think there needs to another package. Hopefully, we can get past the impasse we’ve had now for four or five months and get serious about doing something that’s appropriate,” McConnell told reporters.Top House Republican Kevin McCarthy of California, speaking just minutes later from the same podium, accused Pelosi of playing politics with Covid, deliberately dragging out pre-election talks on new relief to deny President Donald Trump a victory that could have helped him in the election. Trump hasn’t talked or tweeted much about Covid since the election, and has instead focused on grievances about the results.The continued battling comes as caseloads are spiking across the country in a third wave of the pandemic that is threatening a dangerous winter, despite advances in vaccine development and treatments to fight it the disease. The rebound of the economy has been relatively strong so far, but both sides agree more help is needed — even as they spar over specifics like jobless assistance and the means to distribute treatments and vaccines.“We need another COVID relief bill,” said moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. “We need another round of the (paycheck protection) program that’s aimed at the most distressed businesses or otherwise they will not be able to keep employing their workers and they will close their doors forever. We need more funding for schools, for health care providers, for the airlines and bus lines.”Congress virtually unanimously passed a $1.8 trillion Covid rescue bill in March, but top leaders and the administration have fought for months over what another installment of relief should entail. Before the election, with Democrats riding high in the polls, Pelosi took a hard line in the talks, even as the administration made numerous concessions. Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, shied away from concessions made by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as well.“She sacrificed our economy and people who were hurting,” McCarthy said.The combative postures all around don’t appear to bode well for a quick resolution or the smooth resumption of the serious talks that flamed out before Election Day. Capitol Hill is in limbo, frozen by the refusal of Trump and Republicans like McCarthy to accept Biden’s victory and by two Senate runoff elections in Georgia that Republicans are favored to win to maintain control of the chamber.Pelosi and Schumer, meanwhile, continue to press Covid relief proposals like more than $400 billion in aid to state and local governments that McConnell won’t go for.The two later released a “readout” of a call with Biden, setting benchmarks for a lame-duck relief deal that “provides resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, relief for working families and small businesses, support for state and local governments trying to keep frontline workers on the payroll, expanded unemployment insurance, and affordable health care for millions of families.”It appears, however, that Democratic leverage has eroded despite Biden’s win.“What Joe Biden got in this election was a mandate, a mandate to address the challenges that our country faces,” Pelosi said. “And in order to do that, we must address the COVID, the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/post-election-rancor-clouds-chances-for-covid-19-relief-bill/story-2B6Y0FvxslW4ITwkFmRUoL.html
13-11-2020||World||TikTok gets reprieve on Donald Trump’s demand for a ban on the app||The Trump administration pulled back from its threat to ban the viral video-sharing app TikTok in the US, as the dispute winds its way through the court system and a proposed sale hangs in limbo.For months, the app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., has faced the prospect of a US ban starting Thursday. But judges have blocked those prohibitions from going into effect. The Commerce Department said on Thursday that it would comply with those court rulings for the time being, even as the government appeals.The TikTok prohibition “HAS BEEN ENJOINED, and WILL NOT GO INTO EFFECT, pending further legal developments,” the Commerce Department said in a document published in the federal register.Separately, ByteDance has challenged an order from the Treasury Department to sell TikTok or face unspecified penalties. The US Court of Appeals in Washington on Thursday gave ByteDance and the Trump administration Dec. 14 and Dec. 28 deadlines to file documents in the case.When it filed the petition Tuesday, TikTok said the government had not responded to its latest efforts to strike a compromise and prevent an enforced sale. It’s not clear if anything has developed since to extend the deadline, but the court order didn’t allude to any new arrangement.ByteDance had sought US approval for a deal to sell a stake in the app to Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. before the Nov. 12 deadline. But the agreement appears to be in limbo. Before filing its petition in Washington this week, ByteDance requested a 30-day extension from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, or Cfius, that is overseen by the Treasury Department, to keep working toward a solution. That request went unanswered, according to court papers.Lawyers for TikTok and officials at the Treasury Department didn’t respond to requests for comment.Trump has made the fight over TikTok a central front in his broader efforts to crack down on the influence of China’s technology industry in the US Trump first ordered a TikTok sale in August, and threatened to ban the app if ByteDance couldn’t reach an agreement with an American company.He hasn’t said anything about TikTok since the election, having focused on trying to discredit the results that show he lost. But on Thursday Trump issued an executive order prohibiting US investments in Chinese firms determined to be owned or controlled by the country’s military.In September, a judge in Washington blocked a portion of the ban that would have prevented new downloads of the app. And on Oct. 30, a Pennsylvania judge issued a temporary injunction on rules that would have prevented third-party companies from providing online infrastructure that allows TikTok to function smoothly. The US appealed the Washington ruling in October, and said on Thursday it would appeal the Pennsylvania ruling.The status of the Cifius process for a sale is less clear. If the government reaches an accord with the company, it could exercise discretion around enforcement timing, said Aimen Mir, a partner at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and a former deputy assistant secretary for investment security at Treasury, where he ran reviews for Cifius.“Usually when there is extended silence from Cfius, it suggests there’s no clear consensus within government on what the next step would be, but this has been an atypical case for awhile,” Mir said.If an extension hasn’t already been granted, Mir said the Justice Department would have to go to court and seek enforcement of the divestiture order. Trump’s executive order from August doesn’t stipulate a clear punishment for failure to divest, but says that “the Attorney General is authorized to take any steps necessary to enforce this order.” The Justice Department declined to comment.TikTok is one of the most popular apps in the world -- with more than 100 million U.S. users -- and ByteDance’s most important service outside of China. The company and its investors are desperate to finish a deal to avoid a ban in what has been a valuable market for other social media apps, like Facebook Inc.’s Instagram and Snap Inc.’s Snapchat.Trump threatened to ban TikTok and order its sale to a US company as a result of national security concerns. The US is worried that the Chinese government could use the app to gain access to the personal data of American citizens.Cifius, the Treasury Department panel that reviews foreign acquisitions of American businesses, said in a July 30 letter included in ByteDance’s court filing in Washington this week that its security concerns were based on both classified and unclassified information. The letter cited the move by a Chinese affiliate of ByteDance in 2017 to establish a Communist Party Committee in its governance structure, and pointed out that ByteDance also collaborates with public security bureaus across China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-gets-reprieve-on-donald-trump-s-demand-for-a-ban-on-the-app/story-uTDL0G2k4DAtBd1S1rNl2O.html

They met several times and Obama made history as the first US president to visit India twice while in office — 2012 and 2015 — and as the first US president to attend the Republic Day celebrations, both times on PM Modi’s watch.The former president wrote Rahul Gandhi — they met at least twice — in 2015 and 2017 — has “a nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject”, according a direct quote in the NYT review. The context of this observation could not be ascertained from the review, which listed it among gossipy details that Obama put down in the book about leaders he met and interacted over the eight years of his presidency, 2009 to 2017.The former president appeared to write glowingly about Sonia Gandhi but there were no direct quotes from the book in the review. About Singh, Obama wrote: “Secretary of Defense Bob Gates and the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh both come across as having a kind of impassive integrity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eager-to-impress-barack-obama-book-on-rahul-gandhi/story-CExC9kiGpOKjcWWG6cWZPO.html
13-11-2020||World||Coronavirus mutation in Denmark’s minks could be perilous for vaccines||The fight against Covid-19 got a big boost this week, with the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine showing much better-than-expected effectiveness in preventing disease in its first readout and Eli Lilly & Co.’s therapeutic antibody getting an Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. Other vaccines and treatments are likely to follow with similarly positive data. So far so good.But exactly how jubilant should we be? Answering this question depends in large measure on how quickly the virus mutates and finds a way to bypass vaccines and other approved therapies. How quickly it mutates, in turn, depends on our ability to slow the spread through responsible mitigation measures.Some background. Viruses mutate all the time. During the course of a single infection, a person can have coronaviruses with slight differences. If a vaccine or an antibody isn’t 100% effective in eradicating an infection, then even if it prevents disease it could still allow resistant clones to form. These clones could then spread to other people and undermine the efficacy of the vaccine or treatment.This isn’t theoretical. Denmark, one of the world’s biggest producers of mink skins, is in the process of culling its entire 17 million mink population after the virus found its way into herds at hundreds of the country’s farms. By virtue of their sheer numbers, the mink provided the virus with an opportunity to spread rapidly and mutate. Then, in exactly the same way that the virus first entered into the human population in China, it jumped back into humans. One variant of the Danish virus has the potential to be resistant to the very vaccines and therapies that we have just been celebrating.Also Read: Scientists detect two-way transmission of coronavirus on mink farmsBut we don’t need mink farms to generate mutations. A recent study from Emma Thomson, professor at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, and associates found a mutation that can bypass infection-fighting antibodies produced by some people. What this means is that there is one more reason to be concerned about the rapid spread of the coronavirus among humans: The more people get infected, the more likely it is for new versions of the virus to evolve. If the number of infections remains at current levels — or if it continues to rise — there is a risk that new mutations start to spread. Some of these new versions may even be able to reinfect people who had been infected before, a phenomenon that until now has been quite rare.Almost all vaccines in development target the current version of the virus, meaning that they should be effective in preventing the disease in a vast majority of people. However, if we allow the virus to spread, we risk further mutations, and, consequently, less effective vaccines.Should we put the Champagne back on ice? Definitely not. We can take comfort in that we have seen how effective a vaccine can be, at least based on early prevention of disease, and how quickly we can make one. And the beauty of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and another in development by Moderna Inc. is that they can be adapted to deal with new variants that develop. The same applies to Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccines, with some caveats.The Danish experience suggests it’s critically important to stop the evolution of the virus before we even start vaccinating people. That means bringing to bear all mitigation tools, from testing and tracing to social distancing and masks. And we may need to keep up these practices after a vaccine has been deployed until we can be sure inoculations eliminate virus transmission. On top of all this, countries should keep a better eye on their animal populations so as to avoid another Danish mink situation. The more responsible we are with our behaviour, the better the chance for a successful vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-mutation-in-denmark-s-minks-could-be-perilous-for-vaccines/story-IqQjmiar9g3kDtIOZff6bI.html

This is what Europe is about and this is what we stand for.”The move comes as some EU nations attract criticism for their policies. Poland has put in place LGBT-free zones while Hungary has proposed legal changes to enshrine religious doctrine and ban same-sex couples from adoption.Also Read: Brexit talks go into next week, with EU and UK dividedThe commission called on all 27 EU nations to adopt an equality strategy, saying that even in countries with a wide acceptance and support for equal rights, “it has not always translated into clear improvements in LGBTIQ people’s lives.”The EU’s plan promises targeted actions, such as legal protection against discrimination at work and hate crime and help cross-border recognition of rainbow families.The EU strategy is adopted “at a time where we are witnessing the erosion or back-sliding of fundamental rights in some member states,” the commission said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-defends-lgbtiq-rights-in-its-first-ever-equality-strategy/story-IFCfxR3DIsR1L4lV2S1RUP.html
13-11-2020||World||Climate crisis is Boris Johnson’s chance to woo Joe Biden||Boris Johnson was given a friendly warning over the risks of Brexit by Joe Biden during a 25-minute phone-call on Tuesday afternoon. But there was at least one bright spot in that first conversation with the incoming American president: a shared goal to tackle climate change.The British prime minister said that it was “extremely exciting” to discuss the global response to the environment. “As you know, the UK is leading the world in driving down emissions and tackling climate change,” he told Parliament the following day.As Britain tries to redefine its role on the global stage after leaving the European Union, Johnson has a lot riding on green policies.The United Nations COP26 global climate change summit in Glasgow a year from now is critical to the success of that broader mission, and to the longer-term reputation of the UK. The question is whether the new man in the White House is about to eclipse Johnson’s standing as a driver of action or enhance it if the two join forces. The UK has a team of 120 climate and energy attachés, the world’s largest network of its kind, and since taking hold of COP26 presidency last year, ministers and senior officials have directly engaged with at least 100 governments to press for faster action.Also read: Boris Johnson urges Pakistan to assure fundamental rights of citizensThis week, his government pledged to be at the vanguard of “green finance” and announced it will ban supermarkets from produce linked to illegal deforestation. Even diplomats from EU member states, many quick to criticize the UK as Brexit talks drag on, have praised British efforts to corral countries from Brazil to Australia to make more ambitious commitments.The election of Biden will see the issue shoot up Washington’s priorities after being effectively abandoned by Donald Trump. While that may help boost overall global efforts, some experts argue it could also ultimately expose the U.K.’s lack of clout when compared with the EU, China and the US“You are going to have a dialog going on between the EU and China and US, and things are moving,” said Rachel Kyte, a dean at Tufts University and a former renewable energy adviser to the UN secretary-general. “The UK is not in the middle of that anymore, so you have to exercise a presidency from outside of the circle rather than from right in the middle of it.”The post-Brexit mantra of “Global Britain” has been derided by opponents who say the UK’s influence will only diminish outside the EU. Johnson’s government also faces plenty of internal struggles after presiding over the worst death toll from the coronavirus in Europe. His inner circle was destabilized on Wednesday evening when a senior aide quit. Yet on climate action some tangible UK successes abroad are apparent. In the past two weeks, Japan and South Korea have committed to zero out their greenhouse gases by 2050. Johnson, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and other ministers had been lobbying both governments in recent months and Raab traveled to the two countries to make the case.As an early adopter of a net-zero target on emissions by 2050, the UK is now well-placed to lean on other countries to follow suit. Biden, meanwhile, has promised to rejoin the landmark Paris climate agreement on his first day in office and to set the US’s own 2050 net-zero target.One key measure of success at COP26 will be getting countries that have dragged their feet to sign up to more progressive goals, said Alessandro Motta, an Italian diplomat helping to organize COP26.“It’s quite evidently a way to show that after Brexit the UK can still exert a leading role on the global stage,” said Motta. “The UK government has really put a lot of reserves on these diplomatic efforts.”According to a diplomat from a major European government, the UK is pushing the climate agenda through all multilateral channels at the UN, G7 and G20. The diplomat said Britain was aiming to get firm commitments from India, Indonesia, Australia, Canada, South Africa, Brazil and Saudi Arabia.The first real test of the UK’s influence will come on December 12, when Johnson will co-host a conference with the UN that asks other world leaders to set their net-zero goals. They will also have to set interim 2030 climate targets. With Trump on his way out, the US may now soon add its name to the list of countries making strong commitments.In the meantime, Johnson is redoubling efforts.In comments on Thursday to mark a year before the summit in Scotland, which was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, the prime minister called on world leaders to bring forward targets. “Climate change will remain the most enduring threat to the futures of our children and grandchildren—and the world we’re fighting for—if we do not act,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-crisis-is-boris-johnson-s-chance-to-woo-joe-biden/story-2Qmo9a8vJHUpD5kfJQA6II.html
13-11-2020||World||As Covid-19 pandemic rages, global daily deaths surpass peak levels from April||While the latest wave of Covid-19 infections in the United States and Europe has been pushing the seven-day average of daily cases to record levels through the past month, the global death trajectory too has seen a massive rise in the past week, going beyond the previous peak witnessed in early April. This means that more people are dying from Covid-19 across the world every day now than ever before in the 11 months since the virus was first reported in eastern China’s Wuhan city. The global trajectory of the viral disease is currently at levels never before witnessed, particularly due to new infections and deaths in countries such as the United States, France, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom and Italy touching record levels in the past week or so, shows data from Worldometers.DAILY DEATHS SOAR WORLDWIDEAs the first wave of infections tore through Europe and the US in March, deaths rose at a rapid rate through the month and beyond, with the seven-day average of daily deaths peaking at 7,089 on April 18. In the months, and waves of infections, that followed, while daily cases continued to rise, setting new records on regular intervals, the death trajectory never went past the levels from mid-April. Also read | Japan braces for fresh Covid-19 record amid fears of winter waveThis was largely due to two reasons. First, scientists and doctors got better at saving lives as better understanding of the disease developed with time. Second, the general population in Asia and South America, where the virus spread to through May and September, is younger. By mid-April, the case fatality rate, or the CFR, of the disease across the world was a little over 7%, compared to 2.5% at present. This was particularly due to the high number of fatalities in the West. The US, which had seen more than 40,000 people die from the disease, had the most deaths in the world and a CFR of 5%. Italy had reported 23,286 deaths from 175,918 cases till April 18, registering a CFR of 13%. Countries like Spain and the UK till then had seen around 17% of all infected people die. But as these countries brought the first wave under control, things got better and daily deaths remained low --- below the 6,000 mark for the next six months. In the past few weeks, however, things have worsened. The spike in cases worldwide through October has caused a massive uptick in daily deaths, pushing the seven-day average above the mid-April level for the first time on November 4, when it touched 7140. And it has been rising fast since. Over the last week, 8,300 people have died every day. Most of these deaths have come from the US, where 1,080 people have died every day in the past week. On average, 570 people have died every day in the last week in India – the second highest in the world. On the third spot is France, where 529 people have died a day in the last week. It is followed by Mexico and Italy, where the seven-day averages are 465 and 455, respectively. In Iran, the number is 451, while it is 375 in the UK. To be sure, the number of daily deaths is rising very fast in Europe and North American nations, while in countries such as India that are seeing a drop in new infections, this number has been dropping fast. NEW CASES In terms of new infections, the US continues to have the most cases with the country reporting nearly 130,000 infections in the past week. India, despite the ebbing of the first wave of infections, has reported the second highest number of daily cases in the past week – 46,035. It is followed closely by France (46,031 new cases in the last week) and Italy (34,007 new cases). Interestingly, Poland has been the next largest contributor to daily cases as it has reported 25,600 new cases in the last week. Brazil is on the sixth spot with 22,581 new cases . It is followed by UK, Russia, Germany and Spain with 22524, 20501, 18402 and 17705 new cases a day, respectively. Around 42% of all infections in the world have come from Europe -- 279,000 new infections a day in the past week. In North America, fuelled almost entirely by cases in the US, the seven-day average of daily cases is around 162,000, while the number is 95,000 in Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-covid-19-pandemic-rages-global-daily-deaths-surpass-peak-levels-from-april/story-zjMSniCcTKv1Isad8HVmDL.html
13-11-2020||India||Ladakh border disengagement plan ready, claims Chinese media. Then another spin||Indian and Chinese military are about to implement a border disengagement plan under reciprocal principle, China’s state media claimed in a news report on Friday. The report, published by Global Times, a tabloid of the Chinese Communist Party, also claimed that the disengagement plan requires India to first withdraw its soldiers from the friction points in eastern Ladakh. Quoting anonymous sources, the tabloid said China will consider disengaging its army from the northern side of the Pangong Tso once the Indian army withdraws.“India should first withdraw staff who illegally crossed the line on the southern side of the Pangong Tso Lake, and China will then consider disengaging on the northern side of the lake,” sources told the tabloid published by the People’s Daily, the ruling Communist Party of China’s official newspaper.The Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to requests from the Hindustan Times to comment on the report in Global Times.There has been no formal response from New Delhi to the claim reported by Chinese state media. But India had made it clear right after the initial rounds of diplomatic and military talks that since China’s People’s Liberation Army troops were the first to provoke, Indian troops could not be expected to be the first to take a step back. Northern Army commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi told reporters in July that the army would continue all efforts to restore status quo ante (the situation as it existed in early April) along the Line of Actual Control.Also Read: Indian Army, PLA consider scaling up disengagement at Ladakh borderThe Global Times report published on Friday was an updated version of a report published a day earlier in the same tabloid, which denied Indian media reports on “detailed arrangements for a disengagement plan of the two militaries”, as “not accurate”.The two nuclear powers have been locked in a border dispute for more than five months, with several rounds of diplomatic and military talks failing to produce a breakthrough.Indian officials have, after the last round of talks, confirmed that the two sides were considering a proposal for phased withdrawal of troops and military equipment in the sensitive Pangong Tso sector as part of a broader disengagement plan to reduce tensions in the Ladakh theatre. If this proposal goes through, it will be the first significant movement in negotiations in more than four months — disengagement in Galwan valley took place in early July but it did not progress in other areas.The proposal was first discussed on November 6 during the eighth round of military talks between corps commander-ranked officers from the two armies in the Chushul sector.The Chinese foreign and defence ministries have not commented on the details that were said to have been discussed during the November 6 military talks, the eighth round of negotiations between the armed forces.In a statement to the Hindustan Times dated November 10, the Chinese foreign ministry said “…there was a frank, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on the issue of disengagement in the western section of the Sino-Indian border,” during the November 6 talks.“The two sides agreed to conscientiously implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, ensure that the front-line forces exercise restraint and avoid misunderstandings and misjudgements,” the statement said.To a specific question on whether People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops deployed at the border with India were facing problems because of the harsh winter, the foreign ministry statement had said it was “not a problem” for the Chinese military.A five-point roadmap agreed on by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart and state councillor Wang Yi on September 10 had laid out the road ahead to defuse the ongoing tension at the border: Dialogue aimed at quick disengagement, maintaining proper distance between troops of the two sides and easing tensions, abiding by all agreements and protocols on border management, continuing dialogue through the Special Representatives mechanism and the WMCC, and working on new confidence-building measures once the situation eases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-border-disengagement-plan-ready-claims-chinese-media-then-another-spin/story-CEJcguqJRP6mKhUc4tO9xK.html

13-11-2020||India||41 trains cancelled, 11 short-terminated over farmers’ protest in Punjab||The Northern Railway on Friday said that as many as 41 trains were cancelled and eleven were short-terminated in view of farmers’ agitation in Punjab.Earlier in the day, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal held talks with a delegation of representatives of farmers from Punjab, who are protesting a set of laws passed recently to liberalise the farm sector, at the national capital’s Vigyan Bhawan.This is the second attempt by the government to negotiate with the farmers and break an impasse following a cultivators’ agitation in some states, particularly Punjab, against the Centre’s move to open up agricultural markets in the nation.Agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal had met a farmers’ delegation earlier on October 14, after inviting them for talks, to convince them to end their protest, but the meeting had ended in a deadlock.The farmers in Punjab have launched protests, blockading rail tracks and road transport, since the government enacted three farm-sector laws in September.The three laws, together, allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce by easing restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming.The protesting farmers say the reforms could make them vulnerable to exploitation, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers cultivators assured prices from the government, largely for wheat and rice.The farmer organisations are likely to press for the MSP system to be written into law, which is high on their agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/41-trains-cancelled-11-short-terminated-over-farmers-protest-in-punjab/story-9mHoPU9EXHsuasArsBpDmK.html

Upwards of 80% blockage has been achieved in human experiments that have measured blocking of all respiratory droplets,with cloth masks in some studies performing on par with surgical masks as barriers for source control,” it noted.The SARS-CoV-2, that causes Covid-19, can transmit through direct or indirect or close contact with an infected person through respiratory droplet transmission via coughing, sneezing or talking.“An investigation of a high-exposure event, in which 2 symptomatically ill hair stylists interacted for an average of 15 minutes with each of 139 clients during an 8-day period, found that none of the 67 clients who subsequently consented to an interview and testing developed infection. The stylists and all clients universally wore masks in the salon as required by local ordinance and company policy at the time,” the US health body noted further in its study.The CDC, citing several studies, advocated universal use of masking policies, saying that it can help avoid lockdowns in the future, especially if clubbed with other policies such as social distancing, hand hygiene and adequate ventilation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-cloth-masks-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-19-says-new-cds-study/story-HTRbHKz84w1X1VwQDIlbdL.html

But the government is anticipating a second wave in January, February and thereby has asked the authorities to not lower their guards on testing. A circular from the government’s health services directorate dated November 11 said a second wave of the pandemic is likely in January-February. It also said that the estimation is based on what is happening in Europe. Delhi at present is reporting the third wave of the infection the first took place in June and the second in September. Kerala, too, saw a dip in the number of cases until September. The Covid-19 curve is different at every state. Since the breakout in March, cases in Mahrashtra were alway on the rise. Only in October, there have been some signs of decline. The circular said there should be no complacency in coronavirus testing and all labs will remain functional as per Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. The circular said the need of the hour is to celebrate a firecracker-free Diwali keeping in mind health interest of COVID-19 patients and those with breathing problems.On Friday, Maharashtra recorded 4,132 new coronavirus cases, which took the case tally to 17,40,461.As far as unlocking is concerned, Maharashtra chose to be behind other states. Gyms were reopened after Dussehra and religious places will reopen after Diwali.

13-11-2020||India||Odisha cop caught kicking tribal on video got clean chit. Rights panel nails her||A woman police officer seen thrashing a tribal young man in a widely-circulated video eight months ago should not be given a field posting for the next two years, the Odisha Human Rights Commission has said.The Odisha police had given inspector Sandhyarani Jena a clean chit.The commission chairperson Justice Bimal Das and member Asim Amitav Das, however, rejected the police officer’s claims of innocence and after watching the video, observed that the inspector had clearly used force on the tribal young man which amounted to custodial violence.On March 25, Chiita Ranjan Mahanta of Talasarua village in Keonjhar district had gone to Patna police station in connection with an FIR regarding a land dispute where he was named as an accused. At the police station, inspector Jena thrashed and kicked her. She was placed under suspension after the video of the incident emerged in May and provoked nationwide outrage.This is the second case in two days where the commission has come down harshly on police officers facing charges of violating the human rights of citizens. On Thursday, the commission ordered a police inspector to pay Rs 5 lakh in a penalty for arresting two men on a trumped-up murder charge. The two men spent eight months in jail before being released.The commission had ordered inspector Sandhyarani Jena to pay an interim compensation of Rs 10,000 to the tribal man she was accused of beating and kicking. But she went to the high court against this direction, arguing that the commission hadn’t heard her out before ordering compensation. The high court agreed with her and told the commission to hear her version first.The inspector denied assault and said the video was made in what she described as a melodramatic fashion. She also cited the clean chit handed to her by her superior officer, the area sub-divisional police officer who had conducted an inquiry. The report had said it was unintentional and without any malice.The commission did not agree and called her action an affront to the positive initiative of the state government to make the force more transparent and people-friendly.“The state police is a disciplined force and for any acts of commission and omission, the department should not be defamed. The inspector should be sent for training as to how to deal with the accused persons and in the typical situations,” the commission ruled.The human rights commission also noted that CCTV was not working in the police station when the incident happened. “This leads to the presumption that the inspector took the opportunity for beating and kicking an accused inside the police station. It’s the responsibility of the inspector to keep it functional,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cop-caught-kicking-tribal-on-video-got-clean-chit-rights-panel-nails-her/story-a0H2qqOZmUA4WmKzklc5yM.html
13-11-2020||India||RJD considers legal challenge to Bihar poll results, EC says election was transparent||Top leaders of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) led by Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Friday held a meeting with around 30 candidates of the party who lost by narrow margins and assured them the party would mount a legal challenge against poll results in various assembly constituencies. The meeting lasted over four hours during which the RJD nominees shared their experience at the counting centres with some alleging they lost because of manipulation by election officials. Shakti Singh Yadav, RJD’s former MLA from Hilsa in Nalanda, said he would file a writ petition in the Patna High Court challenging the poll results of his defeat to JD(U)’s Prem Mukhiya, who won by a margin of 12 votes. “I will take legal recourse and file a writ petition. I was leading and then the trends reversed after postal ballots were counted. It is all very suspicious and looks like there was a conspiracy to defeat me,” he said. He further claimed that a large number of postal ballots including votes cast by teachers in his constituency engaged in polls were rejected on the plea that many of these ballots did not have covering letters of verification of voters. “It was not my work to ensure that the postal ballot carried necessary papers verifying the identity as a voter. This is again a grey area,” he said. But Bihar’s Chief Electoral Officer, H R Srinivasa insisted that all norms were followed at the counting centres. In context of Hilsa constituency, Srinivasa said all the postal ballots including the rejected ones were recounted on the request of the RJD nominee. “As per EC directives, if the margin of win is less than the postal ballots, then re-verification is done of invalid postal ballots. In Hilsa, the Returning Officer went a step ahead and carried out recounting of all postal ballots including invalid votes in the presence of the candidates. The results were the same,” he said. Srinivasa said that he had already issued the list of 11 constituencies where the margin of win was less than 1,000 votes in postal ballots on Thursday. Of the 11 constituencies, JD(U) won four seats, RJD has won three seats, LJP one seat, BJP one seat , CPI one seat and one seat was won by an independent candidate. “In these 11 constituencies, different parties have won including one independent. The election was conducted in a free, fair and transparent manner,” he said. The 11 seats include Hilsa, Barbigha, Ramgarh, Matihani, Bhorey, Dehri, Bachhwara, Chakai, Kurhani , Bakhri and Parbattta. Besides, the CEO said the norms laid down for classifying postal ballots as valid and invalid were followed strictly during the counting process. On the RJD’s demand of seeking CDs of video recordings of counting centres, Srinivasa said the CDs of videography done inside the counting centres would be provided to whoever asks for it. “We will provide the CDs as against the deposition of the required fee. Everything is there,” he said. The Election Commission too has clarified that the counting process was slow because of the increase in polling stations due to Covid-19 safety guidelines. Meanwhile, RJD’s state spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwary said the party was looking into legal options to challenge the polls results in several constituencies where the margin of victory was abysmally low. “Consultations are going with various allies of the grand alliance and legal experts are also being approached for taking a view on the options of moving court,” he said. On Thursday, Tejashwi had alleged that the irregularities in the counting process had led to the Grand Alliance losing 20 seats that stopped it from reaching the majority figure of 122. The Grand Alliance ended up with 110 seats against the NDA’s 125.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-considers-legal-challenge-to-bihar-poll-results-ec-says-election-was-transparent/story-Nw8S7q2iPT7AkCHjmI9r3H.html
13-11-2020||India||2 commandos among 8 Pak soldiers killed as India lights up Pak posts in retaliation||At least eight Pakistani soldiers were killed on Friday and 12 injured after Indian Army targeted Pakistani positions across the Line of Control (LoC) in north Kashmir with artillery guns and anti-tank guided missiles in response to heavy shelling by the neighbouring army in which nine Indians --- including five security personnel --- lost their lives, people familiar with the developments said on Friday. Pakistani ammunition dumps, fuel dumps and terror launch pads were among the targets destroyed by the Indian Army, they said. The heavy exchange of fire --- triggered by ceasefire violations by the Pakistani army in multiple sectors on the eve of Diwali --- has turned the spotlight on the LoC at a time when Indian and Chinese forces are locked in a border dispute along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive Ladakh sector where a disengagement plan is under discussion but has made no progress so far. Four Indian soldiers, a Border Security Force sub-inspector and four civilians, including a woman and a seven-year-old boy, were killed in Pakistani shelling in Uri, Naugam, Keran and Gurez sectors in north Kashmir, the officials said, asking not to be identified. Three Indian soldiers were injured. The Pakistani casualties include at least two Special Service Group commandos, they said. The Indian Army blamed Pakistan for unprovoked ceasefire violations along the LoC. “Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violations along the LoC spread across multiple sectors including Dawar, Keran, Uri and Naugam. Pakistan used mortars and other weapons,” said Srinagar-based defence spokesperson Col Rajesh Kalia. He said that the neighbouring army deliberately targeted civilian areas. “Our troops retaliated strongly causing casualties and substantial damage to Pakistan army’s infrastructure across the LoC. Several ammunition dumps, fuel dumps and multiple terrorist launch pads have been damaged,” Kalia said. The Pakistani army began shelling Indian positions after the Indian Army foiled a major infiltration attempt in the Keran sector, the officials said. There has been a significant increase in ceasefire violations by Pakistan this year. While the neighbour violated the ceasefire 3,233 times last year, the figure this year stands at 4,052 so far, according to army data. Pakistan carried out 394 violations in October as against 128 till now in November.The Indian Army released several images, including unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) footage, showing multiple Pakistani bunkers and other positions going up in flames in the retaliatory Indian action. One of the videos released by the army showed a Pakistani soldier running for cover before his post was hit by an anti-tank guided missile. “Pakistani casualties may be higher. What we have right now is an initial estimate,” the officials said. Watch how Indian forces blew away Pakistan bunker during LoC escalationThe Pakistanis have got it back “right and proper,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations, commenting on the Indian Army’s retaliatory action.“Pakistan is seeking to create trouble along the LoC as it is aware of our focus on the LAC and the commitment there. The Pakistan army is making desperate attempts to push in infiltrators before harsh winters set in. The ceasefire violations are carried out to help the infiltrators. Also, the Valley has been quiet and the neighbour wants to up the ante there to trigger violence and bloodshed,” Bhatia added. In Naugam sector, a BSF officer posted at Atma Complex was killed in the shelling. He was identified as sub inspector Rakesh Dobal. Baramulla resident Abdul Qayoom said that shelling is still going in some areas of Uri. “Four civilians were killed in Uri and another four were injured,” he said. The ceasefire violation was reported from all the important sectors stretching from Uri to Gurez. All these sectors have witnessed multiple ceasefire violations this year and soldiers have been on high alert. Locals in Uri said the Indian and Pakistani soldiers were targeting each other’s pickets at Haji Peer and Kamalkote sectors since morning. The locals said small arms and mortars have been used during the shelling which triggered panic among the villagers near the LoC. “This was one of the deadliest shelling fires in many years in the Uri sector. Some shells hit residential houses,” said Iqbal Ahmad, a resident of Uri. “The people are very scared as we could see shells landing in the villages,” another civilian Mukthair Ahmad Khawaja said. The situation in Uri town was tense even as ambulances sped towards villages near the LoC to ferry injured civilians to hospitals. In the Keran and Gurez sectors, mortar shells landed close to residential areas in Izmerg, Baktore and Tarabal localities which are just a few kilometers from the LoC. Two girls were injured in Baktore and both were referred to Srinagar for treatment. “We were attending an election meeting when shelling began around 11 am. The intensity of shelling was heavy and people ran for cover. The markets were shut and many people took refuge in underground bunkers. Now the shelling has stopped but people are still in underground bunkers, said Zaheer Ahmad, a government official posted in Gurez. The infiltration attempt in the Keran sector on Friday was the second infiltration bid this week, Kalia said. “Three terrorists were killed in the earlier unsuccessful infiltration bid in the Machil sector on November 7-8,” he added. Three soldiers, including a captain, were killed in action in Machil that day. At a time when military tensions between India and China in eastern Ladakh, the military is also keeping a strict vigil on the western front to deter Pakistan from fishing in troubled waters and prevent what could turn out to be a two-front conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-commandos-among-8-pak-soldiers-killed-as-india-lights-up-pak-posts-in-retaliation/story-AvxzPgYO2gT5RxeVWgqndJ.html

13-11-2020||India||Amid blame game, Congress MLAs in Bihar authorise high command to nominate CLP leader||Amid an ongoing blame game for the party’s humiliating performance in the Bihar assembly election, newly elected Congress legislators on Friday passed a resolution authorising the party high command to select the legislature party leader. The MLAs met for the first time in the Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) headquarter—Sadaquat Ashram—in presence of chairman of the screening committee for selection of candidates for Bihar elections Avinash Pande and Chattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel. “It is a formality to hold the meeting of newly elected leaders and seek their views about the election of their leader in the assembly in presence of the central leaders. As AICC in-charge for Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil is sick, Pande has been authorised to hold the meeting. Baghel has been appointed as the AICC observer,” said a senior functionary of the BPCC. BPCC spokesman Harkhu Jha said that all the leaders unanimously passed a resolution, authorising the high command to elect the legislature party leader in the assembly. “Later, Pandey and Baghel held one-to-one discussion with the newly elected leaders and sought to know their idea to bolster the party’s image in the assembly as well as in the state,” Jha said.The central leaders’ visit to Patna acquires considerable significance, as internal dissension over the party’s abysmal electoral performance, which saw only 19 out of 70 candidates winning, has spilled over into the Grand Alliance. Leaders of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), which emerged as the single largest party but stopped sort of returning to power for want of majority, also blamed the Congress for the Grand Alliance’s debacle. Former chief minister and Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi’s appeal to the Congress support the incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar also led to the speculations of a crack among the newly elected legislators. HAM-S fought the elections under the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) banner and won four seats. The Congress spokesman dismissed any apprehension of a crack in the legislature party.”Manjhi has lost his credibility and trust as he has switched his loyalty many times after deserting the Congress,” he said. Internal squabbling in the Congress also came to the fore on Friday as supporters of senior leader Vijay Shankar Dubey and Siddharth (both MLAs) resorted to pushing and shoving over their choice of a legislature party leader. The situation was, however, brought under control with the intervention of senior leaders. As many as 17 out of 19 newly elected leaders were present in the meeting. Maharajganj MLA Vijay Shankar Dubey, Rajesh Ram and Shakeel Khan are said to be in the race for the post of the CLP leader. Meanwhile, the clamour for fixing accountability for crushing defeat of the party got louder with a section of party leaders gunning for BPCC chief Madan Mohan Jha and BPCC campaign committee chairman Akhilesh Prasad Singh. Singh, however, blamed the Central leaders, alleging that they had hijacked the campaign and refrained from involving the local leaders in the electioneering. The other sections, however, accused Singh of indulging in managing tickets to the leaders, who were unfamiliar with the party cadres of the area they contested, with leaders of the AICC involved in the process. “Leaders like Prem Chandra Mishra, who is one of the prominent faces of the party, was not allowed to campaign anywhere during the election. AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar and former Union Minister Subodh Kant Sahai were roped in the electioneering on a few seats, while Akhilesh Prasad Singh along with AICC secretaries Ajay Kapoor and Virendra Rathore conducted a whirlwind tour across the state,” said a leader, wishing anonymity. AICC member Kishore Kumar Jha alleged that Madan Mohan Jha turned helpless as Singh along with AICC leaders prevailed over him in all crucial decisions, from selection of seats and candidates to the campaigning. “They chose candidates who had little connection with ground reality. Tickets were distributed on the basis of favouritism and other considerations, while bona fide candidates were completely marginalised. There was no logic behind contesting the seats that are considered pocket boroughs of the NDA, especially when the party failed to rebuild the organisation at the grassroots level over the last four years,” said the AICC member.He also said that relying on the team which had utterly failed in the last Lok Sabha election was another fault that brought embarrassment to the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-blame-game-congress-mlas-in-bihar-authorise-high-command-to-nominate-clp-leader/story-J2gizW8kAvrRjzsJvtFcBJ.html
13-11-2020||India||Yogi credits PM Modi for Ram Mandir, reveals vision for transformed Ayodhya||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday gave credit for the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said the PM was the one implementing the ideology of Ram Rajya. “It is due to PM Modi’s planning and strategy that Ram temple is being constructed in Ayodhya after a long wait of five decades,” said Yogi while addressing a gathering at Ram Katha Park in Ayodhya. Yogi said it was Modi’s dream to develop Ayodhya as the “Vedic Ramayana City” and it should be the most beautiful city.“Our generation is not only fortunate to see the start of the construction of Ram temple here but we also attended the historic event. In the struggle of 500 years, many saints passed away with a dream to see the start of construction. I thank PM Modi, who is the one who implemented the ideology of Ram Rajya,” he said.Yogi, UP governor Anandiben Patel and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya were in Ayodhya along with several UP ministers for the fourth Deepotsav celebrations. This is the first Deepotsav celebration in Ayodhya after the bhumi pujan of Ram temple on August 5 in which Modi was the chief guest. But participation of locals was restricted in all the events due to Covid-19 and entry of outsiders into Ayodhya was banned. “We all wanted to see Ram temple. This task has been accomplished by PM Modi,” said Yogi. “Whenever I used to come to Ayodhya and talk about development, saints used to ask me about Ram temple,” the chief minister said. “PM Modi came to Ayodhya even in Covid-19 by following all protocols for bhumi pujan of Ram temple,” said the CM. Yogi said Ayodhya’s branding is now through the Deepotsav event. Yogi and Patel later launched a website -- https://virtualdeepotsav.com -- for people to take part in the Deepotsav virtually. The CM also launched a cover on Deepotsav prepared by Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University, Faizabad. Without naming anyone, the CM attacked the previous state government.

But previous governments used to ban them,” he said. “This Deepotsav, a record of lighting 5.51 lakh diyas will be created. Next year this figure will be 7.51 lakh,” he asserted. The CM pointed out that due to Covid-19 pandemic, celebrations in this Deepotsav have been curtailed. “Otherwise, celebrations would have been organized on a grand scale,” he said.Yogi said soon an international airport in Ayodhya will connect the temple town directly with Korea (South Korea) and other countries.

13-11-2020||India||‘Measly compared to other major economies’: CPI(M) slams new stimulus package||The CPI(M) on Friday said the latest stimulus package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman did not amount to any significant hike in the government’s expenditure and was merely a gimmick for “headline management”.The finance minister had on Thursday announced tax relief on select home sale deals, enhanced credit guarantee programme for small businesses and provided incentives for new job creation as the Centre widened stimulus measures to boost the economy.The measures, which also include additional fertiliser subsidy and already announced production-linked incentive scheme for manufacturing units, totalled Rs 2.65 lakh crore, taking the cumulative stimulus package announced since the lockdown to almost Rs 30 lakh crore or 15% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).“Yet another ‘stimulus’ package has been announced by the central government without any significant hikes in government expenditures or direct cash transfers to the people.“The central government boasts of a total of 15% GDP constituting the stimulus, combined with the earlier three announcements. The reality is that the sum total of direct extra governmental expenditures is, by liberal estimates, Rs 3,72,295 crore or a mere 1.9% of the GDP,” the CPI(M) said in a party statement.“This is a measly stimulus compared to other major economies in the world which have provided 10% to 15% of their GDP,” it said.CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in a tweet that the latest announcement was a gimmick.“Yet another gimmick...This latest announcement is designed more for ‘Headlines management’ in the face of RBI’s severe indictment that Indian economy is in deep recession,” he said.The Left party also claimed that the announcements of increases in governmental expenditures were in fact allocations.“They can be offset by reductions under other heads of the budget, thereby reducing even this liberal estimate of 1.9% of GDP. The Finance Minister must tell the country what is the amount being spent by the government over and above the budgetary estimates of expenditures, only then the real picture will emerge.“Coming a day after the RBI’s severe indictment that the Indian economy is in deep recession for the first time in history, this announcement fails to constitute a blueprint for economic revival,” the statement said.Yechury said the recently announced package along with the previous three, is for credit facilitation “hoping that this will increase investments, generate jobs and revive the economy.” “But this can never happen as what is produced by such investments needs to be sold and the Indian market is shrinking as people have less and less purchasing power,” it said.The CPI(M) also said that the economy can only be revived through a massive hike in public investments to build much-needed infrastructure, generate jobs and boost domestic demand.“The government’s stimulus packages meet the needs of foreign and domestic capital to maximise profits but cannot revive the economy. People’s miseries will continue to mount further with escalating unemployment, hunger and price rise leading to growing poverty and deprivation.“The Polit Bureau of the CPI(M) reiterates that direct cash transfers and distribution of free food is immediately required both on humanitarian grounds and to give purchasing power to the people. This is the only way demand in the economy can rise leading to the beginning of any economic revival,” the party added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/measly-compared-to-other-major-economies-cpi-m-slams-new-stimulus-package/story-MBndYIujA7VPGv8S4dlWHM.html

13-11-2020||India||AIIMS-Patna to begin trial of another Covid vaccine from Nov 16||The first phase of the human clinical trials of another vaccine against Covid-19 of Biological E, a biopharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, will begin at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna, from November 16, the principal investigator of the trial at the facility said Friday.Healthy individuals between 18 and 55 years of age can enroll for the trial voluntarily by calling up the registration section of the community and family medicine department (9471408832), said Dr CM Singh, professor and head of community and family medicine and also the principal investigator of the trial at AIIMS-Patna. The first dose of the vaccine will be administered after running some routine tests on a volunteer. The second dose will be administered 28 days later, he added. “The follow-up sampling to check the level of immunogenicity (amount of antibody titer produced in a healthy body to fight against the SARS CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19) has to be done on day 14, 28, 42, 104 and 194,” said Dr Singh. The institute will reimburse the cost on travel incurred by a volunteer during the trial period. It is the fifth vaccine candidate to move into human trials. Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, co-developed by AstraZeneca plc and University of Oxford is the furthest in phase 3, while Bharat Biotech International Ltd will take its Covaxin into the last stage next month. Zydus Cadila is currently in phase 2, while Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd will soon initiate its phase 2 and 3 trials, for which it received approval last month. The Subject Expert Committee that advises the Drug Controller General of India on applications seeking permission for new drugs, clinical trials, vaccine for Covid-19, gave its approval to initiate phase 1 and 2 human trials for the Biological E vaccine in India on October 26. At least three other institutes, including AIIMS-Delhi and Safdarjung hospital, have been shortlisted for this trial. The AIIMS-Patna has been given a sample size of 12-18 individuals in the first phase of trial. The AIIMS-Patna has completed two phases of human trials of an earlier Covaxin (BBV152 Covid vaccine), the country’s first indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine of the Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL), Hyderabad. It is awaiting approval to initiate phase 3 trial, likely to begin in December, said officials. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an independent panel of experts constituted by the Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL), had tried the vaccine on 375 people across the country in the first phase. It had set a sample size of 750 healthy volunteers for the second phase trial, said officials. AIIMS-Patna had administered the vaccine to 44 volunteers in the first phase and 46 in the second, all of whom were responding well, said officials. The first phase trial is to check the safety of the vaccine. The second phase tests its safety as well as the level of immunogenicity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-patna-to-begin-trial-of-another-covid-vaccine-from-nov-16/story-RgLkuKIHmUegDfXJGoSW3O.html

In the struggle of 500 years, many saints passed away with a dream to see the start of construction. I thank PM Modi who is the one who implemented the ideology of Ram Rajya,” Adityanath said while addressing the fourth ‘Deepotsav’, an event to mark Diwali here.

13-11-2020||India||Telangana allows sale and use of green crackers for hours on Diwali||People of Hyderabad and other districts of Telangana can burst “green crackers” for two hours on Diwali, following interim orders by the Supreme Court on Friday modifying the state high court’s orders of Thursday for a complete ban on sale and use of firecrackers. A vacation bench of Supreme Court comprising Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice Sanjiv Khanna issued notice on the petition and stated that the NGT’s guidelines applied to Telangana and that it shall comply with the directions in letter and spirit. Earlier in the day, the Telangana government issued an order enforcing complete ban on sale and use of firecrackers as per the Thursday’s orders from the state high court. “In the wake of the Supreme Court direction, fresh orders would be issued, allowing sale and use of non-polluting crackers only for two hours from 8 pm to 10 pm,” said a senior official of Telangana government who did not wish to be named The high court on Thursday had directed the government to give wide publicity to the ban. Despite being informed that the NGT guidelines were being followed by the State, the Court observed that the use of firecrackers might contribute to the spread of Covid-19. The order was challenged in the Supreme Court by the Telangana Fireworks Dealers Association through a special leave petition. The NGT categorised the cities into four groups - moderate, below moderate, poor and below poor - based on the pollution levels. Bursting crackers is banned in poor and below poor category cities. According to senior advocate Jaya Krishna, who represented the firecracker dealers’ association, Hyderabad falls under the moderate category hence crackers can be burst. “In fact, people of entire Telangana can burst crackers for two hours on Diwali day. It is safe, green and happy Diwali “, Jaya Krishna said. The dealers argued that the government had given them licences some 15 days ago and they had procured huge quantities of the crackers for sale. The last-minute order of the high court banning the sale and purchase of the fireworks would leave them in huge losses. Although shops selling firecrackers remained open on Friday, sales were low because of less number of shoppers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-allows-sale-and-use-of-green-crackers-for-hours-on-diwali/story-NexjcQxQF5Qu6vfoxJsU8H.html

In the next phase, the short-range missile will be tested by the army and the air force before going into production and induction by the military.The sophisticated missile was test-fired at about 3.40 pm from a mobile launcher at the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur near here. It successfully destroyed the target, people familiar with the matter said.The missile, which can strike an aerial target cruising at a height of 15 km, is launched from a mobile two-vehicle system; one carries the missile and the second, the radar that helps acquire the targets. Because it is mobile, it can stay on the move and evade counter-attacks by the enemy.The radar can simultaneously track 100 targets and engage 6 targets.The first trial of the QRSAM was conducted on 4 June 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wraps-up-1st-round-of-tests-for-missile-that-can-shoot-plane-30-km-away/story-oVEWGcCJNcOLZLj3yh3HNP.html

The tenure of the current Bihar legislative assembly is scheduled to end on Novermber 29. On Sunday, the NDA allies will meet and after a consensus on the chief minister post, it will stake claim to form the government. On Friday, in an informal meeting the four NDA constituents in Bihar — JD(U), BJP, HM and Vikassheel Insaan Party — decided that a joint meeting of the NDA legislature party will be held on Sunday where Nitish Kumar will be elected as the leader. These are formalities that are required to be completed before the formation of the new government. Despite winning 74 seats, 31 more than the JD(U), the BJP top leadership will keep Nitish Kumar at the helm. He was declared the alliance’s chief ministerial face before the election.Speculation is rife that the BJP might push for an EBC or a Dalit as a Deputy CM. It is, however, not clear whether Sushil Kumar Modi will be replaced or there will be another deputy CM.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-govt-formation-nitish-kumar-tenders-resignation-to-govornor-ahead-of-nda-meet-on-sunday/story-gGmWQy7X3I2e1fBvqIhS1I.html
13-11-2020||India||MP govt’s Deendayal committees ploy to build BJP network for 2023 polls: Cong||The Congress has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Madhya Pradesh of trying to misuse the administrative machinery to build a network of the party cadre across the state in the name of Deendayal committees to use the same in 2023 assembly elections.Congress spokesperson in Madhya Pradesh, Bhupendra Gupta said, “The announcement is nothing but a ploy of the BJP government to build a network of the BJP and Sangh workers at the cost of public exchequer to use the same network in the next assembly election. This is also an attempt to assuage the feelings of BJP workers who believe the BJP government gave ministerial berths to 14 ex-Congress MLAs who joined the BJP in March this year in an act of betrayal to the people and then gave them tickets to contest the bypolls by dumping the committed party workers.” The Congress’ reaction came after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced the formation of such committees while releasing the Atmanirbhar Madhya Pradesh Roadmap-2023 during a programme in Bhopal on Thursday.“A new structure will be created for public participation in development and monitoring system. Deendayal committees will be constituted at village, Janpad and district levels to ensure public participation and monitoring,” Chouhan had said.Earlier, in a party meeting in Bhopal in April this year Chouhan had talked of the government’s plan to constitute the committees. Though the state government is yet to spell out in details on functioning of the committees named after Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, founder of the Jana Sangh, the forerunner to the BJP, similar committees had been formed three years back too. The committees were then called Antyoday samiti named after the antyoday (welfare of underprivileged people) ideology of Deendayal Upadhyay, BJP leaders said. The state government had then issued instructions to all the collectors and commissioners of municipal bodies regarding formation of the committees at village, block, district, nagar nigam, nagar palika, nagar panchayat and state level. More than 1.25 lakh BJP workers were supposed to be accommodated in the committees. These committees were supposed to give feedback to the government on the status of implementation of development projects and quality of the work. BJP leaders claimed that the committees were dissolved after the Congress formed the government in December 2018.While Congress has criticized the CM’s announcement on the committees, a section of the BJP leaders and workers too were not enthused over the announcement. Former member of state level Antyoday committee ex-MLA Shivprasad Rathore said, “The committees didn’t have any authority. At best they could have reviewed the government schemes. The district level committees were supposed to apprise the collectors of their feedback and it’s up to the collectors how to look into the suggestions or complaints.”A BJP leader who did not want to be named said, “What is use of such committees without any authority? These committees will meet the same fate as that of Antyoday committees which were nothing but ornamental for party workers. Question is if a government authority would like any interference in his work and who will listen to the committees’ voice when corruption in the system is order of the day.” Another leader was associated with an Antyoday samiti said, “MPs and MLAs of our party hardly welcomed Antyoday samitis, not to say of government officials. They don’t want emergence of any new power centre within the party in their constituencies.” But BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal insisted that the decision will ensure quality of the development works at the grassroots level.” “The CM’s announcement is a welcome step. The committees will work as a bridge between the state government and people and will ensure quality of the development works being implemented at the grassroots level,” Agrawal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-govt-s-deendayal-committees-ploy-to-build-bjp-network-for-2023-polls-cong/story-LTQhEhQcliC4GnZrg2rMEI.html

This is a serious matter,” said Raut, hitting out at the Sena’s former ally.A land deal between the two families was done legally in 2014, the Rajya Sabha MP claimed.“Is he (Somaiya) having a problem that a Marathi person did the deal,” he said, adding no matter what the Sena-led MVA government will last its full term (till 2024).“We will ensure that the BJP sits out of power for 25 years in Maharashtra. Our stand is to give justice to the family of Anvay Naik and punish those legally who forced him to take the extreme step of ending his life,” Raut said.“Shethji’s party wants to protect the accused,” the Sena leader said in an apparent reference to TV journalist Arnab Goswami, who along with two others, has been charged with abetting the suicide of Anvay Naik and his mother over non-payment of dues by their companies.“What 21 deals is he (Somaiya) talking about? Show me even five. There was one transaction which was absolutely legal,” Raut aid.Asked about the demand for a probe by the Enforcement Directorate into the alleged land deals, Raut shot back, “Why only ED...let there be a probe by the CBI. Go to Interpol, FBI, KGB, Interpol and the United Nations.Somaiya has alleged there were multiple land deals between Uddhav Thackeray’s wife Rashmi and Anvay Naik who allegedly committed suicide on May 5, 2018.“How are you linked to the accused. Don’t you have any concern for the mother-son duo who ended their lives?” Raut asked, targeting the former BJP Member of Parliament.Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV, was arrested by the Alibaug police in adjoining Raigad district on November 4 and released from jail on November 11 after the Supreme Court granted him interim bail in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-ensure-bjp-remains-in-opposition-for-25-years-says-sanjay-raut/story-XhYB7VSSsDR2lrZsNrMteP.html

13-11-2020||India||Bihar assembly polls: EC asks for CCTV footage, report from Gopalganj DM||The Election Commission has directed Gopalganj district magistrate Arshad Aziz to make available the CCTV footage of the Bhore assembly constituency counting centre that corresponded to the counting day.The direction came following CPI-ML’s serious allegations that Gopalganj MP Alok Kumar Suman had entered the counting centres on the day of counting. The CPI-ML also made a written complaint on November 10 to the office of the chief electoral office (CEO), Bihar.“JD-U MP Alok Kumar Suman entered the counting hall in violation of clause 16.9 of the candidates’ handbook which specifies who is allowed to enter the hall. This violation is also ground for a recount of total votes in the constituency,” said the CPI-ML representation. Though Suman refuted the allegations, the EC took cognizance of the complaint and asked for clippings of the CCTV footage of the counting day along with a detailed report from the DM by Thursday.“Kindly make available a detailed report along with a video clipping, as directed,” said the letter from additional CEO Balamurugan to the DM. Aziz said that he had not submitted the report so far. “But we will do it soon. Whatever decision the EC takes will be followed,” he added.In a closely fought assembly election between the NDA and the GA, which gave the former a razor thin majority, allegations have been flying high since the counting day, with the RJD, Congress as well as the CPI-ML alleging foul play in counting on seats where the margin of victory has been very small. “The mandate favored Mahagathbandhan, but the Election Commission’s result was in NDA’s favour. This hasn’t happened for the first time. In 2015, when Mahagathbandhan was formed, votes were in our favour but BJP made a back-door entry to gain power,” Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said, adding that the established rules of counting postal ballots first before Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) can be counted was also not followed and not all postal ballots could be counted. In the election for the Bhore seat, JD (U) candidate Sunil Kumar won, defeating CPI (ML) candidate Jitendra Paswan. The victory margin was a mere 462 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-assembly-polls-ec-asks-for-cctv-footage-report-from-gopalganj-dm/story-ItqB3qHun2OkrCfjHP2nwL.html
13-11-2020||India||‘Matter of pride’: PM Modi on WHO’s move to set up centre for traditional medicine in India||The World Health Organisation announced on Friday that it will set up a Global Centre for Traditional Medicine in India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing confidence that just like the country has emerged as the ‘pharmacy of the world’, the WHO institution will become the centre for global wellness.WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the announcement in a video message at an event in which Prime Minister Modi dedicated two future-ready Ayurveda institutions in Jaipur and Jamnagar to the nation via video conferencing on the occasion of the 5th Ayurveda Day.The Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (ITRA), Jamnagar (Gujarat) and the National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA), Jaipur (Rajasthan) are both premier institutions of Ayurveda in the country.The Jamnagar institute has been conferred the status of an Institution of National Importance (INI) by an act of Parliament and the one at Jaipur has been designated an Institution Deemed to be University (De novo Category) by the University Grants Commission (UGC), according to the AYUSH ministry.In his video message, Ghebreyesus said, “I am pleased to announce that we have agreed to open a WHO Global Centre of Traditional Medicine in India to strengthen the evidence, research, training and awareness of traditional and complementary medicine.” “This new centre will support WHO’s efforts to implement the WHO traditional medicine strategy 2014-2023 which aims to support countries in developing policies and action plans to strengthen the role of traditional medicine as part of their journey to universal health coverage and a healthier, fairer and safer world,” he said.Traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda can play an important role in integrated people-centric health services and healthcare, but they have not received enough attention, the WHO DG said.Ghebreyesus also lauded Prime Minister Modi for his commitment to the universal coverage under Ayushman Bharat and evidence-based promotion of traditional medicines to achieve health related objectives.Modi said Ayurveda is India’s heritage whose expansion entails the welfare of humanity and all Indians will be happy to see that the country’s traditional knowledge is enriching other countries.“It is a matter of pride for all Indians that the WHO has chosen India for establishing its Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. Now work will be done in this direction from India,” Modi said.“I would like to thank the WHO and particularly its Director General Tedros for giving this responsibility to India. I am confident that just like India has emerged as the pharmacy of the world, in the same manner this centre for traditional medicine will become the centre for global wellness,” he said.Stressing on bringing ayurveda knowledge out of books, scriptures and home remedies and developing this ancient knowledge as per modern needs, Modi said new research is being done in the country by combining information received from modern science of the 21st century with India’s ancient medical knowledge.Noting that three years ago, the All India Ayurvedic Institute was established here, he said Ayurveda is not just an alternative today but one of the key basis of the country’s health policy.Modi informed that work is on to develop the National Sowa-Rigpa Institute for research and other studies related to Sowa-Rigpa in Leh. The two institutions in Gujarat and Rajasthan which have been upgraded are also an extension of this development, he added.Congratulating the two institutes for their upgradation, the prime minister pointed out that they have more responsibility now and hoped that they will prepare syllabus for Ayurveda which meets international standards.He also called upon the Education Ministry and UGC to find new avenues in disciplines like Ayurveda Physics and Ayurveda Chemistry.Modi also urged startups and the private sector to study global trends and demands and ensure their participation in the sector.Pointing out that during the coronavirus period the demand for Ayurvedic products increased rapidly all over the world, he said exports of Ayurvedic products increased by about 45 per cent in September this year compared to the previous year.He said the significant increase in export of spices like turmeric, ginger, considered as immunity boosters, shows the sudden boost in confidence in Ayurvedic solutions and Indian spices in the world.In many countries, drinks related to turmeric are also increasing and the world’s prestigious medical journals are also seeing new hope in Ayurveda, he noted.Modi said that during the coronavirus period, the focus was not only limited to the use of Ayurveda alone but also on research related to AYUSH in the country and the world.“On one hand, India is testing vaccines, on the other, it is also increasing international cooperation on Ayurvedic research to fight COVID,” he said.Modi pointed out that research is going on in more than a hundred places including at the All India Institute of Ayurveda in Delhi which has conducted research related to immunity on 80,000 Delhi Police personnel.It may be the world’s largest group study and there are encouraging results, he said.A few more international trials are to be started, he added.He also highlighted that prices of Ayurvedic herbs like Ashwagandha, Giloy, Tulsi have increased amid the pandemic.The price of Ashwagandha has more than doubled compared to last year and its direct benefit is reaching farmers, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/matter-of-pride-pm-modi-on-who-s-move-to-set-up-centre-for-traditional-medicine-in-india/story-d0c1y10GJ8Ta58iu84fAwO.html

We need to impress on our developed country partners to do more and show the necessary urgency,” he said.He further said, “Covid pandemic cannot be used as an excuse to not fulfill their commitments or to undermine environmental conventions. We call on them to undertake activities to strengthen “Convention-Plus” actions and not do “Convention-Minus”.The International Solar Alliance spearheaded by Prime Minister Modi where India has pledged USD 1.7 billion for solar energy projects, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, are all “Convention-Plus” activities.“Covid-19 threatens to set back decades of progress by developing countries and push millions into poverty. We need to raise our voice for recovery, resilience and reform to ensure that we go back to path of development,” he said.Urging the need for affordable health systems and resilient supply chains, Tirumurti said that India is assisting in urgent health and medical supplies to over 150 countries.“We have pledged USD 15 million for GAVI and operationalized the Covid-19 Emergency Fund for our neighbours with an initial contribution of USD 10 million. Prime Minister Modi has pledged that India, as the largest vaccine producing country, will make its production and delivery capacity available to the entire humanity,” he said.He further said that India’s involvement in the digital revolution will be a “model for the developing world in the global response to covid”.Speaking on the South-South cooperation, he said, “We have never let geography limit our approach to assist the developing world.

The other co-authors of the study include Sovesh Mohapatra, Prathul Nath, Manisha Chatterjee, Neeladrisingha Das, Deepjyoti Kalita and Partha Roy.According to IIT Roorkee statement, the complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often inhibit the process of developing various new drug combinations for the disease.“Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for the treatment,” says Prof. Satapathi, Principal Investigator and an Associate Professor of Physics in IIT RoorkeeMany of the predicted drugs are already in use for the treatment of Covid-19, and some are in trials, IIT Roorkee said. “Given the need of the present time, the present approach will save a lot of resources and time for synthesizing novel drugs and thus will be useful for a vast majority of the medical research community,” Prof. Satapathi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-roorkee-scientists-predict-fda-approved-commercial-drugs-through-ai-to-tackle-covid-19/story-6UXk9hKS6wgRnO8iIzo0cI.html

All you need to know||In the past few years, air quality and pollution, aggravated by stubble burning, during November- December has become a cause of concern in the National Capital Region (NCR). The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered a ban on the sale and use of crackers in the region until November 30.Many state governments this year including Rajasthan and Odisha have banned bursting firecrackers, keeping in mind environmental impact as well as Covid-19 pandemic, while those like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have allowed green firecrackers.Developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), green crackers emit pollutants at a 30% lesser rate than their conventional counterparts.Here’s all you need to know about green crackers:1. Green crackers are made using less polluting raw materials. Their chemical formulation ensures reduced particle emission into the atmosphere by suppressing the dust produced.2. While regular crackers emit about 160 decibels of sound, green crackers’ emission rate is limited to 110-125 decibels3. Manufacturers need to sign a deal with the CSIR in order to make fireworks using the green cracker formulation. 4. There are three types of green crackers available in India - SWAS, STAR and SAFAL.5. Green crackers too, in many cases, use polluting chemicals like aluminium, barium, potassium nitrate and carbon, But the quantity is reduced which in turn lowers the emission by about 30 per cent. In some green crackers, these chemicals are not at all used.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-are-green-firecrackers-all-you-need-to-know/story-dk4fuHpeZPp8nAOZWR6VOI.html

The interim bail to Goswami and two others in a 2018 abetment to suicide case of architect Anvay Naik was granted on Wednesday by a bench headed by justice DY Chandrachud.

The AG held that these tweets were contemptuous as he said, “Under the Constitution, the freedom of speech is subject to the law of contempt and I believe that it is time that people understand that attacking the Supreme Court of India unjustifiably and brazenly will attract punishment under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1972.”The petition filed under the Contempt of Courts Act and Article 129 by advocate Nishant Katneshwarkar stated, “Petitioners have filed the present criminal contempt petition against the alleged contemnor for scandaliaing this court and further lowering the authority of this court by publishing tweets on twitter.com.”Kamra subsequently issued a tweet refusing to apologise or delete his tweets. He has close to 1.7 million followers, many of whom had even retweeted these objectionable tweets, the petition stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contempt-petition-filed-against-comedian-kunal-kamra-in-supreme-court/story-OLV0NMFzVnhkdoM543b0HJ.html

The incident happened at Parasuramapuram village of Komarada block at around 7.30 am, when the victim, Raghumandala Lakshmi Naidu, went to his fields to inspect the crop. “A group of five elephants had been moving in the area for the last few days, destroying banana plantations and other horticulture crops. One of them, supposed to be a female pregnant elephant, went berserk and rushed towards Naidu, lifted him with her trunk and banged him on the soil, before trampling him,” Komarada sub-inspector of police V Gnana Prasad told Hindustan Times. Naidu was killed on the spot, while a few other farmers ran for safety. The police with the help of local forest officials drove the herd of elephants away into the adjacent forest areas. “We have shifted the body to the local hospital for post mortem. A case was booked under Section 174 of Criminal Procedure Code for unnatural death,” the police official said. This is the second incident of a farmer being killed by elephants in the same area in the last two weeks. On October 29, a 25-year-old farmer Yerra Narayana was also trampled to death in a similar manner near Gumpa under Komarada block. According to V Ramesh, district information officer, attacks by pachyderms have been happening in villages of Srikakulam and Vizianagaram district bordering Odisha very frequently. “A group of elephants from Odisha crossed over the Nagavali River and entered these areas last year and since then, they have been creating havoc in the bordering villages by destroying standing crops and razing huts,” he said. In 2019, there have been at least four instances of elephants attacking people and killing them in Vizanagaram district. “It was only on Thursday that top forest department officials had a meeting to discuss strategies to curb the elephant menace. Within hours, this latest killing took place,” Ramesh said. There is a proposal to fence the forest area where these elephants are moving, so as to prevent them from entering human habitations, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmer-trampled-to-death-by-a-wild-tusker-in-andhra-s-vizianagaram-district/story-es6S45y78znfAgxzRP6GkO.html

I believe they speak for themselves,” Kamra said in the post titled “No lawyers, No apology, No fine, No waste of space”.He also suggested that the court’s time could be better utilised hearing cases relating to “demonetisation, the petition challenging the revocation of J&K’s special status, the matter of the legality of electoral bonds or countless other matters that are more deserving of time and attention”. No lawyers, No apology, No fine, No waste of space 🙏🙏🙏 pic.twitter.com/B1U7dkVB1WTo be sure, the Supreme Court hasn’t yet taken up the requests to initiate contempt of court proceedings against Kunal Kamra.Rule 3(c) of the Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court, 1975 requires a petition that seeks initiation of contempt proceedings to first get the consent of the attorney general. In his communication granting his consent, KK Venugopal said it was time that people understand that attacking the apex court brazenly will attract punishment. “People believe that they can ‘boldly and brazenly condemn’ the Supreme Court of India and its judges by exercising their freedom of speech, but under the Constitution, the freedom of speech is subject to the law of contempt,” Venugopal had said on Thursday as he gave his consent.“This is a gross insinuation against the entirety of the Supreme Court of India that the Supreme Court is not an independent and impartial institution and so too its judges, but on the other hand is a Court of the ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, existing for the BJP’s benefit,” the A-G had observed on Kamra’s tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/won-t-apologise-kunal-kamra-tweets-to-supreme-court-judges-on-contempt-complaint/story-v7L9syj4aLwdY4uMaXSccM.html
13-11-2020||India||Will Owaisi’s AIMIM be an X factor in Bengal? Trinamool says it won’t be easy||Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM)’s announcement that it will contest the 2021 West Bengal polls has put a spotlight on the crucial Muslim vote in the state. Owaisi’s critics say AIMIM will end up splitting the voters and thus help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which seeks to replace Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress (TMC) in power.Owaisi’s announcement about contesting West Bengal polls on Tuesday came on the day his party registered its best electoral performance outside its stronghold of Hyderabad by winning five seats in Bihar. Owaisi has alleged that the Muslims faced neglect in the poll-bound state.Also read | The rise of Asaduddin OwaisiMuslims accounted for West Bengal’s 27.01% population as per the 2011 census and the community plays a decisive role in 120 out of 294 assembly seats in the state, according to surveys by the BJP and election strategist Prashant Kishor’s I-Pac. Banerjee roped in Kishore for the 2021 poll preparations after the BJP made major inroads into the state by winning 18 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019.Muslims are concentrated in Murshidabad (66.28%), Malda (51.27%), North Dinajpur (49.92%), South 24 Parganas (35.57%), and Birbhum (37.06%) districts in West Bengal. In Darjeeling, Purulia, and Bankura, where the BJP won Lok Sabha seats last year, Muslims account for less than 10% of the population.A central AIMIM functionary said they were conducting a survey and will accordingly take a final decision on the number of seats they will contest in Bengal. “We are collecting data for a ground-level research,” said the functionary who also campaigned in Bihar and did not wish to be named.TMC leader Saugata Roy said the AIMIM is known as a party that splits Muslim votes to ultimately help the BJP. “Owaisi is a good Parliamentarian who raises Islamic issues but he will not be able to do anything in Bengal.” He called AIMIM a Hyderabad-based party of Urdu-speaking Muslims. “Muslims in Bengal do not speak Urdu. It took Owaisi three attempts to win five seats in Bihar. Do not expect him to win seats in Bengal.”The AIMIM functionary reacted to Roy’s comments, asking if Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Congress leader Rahul Gandhi speaks Bengali. “And yet the BJP and the Congress have won seats in Bengal. Our leaders on the ground will campaign and contest the polls in Bengal. They speak Bengali.”BJP’s state minority front president, Ali Hossain, dismissed suggestions that his party needs AIMIM to make a dent in the TMC’s Muslim vote bank. “It is a wrong perception that the TMC gets all the Muslim votes while the BJP is supported only by Hindus. The 2019 Lok Sabha poll results clearly established this.”He said in Malda South constituency, where 64% of people are Muslims, their Hindu candidate Sreerupa Mitra Chaudhury got 40% votes and lost to the Congress by a margin of only 8,000 votes. “Similarly, in the Jangipur constituency, where Muslims account for 82% of the population, the BJP’s first Muslim woman candidate Mafuza Khatun got 3,17,000 votes but lost to the TMC. Neither of these could have been possible had Muslims not voted for the BJP. Where was AIMIM in 2019?” asked Hossain.Hossain said the BJP will get 5-10 % Muslim votes in 2021 even if the AIMIM contests. “Our slogan is that a BJP government is required in the interest of Muslims. Yesterday, 350 Muslim families joined our party at Ghatal in West Midnapore. Today, we will organise the BJP’s biggest Muslim rally in Howrah,” said Hossain.Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Md Salim said Owaisi cannot be a factor in Bengal politics unless he is promoted by the media and the BJP. “Hundreds of movements are taking place in Bengal but the focus is on Owaisi. This is how Gorkha leader Subash Ghising rose in the Darjeeling hills in the 1980s and the movement for a separate state started,” said Salim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-owaisi-s-aimim-be-an-x-factor-in-bengal-trinamool-says-it-won-t-be-easy/story-McGUtf3vrbimQWHWbZ9oLK.html

13-11-2020||India||TMC’s sway over minorities likely to unsettle with Owaisi party entry into Bengal||With Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM announcing that it would contest Bengal polls, having bagged five seats in neighbouring Bihar, political arithmetic, in all likelihood, is set to witness a major change as TMC’s sway over minority votes seems to be up for a stiff challenge.The Mamata Banerjee-led party, which had been the sole beneficiary of minority votes since the defeat of the Left Front in 2011, however, tried to put up a brave face, arguing that Owaisi’s influence on Muslims is limited to Hindi- and Urdu-speaking communities that make for just six per cent of Muslim electorate in the state.Muslims comprise 30 per cent of West Bengal’s voters. The state has the highest number of Muslim electorate in the country after Kashmir.A deciding factor in nearly 100-110 seats in the 294- member Assembly, minorities especially the Muslims, till 2019, have acted as a bulwark of the TMC against its rivals, with most of them voting in favour of the party, considering it to be a “credible” force that can resist saffron surge.With the entry of the AIMIM, equations are likely to change, prominent Muslim leaders said.Buoyed by the results of Bihar polls, Owaisi had announced that the AIMIM would contest elections in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and other states.Talking about the Telangana-based party’s detailed plan for Mission West Bengal, its national spokesperson Asim Waqar told PTI on Wednesday that the outfit has already set up units in 22 out of the 23 districts of the state.“We will fight assembly polls in Bengal. We are preparing our strategy. We have registered our presence in 22 out of the 23 districts of the state. We think, as a political party, we can make deep inroads into the state,” Waqar said.Also Read | Bihar poll boost: AIMIM plans to contest in UP, West BengalThe AIMIM’s plan to enter Bengal was frowned upon by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at an anti-NRC rally in north Bengal in November last year, when she, without taking a name, launched a frontal assault on the party by asking Muslims to be wary of “minority extremists” from Hyderabad.Owaisi -- who is fast emerging as the leading Muslim voice in the country -- was quick to hit back, stating that West Bengals minorities have one of the worst human development indicators.According to the AIMIM, Owaisi has found Bengal to be a fertile ground for his expansion plans. The party has built a “good support base” in minority-dominated districts of Malda, Murshidabad, South Dinajpur, North Dinajpur, South 24 Parganas.All five districts comprise more than sixty assembly seats. Incidentally, barring South 24 Parganas, the remaining four districts border Bihar, where the party won five seats, eating into the Muslim vote share of the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan.According to AIMIM state leadership, the party first evinced interest in Bengal after the 2019 parliamentary polls.A rally was duly organised in Kolkata, which witnessed a huge attendance of Muslim youths.“We sensed that Muslims are looking for an alternative and decided to build our base in the state. When we visited the districts, we received a favourable response. Now we have a strong base in several places,” a state AIMIM leader said.According to AIMIM sources, the war of words between Banerjee and Owaisi provided the party a much-needed propellant to make a foray into the state’s political scene.That followed by violent agitation over Citizenship Amendment Act gave the party a perfect opportunity to expand its footprint in the state.“Also, the recent migrant labour crisis has helped us, as a large section of Muslims realised who is its true friend,” the AIMIM leader said.Mohammed Kamruzzaman, the general secretary of All Bengal Minority Youth Federation, told PTI that Muslims who had voted for the TMC are not happy with the way the party has fared on many fronts.Several developments such as TMC leaders joining the BJP have propped up “questions about the credibility of the the Mamata Banerjee party in its fight against the BJP”.“The Muslims, for the last ten years, have voted for the TMC, and they have hopes and aspirations from the party.Although some of them have been fulfilled, there are a many grievances, too. A section of Muslims feels that the leaders they have voted for are either joining hands with the BJP or jumping the ship. So they are wary...” Kamruzzaman said.He refuted claims that Owaisi’s influence is limited to just Hindi- and Urdu-speaking voters.“Owaisi is held in high regard among Bengali Muslims too. And his anti-BJP credentials are impeccable. He has never compromised with the BJP,” Kamruzzaman, who during 2019 had appealed to the Muslim community to vote for the TMC, said.The Imams of the city, who also exert a major influence on the Muslim population in the state, however, has maintained a stoic silence over the matter so far.The TMC, which is yet to fully recover from the 2019 Lok Sabha poll setback, when the BJP’s tally soared from two to 18, is apprehensive that the AIMIM may act as “spoiler” in several assembly segments.“In minority-dominated pockets, where we are still the most-preferred party, the AIMIM may not win the seats but will hamper our prospects. Although West Bengal has 24 per cent Bengali-speaking Muslims and six per cent Hindi-speaking Muslims, we need to ensure that entire minority vote share remains intact, as the BJP is making all efforts to polarise the majority population,” a TMC leader said.Also Read | The rise of Asaduddin OwaisiThe TMC further termed the Owaisi-led party as a “communal force deputed by BJP” to act as “vote cutter”.“Just like the BJP, the AIMIM is also a communal force. Both the political parties survive on divisive politics. The AIMIM is planning to fight elections in Bengal to help the BJP in the state,” senior TMC leader and state minister Firhad Hakim said.His cabinet colleague and state Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind president Siddiqullah Chowdhury exuded confidence that Muslims won’t go with the AIMIM in the assembly polls, likely to be held in April-May next year.“The Muslims in Bengal are politically conscious; they won’t support a party which is an outsider in state politics and a B-team of the BJP. The Muslims would vote for the TMC to stop the saffron party from coming to power,” he said.The BJP, for which the division of Muslims votes is vital to winning the elections, however, denied the claim that the AIMIM might prove to be its B-team.“We don’t need a B-team or a C-team to win Bengal elections. We will win the state assembly polls on our strength and merit, bagging more than 200 seats,” BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-s-sway-over-minorities-likely-to-unsettle-with-owaisi-party-entry-into-bengal/story-mASIhU1TvYYOTCqQbpfNiL.html

A team of doctors sent from Bhopal to Panna collected blood samples from some rodents from the affected areas on Thursday, as per health department officials. As per officials, patients suffering from the disease were found in more than 12 districts in the state and prevalence of the disease came to be known in October when some patients from Panna were referred to Jabalpur and the pathology test of blood samples of patients in a virology laboratory over there confirmed presence of the bacterium in their body. Two of the patients died. The districts where patients have been reported from so far include Panna, Jabalpur, Dindori, Satna, Mandala,Narsinghpur, Katni, Neemuch, Damoh, Umariya, Seoni, Shahdol, said chief medical and health officer (CMHO), Panna district Dr LK Tiwari. Dr Tiwari said a team of doctors from Bhopal reached the district on Thursday and collected blood samples from rats and mice from four villages in three blocks where patients of the disease were found. “With pathological examination of the blood samples we will try to find out if the disease was spread by the rodents in the same area or people were affected by the disease outside the local areas. However, it’s possible that the blood samples taken from the rodents might have been taken from those rodents which are not vectors of the bacterium”, said Dr Tiwari. One of the Bhopal team members Dr Gunjan Singh said, “The situation is not scary. Two of four patients in Panna have died. The disease can be cured in 5 days if diagnosed and treated timely. The vectors of the disease are rats, mice, squirrels and rabbits. Symptoms of the disease are high fever, headache, body ache, rash etc.” She said, “We are trying to find out scale of the spread of the disease. Alertness is the key to protecting oneself from the disease. People should immediately consult doctors in case of high fever and take all preventive measures like covering hands and feet while working in agriculture fields, maintaining heigine in homes and outside etc.” Additional director, Health services Dr Veena Sinha said, “We have come to know about the disease reported from certain districts. The situation is not alarming as yet. We are taking all preventive measures including creating awareness among people to check spread of the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-succumb-to-scurb-typhus-in-bundelkhand-as-disease-spreads-in-12-districts/story-CuAnRWFUU46oVyPBYD3CZP.html
13-11-2020||India||To break ice, Union ministers hold key talks with farmers protesting central laws||Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal have begun talks with a delegation of representatives of farmers from Punjab, who are protesting a set of laws passed recently to liberalise the farm sector, at the national capital’s Vigyan Bhawan on Friday. At least 40 leaders of various farmers’ bodies, including constituents of the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella platform spearheading the protests, are participating in the talks, the first meeting that agitating farmers are holding with Cabinet ministers. This is the second attempt by the government to negotiate with the farmers and break an impasse following a cultivators’ agitation in some states, particularly Punjab, against the Centre’s move to open up agricultural markets in the country. Agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal had met a farmers’ delegation on October 14, after inviting them for talks, to convince them to end their protest, but the meeting had ended in a deadlock. Also Read: Protests against farm laws: Haryana farmers to march to Delhi on November 18The ongoing talks appear to be an attempt by the government to be accommodative of a pre-condition set by farm leaders during their meeting with the agriculture secretary on October 14 that any talks must happen in the presence of Union ministers and not just at the bureaucratic level. Farmers in Punjab have launched protests, blockading rail tracks and road transport, since the government enacted three farm-sector laws in September, creating a key political challenge for the Narendra Modi government.The three laws, together, allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce by easing restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers protesting these changes say the reforms could make them vulnerable to exploitation, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers cultivators assured prices from the government, largely for wheat and rice. The Modi government has said the reforms were unrelated to the MSP system, which, it assured, would continue to exist. Farmers, however, aren’t convinced. “The talks are on and they are on complex issues. We will be in a position to comment only when they conclude,” said Avik Saha, the secretary of All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, which is participating in the meeting. Farmer organisations are likely to press for the MSP system to be written into law, which is high on their agenda. On October 30, food and consumers affairs minister Piyush Goyal and agriculture minister Narendra Tomar, interacting with reporters, said that the “Centre’s door was open for talks with the farmers”. They had said the new reforms would allow farmers greater access to markets and spur investment in the sector. The government is likely to issue a statement once the talks conclude, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/union-ministers-hold-crucial-talks-with-farmers-protesting-central-laws/story-cidQ7Kj8OG6CD1WhaKdUVI.html
13-11-2020||India||In Telangana, bleak future ahead of Congress after Dubbak by-poll debacle||A bleak future lies ahead of the Congress in Telangana following the humiliating defeat in the latest by-elections to the Dubbak assembly seat in Siddipet district, which clearly exposed the chinks the party’s armour. The Congress ended up in the poor third position in Dubbak by-polls, despite pulling out all stops to win the seat and regain lost glory. Party candidate Cheruku Srinivas Reddy, whose father represented the constituency twice in the past, got just 22,000-odd votes and failed to retain his deposit. This is despite a massive campaign taken up by several stalwarts including All India Congress Committee in-charge of Telangana Manickam Tagore, PCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy, working presidents J Kusuma Kumar, Ponnam Prabhakar and A Revanth Reddy and a host of other senior leaders. The grand old party, which has credited itself with granting statehood to Telangana state in 2014, has never recovered after it conceded ground to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi. What is worse, majority of the Congress MLAs defected to the ruling party after its debacles in 2014 and 2018 elections. In 2014, the Congress had won 21 out of 119 assembly seats in the state, but nine of them defected to the TRS. In December 2018 elections, the Congress strength came down to 19 seats, but 13 of its MLAs jumped into the TRS en masse, thereby stripping the party of leader of opposition status. And in the last six years, the Congress has only been on the losing side in all the by-elections. In November 2019, too, PCC chief’s wife N Padmavathi lost the by-elections to Huzurnagar assembly seat in Nalgonda to Telangana Rashtra Samithi candidate S Saidi Reddy with a huge margin of 43,000 votes. With the Congress party’s attempts to salvage some prestige by winning Dubbak by-polls backfiring, the party leaders as usual started the blame game, instead of making an introspection of what had gone wrong with the party. “It was a mistake to choose Srinivas Reddy, a last-minute defector from the TRS, as our party candidate in Dubbak. The party ticket should have been given to a candidate from weaker sections,” argued veteran Congress leader and former MP V Hanumantha Rao. “The BJP’s campaign that Reddy, too, would return to the TRS fold after winning the seat, like other Congress MLAs in the past, had also damaged the Congress prospects,” he said. PCC election coordination committee convenor G Niranjan said the TRS had strategically played down the Congress candidate by projecting BJP candidate M Raghunandan Rao as a potential threat by indulging in police searches on him and his associates. “The TRS sought to impress upon the people that the Congress is nowhere in the field and the fight was between the TRS and BJP only,” Niranjan said. The defeat in Dubbak once again triggered the demand for resignation of Uttam Kumar Reddy as the PCC chief. Within a couple of hours of the by-poll result, agitated Congress workers at Madikonda in Warangal district burnt the PCC chief’s effigy and demanded that the party reins be handed over to younger leader like A Revanth Reddy, who defected from TDP to the Congress two years ago. On Thursday, too, when the party leaders held a rally in Khammam in support of farmers, there were demands that Revanth be made the PCC chief. However, Hanumanth Rao demanded that the PCC post should be given to weaker sections who had been loyal to the party for decades and not for defectors from other parties. The debacle at Dubbak is expected to witness exodus of more leaders from the Congress into either the TRS or the BJP, as there are hardly any signs of any improvement in the party’s prospects. Popular actor and former MP M Vijayashanti already hinted at quitting the party and she is expected to fly to New Delhi to formally join the BJP next week. “Unless the party high command stems the rot, it doesn’t take much time for the party to disappear as has happened in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu,” a senior party leader, who did not wish to be quoted, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-telangana-bleak-future-ahead-of-congress-after-dubbak-by-poll-debacle/story-CWMVGmWjhoyH1OOZmcPk2L.html

13-11-2020||India||Serum Institute’s head says India to get 100 Million Astra shots next month||The world’s largest vaccine maker is ramping up production of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 shot, aiming to have 100 million doses ready by December for an inoculation drive that could begin across India that same month.If final-stage trial data show AstraZeneca’s candidate gives effective protection from the virus, the Serum Institute of India Ltd. -- which is partnered to produce at least one billion doses -- may get emergency authorization from New Delhi by December, said Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of the family-owned firm based in the western city of Pune.That initial amount will go to India, Poonawalla said in an interview on Thursday. Full approval early next year will allow distribution on a 50-50 basis with the South Asian nation and Covax, the World Health Organization-backed body that’s purchasing shots for poor nations. Serum, which has tied up with five developers, has so far made 40 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in the past two months and aims to start manufacturing Novavax Inc.’s contender soon.“We were a bit concerned it was a big risk,” said 39-year-old Poonawalla. But both AstraZeneca and Novavax’s shots “are looking pretty good.”Also Read: Click here for everything you need to know about CoronavirusWorld’s Best Hope for Enough Covid-19 Vaccine Comes from IndiaThe haste underlines Poonawalla’s confidence in one of the main vaccine front-runners. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot has said he is preparing for the possibility of large-scale vaccinations as early as December and once the U.K. grants its own emergency license, Serum will submit that same data to Indian counterparts.Drugmakers are just now getting data that will show how well their vaccine candidates work, but there are plenty of hurdles remaining as the global race to find an effective shot against the pathogen reaches its final stages. Astra and co-developer University of Oxford still need to see testing results. And even if their vaccine proves effective and gets a nod from regulators, there are questions over how easily and quickly the shot can be distributed.Poonawalla reiterated that it will take until 2024 to vaccinate the entire world and two years to see a real reduction in infections, due to affordability and manufacturing hurdles.After talks with the government, Poonawalla said he is confident in their plans to get initial vaccines to the vulnerable and frontline workers. The challenge, will be in getting it to India’s 1.3 billion population, especially in the vast countryside where past inoculation drives have struggled due to patchy health networks.He said AstraZeneca has a significant edge over a rival candidate from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, which this week grabbed headlines after indicating it was more than 90% effective in stopping Covid-19 infections. Expensive cold-chain infrastructure is needed to transport and store that vaccine at -70 degrees Celsius. Poonawalla said it was “just impossible” for most of the world to use at scale, compared to those his company will produce that can be stored at fridge temperatures.Deep-Freeze Hurdle Makes Pfizer’s Vaccine One for the Rich“I don’t think even 90% of the countries will be able to take it, because you just don’t have deep freezers everywhere,” he said of the Pfizer shot. “In a pandemic, always remember that simplicity is the key.”For India, which has struggled to contain the world’s second-largest Covid outbreak, negotiations with the Serum Institute on vaccine pricing will be pivotal for the country’s efforts to emerge from the pandemic.India Said to Keep $7 Billion Ready for Vaccine at $2 a ShotNew Delhi has set aside about 500 billion rupees ($6.7 billion) for vaccines, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. However, in September, Poonawalla argued that India would need 800 billion rupees. Poonawalla declined to comment further.Poonawalla is taking a big financial gamble. Operating in the low margin, mass volume world of vaccines, the Serum Institute -- founded in 1966 by Poonawalla’s billionaire father Cyrus -- supplies 170 nations with over a billion shots a year for diseases such as measles and mumps.Close to $300 million of the company’s money has been invested in early production, said Poonawalla. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have also contributing $300 million this year, earmarking 200 million doses for the Covax effort. That leaves about $200 million left to bridge for Serum’s planned expenditure.“I don’t need all of it right now, the capital we’ve deployed already is enough,” Poonawalla said, adding that advance orders recently signed with countries such as Bangladesh should fill the gap. Serum is also in discussions with India for an advanced commitment. “I think in the next one or two months I’ll be fully capitalized.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-s-head-says-india-to-get-100-million-astra-shots-next-month/story-K2y1arK3kktvkcjURPzv8M.html

The cyclone wreaked havoc and left a trail of destruction and damage in West Bengal killing nearly 100 people. Before the onset of Amphan, 658,000 people -- 500,000 in West Bengal and 158,000 in Odisha -- were evacuated to safer spots. The storm had made landfall around 20km east of Sagar Island in the Sunderbans on May 20 afternoon, packing winds gusting to a top speed of 185 kilometres per hour, cut off road links, snapped telecommunications and left parts of West Bengal without electricity. A day after his visit to the Amphan-hit states, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on May 23 announced assistance of Rs 1,000 crore to West Bengal and Rs 500 crore to Odisha which was released for immediate relief activities, the Centre said in a statement. The Prime Minister had also announced Rs 2 lakh ex-gratia for the next of kin of the dead and Rs 50,000 for the injured, which was over and above the ex-gratia provided through the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and the NDRF, it added.The Centre has approved additional relief of Rs 268.59 crore to Maharashtra that was struck by Cyclone Nisarga in June. The cyclone made landfall on June 3 near the coastal town of Alibaug, around 100 kilometres south of Mumbai. The weather bureau had sounded red alert for at least seven coastal districts of Maharashtra and the state government had evacuated around 60,000 people from the state’s coastal region of Konkan.Also, for floods and landslides during the south-west monsoon, Rs.577.84 crore has been approved for Karnataka, Rs 611.61 crore for Madhya Pradesh, and Rs 87.84 crore for Sikkim, the statement said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-approves-rs-4-381-additional-aid-to-6-states-hit-by-cyclone-floods-this-year/story-kcePxsAq21StdPEyilDhMP.html
13-11-2020||India||Actor Soumitra Chatterjee undergoes first plasmapheresis; has fever but stable||Veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee underwent his first plasmapheresis procedure on Thursday. Doctors treating the 85-year-old actor at a private hospital in south Kolkata said late in the night that he was running fever but was stable. Plasmapheresis is a process in which the plasma is separated from the blood cells for two purposes. The plasma is either replaced or treated and injected back into the body. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award winner was admitted on October 6 after he tested positive for Covid-19. Chatterjee tested negative on October 14 but his neurological system was affected by Covid encephalopathy. As a result, Chatterjee’s condition drastically deteriorated over the past two weeks. The noted actor is in a drowsy state. Dr Arindam Kar, head of the team of doctors treating Chatterjee, said, “The first plasmapheresis went off well. There was no external bleeding. But in the afternoon we had some issues and did a CT scan. There were no abnormalities. As of now he is again stable. His heart beat rate went up a little. He has fever which was the reason for the deterioration in his condition. The fever could be due to the multiple transfusions which are required for plasmapheresis.” “The actor’s lung, liver and other functions are stable. Plasmapheresis and standard dialysis will be repeated on alternate days. We will reanalyze his neurological condition,” Dr Kar added. Earlier this week, the actor’s kidney functions took a toll on his health. He was put on alternated dialysis to improve the renal function. The doctors subsequently decided to go for plasmapheresis and tracheotomy. Tracheotomy is a medical procedure that involves creating an opening in the neck to place a tube inside a patient’s windpipe to ease breathing. Chatterjee’s neurological function, which is the main concern of the doctors, has not improved. On November 2, the doctors conducted a vascular surgery and successfully stopped an internal bleeding which was leading to loss of hemoglobin. Millions of people in Bengal and beyond have been praying for Chatterjee’s recovery ever since he was admitted in hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-soumitra-chatterjee-undergoes-first-plasmapheresis-has-fever-but-stable/story-ioN5iT0RwfMjRHVpABYK3M.html

According to latest figures released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, the nation’s infection tally has reached 8,728,795, the active caseload however, remained below 4.9 lakh.The declining active cases and the steady rise in the number of recoveries from the disease continue to bind hopes of the citizens. As many as 8,115,580 people have recovered from the viral infection either in Covid-19 designated hospitals or in home isolation. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Earlier in the day, the health ministry credited the high levels of testing across states to the drop in coronavirus cases. “Comprehensive & high TESTING is pivotal in the strategy to curb the chain of transmission,” the ministry wrote on Twitter. It added that from very few tests conducted in January, India has now scaled a high of more than 12 crore total tests in November. According to a graph shared alongside the tweet, on an average 11,03,398 tests for the coronavirus disease were conducted daily in the country in the past six weeks. “With daily capacity of 15L tests, more than 11L tests were done on an average every day in the past 6 weeks,” the Union ministry tweeted, adding that such comprehensive testing leads to early identification, quick isolation, timely hospitalisation and effective treatment of Covid-19 patients.

During the last week, the daily tally once crossed the 8,500-mark in the Capital city and over 7,000 cases were registered everyday. As the city grapples with the third wave of the virus, experts believe that air pollution after the festival of Diwali may contribute to making the situation worse.  New York: Over 18,000 people lost their lives during the first wave of Covid-19 in New York. In the last 24 hours, the city has recorded 4,821 fresh infections. Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that schools will remain closed in the city and restaurants and cafes will be allowed to stay open till 10pm. The USA is the worst coronavirus-affected country, followed by India.Turin: Due to the spike in coronavirus cases in Turin, the government has passed an order to shut down bars and restaurants at 6pm. This decision has resulted in a widespread protest and agitation across the country. London: One of the worst-affected cities of Britain, London recorded 3,554 cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours.

13-11-2020||India||Maharashtra: Activists flag 10-acre patch devoid of foliage, Mangrove Cell orders probe||Mangrove trees across 10 acres in Mumbai’s eastern suburbs have lost leaves and died because of tidal water blockage, environmentalists have said and prompted the Maharashtra’s Mangrove Cell to order an investigation.The state mangrove cell on Friday afternoon conducted the first round of investigation at the site. “Our team of beat officers could not identify any sources of high tide water that had been blocked at the wetland. However, the entire mudflats and mangrove patch continue to be dry. We will inspect the site on Monday again and also speak to locals in the area if they can help identify the causes for this issue,” said Suresh Warak, range forest officer (Mangrove Cell). NGOs Vanashakti and Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishthan (SEAP) filed complaints with the cell and the Mumbai suburban collector on Wednesday attaching images of the site.From September onwards, several mangrove patches in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region wore a dry, skeletal look due to certain defoliating pests that feed mainly on leaves and sometimes mangrove tree barks. New leaves and greener foliage have grown on most of the mangroves except in the Mahul-Wadala area. “We initially thought it was due to the pest attack but the reason seems to be different. There is a deliberate blockage of tidewater to this patch which needs to be investigated. The wetland has dried up and has become hard,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.Based on orders passed by the Bombay high court in 2005 and reiterated in 2018 and recently brought to the notice of various state departments by environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, mangrove forests under the jurisdiction of state bodies need to be handed over to the forest department. The administrative jurisdiction of the mangrove area at Mahul-Wadala is with the Mumbai suburban district collector.“The land has not been notified and handed over to the forest department. The state continues to drag its feet on this issue and is allowing the decimation of mangroves,” added Stalin, who is also the member of the state-appointed Wetland and Mangrove Grievance Redressal Committee.Nandkumar Pawar, head, SEAP, said, “The incidents at Mahul are most unusual. This kind of condition of a salt-tolerant eco-sensitive mangrove patch has not been witnessed in the past. Using geo-tagged photographs, we have requested authorities to restore the water supply and ensure the patch is reinstated. Also, culprits need to face the law.”Virendra Tiwari, an additional principal chief conservator of forest (Mangrove Cell), said, “We are clueless at the moment on what could have caused this. We have asked our officers to investigate in detail and action will be taken based on the report.”An official from the suburban collector’s office said they have received the complaint. “The matter has been shared with the forest department. We will provide any support required.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-activists-flag-10-acre-patch-devoid-of-foliage-mangrove-cell-orders-probe/story-kWtgx6miGKjzSzaq8N4vFO.html

It started fundraising for the campaign on Wednesday hoping the region’s people will support them in sending a message to initiate peace talks.The New Peace Process convenor Shubhranshu Choudhary said when he met the women Maoists, they told him they were suffering in the jungles. He added that is why they decided to help them. “...women Maoists...walk long distances in the jungles... hence we decided to help them because it is an issue of women’s health.Choudhary said they are trying to help these women so that they can start talking. “We regularly go to Maoist areas of Bastar, where we are stopped by lower-rung cadres of Maoists. We will drop these gifts and request them to send them to woman cadres. We do not agree with their politics but this Diwali, we want to send them a message that we care for them and will be keen to talk and encourage them that they also talk to the government to resolve the differences.”Chaudhary said they have informed police about the humanitarian initiative aimed at peace-building. “On October 2, at Bastar Dialogue, where experts were called to speak about the problem of Maoist conflict, the suggestion about this Gift campaign was made.”Inspector general (Bastar) Sunderaj P said police and security forces deployed in Bastar always encourage the reintegration of local Maoist cadres into the mainstream. “Our surrender and rehabilitation policy is one of the best in the country. We appreciate each and every effort being carried out in the direction of establishing peace and order in Bastar. We wish the local Naxal cadres, particularly the female cadres identify the real and ugly face of top Maoist cadres and reunite with their families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-diwali-ngo-reaches-out-to-women-maoists-in-chhattisgarh-with-feminine-hygiene-products/story-G65T60cOr3GQuxyOWghvZJ.html

The forest official has sent the body for post-mortem and further investigation is going on. “A male tiger was found dead near the Toraiyabehera area in Chilfi Range of the Bhoramdev Wildlife Sanctuary when forest officials were on routine foot patrolling. The area where the tiger was found is around 200 meters from the border of the Kanha National Park,” said Rakesh Chaturvedi, state Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) talking to HT. The PCCF further said that it seemed infighting for territory between two tigers took place due to which one died. “There is evidence that another tiger was also present at the spot,” Chaturvedi said. The officials said that other senior officials were in the jungle and the post-mortem of the body of the tiger will be conducted on Friday. “More details are awaited,” Chaturvedi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-chhattisgarh-tiger-found-dead-at-bhoramdev-wildlife-sanctuary/story-cokipLM8NOvy8cRs2jsuUK.html
13-11-2020||India||New genus of tree frog discovered in Andaman Islands and Northeast India||A team of Indian, Chinese, Indonesian and Thai researchers have found a new genus of frogs in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and India’s northeast, according to November 12 issue of Zootaxa, an international animal taxonomy journal. The genus has been named Rohanixalus after Sri Lankan taxonomist Rohan Pethiyagoda.A genus is a category of classification of animals, plants above a species and below a family. It can include one or many similar species.Rohanixalus is the 20th recognised genus of the Rhacophoridae family and comprises eight out of the 422 known Old World Tree Frog species in Asia and Africa.The researchers studied aspects such as external morphology, calls, breeding biology, etc of tree frog species distributed across South, Southeast, and East Asia and confirmed that they represent a new genus.Frogs from the genus are characterised by a small and slender body (about 2 cm to 3 cm long), a pair of contrastingly coloured lateral lines on either side of the body, and other distinct behavioural traits, the researchers said in a note on Thursday.Based on DNA studies, the new genus is believed to be of a distinct evolutionary lineage compared to previously known tree frog genera. During the breeding season, these reddish-brown frogs can be found in large numbers on bushes and shrubs surrounding water bodies.Scientists believe many more unnamed Rohanixalus species are likely to be present and there is a need to understand the diversity of the new genus.This is the first time a tree frog species has been found in the Andaman Islands.“Our discovery of a tree frog member from the Andaman Islands is unexpected and once again highlights the importance of dedicated surveys and explorations for proper documentation of biodiversity in a mega-diverse country like India,” said SD Biju, a Delhi University professor, who led the study.The researchers noticed maternal parental care among the new genus. The mother frog attends the egg clutches until hatching and assists in the release of the tadpoles.“During the first three days after egg-laying, the mother sits on the eggs and produces a gelatinous secretion with which she glazes the eggs through the clockwise movement of her legs. This provides necessary moisture to the eggs laid on exposed leaf surfaces and protects them from insects,” said the note.The scientists found that multiple clutches of eggs laid on a single leaf or plant are attended by multiple females in a behaviour pattern described as community egg attendance.The distinct light green coloured eggs of the new genus are laid in an intermediate form of bubble nests, whereas tree frogs of other genera possess creamy white eggs and their nesting behaviour varies from direct development to foam nests or gel nests.“Members of the new genus are reported to display territorial behaviour and frequent combats between males involving pushing, kicking and dislodging, in order to successfully mate with a female,” the note said. “The gravid [pregnant] females in species of the new genus such as ‘Rohanixalus vittatus’ possesses translucent skin making their internal organs, including mature eggs, visible on their see-through bodies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-genus-of-tree-frog-discovered-in-andaman-nicobar-islands/story-SaSD5fpGEYLdSNRUF6xX3J.html
13-11-2020||India||UP begins groundwork for storage of Covid-19 vaccine||As people across the globe await a Covid-19 vaccine, the Uttar Pradesh government has begun the groundwork to stockpile it. The state government has announced that all citizens in the state will be administered the vaccine free of cost, but the first phase of the inoculation drive would cover the health force — doctors, nurses, paramedics and non-medics in hospitals. All divisions have prepared lists of people who will be inoculated first.“Construction of depots is on in 22 districts,while in 27 others, repair work is in progress,” said Dr AP Chaturvedi, state immunisation officer. He said, “We do not know how many vaccine vials will be coming, but the infrastructure will be ready.” Two vaccine depots are coming up in the capital city of Lucknow – a district depot at the urban health post in Aishbagh and a divisional/state depot near the family welfare directorate in Chowk. Both these facilities are being ramped up. Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know today“The focus is on the maintenance of cold chain and work in this regard is in progress at vaccine depots. The target is to have them ready by December 15,” said Dr Rakesh Dubey, director general, family welfare. In Prayagraj, chief medical officer (CMO) Dr GS Bajpai said, “We have identified a meeting hall of Tej Bahadur Sapru (Beli) Hospital as the main vaccine storage centre in the district and its renovation process has begun to ready it as a Covid-19 vaccine storage facility.” “The district has around 1,365 private hospitals and clinics as well as 130 government hospitals and facilities registered with the CMO office and staff of these would be vaccinated first,” he added. District immunisation officer Dr Amit Srivastava said a sum of Rs11.20 lakh was sanctioned by the state government for getting the Covid-19 vaccine storage site ready. “Around 50 ice-lined refrigerators (ILR) capable of highly safe vaccine storage with proper power backup will be installed at this site. We hope to have the facility ready by December,” he added. In Agra, the vaccine would be stored in the compound of the new CMO office at Halwai Ki Bagichi. “That is where other vaccines already in use are being stored but we will make separate arrangements for Covid-19 vaccine,” said district immunisation officer Dr Sanjeev Werman. “A separate 500 square foot hall is being prepared for storing Covid vaccine. Renovation work would begin in a day or two and we will get a deep freezer from Lucknow to maintain the cold chain required,” he added. In Meerut division, which comprises six districts of Meerut, Ghaziabad, Noida, Hapur, Bulandshahr and Baghpat, health officials have made adequate arrangements for storing Covid-19 vaccine at the storage centre of Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College. Divisional surveillance officer Dr Ashok Taliyan said the medical college can store vaccines for three months at the required temperature. Varanasi’s community health centre (CHC) at Chauka Ghat has been chosen for storing Covid-19 vaccine, said a senior official of health department. The CHC was upgraded further as per the need and its storage capacity was also being increased, the official added. CMO Dr VB Singh said, “From the last week of March till date, a total of 17,653 cases have been reported in Varanasi district. Of them, 16,627 recovered, 282 died and 744 are active cases.” (Inputs from Gaurav Saigal, K Sandeep Kumar, Hemendra Chaturvedi, S Raju and Sudhir Kumar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-begins-groundwork-for-storage-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-qkhzv0pIeODf0OUJxm2O4M.html

13-11-2020||India||Ayurveda Day: PM Narendra Modi to dedicate 2 ayurveda institutes to nation||On the occasion of the fifth Ayurveda Day on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to dedicate two ayurveda institutes to the nation—Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (ITRA), Jamnagar, and the National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA), Jaipur. Both the institutes are the country’s premier institutions of ayurveda. The former has been conferred the status of an Institution of National Importance (INI) by an Act of Parliament, and the latter has been deemed to be a university by the University Grants Commission (UGC). The Ministry of Ayush (ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, sidda and homoeopathy) has been observing Ayurveda Day since 2016 on the occasion of Dhanwantari Jayanti (Dhanteras). This year, it is on November 13. In the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, the event will be observed largely on virtual platforms from 10.30am. Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine access to low, middle income nations crucial for economic recovery: WHOITRA has 12 departments, three clinical laboratories and three research laboratories. It is also a leader in research work in traditional medicine, and presently, it is conducting 33 research projects. ITRA has been formed by conglomerating the cluster of four ayurveda institutes at Gujarat Ayurveda University campus, Jamnagar. It is the first institute in the Ayush sector with the INI tag. With the upgraded status, ITRA will have autonomy to upgrade the standard of Ayurveda education by offering courses as per modern, international standards. Further, it will forge inter-disciplinary collaborations to give a contemporary thrust to ayurveda. NIA got a shot in the arm with deemed-to-be-university (de novo category) status. NIA’s contribution to preserving, promoting and advancing authentic ayurveda in the last few decades has been significant. Presently, NIA has 14 different departments. It runs numerous courses in Ayurveda from certificate to doctoral level and is a pioneer in research activities. At present, it conducts 54 different research projects. With the conferring of the deemed-to-be-university tag, the national institute aims to become a state-of-the-art tertiary health care, education and research institute in ayurveda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayurveda-day-pm-narendra-modi-to-dedicate-ayurveda-institutes-to-the-nation/story-cbamyEqbxxXBSAoMzfRENL.html

13-11-2020||India||Rain, snowfall likely to bring down temperature in N India||The season’s first active western disturbance is likely to bring widespread rain and light snowfall to the upper reaches of north-west India on November 14 and 15, and once it passes, wintry winds from the Western Himalayas are likely to bring down the temperature in the northern plains, including Delhi, which has already witnessed an unusually cold October and early November.According to India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Thursday bulletin, scattered to fairly widespread rain is very likely over Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad and Himachal Pradesh; light rainfall over Uttarakhand is likely over on November 15 and 16, and over the plains of north-west India and adjoining central India on November 15. Parts of Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad are likely to record heavy rain on November 14 and 15.There may be a gradual rise in minimum temperature, by two to three degrees Celsius over north-west India, and by two to fours degrees Celsius over Central India in the next two-three days. But after the western disturbance passes, minimum temperature is likely to fall by around 3 degrees Celsius, and winter chill may set in.“We expect heavy rains to be limited to the Jammu & Kashmir region. There will be light snow also but not heavy snow fall because that is expected only when the temperature reaches zero degrees. There is likely to be light and scattered rains in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand during the period. There will be a fall in temperature over the plains but after November 16 gradually. Minimum temperatures are likely to be well below normal during that period,” said DS Pai, senior scientist at IMD Pune.“This will be the first moderate WD to affect the northern region this season. Before and during the WD, minimum temperatures will rise before falling appreciably after it passes. There may be a two-three degree fall in temperature from November 16 and 17. Winter chill is normally felt when the minimum goes below 10 degrees Celsius and maximum falls to around 22-23 degrees Celsius. We can expect that after November 17,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. The minimum temperature in Delhi on Thursday was 11.6 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal on Thursday. Easterly winds were blowing over the north-west region at the moment, but the wind direction may shift on Diwali day. “We are also expecting wind speed to be low on November 14 because of the transition in wind direction,” added Shrivastava. Easterly winds lower pollutants in the National Capital Region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rain-snowfall-likely-to-bring-down-temperature-in-n-india/story-E7wOuoAsQmRNHumqlpEYmI.html
13-11-2020||India||Delhi wakes up to ‘very poor’ quality air, likely to deteriorate later today||A day before Diwali, Delhi woke up to “very poor” air quality on Friday morning – showing a marginal increase from the previous day’s 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI). On Friday morning the AQI is 328 while on Thursday the AQI was 314.The Capital’s AQI was ‘severe’ for six days, starting November 6. Due to a change in wind speeds, Delhi’s air quality had marginally improved on Wednesday and Thursday but scientists have warned that respite from severe pollution will be short-lived. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said winds blowing over Delhi will start slowing down from Friday, and their direction will switch to north-westerly, increasing the contribution of stubble-burning smoke from Punjab and Haryana.Smoke from farm fires contributed to just 3% of Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels on Wednesday, the lowest since October 14.ALSO READ | Delhi air severely polluted for sixth consecutive day“Even though we have forecast that this Diwali is likely to be better compared to the last few years, the weather is expected to be unfavourable. If people in the city burst crackers, then the pollution level could slip to ‘severe’ on Diwali day and a day after,” Soni said.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that from Diwali afternoon the wind speed will dip to nearly 6 kmph. “From Diwali evening the air quality is likely to start deteriorating. However, from Sunday night the wind direction is expected to change again to easterly and there is also a possibility of light rain,” Srivastava said. The IMD forecast said that wind speeds are likely to improve from Monday.ALSO READ | Delhi’s air quality improves, may deteriorate again over Diwali weekendThe System of Air Quality and weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, also released a similar forecast for Delhi’s air quality for the Diwali weekend. “The stubble burning induced impact in AQI is expected to increase from negligible to moderate for the next two days,” the SAFAR forecast read.The forecast added that even if residents do not burn any crackers, the PM 2.5 level is still expected to be on the higher-end of ‘very poor’ or the lower-end of ‘severe’ category. However, despite unfavourable weather conditions, the forecast said the AQI is expected to be better this year, as compared to Diwali day and the days after the festival for the past four years.Meanwhile, IMD has predicted a foggy Friday morning and the minimum temperature is likely to be at around 12 degree Celsius while the maximum temperature is predicted to be around 30 degree Celsius. On Thursday, Delhi’s minimum temperature, recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official reading for the city, was 11.6 degree Celsius – two notches below normal. The maximum temperature was 29.2 degree Celsius – one degree above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-wakes-up-to-very-poor-quality-air-likely-to-deteriorate-later-today/story-6PUeMUge4LedUFrj7A0PfK.html

The 768-page memoir, expected to hit the stands on November 17, chronicles Obama’s childhood and political rise, before diving deeply into his historic 2008 campaign and first four years in office. Obama was the first African-American president of the United States.

Addressing a virtual news conference, senior Congress leaders P Chidambaram and Jairam Ramesh said the third stimulus package announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday was yet another move to deflect the attention of the people from the bad state of the economy. “The economy continues to be in dire straits and the government does not have a plan to revive the economy. On the other hand, it is busy deflecting the attention of the people from the economy and managing the headlines about the economy,” Chidambaram, the former finance minister in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, said. “I don’t think this government has a considered plan to revive the economy and therefore 2020-21 will be a wasted year and we will end up with the size of the economy lower than the previous year,” he added. Ramesh said the government was only indulging in headlines management to bury the fact that the Indian economy in recession. “At least this year, its [stimulus] effect will not be seen,” he said.However, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda rejected the Opposition’s charge. “With today’s announcements total stimulus have gone up to Rs 29.87 lakh crore, which is 15% of the GDP. Hon PM @narendramodi ji govt’s timely decisions & effective last mile delivery is leaving no stone unturned to make India Self-reliant,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-has-no-plans-to-revive-economy-says-chidambaram/story-W6XoaryFKF4GGLzOQNl6gL.html

13-11-2020||India||No bail, but doctors to examine Varavara Rao||Ailing Telugu poet and activist P Varavara Rao, arrested in August 2018 in connection with the Bhima Koregaon case and consistently denied bail, may get better medical case with a division bench of the Bombay high court on Thursday directing Maharashtra and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to arrange for an immediate video medical consultation for him with doctors at Nanavati Hospital. If the doctors believe a visit is necessary, they should visit Taloja jail, where Rao is housed, the court ordered, asking that a report be submitted by November 16. The bench, comprising justices AK Menon and SP Tavade, also acceded to the request for a hearing after the report was submitted and posted the hearing of the petition of Rao’s wife P Hemlatha on November 17 at 3pm. The bench was hearing a writ petition seeking bail for Rao on health grounds. The HC proceedings on Thursday came a day after the Supreme Court asked high courts to “exercise their jurisdiction” and ensure that people’s liberty is protected. Justice DY Chandrachud said this while hearing a plea filed by Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, seeking interim bail. The bench granted him bail and he was released from Taloja jail the same day. Senior advocate Indira Jaising, appearing for Rao, informed the court there is an urgency to hear the petition because a fellow inmate talked to Hemlatha on Wednesday and informed her that Rao’s health was deteriorating. NIA admitted in its affidavit that Rao’s health is not good but added that doctors at Taloja jail were regularly checking his condition and providing necessary treatment. “There is a legitimate apprehension that Rao will lose his life if he continues to be kept in Taloja jail. The court was not informed about Rao being shifted out of Nanavati Hospital to Taloja jail. No medical report has been submitted after July 30,” argued Jaising. “Condition of detention cannot be cruel, inhuman and degrading. But it is in the case of Rao. It is violating his rights under Article 21 and 32 of the Constitution. If he dies in jail it will be a case of custodial death.” Jaising then sought an interim order to have Rao sent to Nanavati Hospital and to also constitute an independent board of doctors to assess his condition. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for NIA, and chief public prosecutor Deepak Thakare claimed doctors at Taloja jail were regularly checking Rao’s health. Thakare also submitted a medical report of November 12, claiming a check-up was conducted in consultation with doctors from Nanavati hospital. He added that when Rao’s condition worsened he was moved to Nanavati, and that his family was allowed to have video calls with him. Rao was first taken to JJ Hospital on May 28 after he fell unconscious, but was discharged on June 1. The family alleged that Rao was discharged in a hurried manner to obstruct his bail plea. “June 2 was the date of hearing on his bail application on health grounds in the NIA Special Sessions Court and police argued against his bail showing a normal report from the hospital,” his family had said. His bail was denied by an NIA court on June 26. Rao continued to show signs of delirium, though, and after voices were raised from various quarters, Rao was admitted to JJ Hospital again on July 13. Later he was shifted to St George’s Hospital after he tested positive for Covid-19. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) also intervened and issued notice on July 13 to the Maharashtra government, asking it to ensure Rao was taken care of. It also sought a report on Rao’s health. Maharashtra chief secretary responded on July 22, saying adequate care was provided. The commission observed that the right to life and medical care is one of the basic human rights and the state is duty bound to provide the same to a prisoner as well. Rao was then moved to Nanavati hospital for treatment. He was shifted back to Taloja jail on August 28.In October, Hemlatha moved the Supreme Court seeking bail but a three-judge bench that heard the case on October 29, while pointing out that the Bombay HC had not heard the case since September 17, declined to act on it. The bench asked the Bombay court to hear his plea at the earliest. Rao is accused of participating and making an inflammatory speech at the Elgar Parishad conference in Pune on December 31, 2017. The police have claimed that activists including Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Arun Ferriera, Gautam Navlakha and Anand Teltumbde planned the Elgar Parishad conclave, which was intended to incite violence at Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018. Many of them have been arrested, and most charged under the draconian UAPA law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-bail-but-doctors-to-examine-varavara-rao/story-khlXqHlbl38jrgUE3lpFhK.html
13-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The fourth round of antibody tests in New Delhi, results of which were made public on Wednesday in the course of a court hearing, presents some interesting questions.It found that 25.5% of the approximately 15,000 people tested possessed Covid-19 antibodies. The tests were carried out in the third week of October. The results are near-identical to those of the third round, covering around 17,000 people, conducted in the first week of September, which showed that antibodies were present in 25.1% of the people surveyed. The second round (around 15,000 were tested in August) showed that 29.1% of the people surveyed had antibodies. And the first round, in late June and early July, found them in 22.6% of the 21,000 people surveyed.This is not how the results of sero surveys are meant to progress. Sero surveys, such as the ones being carried out in Delhi, are a measure of prevalence of an infection (in this case, of Covid-19), and, therefore, of immunity. Ideally, their results should show increasing prevalence, or immunity, till the herd immunity level is reached. This is the level at which much of the population is safe because the virus can’t find enough people to infect. But there are complications in making such assumptions: for one, Covid-19 antibodies do not seem to last; for another, the presence of antibodies isn’t always necessary for immunity, just as their absence isn’t a sign of lack of protection. Indeed, the October round of the sero survey in Delhi found that 43.5% of people previously diagnosed with Covid-19 did not possess antibodies any longer.This isn’t entirely unexpected.In late October, results of a study led by Imperial College London, of 365,000 people across England, conducted in three rounds between June and September, showed that the number of people with Covid-19 antibodies declined over time. The UK study actually saw a decline in the infection’s prevalence across all parts of the country, with a clear fall between the first and the third rounds. The study was conducted ahead of the second wave of infections in the UK. This may well be what the Delhi study is finding too.There is some debate about the behaviour of antibodies, though. According to a paper published in Science Immunology in early October by researchers in the US, including some in Massachusetts General Hospital, and based on a study of 343 Covid-19 patients, antibodies of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) variety, ones that typically provide long-lasting immunity, were found in patients for up to four months (the study ended then). Others, of the IgA and IgM variety, were detected 12 days after infection but did not last beyond two months.A second paper, also published in the same journal around the same time, but based on a study in Canada by researchers at the University of Toronto, came to a similar conclusion – levels of antibodies of the IgG variety reached a high between two weeks to a month after the infection, and then remained stable for at least three months. This study covered 439 people (not all had been tested, but all did have symptoms of Covid-19).Interestingly, as Dispatch 112 on July 23 pointed out (citing a late June paper on a preprint server), research at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute and Karolinska University Hospital showed that many infected people who were either asymptomatic or showed only mild symptoms did not test positive for antibodies although they had what the researchers called a strong T-cell response. The research was subsequently published in Cell. T-cells are the immune system’s combat specialists (even better, they remember viruses), recognising and fighting infected cells. The research (of around 200 people) showed that twice the number of people with Covid-19 antibodies had T-cell immunity. This could well mean that people who are asymptomatic or contract a mild infection either do not generate these antibodies or see their number wane soon after the infection passes, although (according to the Swedish study) they remain immune. Is that what Delhi’s result is showing? And what does that mean in terms of the infection’s prevalence and immunity?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-ICaEzkII7kqqt4Mi06OmDO.html
13-11-2020||India||Russia backs India’s stance at SCO summit||Russia on Thursday backed India’s assertion that Pakistan shouldn’t raise bilateral matters at platforms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), saying these groupings are focused on multilateral cooperation to tackle regional challenges. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took an indirect swipe at Pakistan at SCO’s virtual summit on Tuesday, saying it is unfortunate that repeated attempts are being made to violate the grouping’s charter by raising bilateral issues. Asked about this matter during an online news briefing on Thursday, Russia’s deputy chief of mission Roman Babushkin said SCO’s charter does not allow the inclusion of bilateral issues. Russia, the current chair of SCO, made it clear to all member states that such issues should be avoided. The main objective of SCO is dealing with regional challenges and threats and promoting economic, financial and humanitarian partnership among member states in order to maintain the momentum of ongoing collaboration, he said. “We should not [divert] our attention to bilateral disputes, we don’t interfere in these bilateral disputes,” Babushkin said, adding that Russia’s position on India-Pakistan disputes remains “consistent and unchanged”. India has reacted sharply to Pakistan’s repeated efforts, often with support from its traditional ally China, to raise the Kashmir issue at multilateral bodies such as SCO and the UN Security Council , efforts that intensified after the special status of Jammu and Kashmir was scrapped in August last year. In September, India walked out of a virtual meeting of national security advisers of SCO after the Pakistani representative projected a map that inaccurately depicted the borders of the two countries. Russia, which chaired that meeting, subsequently informed India that the Pakistani representative went ahead with the action despite being asked not to do so. Babushkin said all member states of SCO are “doing their best to avoid bringing tensions into the agenda of this organisation”. He added, “The value of this organisation is that it provides a proper platform for expanded cooperation and it provides common ground for issues for practical cooperation.” Russia on Thursday said any further escalation of tensions between India and China at Line of Actual Control could impact regional stability across Eurasia and reiterated the need to find a negotiated settlement. “It is feared that amid common turbulence and unpredictability, escalation between India and China would further affect regional instability in our common home Eurasia, while escalation as we are witnessing can be misused by other players in their geopolitical purposes,” Babushkin told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-backs-india-s-stance-at-sco-summit/story-aUzOnIFhcTDVZeLw2dKjDN.html
13-11-2020||India||High-tension wires along elephant corridors in Bengal to be insulated||With nearly four dozen elephants dying because of electrocution in the last five years in West Bengal, the state government is now planning to insulate the low-tension wires that crisscross the elephant corridors.The forest and power departments are also planning to install energized electrical fences at some locations along elephant corridors. The fences will have low voltage pulsating current which would ensure that the animals don’t cross them. The initiative came after the Calcutta High Court in September took suo moto cognizance of reports of elephant electrocution in the state. In October, the division bench of the HC passed orders to stop elephant deaths by electrocution. According to forest department data, at least 47 elephants have been electrocuted in West Bengal till date since 2015. While 22 were killed in south Bengal, another 25 were killed in north Bengal. “Often villagers set up electrical fences by illegally tapping electricity. When the elephants touch the fences, they are killed. We are also coming up with multi-departmental anti-electrocution cells which would also comprise local authorities which would work on the ground to prevent such things,” said a senior state forest department official.Forest officials said that apart from the illegal fencing which kills animals often it has been seen that elephants tend to lean against electrical poles of high-tension wires. If the poles get charged somehow because of leakage during monsoon the elephant gets killed. “We will cover the poles with barbed wires to prevent elephants from leaning against them. This will help to save their lives,” said an official. The WBSEDCL will check why the circuit breakers for the high-tension feeder lines did not trip after elephants came in contact with them in the past, another official said.The tea garden managements may not be encouraging the setting up of illegal electric fences but there are several such fences near labour colonies that cause electrocution of the elephants, he said.The forest department will identify tea gardens adjacent to elephant corridors and the cells will ensure that the management of the estates erect only low-voltage fences, the official said.While north Bengal has around 550 elephants, there are around 200 elephants in south Bengal. Man-elephant conflict is common in West Bengal and villagers sometimes kill elephants to save their crops and property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-tension-wires-along-elephant-corridors-in-bengal-to-be-insulated/story-8tltX09ka9r3U56RAN9tpI.html
13-11-2020||India||Telangana launches hunt for man-eating tiger that killed tribal||The Telangana forest department authorities sounded a high alert in the villages and hamlets surrounding Kawal tiger sanctuary in Asifabad-Kumaram Bheem district, a day after a tiger mauled a 21-year-old tribal to death on Wednesday. Sidam Vignesh, who went to the forest area with two others to graze the cattle, was attacked by a tiger at Digida hamlet of Dahegaon block. The tiger caught the youth by his neck and ran deep into the forest. Vignesh’s mauled body was found by his friends, Bolishetty Naveen and Sidam Srikanth, and other villagers later in the evening. Forest department authorities say it is the rarest of rare incidents in the Telangana forests. “At least, I have not come across any tiger injuring human beings, leave alone killing them in my 25 years of service. I am surprised how it happened,” A Shankaran, officer on special duty (wild life) in the forest department, told Hindustan Times. Apparently, the tiger had eaten some flesh of Vignesh’s body, before abandoning it. “There are no man-eaters in our forests. So, it is shocking for us. May be, the tiger was too hungry and might have not found its prey for a long time,” he said. He said there was also a possibility of the tiger mistaking Vignesh as an animal, as he was in a bent position behind the bushes. “There are at least four tigers in the forests moving between Kawal tiger reserve and Tadoba tiger reserve in Maharashtra. “They travel for 10-12 kilometres in a span of 10 hours. There have been incidents of tigers preying upon cattle in the tribal villages adjacent to the forests, but killing a man has never happened before,” Shankaran said. The killing of Vighnesh sent panic waves among the tribal people in the area, who immediately alerted the local forest officials and the police, who launched a hunt for the tiger. “We have laid two trap-cages along with bait to catch the wild cat. We shall put up two more on Friday and are confident of catching the tiger,” the forest official said. Once the tiger is caught, the forest officials will take a call on what to do after consulting the National Tiger Reserve authorities. “We shall decide whether we should leave the animal deep in the forests or hand over to any zoo authorities,” Shankaran said. The forest department announced an amount of Rs 5 lakh as ex gratia to the family of Vighnesh. “We shall hand over the amount after completing the formalities by the local revenue staff,” Shankaran said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-launches-hunt-for-man-eating-tiger-that-killed-tribal/story-S4t55pC4b43Wt9oMkXlzkJ.html

13-11-2020||India||Congress back to Square One in Gujarat||From having come within striking distance of ousting the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Gujarat in the 2017 assembly polls to losing a clutch of legislators, and finally getting wiped out in the recent bypolls, the Congress party’s fortunes in the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi continue to slide. In December 2017, the party restricted the BJP to 99 seats, its lowest tally in the state in 22 years and also registered its best performance in two decades, winning 77. The party won praise from election watchers for putting up a strong fight and even restricting the BJP from reaching the psychologically important three-figure mark in the 182-member assembly.But over the past three years, the Congress has lost 12 of its legislators to the BJP, which has reduced its strength to 65. On the other hand, the BJP has increased its tally to 111. Chief minister Vijay Rupani described the victory in the recent assembly bypolls – where the BJP won all eight seats, which were all previously held by the Congress – as a “trailer” of the 2022 assembly elections. Gujarat Congress functionaries primarily blame the central leadership, especially in-charge Rajeev Satav, for the slide from 2017 onwards, and say the state unit is too weak to take on the BJP. Across India, in bypolls to 58 seats across 11 states, the Congress won just 12 ,while the BJP won 40, comfortably retaining power in Madhya Pradesh and getting a majority on its own in Manipur. The Congress held 44 of these 58 seats earlier. This was the third by-election in Gujarat since the 2019 Lok Sabha polls necessitated due to the switching of Congress legislators to the BJP.In bypolls in May last year, the ruling BJP won all four seats in Gujarat. This was followed by another by-election in October last year on six seats, also caused by the defection of Congress legislators, including firebrand backward caste leader Alpesh Thakor, to the BJP. While the BJP and the Congress won three seats each, the grand old party managed to defeat Thakor. This reverse happened just when the Congress party looked to be making an impressive run -- starting with the election of senior leader Ahmed Patel in August 2017 to the Rajya Sabha. Patel prevailed in a tense fight with the BJP nominee Balwant Singh in an election that spilled past midnight and saw the Congress sequester its lawmakers in a resort to prevent any attempts of poaching.In December that year, the party fought the assembly elections with senior leader and current Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot as the general secretary in-charge of Gujarat and Bharatsinh Solanki as the state unit chief. Though the BJP eventually won the elections in what is known as its pocket borough but the Congress managed to restore some pride. “All of that has been lost in last three years. We are back to square one,” said a functionary. Satav, a former Youth Congress president and considered close to former party president Rahul Gandhi, was appointed Gujarat in-charge in March 2018, a few months after Gehlot took over as Rajasthan chief minister. “It’s been over a year now that we don’t have any state committee, right from booth level. The state leadership is also moving in the hands of one family,” said a second Gujarat Congress leader who refused to be named. “Satav has hardly toured the state after assuming the charge and even could not bring the warring factions together,” he added. But Satav said the criticism was unjustified. “No doubt, we have lost by-elections on all seats and we will do in-depth introspection and take the required corrective measures after evaluating the reasons. But the BJP misused all the state machinery to ensure its victory. We have seen ruling parties winning all by-elections barring Telangana and Haryana,” he said. Ahmedabad-based political analyst Prakash Shah blamed the weak leadership for the Congress party’s debacle in the by-elections. “The Congress leadership has failed to keep its flock together and the BJP is also readily accommodating them. This shows that the Congress leadership is weak and its legislators are political pliable,” he said. Gujarat was not the only disappointment for the Congress in this round of assembly bypolls. It also failed to win any seat in the bypolls in UP, Karnataka, Manipur, Nagaland, Odisha and Telangana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-back-to-square-one-in-gujarat/story-gzFUhIGsxKhL34ER2Fw1UM.html
13-11-2020||India||Contest to design Central Vista icon||The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) on Thursday announced a design competition to construct an “iconic structure” on the bank of the river Yamuna as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project to commemorate 75 years of independence. The structure would be part of the New India Gardens or the Nav Bharat Udyan that is proposed to come up on 20.22 acres on the western bank of Yamuna. It is expected to be unveiled to the public by August 15, 2022.A CPWD proposal dated November 12 said the structure so built must “realise the grand vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, symbolising emerging New India with equitable growth opportunities, rooted in values of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwaas and representing the aspiration of clean India, free from poverty, corruption, terrorism, communalism and casteism”.“The structure will be part of a complex that will also have facilities for entertainment and to showcase “India’s rich historical and cultural heritage,” the proposal stated. To be sure, the master plan submitted by Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt Ltd — the architecture firm that has been tasked with developing the Central Vista — included the construction of the New India Gardens near the Yamuna river, though the firm will not be involved in its construction. HCP has been tasked with redeveloping the Central Vista avenue, which includes building a new Parliament complex, also by August 15, 2022. According to the CPWD proposal, the new structure must come up on the central axis, which extends from the Rashtrapati Bhawan, through the North and South Blocks, over Rajpath and to India Gate, thereby extending the axis from 2.9km to 6.3km.The Nav Bharat Udyan will also have facilities such as the “Sphere of Unity”, “Milestones Walkway”, “Journey of India”, “Tech Dome”, “Amphitheatre” all of which are meant to showcase India’s heritage and scientific advancement and “to symbolise unity in diversity and aspirations of the New India”. The CPWD proposal mandated that only such material and technology should be used to build the structure that would endure like “Ashoka’s edicts, Iron Pillar in Qutub Minar complex etc.” As per the rules of the design competition, any Indian citizen or organisation is allowed to participate. It will include architects, architectural firms, students, student groups, architectural or planning schools / colleges and other institutions across India, or any combination of the above. All submissions have to be made by December 11 while the winners will be announced in the last week of December 2020.“The structure should be iconic in design and represent the national capital. For example, at present India Gate erected by the British in the Central Vista in the early 20th century prominently signifies Delhi. The proposed iconic structure being built in the independent India should now become a new symbol of the national capital,” CPWD’s proposal said. The structure can be a tower or a sculpture or any other form besides a building that can be occupied, according to the rules. The maximum permissible height at the proposed site as per colour coded zonal map prepared by Airports Authority of India is 134 metres from the present ground level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contest-to-design-central-vista-icon-on-yamuna-banks/story-j78Ae4Z37xRcOTnPrMC0uO.html
13-11-2020||India||Govt allocates additional Rs 10k cr for migrants scheme||The Narendra Modi government’s third stimulus package pumped an additional Rs 10,000 crore into the special job scheme for migrant workers, an indication that a large section of daily wage workers are still dependent on the Centre’s welfare programme even though almost all sectors of the economy have reopened for business. The Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojana is in progress in 116 districts and has spent Rs 39,292 crores so far out of the initial outlay of Rs 50,000 crore. The additional allocation of Rs 10,000 crore—a 20% increase —will be used primarily for MGNREGS-related work such as construction of rural houses or water conservation and harvesting. “Our current estimate shows that we would require funds for 320 crore persondays in MGNREGS. Since a larger number of MGNREGS works come under this special job scheme, this additional outlay is provided,” a top rural development ministry official said on condition of anonymity. The Garib Kalyan Rozgar scheme was launched in June, front-loading 25 existing schemes to offer jobs to migrant workers who returned home during the pandemic. Most of them are from six states. This is the first additional allocation for the programme. HT had reported on September 27 that the construction of houses in rural India has driven this effort with 3.77 lakh projects, , followed by 1.21 lakh water conservation and water harvesting works, and 92,158 projects involving the laying of fiber optic cables under Bharat Net. The flagship rural job scheme, MGNREGA, has a record allocation of Rs 1.01 lakh crore for FY20-21. The demand for jobs under MGNREGS has slowed over the past three months but officials believe that it will rise agsin in winter months after the agricultural season is over. The government announced that Rs 73,504 crore has been released under MGNREGA and 251 crore person-days of employment have been generated. Experts say that the additional Rs 10,000 crore will be spent on some specific schemes from the basket of 25 programmes that were front-loaded to roll out the migrant jobs scheme. “It looks like additional funds are required for these schemes and that’s the reason the government pumped in Rs 10,000 crore,” said former rural development secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-allocates-additional-10k-cr-for-migrants-scheme/story-KcDEASoEHsxsRd82xQycwK.html
13-11-2020||India||Retail inflation at a six-year high of 7.61%||Retail inflation jumped to a six-year high of 7.61% in October from a year ago, compared to an increase of 7.27% in September, a reading that is well above the Reserve Bank of India’s acceptable limit of 4% (+/-2) for the seventh straight month, data released on Thursday by the ministry of statistics showed. The country’s consumer-price index - a measure of what households pay for everyday items, including fuel, clothing and electricity - is now at its highest level since May 2014, fuelled by persistent high food prices. Combined (rural and urban) food price inflation rose 11.07% in October on the back of costlier onions, potatoes and other vegetables, up from 9.73% in September, the data showed. High food costs affect poorer households more than affluent ones. The poor tend to spend a higher proportion of their monthly budgets on food because according to the well-known Engel’s Law, as household income rises, the percentage of income spent on food declines, relative to other expenditure. Vegetable prices surged 22.51% in October after increasing 20.73% in September, the data showed. Prices of meat and fish increased 18.7% in October against a 17.6% rise in the previous month, while pulses rose 18.34% in October against a 14.67% rise in September. The upsurge in vegetable prices was driven by damage to stored and freshly harvested onion stocks due to heavy rains last month in states, such as Maharashtra and Karnataka. Higher onion exports this year, of over 2 million tonne till August, also exacerbated domestic shortage. To curb prices, the government had on Sept 14 banned export of onions. To help quicken imports, the government on October 21 relaxed fumigation norms for imported onions. “The directorate general of foreign trade is facilitating private traders to speed up imports by clearing licences and prices have stabilised. At an all-India level, average retail prices of onions have stabilised at around Rs 65 a kg,” food minister Piyush Goyal had told HT on October 30. Among major categories that make up the consumer price index, fuel and light inflation jumped 2.28%, compared to a 2.87% rise in September, while health costs climbed 5.22%, against a 4.9% surge in the previous month. Household goods and services prices recorded a 2.83% growth, marginally down from September’s 2.9%. Elevated retail prices not just affect consumers but also shrink the Reserve Bank’s room to lower interest rates further to boost growth at a time when the pandemic has battered key sectors. On Wednesday, the Reserve Bank of India, in its first ever ‘nowcast’ note, had said the country had “entered a technical recession in the first half of 2020-21 for the first time in its history”. Growth in the first quarter fell 23.9%, according to official data. The government on Thursday announced a third round of stimulus worth Rs 2.65 lakh crore to steer the economy out of a deep slump. “People’s preference for a safe transport option for commute has resulted in transport and communication inflation to increase consistently from March, when it rose 4.3%, to climb 11.16% in October,” said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist of India Ratings & Research, a ratings firm. According to Abhishek Agrawal, an analyst with Comtrade, a commodities-trading firm, October’s retail inflation should “make it clear to policymakers that food inflation has persisted and supply-side constraints are to blame”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retail-inflation-at-a-six-year-high-of-7-61/story-sbOIJszIsgk9LXo8Q2WRAJ.html
13-11-2020||India||Our ideologies should not go against national interest: PM Modi to JNU students||Sharing his experience of Emergency with the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said one doesn’t need to sacrifice his or her own ideology to fight for a common, greater cause. “When people joined Mahatma Gandhi, they didn’t leave their ideologies. I have seen Emergency days. There were so many people from various political beliefs — from Congress, from RSS. But we were all united by a common cause of national interest,” PM Modi said, unveiling a statue of Swami Vivekananda at the university campus via video-conferencing.“Placing individual ideologies before national good is wrong,” the Prime Minister said in his speech where he also gave some tips to JNU students. “Don’t accept status quo. Swami Vivekananda never accepted status quo. Do’t forget to laugh. I often see young people so serious as if the burden of the entire world is on them,” PM Modi said.Watch | ‘Keep national interest above ideologies’: PM Modi tells JNU students His speech also dwelled on politics, reforms and reforms brought by the BJP government. Talking about reforms and politics, Modi said there was a time when good reforms were considered to be bad politics. Urging JNU students to debate on this, the PM asked, “How did good reforms become good politics? You at JNU must deliberate on this.”As Prime Minister Narendra Modi elaborated on the reforms taken by his government, he said the new National Education Policy is based on the policy of inclusion, which will make sure students can get admission to universities like JNU. “All our reforms are aimed at development. For years, farmers remained a topic of political discussion. But we gave them security and then started reforms,” PM Modi said. Slamming the previous governments for dissociating the poor from the system, the Prime Minister said, “Now they have house, toilet, electricity, paid internet connection like others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-did-good-reforms-become-good-politics-pm-modi-asks-at-jnu/story-6h9wd6Z8rjogY5wbpdukUK.html

Attorney General says he crossed the line||Attorney General KK Venugopal on Thursday gave his nod to initiate contempt of court proceedings against stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra for his ‘highly objectionable’ tweets against the Supreme Court.The Attorney General has said that the tweets by Kamra are ‘not only in bad taste but also clearly cross the line between humour and contempt of the Court’. Kamra on Wednesday had shared a series of tweets concerning the top court in his reaction to interim bail granted to Republic TV’s editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami by the SC in the 2018 abetment to suicide case.

13-11-2020||Editorials||All eyes on the economy | HT Editorial||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the third Atmanirbhar Bharat package on Thursday. With the latest measures, India’s economic response — including both of the Centre and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) — to the economic disruption inflicted by the Covid-19 pandemic has reached ₹29,87,641 crore; roughly 15% of the total GDP, Ms Sitharaman said. To be sure, the actual fiscal impact on the central government’s finances is significantly less than the 15% figure. The announcements came on a day when the two important economic numbers were announced. The Index of Industrial Production came out of contraction zone — it grew at 0.2% on an annual basis — in September for the first time since the imposition of a nationwide lockdown. The Purchasing Managers’ Index manufacturing had entered expansion zone in August and has been gathering momentum since then. To be sure, the recovery in industrial activity is not uniform. Cons-umer goods industries have shown the biggest expansion while capital goods industries are still in the contraction zone. There will be greater clarity when the second quarter GDP numbers are released later this month. India’s retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, grew at 7.61% on an annual basis in October. This is the highest monthly growth in inflation since June 2014, the first full month after Narendra Modi assumed office. To be sure, the inflation spike is a result of seasonal shocks to food prices and the government’s taxation policy on petroleum products, rather than an overheating of the economy. While core inflation (non-food non-fuel) has shown a growth of 5.7%, non-core inflation has grown at 9.8%. Given the fact that the government will be presenting the next Union Budget in just over 75 days, it is reasonable to assume that no significant measures will be announced before it. While there is an acknowledgement of the fact that sequential economic recovery has been gaining momentum, it remains to be seen how much of this is preserved after the festive season. Keeping food inflation under control has been one of the key political economy priorities of this government. If things do not improve quickly, there could be more curbs on both domestic and foreign trade in food items, which goes against the spirit of agricultural reforms announced earlier this year. More broadly, the government’s measures are positive — but whether they will be enough remains a big question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/all-eyes-on-the-economy/story-rVBjtAOj3Z2OQwrI0W2fwJ.html
