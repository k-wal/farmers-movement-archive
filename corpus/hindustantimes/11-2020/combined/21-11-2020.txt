She introduced me to other guests as a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), much to the delight of a young couple. They were thrilled about Chief Minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal’s live-streamed Laxmi puja earlier that evening. The woman, who runs a business, said that she had always wanted to do the puja at home, but didn’t know how to conduct it. The instructions from the live-stream helped them set it up. I have since heard several other accounts of people who found the Delhi government’s Diwali puja a useful guide. The pandemic made it unviable for the AAP government to replicate its popular Dilli Ki Diwali festival at Connaught Place, so the CM’s call for a community puja led by his Cabinet was the next best thing. Add to the mix bhajans from Anup Jalota and some excellent dance performances, and it was a wholesome Diwali package. But Kejriwal’s Diwali puja triggered sharp criticism from both the Left and the Right. It was amusing to see both unite in going after something as innocuous as a community prayer on one of India’s biggest festivals. Why is an elected head of a state patronising a religious festival and participating in prayers? The principle of separation of church and State was being violated, they said. But the truth is separation of church and State in its puritanical sense has always been alien to the conceptualisation of a secular India. Historically, various governments have patronised and supported religious activities. The Delhi government, for instance, has been facilitating the Chhath puja at 1,200 public ghats, providing financial and logistical support to Valmiki Jayanti, Gurupurab and organising Iftar functions among other such events. Kejriwal has personally attended and participated in each of these. What made this Diwali puja stand out was that, in addition to backing and participating, Kejriwal also performed the ceremony and streamed the puja. To be fair, Kejriwal has always led his family Laxmi puja each year and it was his special love for Diwali that led to the three-day Dilli Ki Diwali laser show festival in Connaught Place last year. This year, with no major public gatherings possible, he live-streamed the puja. The disquiet about Kejriwal performing the puja comes from a misplaced understanding of what it means to be secular. Suhas Palshikar tweeted his scholarly articulation of this phenomenon recently: “Seculars have done enough harm by confusing secularism with an anti-religion intellectual position. The intellectual terrain of discussion then shifts away from core issues of coexistence and sublimation of religiosity.” This tendency to conflate the religiosity of politicians with religious supremacy led a senior TV editor to compare Kejriwal with Modi. When I pointed out to her that peaceful expression of religious beliefs is not comparable with bigotry, it was not well received. This behaviour is odd for a country that is so overwhelmingly religious. The need to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s politics of religious supremacy should not lead us to look askance at legitimate expressions of Hinduism itself. It is this kind of stance that alienates the ordinary religious Indian from the liberal elite.The Right-wing’s attacks are coming from a place of insecurity. They have exercised monopolistic power over Hinduism so far. Every time a non-BJP political leader expresses their Hindu faith, the party’s machinery attacks it as disingenuous. Kejriwal’s Hindu identity is not a façade. He is from a deeply religious family. One especially revealing incident from a documentary about his life comes to mind. His parents were asked about the time they met Kejriwal’s batch-mate and wife Sunita for the first time. His father, Gobindram Kejriwal said, “All we asked Sunita was, beta, do you believe in God? She said she did, and that was all we needed to know.” The Left and Right need to realise that Kejriwal’s politics is prefaced on his governance model, which won him the Delhi assembly election three times. That is his electoral trump card, not his Hindu identity. His religiosity is just a fact that they will have to accept and live with.

21-11-2020||Mumbai||Memorial in honour of 26/11 Mumbai attacks martyrs in Kalyan missing||Just a week ahead of the November 26 anniversary, the memorial that was raised in honour of the martyrs of 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attack has gone missing.Locals claimed that the helmet of the Boots, Gun and Helmet Memorial at Mahatma Phule chowk had gone missing seven months ago. Now, the entire memorial is missing. Kalyan’s hawkers union president Arvind More, who has been following up on the memorial, claimed that the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has failed to maintain the memorial.“The helmet had gone missing seven months back. Now the entire memorial is not in place. I have tried inquiring with the civic body about it but they are clueless about where the memorial has gone, whether someone had stolen it or it was taken away for repair,” said More.Ironically KDMC officials are also not aware of whether the memorial was taken away for repair and when it will be placed at the chowk. “I have no clue about the memorial. Will check with other departments of my ward if they have taken it for repair and maintenance,” said Bhagaji Bhangre, ward officer KDMC.Earlier, locals had complained about the memorial being misused by drunkards who used to dump waste there. Stray dogs sat along it and also it was ill maintained. The memorial was built in 2012 in the memory of the five police officers who lost their lives in the terror attack on November 26, 2008.A total of ₹1.5L to ₹2L was spent to build the base structure with railings.This particular memorial is located in one of the prime locations of Kalyan station road. It is surrounded by roads that connect to the Rukminibai civic hospital, traffic police office, tehsildar office, forest department office and Kalyan court.Every year, on November 26, the traffic and local police visit the memorial offering prayers to the martyrs.More said that the civic body used to maintain it sometimes. However, it was in complete neglect over the last few months.Sandeep Singh, 30, who runs a small stall near the chowk, said, “The memorial is missing for almost seven months now. I have not seen anyone repairing it or inspecting it. It might have being stolen during the night.”Kalyan’s Sunil Pankar, 48 and retired from Navy, said, “The best way to make sure such memorials are protected and maintained is to involve public and interested groups, and let them look after the memorial on a regular basis. There is lack of such initiatives that the civic body should emphasise.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/memorial-in-honour-of-26-11-mumbai-attacks-martyrs-in-kalyan-missing/story-sMTDfOse5NOB9bTtIYx76L.html

This is part of the civic body’s ‘My Family My Responsibility’ initiative. Health workers have been instructed to visit homes of migrant workers who had left Mumbai during the lockdown and screen them for symptoms of Covid-19. BMC will also mobilise mobile clinics and testing camps in slum pockets where they notice reverse migration.“We have lists of houses or chawls which were found locked during the door-to-door survey. Now, as migrants return to Mumbai, we will send our volunteers to inspect those places again. All family members have to undergo mandatory screening to avoid any chance of the spread of the virus,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Under the ‘My Family My Responsibility’ campaign, BMC has so far surveyed 35.1 lakh families in Mumbai, including residents of slums and high-rise residential complexes. As part of the survey, health volunteers visit homes and check residents for oxygen saturation and other symptoms of Covid-19. If anyone exhibits symptoms such as fever, cold, cough or loss of smell, they are tested for Covid-19.“During the survey, around 4 lakh houses or rooms were found locked. Approximately, 18 lakh migrants used to live in those places who might return now as the lockdown has been relaxed,” said Kakani.BMC has also instructed local medical practitioners to refer suspected Covid-19 patients to testing centres.Health experts have welcomed the move. “Migrant labourers were considered super spreaders as most lived in slums… BMC has to be cautious. Any mistake in screening can again spread the virus in overcrowded slums,” said Dr Sunil Mishra, health activist with NGO Doctors for Help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-outbreak-mumbai-civic-body-to-conduct-door-to-door-survey-to-screen-migrants-in-city/story-Rp0Km44y8MiRv3ztat1L6K.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Inflated power bills: 96% of 11 lakh complaints from across Maharashtra resolved||Between March and October this year, more than 11 lakh power consumers across the state have complained of receiving inflated bills. According to data shared by the state energy minister’s office, 1,166,815 consumers in the state had registered complaints, of which the utilities have resolved 1,129,767 or 96.8% so far.While the Maharashtra State Energy Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) supplies power to over two crore consumers in some parts of the city and state, the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST) supplies power to 10 lakh consumers in the island city and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) and Tata Power supply power to close to 30 lakh consumers in Mumbai.As per the data, MSEDCL is yet to resolve 31,151 complaints, followed by BEST which has close to 3,016 complaints pending, while Adani and Tata have 723 and 2,158 complaints pending respectively. The state distribution company has now assigned specific roles to its employees to recover dues by December-end. MSEDCL is facing a huge debt akin to ₹59,102 crore, as per data shared by energy minister Nitin Raut.“MSEDCL faced an additional loss of ₹9,000 crore as many consumers did not pay their power bills. In March 2020, the dues pending in the residential category was around ₹1,374 crore which increased to ₹4,824 crore by October-end,” Raut tweeted on Wednesday.In August, the state had said that it was planning to waive excess bills by bearing the surplus amount for April, May and June. Raut had in October also said that consumers will get good news during Diwali. However, on Tuesday Raut announced that the state will not be able to provide any relief to consumers owing to its poor financial status and lack of aid from the Central government. The announcement came as a shock to many consumers who had reported inflated bills after the lockdown period. HT had also reported that 64.52 lakh consumers of MSEDCL had not paid any bill amount since March in view of a waiver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/inflated-power-bills-96-of-11-lakh-complaints-from-across-maharashtra-resolved/story-gWzZUk1c1HhKadz1YhPn8H.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra to build 8.82 lakh homes for the homeless within 100 days||The Maharashtra government on Friday launched an ambitious scheme of building more than 8.82 lakh houses for the homeless people residing in rural parts of the state and has set a target of constructing these homes within 100 days by February 28, 2021. The homes will be built by amalgamating many schemes being run by the state and the Centre. Named Maha Awas Yojana, the ₹4,000-crore scheme was launched by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Friday. He also directed the concerned officials to ensure that the homes are of good quality.“All the officials must ensure that the houses should be pucca and of good quality. They should be so ideal and beautiful that people from other states would come to see them,” the CM said while launching the scheme.He said that the government has made several changes in Maha Awas Yojana to ensure it is a complete package. “We will not only give grants to people for building houses, but will also see that they get land and have basic amenities such as toilets by ensuring loans from banks,” Thackeray said.Rural development minister Hasan Mushrif said, “We have set a target to build 882,135 houses by February 28 with an expenditure of ₹4,000 crore. We will be providing land to those who don’t have any and will also regularise illegal encroachment on government plots under the scheme. We want to ensure that not a single family is left homeless in rural Maharashtra.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-build-8-82-lakh-homes-for-the-homeless-within-100-days/story-ksVLLuVPDJL1BBc9nmTRAJ.html
21-11-2020||Chandigarh||Witerati: Of Tantrumps, Tin Pots & TikTok||Whilst former POTUS Donald Trump staged his Dramatics of Denial starring Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, little would he have imagined he was making not only history and histrionics, but also attaining immortality in the annals of 2020’s cult cliché-ism.It’s best left to pol(l)itical scientists to pontificate on #POTUS45 legacy – good bad and the ugly – and suffice it for us to stick to Trump’s lexicological legacy – Word of the Year 2020.“Tantrump”.Who better to enlighten about word’s worth and Trumpisms than a custodian of Queen’s English fabled for flowery Tharoorisms.Tweeting John Cole’s cartoon, grammarian-parliamentarian Shashi Tharoor enlightened us less linguistically awakened Netizens that fashioned after former White House incumbent, word “Tantrump” has now come to denote “an outburst of anger, characterised by an inflated sense of entitlement, denial, narcissism, paranoia and victimhood”.While contributions to the vocabulary by less melodramatic heads of state have comprised more of catchphrase-ism or colloquialism – be it Bill Clinton’s Carville-esque “It’s the economy, stupid,” Mikhail Gorbachev’s “Glasnost” and “Perestroika” or closer home, Narendra Modi’s pet phrase “Mitron” or Tharoor’s “webaqoof” or “farrago” – trust Trump’s contribution to popular vocabulary being about brattish behaviour “isms” – mannerism, egoism or narcissism.While the former POTUS was privileged to possess a platform Shakespearean for his Theatre of the Absurd – “All the world’s a stage” – lesser mortals aren’t as blessed with soap opera-esque ouevre or audiences when they throw localised versions of ‘Tantrumps’.Of Trumpisms VS TharoorismsOne tribe tossing ‘tantrumps’ at the passing of pandemic-esque power is that of neighbourhood RWA (Residents’ Welfare Association) chiefs.Elevated to the exalted status of Tin Pot dictators during Lockdown – vested with powers of policing protocols governing social distancing in gated housing societies, come Unlock and some RWA heads – Khullar jis or Khanna jis – are suffering signs of sulkiness at the loss of power. Power, that came from catching red handed on CCTV footage errant residents who sneaked into lifts during Janta curfew or stalked Condo corridors minus masks in Lockdown 1.0.Like a Trump reluctant to relinquish residency of the White House, these RWA ‘Tin Pot’ types look to be loitering still near seats of power – security desks housing CCTV cameras of Condo living – long after Lockdown is gone. To do ogling ‘masked’ as goggling. Or to do more moral policing by scuttling the Condo’s carriers of “fake news” – inmates who fib they’re driving to the doc when they’re actually scooting to socialise in the Corona-scape.The curious case of Sleepless in Scuttle.Of TikTok & TantrumsCloser home, in the current anti-China corona-scape, the Trump tantrums may carry a ring a resonance in the mannerisms of maids – Lalitaa ji & Co.With the Tiktok template, which gave many a house help a digital stage for making histrionics if not history, consigned to curtains down by the “Chini Kum” narrative, bais Lalitaa jis & Co may be employing ‘Tantrump-ish’ histrionics with employers.Post-TikTok, maids may now eye memsahibs Lollita & Co’s Netflix-enabled phones broadcasting “Bandish Bandits” or “Panchayat”. When supplications for spare smartphones fall on deaf memsahib ears, maids Lalitaa ji & Co deign to deliver demeanour that’s Tantrump-ish – clanking and clanging Pan-demic’s pots ‘n’ pans like a Trump-ish empty vessel making the most noise. Or the Lalitaa jis may waste working hours pirouetting TikTok-type latkas-jhatkas in front of Lollita & Co’s bathroom mirrors in demeanour smacking of Trump-ish denial mode – denial of the deathblow to TikTok or dramatics at the denial of the desired smartphone.The curious case of ‘Who Moved My Grease(paint)’!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/of-tantrumps-tin-pots-tiktok/story-NlRlm3bZFUj5wOOZJs6f7N.html
21-11-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: Unravelling the role plays of society||While the world is still grappling with the pandemic, as also with some human viruses and levels of global suffering are high, it is time to take a look at the lighter side of life’s role players in present times.Politicians, those icons of power hungriness, are currently at their most blatant, tom-tomming their way constantly into our ears with cacophonous results. Aided and abetted by social and unsocial media, bolstered by perennial hangers-on, propped up by supporters with insatiable vested interests, these ‘leaders’ from all countries, all parties, all hues, have just one desire – Power!Bureaucrats, those hapless members of rule bound career services, though some are cunning too, have actually proved their mettle a little more in this crisis ridden year. Whether they are responsible for ensuring compliance of regulations or administering public health services, or even the counting of contentious votes, they have been doing better than usual, barring the usual aberrations.Media persons, those eagle-eyed destroyers of mental peace, are leaving no stone unturned to create havoc in our mind space, often with caustic, acerbic and vitriolic tirades against soft targets as well as deserving candidates. They get away with so much faffing around, all year round, that even they do not remember what their priorities were just a few days ago. Thankfully, the modicum of sobriety displayed by some stalwarts quietly embalms the madding air.Corporate professionals, those for whom profit and loss are nearly everything, have been hankering for the normalcy of yore which has been snatched away from pretty much everyone, as if a giant bird swooped down from the heavens and took it away. They are working from kitchens, from cupboards, from cars and scooters, in the hope that one day they will be back to delivering PPTs without PPEs and actually shaking hands, in the hope of making a few killings!Teachers, those underrated heroes, have been braving it out, gritting their teeth and hanging on by the skin of their teeth. Ladies especially have had a harrowing time, juggling multiple tasks at home while attempting to look calm and composed before smart screens, with restless students waiting at the other end, feeling equally ill at ease.Actors, those starry ones whose job it is to pretend to be someone else, are lamenting the loss of glitter and glory, the sun and the spotlight. They have taken to home videos on Instagram of them cooking and cleaning. But at the first opportunity, they have donned PPE kits and dashed off to the Maldives by the next available flight!Social media Influencers, those new kids on the block, whose ephemeral existence actually depends on apps of the banned and not banned varieties, have actually risen to the occasion. They have entertained or led from the front at times, and made laughing stocks of themselves at other times, but they are here to stay, make no mistake.Motivational speakers, the ones who look busy without doing anything of value, and who pretend that they have a sense of incomparable above-ness to enable them to inspire those feeling low, have recently gained an additional false sense of importance. But their bubble is sure to burst once the pandemic finally relents, and people do not need them any more!Men, the so-called dominant members of society, have found their dominion snatched and have converted themselves, by and by, into dish washers and table clearers. Many have turned into poets, others into singers, and some into chefs. They have clearly understood who the boss is though. There is no dispute on that account.On a sober note, medicos, those beacons of light in the darkest of times, have learnt, like many others, the value of family and calmness. Even basic liberties like being able to hug their dearest ones and partake of meals with the family have been coerced away from them by the pandemic. The rest of humanity can only pay gratitude to them and others who are upholding the virtues of dedicated public service in these shaky times.As the saint said, “Life is a movie and each of us has a role to play.”Let us endeavour to play it well!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-unravelling-the-role-plays-of-society/story-T81krLtYt5FGqqStkX1MDO.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Teachers urge Maharashtra education department to scrap 50% attendance rule||After the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) declared that schools in the city shall remain closed for students up to December 31, teachers have now urged the education department to scrap the rule mandating 50% attendance for them.Teachers said since they are taking classes online from home since June, the rule making it mandatory for them to physically attend school is not helping. “When students are not going to come to school until next year, what is the point of calling teachers? Teachers are travelling to schools under immense risk, which can easily be avoided,” said Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the Mumbai Principals’ Association. Anil Bornare, coordinator of the BJP Teachers’ Cell in Mumbai, said the department should scrap the attendance requirement at the earliest. “Teachers should be allowed to work from home as schools continue to operate online even in the coming days,” he added. Officials from the state education department did not respond to HT’s calls and messages on Saturday. According to the state education department’s standard operating procedures (SOPs), teachers from all schools, government, aided or private, in the state can be called to school for work related to online learning or other academic work. Similarly, schools need to follow the policy of “staying home if unwell” for teachers who are not feeling well and especially those who have comorbidities or are above the age of 50 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/teachers-urge-maharashtra-education-department-to-scrap-50-attendance-rule/story-O1TpBUYsDE8KNZoF447EeL.html
21-11-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: An uncommon smartness||Golfers ambling down the fairway to the 9th hole green at the Panchkula Golf Club (PGC) will have noticed a couple of birds stalking the tightly mowed grass. The birds are digging the soft soil for grubs and insects much like Hoopoes. What the golfers may not comprehend is that those birds, Indian Pond herons, are indulging in a foraging behaviour relatively unknown to the species. Otherwise, herons are typically depicted as water birds lurking around shallow pools to hunt fish, frogs, insects etc. A resident species encountered virtually throughout the subcontinent, the heron is, however, an understudied and under-watched bird thanks to a national obsession with charismatic species such as bustards and tigers.I sought an insight into the herons’ novel foraging behaviour from KS Gopi Sundar, an ornithologist engaged intensively with field research of water birds and a global award-winning scientist. “Herons are very smart birds that learn from other birds. For example, I observed Pond herons dipping a dry, discarded ‘roti’ in water to make it easier to swallow. This trick they had learnt from birds such as Grey herons. I cannot speculate on which species the herons may have emulated for grubbing at the PGC but it seems that they observed other species doing so, tried it out and discovered rich pickings in the form of protein-rich grubs that flourish in golf courses as they tend to be artificially over-watered,” Sundar told this writer. “We term such adaptability as ‘behavioral plasticity’ or the ability of an organism to adeptly vary its behaviour in response to environmental changes. In contrast, the Indian skimmer is a super specialty species that requires pure riverine habitat for survival. The skimmer has been declared a vulnerable species due to its relative inability to adapt to ravaged river ecology. But herons adapt to ecological disruptions, find new foods and continue to propagate the species in abundance,” Sundar added. MIDNIGHT’S BLOSSOMS Smart Pond herons at the PGC are habituated to the golfers advancing upon their feeding grounds and beat a short retreat to return to digging when they have seen off the last of the golfers’ backs. In contrast, I stumbled upon a creature in a terrified tizzy at the Chandigarh Golf Club. It was a colourful and large caterpillar moving around in circles on the path to the 4th hole tee box. The caterpillar was searching for a suitable spot to pupate and that would be on soil or within loose soil, in moss or beneath fallen leaves.The caterpillar was the final-stage larvae of the Oleander hawk-moth or the Army Green moth, a beautiful insect that ventures into the twilight to feed on nectar after remaining still and cryptic through the day, unlike sun-kissed butterflies. Interestingly, in the initial stages of its life as a caterpillar, the Oleander’s colouring is greenish but turns browner with markings quite different in its final caterpillar stage. Before the caterpillar turns into a nocturnal moth, it must go through the intermediate stage of pupation. In the initial stages of its life as a caterpillar, the Oleander’s colouring is greenish. It turns browner with markings quite different in its final caterpillar stage.Nature’s embedded surprises are at their most vivid in butterflies and moths. They metamorphose from hairy caterpillars to still, humdrum pupa bundles and finally blossom – quite unbelievably – as petals on wings, as blessed ballerinas of the free air. If all goes well, golfers may never catch a glimpse of what that crawling creature turned into as it must fulfil its tryst with midnight: as an angelic moth, as a moon flake flitting in the shadows lingering over deserted, ghostly greens.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-an-uncommon-smartness/story-trKOXXSFeojiLEwCP5f6kN.html

In a statement, Ashok Rawat, municipal health officer, North Corporation, said, “We have also asked the medical superintendents of covid-designated hospitals to release bodies at intervals so that there is no rush at the cremation ground.” Besides, corporation officials said that from Sunday they would provide personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for maximum four people accompanying the bodies for last rites.Every covid-designated hospital in Delhi has been assigned a crematorium and graveyard to ensure there is no rush at certain crematoria only. “But, for past one or two months, as Covid-related deaths were fewer, families from other neighbourhoods were also bringing bodies to Nigambodh Ghat. Ideally, it should accept bodies from seven hospitals in north Delhi, including the Lok Nayak Hospital, GB Pant and Hindu Rao, but, lately, people from east and central Delhi have also been cremating bodies here,” said a senior official.Corporation officials said that they have made elaborate arrangements to cremate bodies at the Nigambodh Ghat. “Other than three incinerators running on CNG, there are around 104 wood pyres of which 52 are reserved for covid victims. Over the last 10 days, up to 22 bodies of Covid victims were burnt every day here,” the official said.On Saturday, till 5.30 pm, 20 Covid victims and 40 others were cremated, he added.From Monday, three new CNG furnaces are likely to start operations at the ghat. As per Delhi government data, the city recorded 118 Covid deaths on Friday, the second highest single-day toll. Maximum Covid deaths in a day were reported on November 11, when 131 fatalities added to the toll.There are 19 crematoriums and graveyards where Covid-19 bodies (of confirmed and suspected cases) are being cremated/buried. Of these, eight are run by north corporation, six by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) and five by East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). Officials said these facilities can cumulatively dispose of nearly 140-150 bodies daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dont-send-bodies-from-south-and-east-to-nigambodh-ghat-north-civic-body/story-0INKNtrvvoIrZlwoA27S2J.html

21-11-2020||Chandigarh||Elevated road project: Traffic gridlocks drive residents up the wall in Ludhiana||As the Samrala Chowk-Ferozepur Road elevated road project is moving further towards Bharat Nagar chowk, the commuters are left in the lurch having to face massive traffic jams on one of the busiest stretches in the city.After Bhai Bala Chowk, the traffic light-point in front of the mini secretariat has become a major bottleneck for traffic movement.The misplaced priorities of the traffic police are also adding to the harassment of the commuters as instead of streamlining the traffic, they are busy challaning vehicles.Sunny Saini, a school teacher, said that the traffic police should take measures to end the harassment of commuters. “Due to the elevated road project, the width of the road has shortened and it takes 20 minutes to half an hour to cover the 1.5-km stretch in front of the mini-secretariat from Aarti Chowk during peak hours. And then there is fear of being caught by the police at a light-point. Instead of challaning the vehicles, police should manage the traffic,” he said.Another commuter said that traffic cops deliberately ambushed vehicles that incidentally jumped a light during peak hours and were not bothered about helping stranded commuters.Construction adding to air pollution: residentsAnuj Kumar, a resident of Dugri, said that the construction was causing a lot of air pollution. “Plumes of smoke and dust can be witnessed even from a distance. Commuters, pedestrians and those traveling on two-wheelers and auto-rickshaws are forced to inhale them. The authorities should tell the construction company to spray water to settle the dust and immediately construct a slip-road to ease traffic jams.”The 12.951-km elevated road is being constructed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) from octroi post on Ferozepur Road (NH 95) to Samrala Chowk. The work on the project was taken in hand in October 2017 with the target to complete it in 30 months (by April 2020), followed by 48 months of maintenance by the construction agency.When contacted, assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Gurdev Singh said, “We are holding a meeting with the representatives of the construction company and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Monday to discuss the issues being faced by the commuters. On the other hand, traffic cops have already been instructed to streamline traffic on priority basis so that commuters are not harassed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/elevated-road-project-traffic-gridlocks-drive-residents-up-the-wall-in-ludhiana/story-dj0ZIcx2dXJTmeb7OuqfFK.html

Addressing a press conference, Bali said the project has not moved an inch in three years.This was reflected when Union minister Anurag Thakur and chief minister Jai Ram Thakur started a blame game on the issue on the stage in full public view, he said. Bali said that while the Union minister squarely blamed the state government for the delay, the chief minister said that he was in talks with the Centre on this matter. APPOINTMENTS DONE BY FLOUTING NORMS Bali further alleged that a lot of appointments in the CUHP were done by flouting the norms and Congress was readying to launch a stir against the issue. He said that the BJP cadre was being appointed in the institution tweaking the norms. Bali said he was not against appointing people from the cadre but breaking the norms. Citing an example, Bali alleged that the BJP government lowered the experience criteria to be appointed as director of an engineering college.The former minister also alleged that chief minister Jai Ram Thakur laid foundation stones of various projects in the Nagrota Bhawan assembly segment which were launched in the Congress regime. “At least 50% of the projects were launched in Congress regime and the foundation stone was already laid,” he alleged.

21-11-2020||City||Centre to blame for delay in Central University project: HP revenue minister||Amid escalated blame game over setting up of two campuses of the Central University of Himachal Pradesh, the state government has now put the ball in the Centre’s court. Five days after Union minister Anurag Thakur took a dig at chief minister Jai Ram Thakur for the delay in setting up of two campuses of Central University in Dehra, revenue minister Mahender Singh Thakur claimed that the state government had written to the Centre numerous times for forest clearance for the land allocated for setting up the campuses, but to no avail. Mahender, who is the second most senior minister in Jai Ram’s cabinet, said that the state government has taken up the matter with the ministry of forest and environment. “We have urged the Centre to redress these technical issues so that the construction work of the university and the pending works of over 30 other projects could be started and the pace of development could be accelerated,” he added. “The state government is taking necessary steps for getting approval for the establishment of Central University and all other developmental projects by taking action under the Forest Conservation Act 1980, but in view of the clarification of the ministry of forest and environment, the Central University and the works of many other important projects are getting delayed,” said Mahender.The revenue minister made it clear that the state government has taken prompt action in converting forest land for the Central University under the Forest Conservation Act 1980. It was decided during the Prem Kumar Dhumal government that two campuses of the CUHP would be built at Dehra and Dharamshala. The state government had transferred 34.55 hectares of land in 2010 to the Central University of Himachal Pradesh for the construction of the southern campus in Dehra, the mutation of which was done in 2010. Apart from this, the approval to divert 81.79 hectares of forest land under the Forest Conservation Act was received on December 11, 2018, in the name of User Agency Director Higher Education, Himachal Pradesh, but this included the condition that the land which has been granted permission to convert cannot be transferred in any case to another agency, department or any other person without the approval of the Central government. There will be no change in the legal status of such diverted forest land. On the request of the department of revenue for this matter and some other matters, the forest department had urged the Union ministry of forest and environment, on April 22, 2019, for the necessary clarification, whether the diverted forest land agency may or may not be transferred to user agency through mutation mode. The revenue department had also urged the Union ministry of forest and environment, whether the documents for possession of the converted forest land can be entered in the revenue records or not. On this, the Union ministry of forest and environment, through a letter on July 30, 2019, had clarified that the legal status of the forest land that is diverted under the Forest Protection Act 1980 will remain as forest land only. In such a diverted land arrangement, the name of the user agency or user department cannot be transferred by the revenue department in the revenue records. Anurag Thakur softens stance on Central UniversitySHIMLA: Days after slamming the state government for delay in setting up campuses of the Central University of Himachal Pradesh, Union minister of state for finance Anurag Thakur seems to have softened his stance on the issue as he expressed gratitude to the chief minister for prompt action and expressed hope that work would start soon.In a press statement, Thakur said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was the biggest political party in the world, as well as a family.He said that the double-engine BJP government at the Centre and the state is committed to the all-round development of the state and working in tandem in this direction.“I am grateful to chief minister Jai Ram Thakur for his prompt action to provide approval for land transfer at Dehra and resolve the long-pending issue of setting up of CUHP campus,” said Thakur expressing delight that the chief minister took quick action over the issue he had raised while sharing the dais at a programme at Dehra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-to-blame-for-delay-in-central-university-project-hp-revenue-minister/story-0MbSEErKf13Wb9UWGhzbEM.html
21-11-2020||City||PAGD candidates not allowed to canvas: Farooq to J&K election commissioner||People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), an amalgam of Jammu and Kashmir’s mainstream parties, demanding restoration of Article 370, on Saturday wrote to the UT election commissioner KK Sharma alleging that the administration was interfering in the democratic process on the pretext of providing security.Chairperson of PAGD, Farooq Abdullah wrote the letter in the context of upcoming district development council (DDC) elections stating that their candidates were not being allowed to canvass freely.“A strange and unique feature has come to the fore. Candidates put up by the PAGD are immediately whisked away to secure locations in the name of security and confined to those locations. They are not allowed to canvass, they are completely out of touch with those from whom they are supposed to seek votes,” said Abdullah in his letter to the election commissioner.He alleged that the current state of affairs was “blatantly oriented” to provide security to a select few while confining others.“Security cannot and should not be used as a tool or an excuse to interfere in democratic processes,” he said while adding that they have been well aware of the security requirements as these challenges are “painfully persistent for the last three decades”. He said that the democratic journey is a bloodied journey in the Valley, soaked in the blood of thousands of political workers who have laid down their life for the sake of democracy.“The democracy is in a state of fragility in Jammu and Kashmir and no government has the right to alter the institutional foundation of democracy in the UT, nourished by the sacrifices of thousands of political workers,” he said.He alleged that using “security” as a reason to modify the democracy is a “desecration of those sacrifices when the very conflict that consumed their lives is used as an alibi to customize the democracy.”“Security is a challenge here and it is for the government of the day to counter that in a manner which is fair and transparent. Providing security to a selected group and confining others is a gross interference in the democracy,” he said.The constituents of PAGD —National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party, People’s Conference, and other smaller parties— are fighting the DDC polls jointly on individual party symbols, the first phase of which is scheduled to be held on November 28. Former J&K chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti have also alleged that candidates of parties opposing the BJP were not being allowed to campaign freely for the upcoming DDC polls on the pretext of security while the saffron party was being given a free hand.Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole has refuted these allegations saying there was no disparity between candidates. Kashmir inspector general of police (IGP) Vijay Kumar has said they were putting candidates in secure areas as it was difficult to provide security individually.People’s Conference leader and PAGD spokesperson, Sajad Lone also alleged that the security was being used as a pretext to “impede electioneering”.“Pre-determining democracy, undermining democracy can have disastrous consequences. We, our children are here to stay. Visitors deputed as administrators better not sow a poison whose venom will be spread over decades,” he said on Twitter.On Thursday, CPI(M) leader MY Tarigami had also written a letter to Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha with similar allegations.He said that L-G Sinha responded to the letter, which the CPI(M) leader shared with the media. “The issue is already in my notice and necessary instructions stand conveyed to the concerned,” Sinha wrote to Tarigami.Mehbooba “stopped” from visiting Shopian’s Rambiara People Democratic Party president and PAGD vice-chairperson, Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday said she was stopped from visiting Shopian’s Rambiara Nallan by the local administration. She alleged that sand extraction through illegal tenders has been outsourced to outsiders and locals are barred from the area.“Our land and resources are being plundered by GOI that has nothing but contempt for us. This is their warped idea of Naya Kashmir. Sand mafia is operating in broad daylight yet we are expected to remain quiet. As a leader, it’s my responsibility to articulate these grievances. But BJP is brazenly violating my rights & curbing my movements under the guise of ‘security,’’ she said on Twitter.She also uploaded videos on Twitter where the police were apparently stopping her from going ahead.“J&K has been turned into an open-air prison but we will fight tooth and nail against this onslaught on our dignity, rights and identity,” she said.She also alleged that the Centre was sabotaging the participation of non-BJP parties in DDC polls.“PDPs Bashir Ahmed despite having adequate security has been detained at Pahalgam on the pretext of security. Today is the last day for filing nominations and I have spoken to Anantnag DC for his release,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pagd-candidates-not-allowed-to-canvas-farooq-to-j-k-election-commissioner/story-itqRRU3UczUO2WKQqRvv9I.html

21-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab gangster claims responsibility for killing dera follower, premis protest||Hours after the murder of a Dera Sacha Sauda follower at Bhagta Bhaika village in Bathinda district, gangster Sukhpreet Singh, alias Sukha Gill Lamme, claimed responsibility for the attack through a Facebook post on Saturday. Agitated over the murder of Manohar Lal Arora, a foreign exchange dealer, premis gathered in large numbers at Salabatpura, about 50-kms from here. They placed the body in the middle of the road and raised slogans. The protesters said they won’t cremate Arora until his assailants are arrested by the police. Senior superintendent of police BS Virk spent nearly two hours with dera supporters at Salabatpura to ease the situation. He said the deceased was not an accused in any crime, including sacrilege. “I will meet protesters again on Sunday again to convince them to lift the blockade. Our teams are working hard to crack the case,” said the SSP. Harcharan Singh Insan, the member of Dera’s 45-committee of Punjab unit, said last rites will be performed only after the killers are held. “It is shocking that an innocent person engaged in legal activity was murdered in broad daylight. It is unfortunate that the dera and premis are defamed with unfounded allegations. We will continue agitation until the Arora family gets justice and assurance of their safety and security,” he said. Earlier, police said the claim of shooting Arora, 53, was made around midnight. The Facebook post in Punjabi claims that the crime was committed by Rajinder and Aman to avenge the sacrilege incidents of 2015. A post from the gangster’s social media page threatens to eliminate anyone involved in the sacrilege of the scriptures of Sikhs. A resident of Lamme near Ludhiana’s Jagraon town, Sukha is known for committing crimes and using FB to take responsibility for it. Bathinda range inspector general of police Jaskaran Singh said: “Special teams are focusing on various leads. We have no comment to offer as the investigation is on.” VICTIM’S SON MAIN ACCUSED IN 2015 SACRILEGE INCIDENT Manohar’s son Jatinderbir Arora, alias Jimmy, is the main accused in a 2015 incident of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib at Gurusar village. Jimmy was released on bail in May last year. TWO PISTOLS WERE USED TO KILL VICTIM Manohar was shot dead by two masked men from close range at his office on Friday evening. Police sources said the accused had come on a motorcycle with their faces covered.

Apart from a disclosure statement, which by itself carries no meaning, there is one statement of constable Pushkar who identified the applicant/accused .... as one of the rioters in the incident of February 25, 2020. However, the statement by a police personnel, given only on April 19, 2020, for the incident of February 25, 2020, is not a strong piece of evidence,” Rawat said.He also noted that Sajid did not identify or name the teenager in his statement.During the hearing, advocate Abdul Gaffar, appearing for teenager, argued that the boy has been falsely implicated in the matter and was not even named in the FIR.Additional public prosecutor Saleem Ahmad, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea and said the teenager was arrested in another riots case, wherein he had disclosed his involvement in the present case as well.Communal clashes had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/teenager-gets-bail-in-delhi-riots-case-court-says-no-eyewitness-to-his-role/story-6deweLJ9cAoKtvX1dd92qI.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||AAP accuses civic bodies of corruption in property tax collection; absurd claims, says BJP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in Delhi (MCDs) of corruption in property tax collection and said it was going to hold a series of media briefings in the coming days to expose the corruption. The BJP later termed the allegations “false and absurd”.“In Delhi, where the property rates are higher than that in other states, the MCDs are still poor but councillors are rich. This is because there is rampant corruption in property tax collection perpetrated by BJP leaders. As per the audit report of the MCDs, a company was paid ₹13.77 crore for creating the Unique Property Identification Card (UPIC) system. The system was never implemented so as to divert money into the pockets of local BJP leaders and officials,” said AAP’s national spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj.He further said, “When the AAP government was formed in 2015, the Delhi government had an income of ₹30,000 crore, which increased to ₹60,000 crore in the next four years, even without the government increasing taxes. But the MCD taxpayers have decreased in 2017-18 due to non-compliance that was brought about by corruption. In 2015-16, they collected taxes from 3,95,219 people, the next year, the MCD collected taxes from 4,41,879 people. The number decreased in 2017-18 to 4,05,774 people.”Bhardwaj added that the AAP will hold a series of press conferences – starting Saturday – to expose the alleged corruption.The Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These statements are false and absurd. We fail to understand how AAP leaders can even imagine that tax money can be syphoned off by individual leaders or officials of the MCDs. As per the law, tax collection is done in bank drafts. This leaves no chance for any pilferage. As for the decrease in the number of taxable properties is concerned, from 4.41 lakh to 4.05 lakh, that happened after small properties, especially in unregularised areas, were exempted from the tax net.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-accuses-civic-bodies-of-corruption-in-property-tax-collection-absurd-claims-says-bjp/story-kgjvyHv9woysH8tTJdCWNI.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||Police bust gang that extorted money from commercial vehicle drivers in Delhi||Delhi Police on Saturday claimed to have busted a gang, whose members posed as recovery agents of insurance companies and extorted money from commercial vehicle drivers on the pretext of pending loan EMIs. Police have arrested one of the gang members, whom they identified as 37-year-old Bijender Lala, a resident of Burari. Police said Lala was previously involved in two incidents of robbery, reported from Samay Pur Badli and Okhla areas. A Maruti Swift car and ₹10,000 cash, which he had recently extorted from a taxi driver were recovered from him.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse said on Friday, a taxi driver Jugal Kishore from New Usmanpur complained that he had bought a used commercial Hyundai Accent car about a year and a half ago from a person named Rinku Pandey for ₹1.3 lakh.“He said, on Thursday, while he was carrying a passenger to RML Hospital, his car was intercepted by a Swift car near Kashmere Gate. The occupants of that car approached Kishore and addressed him by the name of the previous owner of the car. The man also said Kishore has defaulted on a car loan and asked him to get it into the Swift to sort out the matter. But as soon as the complainant got inside the car, the driver started driving while the other man followed in Kishore’s car,” Alphonse said.The complainant told police that the men drove towards Uttar Pardesh and told him way that his car would be confiscated. “They said he would have to pay ₹15,000 to resolve the matter. They did not even let him speak to the previous car owner and threatened him with bodily harm. Once he paid the amount through Paytm, they did not give him any receipt of payment, instead they dropped him off at the Delhi-Noida border,” the DCP said.Later the complainant came to know that the loan amount against his car had already been cleared by the previous owner and lodged a police complaint. The DCP said, during investigation, consistent efforts were made to obtain the details of the Paytm account to which the money was transferred.“Accordingly, a trap was laid and one of the suspects, Bijender Lala was arrested. The Swift car and ₹10,000 of the extorted amount was recovered from him. During interrogation Lala disclosed that he earlier used to work as a recovery agent and that’s when he got the idea to extort money from people on the pretext of loan defaults,” Alphonse said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-bust-gang-that-extorted-money-from-commercial-vehicle-drivers-in-delhi/story-4QqjZKYhKj4pcO8TqfP85O.html

Apart from hitting the expo sector, it also took a toll on the industry that could not upgrade itself in the absence of exhibitions. The expo planned in February will see participation of companies from India and abroad, which will help the local industry incorporate new technology and machinery, and expand business globally,” said Upkar Ahuja, president, Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU).The managing director of Udan Media and Communications Pvt Ltd, which manages trade fairs, GS Dhillon said, “Organisers of exhibitions have suffered huge losses in the absence of exhibitions all year due to the Covid outbreak. However, the industry is showing good response for the Mach-Auto expo, which will help pick up the exposition sector as well.”On digital platforms to organise such exhibitions, Dhillon said, “We are not equipped with the infrastructure and facilities required for digital expos. The government and industry jointly need to work on this.”For the hosiery sector, apart from providing an opportunity to upgrade its technology, exhibitions also give them a chance to get feedback from consumers. “Two exhibitions are organised for wholesale and retail hosiery sectors in June and July. During these exhibitions, we get feedback regarding the consumer demand, which helps us focus on manufacturing the right products. But, no exhibition could take place this year,” said Darshan Dawar, president, Knitwear Club and Ludhiana Woollen Manufacturers’ Association.Industry to rope in educational institutionsAhuja said with students coming up with various innovations that can useful for the industry, they will be roping in educational institutes, such as IITs.“We have also tied up Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana, for the students’ skill development, which will equip them to graduate into industrial jobs with ease,” said Sushil Sharma, general secretary, Association of Ludhiana Machine Tool Industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-covid-blues-ludhiana-industry-hoping-expos-will-be-breath-of-fresh-air/story-sgJTmXekuTf1NYqPNaIT3L.html

21-11-2020||City||Govt invites objections to upcoming Mattewara industrial park in Ludhiana||Amid the row over establishment of an industrial park near Mattewara forest in Ludhiana, the Punjab department of town and country planning has sought objections/suggestions regarding land use amendments for the project.In a public notice issued on Friday, the department invited objections/suggestions within 30 days, even as different NGOs, under the banner of the joint action committee to save Mattewara forest, have been up in arms against the park.The NGOs contend that the park will damage the Mattewara forest and its wildlife, and further pollute the Sutlej river.The public notice issued on Friday states that objections/suggestions have been invited to allow modern industrial park/mixed-land use development by the Punjab government under a central scheme. The park has been proposed in a no-manufacturing zone within 1km belt along the Dhusi Bandh in villages Sekhowal, Ghari Fazal and Salempur with adequate flood protection measures, along with construction of a road over the embankment to sufficiently isolate the road. The objections can be submitted with the office of chief town planner, Punjab, PUDA Bhawan, Mohali.Social activist Kuldeep Khaira said, “NGOs from different parts of the state and even Rajasthan have opposed the project, as it will add to the pollution in Sutlej river, through which surface water is supplied to Rajasthan. It will also damage the Mattewara forest and its wildlife. The government is not even providing information about the project under the RTI Act, as we are working to file a petition in the National Green Tribunal to stop this project.”Convener of Faridkot-based NGO Naroa Punjab Manch, Gurpreet Singh Chandbaja said, “The state government has already failed to reduce pollution in Ludhiana Buddha Nullah, for which the industry is also responsible. Now, the government has proposed an industrial park near Mattewara forest. Ludhianvis are against the project and we stand by their side.”The state government has proposed to establish the industrial park in around 960 acres on government and panchayat land in Haidar Nagar, Sekhowal, Salempur, Sailkiana and Machian Kalan, among other villages.Earlier, the residents of Sekhowal village had opposed acquisition of 416 acres of village land, but it was eventually transferred to the government in September this year. The Greater Ludhiana Area Development Authority (GLADA) has already acquired 960 acres for construction of the park.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-invites-objections-to-upcoming-mattewara-industrial-park-in-ludhiana/story-yRWgvJ80UsOwzYfvgq8W7O.html
21-11-2020||Pune||Wagholi and Kharadi residents in Pune choke in polluted air due to garbage burning||Hundreds of residents in the eastern suburbs of Wagholi and Kharadi are facing serious issues related to rampant and large-scale garbage burning in the area. The residents, especially small children, patients and elderly citizens are suffering from serious breathing issues due to pollutants floating in the early morning air and the burning plastic waste set on fire by miscreants. In Kharadi, indiscriminately dumped garbage on the open ground was set on the fire late night and at odd hours leading to breathlessness and pollution in the area, claimed area residents. “During the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, burning garbage is a crime and investigation needs to be done regarding who is behind the incidents. The CCTV surveillance project of PMC must be used to catch the culprits,” said Ameya Jadhav, a Kharadi resident.“Wagholi is suffering due to unplanned infrastructure and air pollution has increased considerably during the last few months as the main contributor is ineffective waste management. Since the existing waste treatment facility is in shambles, miscreants are burning the garbage openly during the night and endangering our lives. We have reported this issue to the gram panchayats and the concerned departments but to no avail,” he said. Satish Joshi, the former secretary of Marvel Cerise co-operative housing society and vice-chairman of Kharadi resident association said, “For the past three weeks, we are facing issues related to heavy smoke in the air and Kharadi residents are finding it difficult to breathe. The air outside has become unbearable now. Burning garbage is illegal and we wonder what is preventing the PMC from acting against the offenders.” PMC joint commissioner and solid waste management department head Dnyaneshwar Molak said, “Based on the complaints, a fact-finding team will visit the spot and take necessary action soon. The citizens must inform us about the incidents so that appropriate action will be taken.” Prashant Ranpise, PMC fire chief said, “Whenever the fire department control room receives a call about a fire our primary responsibility is to respond to the call in real-time and bring the fire under control. The maximum number of fires due to garbage burning is reported in the months of October, November and December. Garbage fire is major ones and we are keeping a close tab on such type of incidents in the city and surrounding areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/wagholi-and-kharadi-residents-choke-in-polluted-air-due-to-garbage-burning/story-SvNcpVFTVzKhqMt8C0NAzK.html

21-11-2020||Pune||Roads under duress pose risk to commuters in Hadapsar and Undri in Pune||Two roads which are vital in connecting Hadapsar and Undri and run parallel to water bodies are caving in due to non-construction and repair for the past two years. The Mutha Canal road which connects BT Kawade road to Race Course and the Dorabjee Heritage Mall road are now posing as a daily threat to commuters in the area. A major portion of the Mutha Canal road has collapsed due to water pressure in the canal. The three-kilometre road’s security fence has broken down at many places. According to commuters, if necessary, safety measures are not undertaken it would lead to vehicles landing straight into the canal. Similarly, the Dorabjee Heritage mall road which connects Mohammadwadi to Undri, Sayyednagar, Pisoli , Kondhwa, NIBM and other nearby suburbs has broken down near the Marvel Sangria turn. A major portion of the road has gone into the huge nullah which is usually flooded during monsoon with no repair work in sight. Sangeeta Patil, a commuter who stays in the BT Kawade road area said, “The road has become a death trap for the past two years and no steps have been taken by civic authorities to carry out repairs. The concerned government department is oblivious to our woes and have no time for either mending the fence or constructing the damaged portion. We are planning to agitate against the inefficiency of the administration as our lives are at risk. There have been instances when two-wheelers skid off into the caved portion of the road. Luckily, nobody lost their life.” According to Daljeet Goraya, secretary, Ganga Kingston society, Mohammadwadi, a tree fell down at the spot near Marvel Sangria nullah road some two years ago and since then the patch has developed. “The faulty patch of road caved further and we registered a complaint with the civic authority but they never paid any heed to it. Still, commuters are facing serious issues while travelling on the road but PMC is yet to respond. This patch was mainly caved in because of nullah running parallel to the road. The soil is continuously eroding since this nullah flows during rainstorm and damages the road,” Goraya said. According to Goraya, soil erosion has taken place due to continuous deforestation in the area. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, “We will inspect and find out all the technical reasons behind the road faults and a comprehensive road improvement programme will be undertaken at both the spots to ensure smooth and hassle-free travel to commuters.” V G Kulkarni, PMC road department said, “Currently, 30 per cent of the budget is reserved for maintenance of roads and only 10 per cent funds are available for any other works which need to be done. We are equally concerned about the roads mentioned and a permanent solution will be provided in commuters’ interest at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/roads-under-duress-pose-risk-to-commuters-in-hadapsar-and-undri/story-ulb9Trk8qsN46EhKeyZeGN.html
21-11-2020||Pune||BJP, MVA trade barbs ahead of Pune graduate constituency polls||With just ten days left for the Pune graduate constituency polls, campaigning has picked up pace as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) nominee Sangram Deshmukh is locked in a tight battle against Arun Lad of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).As many as 62 candidates are in the fray here for election to Pune graduate constituency. These seats are part of the five graduates’ and teachers’ constituencies of the legislative council for which voting will take place on December 1.From BJP, most of its senior leaders in the state plan to campaign for Deshmukh while for Lad, Congress-NCP and Sena held a crucial meeting in Pune on Friday in which they discussed to focus on key areas to wrest the constituency from BJP, which has lined up a battery of leaders including former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and party leader Ashish Shekar.Following the meeting of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders, Maharashtra minister and state NCP chief Jayant Patil accused the previous BJP-led government of pushing the state-run power transmission company Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) into a crisis due to the power bills allegedly worth Rs 67,000 crore outstanding from consumers in the state.His remarks came amid criticism being faced by the MVA government over the issue of inflated electricity bills, with demand growing for waiver of these bills.“During the BJP-led government’s five-year rule, power bills worth Rs 67,000 crore were outstanding, due to which the MSEDCL went into a financial crisis. Today, the common man is facing hardships due to the power bills. The previous BJP government in the state had put the MSEDCL into crisis...,” he said.Leader of opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Council and state BJP leader Pravin Darekar, on Tuesday, accused the ruling Shiv Sena and NCP of trying to overpower their ally Congress in the state by ignoring its demands.Darekar was in Pune to campaign for BJP’s candidate from Pune graduate constituency-Deshmukh.Targeting MVA government over backtracking on its promise of power bills, Darekar said, “While on one hand, those in power gave a package to the public transport department, the energy ministry, however, has been deprived of it.”“The MVA government has given a package to the state transport department which is headed by a Shiv Sena minister but refused to give any relief to the energy ministry the post of which is held by Congress’s Nitin Raut. Therefore, it is clear that the Shiv Sena and the NCP are trying to overpower the Congress party in Maharashtra,” Darekar said during a press conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/bjp-mva-trade-barbs-ahead-of-pune-graduate-constituency-polls/story-8sJkTVGxkcIz50gevZS8iL.html
21-11-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka CM warns pro-Kannada groups against imposing statewide bandh against Maratha Corporation||As pro-Kannada groups decided to go ahead with Karnataka bandh on December 5 against the establishment of the Maratha Development Corporation(MDC), Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Saturday asked them to withdraw it, as he warned against any forceful enforcement.Asserting that he was for Kannada and Kannadigas, Yediyurappa said, “I’m ready for all that is required to be done for Kannadigas, but it is not right to call for bandh for some other reason, people will not appreciate it.” Speaking to reporters here, he said he will not allow forceful enforcement of bandh anywhere.“I’m observing the burning of effigies and bad behaviours. we will have to take strict action.Let them protest peacefully, but the government will not tolerate attempts to give it a different turn,” he added.Pro Kannada organisations at a meeting on Friday had decided to go ahead with the bandh on December 5 as planned earlier, and have set a November 30 deadline for the government to withdraw its decision to establish Maratha Development Corporation.Terming the bandh call ‘unnecessary,’ Yediyurappa had earlier too warned pro-Kannada groups against forcing a bandh on the people of the state.He had even clarified that the decision to set up a Maratha Development Corporation had nothing to do with the Marathi language, and it is for the Maratha community residing in the state. Noting that his government was making all honest efforts to provide justice to all the sections of the society, Yediyurappa on Saturday said, there is no room for discrimination. “Let them (Kannada groups/activists) understand this and withdraw their bandh. I request the activists for cooperation with folded hands,” he added. Kannada activists have been opposing the creation of Maratha Development Corporation, ever since the government mooted the move earlier this month. It has now been approved by the cabinet also. The government had earlier announced the setting up of the Maratha Development Authority, but subsequently changed it to corporation, as authority has to be constituted by a law, by passing an act in the legislature. The creation of the corporation is seen as a move by the BJP to woo the Maratha community that has considerable presence in the Basavakalyan assembly constituency also Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency, which is due for a bypoll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-cm-warns-pro-kannada-groups-against-imposing-statewide-bandh-against-maratha-corporation/story-SXfVgcaMu3Q2VnMXOwhFGP.html

21-11-2020||Pune||1.35 lakh properties registered in state during Diwali drawing in revenue of Rs 879 crore||The Inspector General of Registration and Stamps has, during a 15-day period prior to, and leading into Diwali, registered 1.35 lakh property documents, with a revenue of Rs 879 crore for the state exchequer.Till November 18, a total of Rs9,102 crore in revenue was generated. On Wednesday, November 18, alone, 7,500 documents were registered and a revenue of Rs 41 crore collected. Last year, the IGR office was shut on the occasion of Diwali.IGR Omprakash Deshmukh said, “We had kept registration offices open during Dusshera and Diwali. The festive season has seen a good response from property buyers which reflects the changing sentiments of buyers. It is a positive development.”According to the Confederation of Real Estate Developers of India (Credai), during the Covid lockdown period, March to July, there was a decline in the sale of properties and registration was at its lowest. As per Credai, property registrations have gone up by 36 per cent in September-November, when compared with registration in the corresponding months of 2019. Credai maintains that 2.73 lakh documents were registered in November alone, with 1.21 lakh documents registered in the first 13 days of the month.Credai state president Rajeev Parikh said that the state government’s decision to bring down stamp duty rates had a positive impact on the real estate market.“There is a significant increase in the number of property buyers across the state due to reduction in stamp duty and also a number of concessions granted by real estate developers to the buyers during the festive month. These buyers had halted their decision to purchase properties due to Covid-19, but have now gone ahead with their buying,” Parikh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-35-lakh-property-documents-registered-during-diwali-drawing-in-revenue-of-rs-879-crore/story-8u2qDtAclSgbVohQ0jtLGP.html
21-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers to lift rail blockade completely from Monday||Punjab farmers will completely lift their nearly two-month-long rail blockade against the Centre’s new agriculture laws from Monday to allow goods and passenger trains to ply in the state. The announcement came after chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh invited leaders of all 31 farmer unions to Chandigarh for talks to break the deadlock over resuming train services in Punjab, the CM’s media adviser Raveen Thukral tweeted. “The decision was taken in response to the impassioned appeal by the chief minister at a meeting with kisan (farmer) unions,” he said. “The kisan unions will allow the resumption of all trains from day after tomorrow (Monday) evening. There will be no hampering of operations for 15 days during which the central government should open talks. If talks don’t happen in a fortnight then the agitation will resume after 15 days,” the government spokesman said. Capt Amarinder had also urged the Centre to support his government in creating a congenial environment for ending the agitation, which had grave repercussions for the state and the nation. Punjab farmers’ bodies on Wednesday had said that they would consider allowing passenger trains to run in the state if the Centre starts running the goods trains first. However, the railways had refused, saying it would either operate both freight and passenger trains or none. The suspension of goods trains has hit the supplies of fertilisers for the agriculture sector and coal for thermal power plants, besides adversely affecting the industry. Farmers, who are protesting against the three farm laws, have said that they will reach Delhi through five highways connecting the national capital on November 26 as part of their Delhi Chalo call. Farmers have expressed fears that the new laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of corporates. They have been demanding that the laws be repealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-farmers-to-lift-rail-blockade-completely-from-monday/story-alkFGBZj9JBZtyVbZ8ryHI.html

21-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC says false allegation of impotence against spouse amounts to cruelty||Levelling false allegation of impotence against a spouse amounts to cruelty, the Delhi High Court has held while upholding the divorce granted to a man, whose estranged wife had claimed that he was incapable of sexual intercourse.The high court agreed with the submission of the husband’s counsel that the allegations levelled in the written statement filed by the wife were “grave and serious”, and likely to impact the man’s self-image and adversely affect his mental wellbeing.“Thus, having regard to the law on the subject, we find no infirmity in the findings and observations of the trial court that the allegation of the appellant (wife) in the written statement with respect to the impotency clearly falls within the concept of cruelty as defined under law,” a bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Sanjeev Narula said.The high court’s verdict came while dismissing the woman’s appeal against a trial court order granting the husband’s petition for grant of divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act.The estranged couple had got married in June 2012 here. While it was a first marriage for the woman, the man was a divorcee then.In the plea, the man had sought to declare the marriage null and void on the ground that it could not be consummated due to the woman’s alleged impotency and that his consent was obtained by concealing several material facts related to her psychological disposition. Had he known them, he would not have consented for the marriage, it said.The woman, in her response, in turn alleged that the man was suffering from impotency (erectile dysfunction) which was the true cause of non-consummation of marriage, his parents were quarrelsome, they demanded dowry and she was cruelly treated and even badly thrashed by the man in front of his parents.Before the high court, the woman sought to set aside the trial court’s order granting divorce decree and also prayed for restitution of conjugal rights, saying she was willing to save matrimonial alliance.The high court said the woman’s allegation was rejected by the trial court on the basis of the testimony of an expert witness who after physically examining the man had found that he was normal with no problem of impotence.It said mental cruelty is primarily contextual, pertaining to human behaviour or conduct with respect to matrimonial duties and obligations and it is essential to see whether the conduct of the party is of such a nature, that a reasonable person would neither tolerate the same, nor be reasonably expected to live with the other party.The high court noted that the woman had been reinforcing the allegation of impotency throughout the litigation and these false accusations which could not be proved are bound to cause deep hurt and anguish to the man, who can reasonably apprehend that it would be perilous for him to live with her.“It is also abundantly clear that due to the mental pain, agony and suffering caused by the false accusations, the respondent (man) cannot be asked to put up with the conduct of the appellant (woman) and to continue to live with her,” the high court said, adding there was an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.It also said that no party can be excused of recklessness in allegations made before the court of law and the consequences of false assertions have to follow.Allowing a person to get away with the consequences of false allegations, or treating them as trivial, would not advance the cause of justice, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-says-false-allegation-of-impotence-against-spouse-amounts-to-cruelty/story-8Y1fpoE0S4aClJKYTPpKCL.html

Similarly, several such developmental works are undertaken across the state by the MVA,” said Aaditya Thackeray. Slamming the opposition party on developmental works he said, “Politics is a part of everything. Politics, for us, is only during the elections after which we focus on work. Other parties continue doing politics throughout.” While Shiv Sena MP Shrikant Shinde has been taking all the credits for the work of the Patripool bridge through his social media handles, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have been slamming the state government and Shinde for delaying the project. Also read: ‘Desist from policy of supporting terror’ - India slams Pak over JeM attackIn March 2020, BJP party workers had staged a protest targeting the Shiv Sena for delaying the work. The 104-year-old Patripool bridge was dismantled on November 18, 2018, following which there has been a demand to build the new bridge as it affected the traffic movement in Kalyan-Dombivli. “It is a very big day for the entire Kalyan-Dombivli city as the launching of girder is carried out. When the bridge was dismantled two years back it was done in emergency considering the safety of the commuters as it was declared dangerous,” said Shinde. “The planning and procedure for the new bridge was initiated after the bridge was dismantled. This took time as we had to plan from the beginning and also redesign the plan due to the hurdles caused by a gutter. We had to get permissions from the railways and local body. After that, the lockdown affected the work as workers were not available. However, we managed to speed up the work and now it is in its final stage,” added Shinde. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) MLA Raju Patil, who reached the spot, was not allowed by the police. “I reached the spot to have a look at the girder launching work. Police thought we arrived for a protest at the site. They were doing their duty for law and order. I wanted to meet the civic commissioner. If we are protesting, we intimate about it in advance.”The launch work of the 76-meter-long girder will continue tomorrow. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) has claimed to make the new two-lane bridge ready by December end for the commuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aaditya-thackeray-slams-opposition-says-parties-indulge-in-politics-we-focus-on-work/story-jkpCpT39vMU9x9XQ36S3ON.html

It added it will also be contrary to the Indian Contract Act, under which free consent of the parties is a must for a valid contract.“It cannot be overlooked that lack of valid arbitration agreement is one of the basic grounds for setting aside an arbitral award,” said the bench. “Thus, to foist an arbitration agreement on a party is nothing short of imposing an illegality.”MEP RGSL Toll Bridge Private Limited and Raima Toll and Infrastructure Private Limited had moved the court after MSRDC rejected their proposal for referring to arbitration the latter’s demand for additional revenue from the toll collected.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who represented the petitioners, cited a clause in their toll collection contracts with MSRDC and said it is akin to an “arbitration clause”. He added it was required to be read as a clause providing for arbitration in case of a dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-says-parties-to-dispute-cannot-be-forced-to-arbitrate/story-zyybG6OADj1DFeBToHdPMP.html

Will the government take a firm stand after holding talks with teachers, parents, officials and representatives of school staff. Students are scared over the chaos at the state level,” he told reporters.Shelar said students are suffering due to the state government’s decision on conducting examinations and also due to delay in declaring results of various examinations.“There is still no clue about admissions for various courses.

21-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi markets stay open: Shopkeepers geared up to take precautions, shoppers support||Due to the concern in rising cases of Covid-19 in Delhi, there were thoughts to shut the hotspot markets, to limit the crowds. But, in a recent statement released by Delhi Government, it has been decided that anyone found not wearing a mask in the market will be provided one, free of cost by the market associations. Shopkeepers have also been advised to keep handy, spare masks and hand sanitisers for shoppers. Those shopkeepers who were worried about facing more losses if the lockdown is implemented, have heaved a sigh of relief. Amit Gupta, a wholesale shopkeepers in Old Delhi’s Sadar Bazaar, says, “During the festive season, 50% customers were seen in markets without masks in Old-Delhi, they were carrying masks but were too careless to wear them. I remember I told most of them to wear them and then enter in my shop and they all obliged. So, I feel asking shopkeepers to give masks is a good idea, kam se kam market shutdown to nahi hogi... We have dealt with huge losses already.”Since the talk of markets getting shut down again has been in news, those in market associations have also been contemplating how to evade the situation, while making shopping a safe experience. Sanjeev Mehta, president, Khan Market Traders Association, says, “In Khan Market, we have hardly seen anyone without a mask, so making more masks available is indeed a good step. But in a complex such as Khan Market, it wouldn’t make much difference. However, we will provide extra masks and sanitisers to the shopkeepers as well as visitors.”But since the cases of Covid-19 are increasing rapidly, shopaholics who love to frequent markets are divided on whether not shutting down markets is a good move at this point in time. Kriti Khurana, a college student pursuing CA, says, “If you see the number of cases as compared to the number of beds available for the treatment even in extreme cases, one would get to know the huge difference and the need to take precautionary measures as soon as possible. I don’t support any sort of lockdown. But what is needed is absolute willingness from every Delhiite to take precautions and follow guidelines without the fear of any penalty!” “Yahan sab aaise ghum rahe hain jaise har medical shop pe vaccine available ho Covid-19 ki,” Akshit Taneja, a software engineer, adding, “Markets of hotspots should have been closed in the festive season, not now when the shopkeepers are trying to make their ends meet. And shopkeepers are offering to be alert and keep extra sanitisers, so what is needed is sincerity of shoppers to abide by the need of the hour and take all necessary precautions. Why even step out of the house without a mask, leave apart visiting a market?” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-markets-stay-open-shopkeepers-geared-up-to-take-precautions-shoppers-support/story-Iy1QkienfmQEFsjX12P3CJ.html

According to the list, the centre provides the time slots for counselling,” said the centre’s in charge, Dr Neelam Andhrade.“Though there is no scientific evidence available, we have seen that patients who talk regularly on phone with their relatives recover faster. In fact, the recovery rate is higher among older patients.”The BMC is planning to start similar telephonic counselling at other centres. “We are getting quite a good response from the centre. So, we are in talks to start the facility at other centres also. We have also ordered smart electronic pads for patients. We have allocated a budget worth Rs 9 crore for the procurement process,” said BMC’s additional commissioner Suresh Kakani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-starts-counselling-of-covid-19-patients/story-3w4DIKapCajJ1Mzhp8Gc7M.html

Ashutosh Singh, divisional forest officer (DFO) Badrinath said one Maheshi Devi, along with her husband, in Vadhuk village had gone to a nearby forest for cutting grass for cattle fodder when a bear attacked them. “The husband climbed a tree and saved himself from the bear attack but the wife was mauled by the bear,” he said. Singh said after the required formalities are completed, the kin of the deceased woman would be given compensation. Singh said the woman died on the spot. “With the onset of winters, bear attacks increase as bears come down from snowy higher reaches in search of food. This is one of the main causes of the surge in man-bear conflict here in winter months,” he said. This is not the first incident of a bear attack in the state over the last one year or so. Also read: Winter arrives early in north as mercury dipsIn the first week of September, a 48-year-old man was killed by a bear in Pithoragarh district. The victim was a labourer working on a road project on Munsiyari-Milam road stretch. In May, a fire watcher of the forest department was attacked and severely injured by a bear in Khatna area of US Nagar while he was out on patrol. In February, Jagdish Singh, a resident of Nanakmatta area in US Nagar, had gone to a nearby forest to fetch fodder when he was attacked by a bear. In a similar incident, also in Nanakmatta, in January, Balwant Singh, a farmer, suffered grievous injuries in a bear attack in the Hanspur Khatta forest area. The Himalayan black bears can be found in and around Himalayan meadows at an elevation of 10,000 to 12,000 feet. They come down to 5,000-6000 feet in the winter months in search of food. The Himalayan black bear has been listed as a vulnerable species under the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/woman-killed-by-himalayan-black-bear-in-uttarakhand-husband-escapes-by-climbing-tree/story-rMfi2azNx2rAI0681ggJvJ.html
21-11-2020||Jaipur||Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, Gehlot asks private hospitals to increase beds||Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday asked private hospitals to increase capacity to admit Covid-19 patients as the average daily increase in coronavirus cases in the state in the past fortnight has been highest since the outbreak of the pandemic in March this year. The Centre had already sent a team of experts to help the state bring the increase under control, official data showed.On Friday, Rajasthan reported 8.36 percent increase (2,762 new cases) in Covid-19 cases taking the total number to 2,37,669. Since November 1, Rajasthan has reported around 40,000 new Covid-19 cases, which is about one-sixth of the total cases reported in the state since March 25. The number of active cases has also crossed the 20,000-mark for the first time in this pandemic, officials said.Most number of cases have been reported from Jaipur (41,547), followed by Jodhpur (35,159), Alwar (17,809), Bikaner (17,272), Kota (13,146), and Ajmer (12,531). Amid the pandemic, the state has also reported 2,130 Covid-19 deaths. State medical and health secretary Siddharth Mahajan said Covid-19 death rate in the state was 0.91 percent which was less than the national average of about 1.5 percent.Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent of Rajasthan University of Health Sciences, biggest Covid-19 government hospital in the state, said the reason of sudden spike in cases is the change in weather, decrease in temperature and community spread. “The next two months – December and January - will witness an increase in cases and then it will start coming down,” he said.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine - Bharat Biotech trials, Pfizer’s emergency use applicationSingh said the government is increasing Covid-19 health facilities with over 1,200 beds reserved for Covid-19 patients. However, he admitted that many hospitals were facing a shortage of beds because of the sudden increase in patients. “We are working to improve bed capacity in government hospitals,” he said.In a statement, chief minister Gehlot said that the private hospitals have been asked to increase beds for Covid-19 patients and provide treatment as per the guidelines and at the rates prescribed by the state government.Interacting with the representatives of private hospitals on Friday, CM Gehlot said the cases were increasing due to reasons such as dip in daily temperature and public rush during the festive season.“In view of this, it is necessary to increase the oxygen availability and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. The state government is continuously expanding medical facilities in state hospitals. Private hospitals should also increase the number of beds ensuring that not a single patient is denied treatment,” the government said in a statement quoting the CM.To control spread of the infection in rural areas, the government said oxygen reading meters have been provided to Anganwadi workers to check oxygen level of those showing Covid-19 symptoms and now they would be provided to Asha workers as well. The CM also asked people in rural areas to take the diseases seriously as about 27 percent of the total deaths accounted from the villages.On Friday, the Central government sent an expert panel headed by Dr V K Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, to Rajasthan for assessing the ground situation and for holding discussions with the state health department officials. The team is also expected to visit districts from where the maximum number of fresh cases are being reported, said a health ministry statement.The Rajasthan government officials have ruled out imposition of a lockdown even though night curfew may be imposed in certain places, officials said. “District magistrates have been empowered to take measures to control the spread of Covid,” a senior Rajasthan government official said.Raman Sharma, senior professor, department of medicine, Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital, said it was the first winter of the Covid-19 pandemic and one would have to see how the virus behaves. “So far, we have seen that more patients are coming and the intensity of the virus load is also high. Therefore, in most hospitals the beds are full and we are making effort to provide medical help to the patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-gehlot-asks-private-hospitals-to-increase-beds/story-1NbLLOURO1aB87ZcW9jLFN.html

The corporation had recently sought a grant of ₹27 crore from the UT administration to run its day-to-day affairs and pay the wages to the staff.Notably, CITCO is yet to get ₹10 crore pending dues from the UT administration on account of expenses incurred for running the UT guest house in New Delhi and UT Secretariat canteen in Chandigarh.The UT’s plans to privatise the three CITCO hotels have also failed to materialise with the administration fearing no takers would come forward during the current economic slowdown. The administration has currently put on hold the selling of these hotels even though the privatisation of the UT electricity department is at an advanced stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/generate-own-revenue-to-pay-staff-citco-writes-to-three-chandigarh-hotels/story-wAm2KEj7WmRWue8and9n8M.html
21-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Waterlogging in Sector 33 underpass makes it inaccessible, raises stink||After the recent spell of rain in the city, the underpass connecting the Terraced Gardens in Sector 33 has become waterlogged, with water stagnating here for days and raising a stink.The underpass that was inaugurated in January 2019 was constructed at a cost of ₹80 lakh for pedestrians to directly access one park from the other. Earlier, they had to climb the stairs and cross the road, which was more dangerous; a fatal accident had also occurred here. But owing to the present condition of the underpass, residents are being forced to do the same. General secretary of the Sector 33B resident welfare association (RWA) Kuljinder Singh Sra said, “Residents of Sector 33 have stopped using this underpass for the last few months now. Due to leakage from some pipes or some other reason, even during dry weather stagnant water remains present. Whenever we complain to the municipal corporation (MC) workers maintaining the parks, they ask us to register a formal complaint.”President of the Sector 33A RWA, Jagdish Singh Sarpal, said, “This problem existed even last year. The area isn’t lit at night and the underpass has become a hotspot for anti-social elements to congregate after nightfall. Most senior citizens have stopped coming to this side of the park.” He added that the police should post some personnel there especially during the evenings to ensure safety of the residents.Local area councillor Rajesh Kumar Gupta said, “There seems to be a problem with the level inside the underpass since the area doesn’t get drained on its own. I will speak to the MC officials about this and ask them to install a road gully inside to fix the problem.”Taking stock of the situation, chief engineer of the MC Shailendra SIngh said, “We will get the area checked. For the underpass, after rainfall a motor is needed to clear out the accumulated water, and we will ensure that work gets done soon.”The officials of the horticulture wing of the MC added that they hadn’t received any complaint on the issue, but will get it checked regardless.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-waterlogging-in-sector-33-underpass-makes-it-inaccessible-raises-stink/story-AFvwIErMzk16KAeJLSkveP.html

21-11-2020||Chandigarh||Positivity rate among voluntary Covid tests 3% in Chandigarh||The Covid-19 positivity rate among random and/or voluntary tests conducted in Chandigarh’s containment zones, markets areas and among high-risk groups, in the span of the last 45 days, has come out to be around 3%, official data reveals.The UT health department had last month constituted five teams under its associated hospitals to conduct voluntary testing across the city.Most of the tests were conducted through the rapid antigen method, while the people exhibiting symptoms were tested through the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique (RT-PCR).Till November 19, the mobile testing teams conducted 10,645 tests out of which 312 were found to be infected.Dr VK Nagpal, joint director of the UT health department, said that the majority of those found positive were not exhibiting any symptoms and such an exercise was helpful to contain the spread. “This also gives an idea of the asymptomatic population that has been infected and we have been able to isolate a good number of people this way,” he added.Overall positivity rate in UT 12.6%Since the start of the pandemic in March till late September, the focus of the UT administration was on testing of close contacts of positive persons and those exhibiting major symptoms or persons with travel history. After the surge in cases in September, however, the strategy was modified to make testing more accessible in dispensaries around the city.UT has conducted a total of 1,30,070 tests out of which 16,472 were found to be positive, suggesting an overall positivity rate of 12.6%.For this month, the UT health department has said that the target is to test around 35,000 persons, against the 29,000 tests conducted in October. Dr Amandeep Kang, director UT health department, said, “Even though the number of tests decreased during the festive days, we are expecting it to increase to 4,000-5,000 during this month. The proportion of RT-PCR tests is being maintained above 30% of the total tests conducted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/positivity-rate-among-voluntary-covid-tests-3-in-chandigarh/story-s6CBOd4YwjuSLvUdCnOSFO.html

This will provide better connectivity to Chandigarh and the upcoming Punjab Cricket Stadium (PCA) in New Chandigarh, which is expected to host domestic and international matches by September next year.A senior GMADA officer said they were working on a detailed project report (DPR) and hoping to complete the project by October next year. “Three bridges will be constructed on the existing causeways, with the project estimated to cost Rs 100 crore,” he said.As part of the upgrade, the road will also be equipped with trunk storm lines for developers in New Chandigarh.“This road will help with better connectivity between Chandigarh and Punjab, and with the PCA stadium soon to be operational, there is a need for an alternative route to handle the traffic pressure,” said Taraninder Singh, president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), Mullanpur. Currently, commuters have to go through Sarangpur via Madhya Marg to reach New Chandigarh. The 1.2km road via Dakshin Marg will shorten the distance between Chandigarh and Kurali by connecting National Highway 21 and Sector 39 through Kurali.The road will also connect directly to the new international cricket stadium coming up in New Chandigarh. Being constructed by the Mohali Cricket Association, the stadium is nearing completion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gmada-upgrading-togan-road-in-mullanpur-to-six-lanes/story-J3j9eMmueCLUgfxAK1axMM.html

21-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Rush for NCR venues after wedding cap||Deepak Sharma (48), a bakery shop owner in Najafgarh, made frantic calls to relatives to look for a new venue for his son’s wedding, scheduled on November 25, after Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal approved the government’s proposal to restrict the number of guests at marriage-related events to 50 amid a spike in Covid-19  cases.Sharma had booked a resort in Mundka for the wedding. “With the help of our relatives, we found another resort in Ballabhgarh, Faridabad. Now, we are busy informing all our relatives about the change of venue and making arrangements for transportation. There is complete panic and chaos instead of fun,” said Sharma. Like Sharma, many people are now looking for alternative venues in places such as Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat etc. Tent houses, banquets and hotels claim that they are bombarded with cancellation calls or asking for refund.Nitin Gulati, owner of Gulati tent house, said that he has got nine cancellations in two days. “We had erected the tents for a capacity of 200 people. Now, our clients are looking for venues in neighbouring areas,” said Gulati.He added, “This year has been disastrous for us. After no work for 7-8 months due to Covid-19, we were looking forward to the wedding season to stay afloat. We had called labour from Bengali and UP. Now, I don’t know how to pay them, as clients are asking for a refund,” said Gulati.Also Read: 6,608 new Covid-19 cases in Delhi, positivity rate drops to 10.59%Vikaas Gutgutia, managing director and founder, Ferns N Petals said, “For the Indian wedding industry, recovery was on the cards, but businesses will again come to a standstill, as we are facing the brunt of Diwali crowds at markets. We have been getting calls from clients who had opted for a venue in Delhi, to enquire, if the functions can be organised at our venues in the NCR. In the coming days, all our 11 wedding venues are booked to host 10-12 weddings each but we are now anticipating changes or delays.”Associations of banquets, tent houses and hotels are still trying to approach the Delhi government and the L-G to reconsider the decision. Ramesh Dang, president of Community Welfare Banquet Association Delhi, said, “We have written to the CM to reconsider the decision, as it will result in a collapse of the sector. People are now opting for neighbouring areas in UP and Haryana. We have 1 million families associated with us. It will lead to unemployment,” said Dang.Struggling to retain their clients, hotels and banquets are trying to offer them different options. Greesh Bindra, vice president, operations, at Suryaa hotel, said, “We are getting a lot of calls from clients who are asking for refund. We have 4-5 venues, including big outdoor spaces at our hotels. We are suggesting different options such as holding events at two different venues or holding multiple events so that the guests can be divided. We have suggested that some guests come for lunch while others for dinner.”“This atmosphere of uncertainty will impact the next wedding season,” said Bindra.Calling the restriction unjustified, Pankaj Shokeen, general secretary, Delhi tent owners’ federation, said, “The cinema halls are allowed to operate at 50% capacity. Buses are running full capacity. Markets are crowded. But the restriction is just for weddings. Why? There is no logic in the decision.”The Delhi government did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-rush-for-ncr-venues-after-wedding-cap/story-8YFFUA5wpYVIrhwM8gKiuM.html
21-11-2020||Chandigarh||CBI being exploited for politics, won’t allow it to enter Punjab without permission: Capt Amarinder||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday cited the CBI’s “poor track record” in the 2015 Bargari sacrilege case to announce that his government will not allow the Central Bureau of Investigation into his state without permission. Pointing out that eight states, including Punjab, had withdrawn permission to the agency to enter without permission, the chief minister said the agency was being increasingly used to play politics, and a fair probe could not be ensured through it. Dismissing the BJP as a non-entity in Punjab politics, the chief minister told a TV channel that the party was welcome to contest all 117 Vidhan Sabha seats in the state though it would not be able to win a single one without an alliance partner. The Congress had, in fact, no challenge in Punjab, with even the Akalis and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) posing no threat, he said, adding that neither of these parties had ever talked about anything positive in the interest of the state. With elections in the state still over a year away, it was not possible to say which issue will dominate the polls, he said, expressing the hope that the BJP will resolve the farmers’ grievances soon. “Farmers want MSP to remain and the Government of India should take steps to ensure that,” he said. The chief minister reiterated that corporates were welcome to buy foodgrains in Punjab as long as they followed the marketing system, built on ties between farmers and arhtiyas (commission agents). SAYS DISSENT IN CONGRESS SIGN OF INTERNAL DEMOCRACY Terming the dissent in the Congress a sign of internal democracy in the party, Capt Amarinder pointed out that those who had written to the party high command had been included in key committees constituted by party chief Sonia Gandhi. On the issue of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) elections, the chief minister said that he had been demanding those for long but the Akalis did not want polls to the body, which they had been using for their own political gains. Welcoming the ongoing joint Indian naval exercises with other countries, Captain Amarinder said China and Pakistan will not succeed in their nefarious designs against India. Punjab wants peace and development and will not allow Pakistan to foment trouble at any cost, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cbi-being-exploited-for-politics-won-t-allow-it-to-enter-punjab-without-permission-capt-amarinder/story-i7Zx5hvWnFDV1PhnDvttrO.html

21-11-2020||Jaipur||‘Love Jihad’ a term created by BJP to divide nation: Gehlot||Love jihad is a word manufactured by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to divide the nation and disturb its communal harmony, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said on Friday, remarks that came in the backdrop of some BJP-ruled states signalling that they are considering laws to regulate interfaith marriages between Hindu women and Muslim men. Gehlot stressed that “Jihad has no place in Love”, pointed out that marriage is a matter of personal liberty and asserted that laws to curb it “is completely unconstitutional & it will not stand in any court of law”.“They (BJP) are creating an environment in the nation where consenting adults would be at the mercy of state power. Marriage is a personal decision & they are putting curbs on it, which is like snatching away personal liberty,” the senior Congress leader tweeted.“It seems a ploy to disrupt communal harmony, fuel social conflict & disregard constitutional provisions like the state not discriminating against citizens on any ground,” he said in another tweet.His remarks drew a sharp reaction by BJP leader and Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who said the BJP believes in development for all and alleged that hatred is the Congress’s “prerogative”.“Dear Ashok ji, Love Jihad is a trap that has thousands of young women believing the marriage is a personal affair, where later it turns out it isn’t. Also, if it is a matter of personal liberty, then why are the women not free to keep their maiden name or religion?Also Read| ‘Ignoring the suffering of our daughters’: BJP’s Poonia slams Gehlot over ‘Love Jihad’ tweets“Why are families of girls too forced to accept the other religion? Isn’t religion a matter of personal liberty? Ashok ji, Since Congress wants to support this act of deceit under the garb of personal liberty, isn’t it becomes a blatant display of its communal agenda.“Ashok ji, manufacturing terms, riots and hatred is a Congress prerogative. The BJP has believed in Sabka Vikas hence will ensure our women folk are not subject to injustice of any kind,” Shekhawat said in three tweets.Jaipur-based political analyst Narayan Bareth said that the timing of Gehlot’s remarks shows his importance. “Gehlot, being a prominent leader of the Congress, would have understood the need to speak on the issue as it was getting traction and could not be left unaddressed. His comments, coming at a time when the Congress leadership is busy handling infighting after electoral debacle in Bihar, have shown Gehlot’s growing political stature,” Bareth said. On Tuesday, the BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh government said a bill —with a provision of five years in jail for forced conversions for marriage — will be passed in the next session of the state assembly to check “love jihad”, which Hindu activists describe as an organised conspiracy of Muslim men to trick Hindu women into marriages and effect a demographic change. Later on the same day, the Haryana government signalled its intention to constitute a committee of officials to study and draft a law to that effect. Earlier, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka — all ruled by the BJP — have also promised to bring legislation to end love jihad. Despite the political mobilisation, experts say that the charges of love jihad are bogus and that adult men and women are free to convert under the constitutional right to freedom of religion. In February, the central government told Parliament that there was no definition of the term and no such cases were reported by agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/love-jihad-a-term-created-by-bjp-to-divide-nation-gehlot/story-sUXFQ8baYIFvGor8MTZuyK.html
21-11-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh districts under night curfew amid surge in Covid cases||The Madhya Pradesh government on Friday decided to impose night curfew in five districts, including Covid-19 hotspot Bhopal, Indore and Gwalior, from Saturday as the state reported 1,500 cases on Friday – the highest for the state in the past 40 days. The government also decided to close schools upto class VIII till December 31.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said: “The night curfew will be observed from 10 pm to 6 am in the five worst-affected districts - Bhopal, Ratlam, Vidisha, Indore and Gwalior from Saturday. The night curfew will not be applicable to the transportation of goods and night shifts of factories.” “There is no plan of imposing a lockdown in the state but schools from class 1 to 8 will remain closed till December 31,” he said. The CM said complete lockdown was not a solution and there was a need to create more awareness.It may be recalled that the union home ministry has prohibited states from imposing complete lockdown without its permission.“The district administrations have been asked to ensure implementation of Covid-19 guidelines and also asked people to use mask and sanitiser,” the CM said.The decision was taken at a meeting to review the rise in Covid-19 cases in the state, in which a decision was taken to ask district Covid committees to submit suggestions to check spread of Covid by Saturday.According to official data, the Covid positivity rate in Madhya Pradesh on Friday doubled to 4.8% from the rate in November 5, which was about one percentage point higher than the national average. In MP, there are 10,402 active cases of Covid 19 even though the total cases reported so far were 1.76 lakh.A health department official, privy to the data, said most number of cases were being reported from Bhopal and Indore, which had witnessed first wave of Covid-19 in May and June. In the past 24 hours, the highest 387 cases have been reported from Bhopal followed by Indore with 313 cases. In wake of spike in Covid cases, the central government on Friday decided to send a team of experts to the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-districts-under-night-curfew-amid-surge-in-covid-cases/story-C0ARUFopSDMUEYyqS9n63H.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra govt mulls halting flights, trains from Delhi||The Maharashtra government is considering halting flight and train services from Delhi to Mumbai and other cities in the state due to the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in the national Capital, which is under its third wave of infections, officials said, adding that the final decision is yet to be taken.Government officials, however, concede that such a move is unlikely due to the Centre’s latest “unlock” guidelines, issued on September 30, which stated that inter-state movement cannot be restricted. Maharashtra would also need the central government’s approval for such a move. “We have been constantly reviewing the situation. In the wake of the high surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, we need to take precautionary measures to ensure that Maharashtra is not affected. There are very limited train and flight services currently operating between Delhi, and Mumbai and other Maharashtra cities. The decision to either curtail the number of services or stop them entirely will be taken in due course,” Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said. The jump in the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi was discussed in a meeting convened by Kumar to discuss the pandemic situation in the state earlier this week. Maharashtra is the country’s worst affected state from the pandemic, recording over 1.7 million Covid-19 cases and over 46,000 deaths.Also Read: 6,608 new Covid-19 cases in Delhi, positivity rate drops to 10.59%Officials from Maharashtra government said it would be difficult for the government to entirely ban the flight services due to the pressure from the central government. “Central government does not concede to our proposal of entirely banning the flights between Mumbai and Delhi, which is the busiest route in the country. Even when we tried to push the resumption of the flight services by a few weeks in May, Centre was bent on starting it. In such a scenario, we will have to go for stricter screening at the airports if we are not allowed to completely stop the operations,” said an official requesting anonymity. The official added: “The policy over the operations of the flights will have to be uniform for the state and it cannot be only for Mumbai. The final decision is expected after a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.”Out of the 150 flights operated from Mumbai airport daily, most fly between the two cities. Another limited number of flights operate between Delhi and other cities such as Nagpur, Aurangabad, Pune and Nashik. AVIATION MINISTRY/MHA RESPONSE Another official said on the condition of anonymity that the trains not only originating from Delhi, but also passing through the capital city, will have to be stopped if Maharashtra wanted to stop people coming to the state from Delhi, a task that would not only be monumental but also one that could halt travel from many other states in north India.The Railway Ministry on Friday said that no such decision has been taken by the ministry regarding cancellation of trains on the Mumbai-Delhi route. “There have been reports in section of media today about cancellation of certain trains on Delhi-Mumbai sector. It may be clarified that Railways has not taken any decision regarding cancellation of trains on Mumbai Delhi sector.” tweeted the Ministry of Railways.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“The decision will be taken by the railway ministry on the operation of trains between both the cities but the Maharashtra government can propose on cancellation.

There are currently five trains operating daily between Mumbai and Delhi, and another ten that are routed through Delhi to other states from/to Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-maharashtra-govt-mulls-halting-flights-trains-from-delhi/story-Iypag4ARFa02TrHKH3c6fI.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Khan Market’s most enduring chai||It pays off to head to Khan Market on a full stomach. This way, you don’t have to pay the high price of eating there. In the Capital’s most upscale shopping enclave, cafes and restaurants are as super-expensive as the rest of the market. Consider the humble chai. A famous Khan Market cafe used to charge ₹155 (plus taxes) for one cup. The place shut down following the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, but if you insist, there still are places here to burn your cash for tea. Or, alternatively, you can have an equally tasty but far cheaper chai from JP. Unlike many Khan Market destinations that keep appearing and disappearing with puzzling regularity, JP’s chai is an institution. It has remained in business for 35 long years. Started by late Rama Nandan, it is now run by his grandson. While his distant cousin Daya Shankar makes the chai, the aforementioned JP (Jai Prakash), serves it. With one arm holding the deliciously-chipped chai kettle and the other carrying a stack of paper glasses, JP can be seen throughout the day busily walking about the market lanes. His patrons include folks working as shop assistants in the fancy showrooms, as well their doormen and door women, and the showroom owners themselves.A native of Jaunpur, in UP, JP arrived in the city in 2002 to carry on his grandfather’s legacy while his father kept being a farmer in the city. “My wife and children live in the village,” says JP on being ambushed with queries during his rounds in the Middle Lane. JP, 39, turns out to be very friendly and polite, he speaks Hindi, and seems to be smiling as he talks, even though he’s wearing a mask. Watching him walk about the market is like seeing a man strolling inside his own home. “I live in Khan Market,” he says, freely giving out the address of the room he shares with his cousin.Daya Shankar and JP’s chai has the flavour of home, with a strong flavour of adrak (ginger). Some days it tends to be a tad too sweet, but this cold smoggy evening it is just perfect.But taste is not the only point of JP’s chai. It is also about the kick that one gets on dunking down this delicious offering for so cheap (₹10 only) in this unimaginably pricey destination. Sipping it is like partaking in a Khan Market secret, beyond the reach of the passing fashionable crowd. JP serves from 10am to 1pm, and from 3pm to 6pm. It’s easy to spot him in the lanes—just look out for the tea kettle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-khan-market-s-most-enduring-chai/story-eVtSQva9NzAOHLl7Y3x7IN.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||6,608 new Covid-19 cases in Delhi, positivity rate drops to 10.59%||The city on Friday reported 6,608 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), recording fewer than 7,000 cases in a day while conducting the regular 60,000 daily tests for the first time since early-November. The positivity rate — the number of samples that return positive among total tested — also dropped on Friday to 10.59%, the lowest since November. Experts see positivity rate as a crucial metric to assess an outbreak in a community and, when this number is coupled with an increase in new cases, it can determine how fast a contagious disease is spreading. The daily positivity rate had gone up to 15.3% on November 15, but has dropped regularly from that number in the days since. On Thursday, 62,425 tests were conducted, of which almost 38% were done using the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The test is known to detect more positive cases than the alternate rapid antigen test, which is less sensitive.“It appears that there are some good signs in the last 4-5 days. On November 15, the positivity rate was 15%. On November 17, this reduced to 13%. Today, it is 10.5%. In the last five days, the positivity rate reduced by five percentage points… It appears that the cases are reducing. We are keeping our fingers crossed...,” Kejriwal said at the 18th Hindustan Times Leadership Summit on Friday.Also Read| HTLS 2020: Delhi’s Covid fight didn’t start from zero, yet we have done well, says KejriwalDr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said she hoped the CM was right, but also urged caution. “We need to watch the numbers for at least a week. Once this wave is over, I think we will see sustained but fewer cases...” The number of deaths, however, remained high. On Friday, 118 deaths due to the viral infection were reported, the second-highest single-day toll in the city. The most deaths reported in a day was on November 11, when 131 fatalities were recorded.On Friday, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said most patients with Covid-19 in the city die 10 days after hospitalisation. “There are some deaths that still happen within three days of hospital admission, however most deaths happen after 10 days. If you see the proportion of deaths, it has remained the same at about 1.57%. This is almost comparable to the national average of 1.48%,” Jain said during a press briefing.The improvement in timely hospitalisation of Covid-19 patients was acknowledged by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul in a press briefing this week. Also Read: Delhi health minister ropes in Superman, Batman to fight Covid-19“Initially, when the pandemic had started – till about June – nearly 60 to 70% of the deaths in hospitals happened within the first 72 hours. Half of these deaths happened within the first 24-hours of admission. In Delhi, there has been a dramatic change since. We are still monitoring the mortality as it shows the efficiency of the system – mobilising patients from home, ambulance service, access to beds, and efficiency of the treatment,” Dr Paul had said. Meanwhile, the Delhi government have roped in Batman, Superman, and Flash in their fight against Covid-19, with the health minister posting pictures of the superheroes in masks on Facebook. The caption on the photographs read, “Heroes wear masks. Put on your mask and save lives. #BeAHero.” This comes as the Delhi government increased the fine for not wearing mask in public places from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/6-608-new-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-positivity-rate-drops-to-10-59/story-ZTVRANQuZB2lsQqS7x5JqK.html
21-11-2020||Chandigarh||Custodial rape allegations against Haryana cops: HC turns down plea for medical exam by external board||The Punjab and Haryana high court has turned down the plea for getting two cousins, who have levelled allegations of custodial rape by Haryana cops, examined by an external board. The high court was hearing a plea from a Sonepat woman seeking medical examination of her daughter and niece. The allegations are that one of the girls was gangraped by cops in custody and another sexually assaulted. The duo were booked in an FIR registered on June 30. The FIR was of murder of two cops in which one Amit was accused, who subsequently died and these two girls were arrested on July 3. The court observed that medical examination was conducted twice upon arrest, which specifically mentioned that no visible mark of injury was seen over the bodies and private parts of these two girls. Even the report submitted by the magistrate concerned reached the conclusion that the medical evidence with regard to the commission of rape is inconclusive at this stage, the bench said. “This shows that multiple times, medical examination of the victims were conducted, but there was total silence maintained by them, at every opportune time, to disclose about the occurrence so caused. Considering the very fact of the victims, having been medically examined multiple times, it will not be appropriate to further direct the constitution of a medical board for comprehensive examination of both the victims, more particularly, considering the duration of time having lapsed since then,” the court said, adding that moreover, a special investigation team led by a woman IPS officer is probing the matter. The court, however, directed the Karnal Central Jail superintendent and Karnal observation home in-charge to take appropriate steps for extending medical treatment to both the girls at PGIMER, Chandigarh. The allegations in the plea were that the girls had gone to meet Amit in Karnal, when two cops in inebriated state misbehaved with them, which led to a fight between cops and Amit, wherein the cops got injured. When the girls came to know about the murder of cops, they approached the police, but police booked them in the murder case of cops and eliminated Amit, the plea had alleged, adding that the girls were raped by 10-12 cops in custody. It was also alleged that family was not allowed to meet them. However, the court said that the record produced by the police revealed that nearly a dozen times, either family members or some lawyers had met these two girls since their arrest. In future, family members be allowed to meet them as per rules, the court directed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/custodial-rape-allegations-against-haryana-cops-hc-turns-down-plea-for-medical-exam-by-external-board/story-SXzHE84vVIeahM6svLr47O.html

The woman, whose husband works in Haryana Police department, had come to Fatehabad with her two sons two months ago. Preliminary probe suggested that the woman took the extreme step after having an argument with her husband, who had been “mounting pressure” on her to divorce him, investigators said. “My sister committed suicide when her parents and other family members went to a local market. She had been living with her parents ever since her second son was born. She came here after her husband started mounting pressure on her to get a divorce. He accused my sister of having an extramarital relation. Before her suicide, the couple had a heated exchange on phone. They had married four years ago,” he added.Fatehabad deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Subhash Chander said prima facie, it appeared that the couple had differences and often engaged in disputes. “The woman was staying with her parents for the last couple of months as her husband accused her of having an affair.

At popular locations such as Baland, Mandothi, Dubaldhan, Bhindawas Bird Sanctuary, Dighal, and Rewari’s Masani village, birders have spotted greylag goose, bar-headed goose, ruddy shelduck, tufted duck, eurasian teal, greater spotted eagle and many other species. The region usually witnesses migratory birds from across Kazakhstan, Iran, China, Mongolia, Nepal and Bhutan.Rakesh Ahlawat, a bird watcher from Dighal village, said the migratory birds have started arriving at various birding sites in the region.“Over 80 species of the birds have flown into Haryana from colder regions of Europe and Central Asia. At many places, less birds were spotted due to lesser rainfall in the month of August, but the number of migratory birds has been increasing with rise in winter. This time, we have seen dunlin and spotted crake, which has caused excitement among the bird watchers,” he added.He claimed that over 100 species of migratory birds visit the wetlands of Rohtak, Jhajjar and Rewari in the end of October and November, and stay till March.Shiv Singh, district wildlife officer, Rohtak, said every year, they witness a large number of migratory birds at the bird sites in the region from various corners of the world.“The process starts in the month of October and continues till February. This year, we found fewer birds at many sites, including at Dighal, due to less water in the wetland. The birds fly to Haryana due to favourable climatic conditions and availability of food. There are many species which have been flocking to the region for the past many years,” the wildlife officer added. He further said this year, they have witnessed a drop in number of winged guests arriving at the popular sites. Moreover, less number of people are visiting the bird sites due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“There is no impact of the virus on the migratory birds, but certainly on the visitors. We are accessing the data of birds visiting the sites,” Shiv Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bird-watchers-rejoice-as-winged-guests-fly-into-haryana/story-uPCYAl0mwNX6eHxHpMxJiK.html

The delay on part of Ghuman, who has already tendered resignation, in deciding on the inquiry reports related to the irregularities also created differences between the varsity administration and the state government which wanted the former to put its house in order before asking for more funds. While issuing a special grant of Rs 20 crore to the varsity on July 22, finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal had categorically asked the university to fix responsibility and submit a report on the alleged glaring financial irregularities. The minister had even directed the varsity to control its expenditure and adopt austerity measures. But no action was taken on 13 internal inquiry reports into allegations of corruption, nepotism and misuse of funds during the tenure of Jaspal Singh. Ghuman could not be reached for comments despite repeated calls and messages. The probe reports deal with purchase of fire extinguishers to the tune of₹80 lakh, faulty recruitment of 62 assistant professors; priority given to wait-listed candidates in teaching and non-teaching departments; hiring of outsourced employees, recruitment of teachers on fake scheduled caste/backward class certificates; purchase of paper and answer book cases at exorbitant rates; undue promotions; purchase of faulty software for distance education department and the examination branch; incorrect pay fixation and allowing service extension to retiring employees. Increased salary bill, dip in income As per the budgetary proposals for the current fiscal, the varsity expects an income of₹380 crore against an expenditure of ₹676 crore, leaving a massive Rs 296-crore deficit. The main reason behind increasing deficit is increase in the salary bill, which is Rs 425 crore against Rs 199.27 crore in 2010. On the other hand, the overall income of the university has decreased from Rs 445 crore in 2017 to Rs 344 in 2019-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/v-c-s-failure-to-act-on-anomalies-during-predecessor-s-tenure-led-to-mess-at-punjabi-university/story-bquSRHLvtbqDIyZfTNoQxO.html

The Delhi government recently sought tighter curbs on weddings in city and asked the Union government for approval to lock down market places if they were turning into hot spots.“It appears that there are some good signs in the last 4-5 days. On November 15, the positivity rate was 15%. On November 17, this reduced to 13%. Today, it is 10.5%. In the last five days, the positivity rate reduced by 5 percentage points… It appears that the cases are reducing. We are keeping our fingers crossed. I hope that if this trend continues, then maybe we – the people of Delhi and those from the central government and all organisations – I think we are crossing the third peak,” Kejriwal said at the 18th Hindustan Times Leadership Summit.Also Read: HTLS 2020: No VIP category should be created for Covid-19 vaccine, says KejriwalThe Delhi chief minister said that even after 8,593 daily cases recently, the Capital’s health care infrastructure did not collapse under the surge of infections, something that was noticed in several metropolises across the world, including New York City. “A total of 7,500 beds are vacant, and 450 ICU beds are vacant right now,” he said, praising the efforts of health care workers. “We will add 1,000-1,500 ICU beds in the next 1-2 days,” he added.Referring to the intensity of the third wave, the Delhi CM said that experts indicated the disease pattern was aggravated because of increased air pollution. He said the fundamentals of the “Delhi model” that his government devised to fight the pandemic a while back — testing, home isolation, public data, hospital beds, and plasma therapy — remained strong even today, and the current situation did not go out of control because of the robustness of this strategy.On Friday, the national capital recorded 6,608 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the infection tally to 517,238 , while 118 deaths in a day pushed the death toll to 8,159.Kejriwal also said that his government was in the process of creating a health information management system that will integrate and track hospitals and other such facilities across the Capital. “All Delhi government hospitals, mohalla clinics, poly clinics... all will be connected with each other. At the click of a button, you will know on the cloud… what all is available at which hospital. All citizens will be given e-cards and their medical history will be available on the cloud... I hope we will be able to implement it in a year.”The CM added that the system will begin only with Delhi government hospitals but the plan is to expand it. “It is a modular structure in which extra things can be plugged in subsequently. In one year, we will try to bring Delhi government hospitals on this. I would like private and central government hospitals to come on board subsequently. The entire health infrastructure of Delhi should be on this platform finally, but in Phase 1, it is going to be only Delhi government infrastructure.”He said that under the system, when a patient visits a health facility for the first time, their history will be fed in. The details will then keep getting updated with each visit. The CM added that the system, planned for two years, was brought into urgent focus because of the pandemic and the tendering process for it had been completed.Also Read| HTLS 2020: ‘Congress has collapsed as a national party’: Delhi CM Arvind KejriwalThe Delhi CM said that when the pandemic began early this year, several factors were beyond Delhi’s control, leading to the ballooning of Covid-19 cases. “We found out about the coronavirus in February and March... Indians wanted to return from countries ravaged by the disease at that point. By March 22, about 32,000 people returned and spread across Delhi. We asked DCs to identify them and isolate them but it wasn’t practically possible. Delhi didn’t start from zero, we started with several thousands.”When asked which aspect of the disease was the most challenging to tackle, he said the “rate of the spread of the infection”. “It spreads so fast. If you are not on your toes 24 hours a day, then your structure collapses.”He said the Delhi government’s decision to begin home isolation for mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic cases was a game-changer. “If all patients come to the hospitals, then we can’t manage. Without home isolation, there would have been no beds for serious patients,” he said.Kejriwal also said that the decision to implement a nationwide lockdown in March was a good move as it gave governments time to build infrastructure and acquire equipment. On the question of whether a lockdown could return in the Capital, he said: “A lockdown doesn’t end corona; it delays the infections. The day the lockdown ends, cases will rise.” He added that governments should clamp lockdowns only when facilities are overrun with infections, emphasising that it was essential to keep up economic activity even while fighting the pandemic.Also Watch: Covid: Delhi vs New York comparison by CM Kejriwal amid 3rd wave #HTLS2020 He defended the Covid-19 testing record of Delhi, saying that the government responded to the worsening situation swiftly. “August 16, when cases started rising [in the second wave], within a week we increased the number of tests. Even now, as the cases started growing, we started testing more.”Kejriwal said that the accuracy of rapid antigen tests was doubtful, but RT-PCR tests took much longer to return results. “Ideally, all tests should be RT-PCR,” he said. But the CM said the turnaround time in these tests was two days on average.The Centre recently announced that it will double the testing capacity in Delhi to 100,000-120,000 with a focus on increasing RT-PCR tests, deploy mobile testing labs and ramp up ICU beds.Kejriwal also said that the entire world was desperately waiting for a vaccine. “For vaccine delivery in India, the entire distribution plan will be made by the central government. But if they ask us for suggestions, there shouldn’t be ‘VIP and non-VIP’ culture...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/htls/htls-2020-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-hopes-3rd-wave-may-recede-if-trend-holds/story-QLaG4iqTGYnCDbXhEGXalO.html
21-11-2020||City||Will probe 261% rise in power bill arrears during BJP government: Maharashtra energy minister||The Maharashtra government will investigate the “unreasonable” rise in arrears of powers bills in the five years of the previous government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), state energy minister Nitin Raut said on Friday. In the cabinet meeting held on Thursday, the ministers were informed that the unrecovered power bill amount of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) has increased to Rs59,102 crore by October end. This means Rs36,992 crore was not recovered in the past five years, the officials said. “By the end of March 2014, the unrecovered amount of power bills in the state was Rs14,154 crore which increased to Rs51,146 crore by the end of March this year. This issue was discussed in the state cabinet meeting. Following the directives of the CM, we are going to investigate the matter,” Raut said. “The profit generated by the power company has reduced in the past five years. They (BJP) have made bogus claims that the financial position of MSEDCL has improved in the five years. Their credibility is in question now,” Raut said, taking on the Opposition party, which has declared to start a state-wide agitation against the state government for not providing relief to consumers from inflated power bills during the lockdown period of three months — April, May and June. Raut said he would be happy if the BJP could agitate against the Centre, which is not ready to provide funds worth Rs10,000 crore sought by the state energy department. “I have requested them to provide us Rs10,000 crore. They are yet to clear the state’s share of Rs28,000 crore in the Goods and Services Tax (GST). We are ready to provide relief to people if they (BJP) could bring back state’s money from the Centre,” he said. Meanwhile, the state BJP unit clarified that the amount of unpaid power bills increased because of surge in power consumption owing to drought. “Power consumption increased in the past four years as the state was reeling under drought. Consequently, the unrecovered amount of power bills also increased. But the then BJP government never cared about money and provided power to farmers according to their requirement. This is the reason why power consumption for agricultural activities increased by 60% in 2019,” said BJP spokesperson Vishwas Pathak, who is also former MSEDCL director. Meanwhile, during Thursday’s meeting, the cabinet also cleared a proposal of an amnesty scheme to encourage farmers to clear power bill arrears, as around power bills of agricultural pumps used by the farmers to irrigate farms amount to Rs41,000 crore. The energy minister had also said that the state has not shelved its plan to waive off the power bills up to 100 units to poor families and those living below the poverty line (BPL). He further said that the panel formed to give its recommendation on waiving off power bills up to 100 units could not meet due to the pandemic. “We will ask the study group to submit its report to the state government. This move (to waive off bills up to 100 units) is likely to bring a financial burden of Rs6,000 crore on the state exchequer every year,” the energy minister said. The state had planned to formulate a scheme on the lines of Delhi, where the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had in 2019 announced 100% power bill waiver for households consuming up to 200 units of power in a month and subsidised bills for those consuming power between 201 and 400 units. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-probe-261-rise-in-power-bill-arrears-during-bjp-government-maharashtra-energy-minister/story-5LtjO2LNwEHvBaMdLMrQKP.html

The active cases in mid-October were as high as 30,000.The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has, so far, reported the maximum number of Covid-19 cases at 56,167, followed by 50,127 in Navi Mumbai and 49,362 in Thane city.Out of the total deaths, Thane city has recorded 1,183, Navi Mumbai 1,034 and Kalyan-Dombivli 949. A slight decrease in the number of cases has been noticed across the district in the last week. Opening of labs in each corporation helped see a dip in positive cases, claimed the district authorities.Rajesh Narvekar, collector, Thane District, said, “In the beginning of the pandemic, Thane district did not have a single testing lab. However, now every municipal corporation has testing laboratories that have ensured quick initiation of treatment. We are also in the process of building a testing unit in Padgha, which will cater to the rural areas within the district. We have identified places with infrastructure to accommodate more patients in case of a second wave.”The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has a recovery rate of 95 per cent with mortality rate coming down to 2.31 per cent even as the number of testing done is between 5,000 to 6,000 on a daily basis.Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC, said, “Although the situation is under control, we request support from residents in following social distancing rules, sanitize regularly and wear masks. For more than a week, the daily average number of cases has been consistently below 150 cases.”KDMC had the most number of cases within Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However they are presently at 96 per cent recovery rate. Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC, said, “We have handled the situation well and are ready to tackle more cases. Even if we get 900 daily cases, we have the provisions but residents have to take precautions, especially with educational institutions and public transport gradually opening up.”The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has hardly a few active cases. It reported less than 200 cases over the last few days. Similarly, Bhiwandi-Nizampur City Municipal Corporation had zero cases on Diwali despite the number of testing in these areas continuing to be the same.Bhiwandi had managed to control the pandemic in the early stages itself. Since mid-September, two-thirds of the Covid beds in the city had been given for patients from rural areas and other municipal corporations. Door-to-door testing was also initiated from September in the city leading to a decrease in positive cases. Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation is also at 93% recovery rate, “We have recently inaugurated our testing lab and will be adding 260 more beds within the city. We are well prepared if at all a second wave happens,” said Raja Dayanidhi, commissioner, Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation.Within Thane rural, the Zilla Parishad had asked villages in July to hoist a green flag in the gram panchayat if they did not have a single case in 28 days. Currently, there are 209 villages within Thane rural areas that have hoisted green flags. Till now, there have been around 35,785 positive cases within the rural areas of the district.“Less than 70 cases are being reported daily this week from across rural areas of the district now. We also took special efforts to remove fear in the minds of the locals, created awareness and testing were conducted regularly,” said an official from Thane Zilla Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-district-sees-drop-in-covid-19-cases-post-diwali/story-nMOL78nqSebPBVGWq60MUJ.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Low-key Diwali: Less cases reported at Navi Mumbai’s National Burns Centre||The low-key Diwali celebrations this year have reduced the number of burn cases reported at the National Burns Centre (NBS), Airoli, to seven. The number reported last year was 25. Out of the seven cases this year, five are of girls below 10 years whose dress caught fire and two are men who got burnt while bursting crackers.According to the centre, every year, around 20 to 25 cases of burn injuries are reported in the centre post Diwali. Most of them occur due to dresses catching fire from oil lamps.Dr Sunil Keswani, head of the National Burns Centre, said, “Small girls are usually dressed up in flowing traditional dresses, which get caught in diyas while playing. The five children admitted have received around 30 per cent burns. For an adult, this is a recoverable percentage but for children this could be fatal.”The two men got burn injuries while lighting a flowerpot.Keswani added, “Cracker burn cases are usually minor. They don’t have to get admitted. The victims are usually a parent who happens to burn their hand or face while lighting a firecracker for the child. Eight out of 10 firecracker burns happen while lighting a flowerpot.”He said that last year there were two deaths of women above 60 years who were comorbid and had sustained burn injuries after their sarees caught fire from diya.“This year, people did not indulge in crackers and diyas. Moreover, most of them stayed at home. The pandemic was a blessing in disguise for fall in the number of Diwali burn victims,” Dr Keswani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/low-key-diwali-less-burn-cases-reported-at-navi-mumbai-s-national-burns-centre/story-pr1VmCckJ6SJyiKcuhc2WM.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Maternity, multi-speciality hospitals to boost Kalyan-Dombivli health infrastructure||The Covid-19 pandemic situation has finally awakened the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) to the need for better health infrastructure in the twin cities. At present, Kalyan-Dombivli has merely two civic-run hospitals, four clinics and 15 primary healthcare centres to cater to a population of more than 15 lakh.Civic commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi, who has been vocal about the poor state of health infrastructure, has taken up two major projects for the same.The KDMC plans to redevelop an existing maternity home at Patharli in Dombivli. This has been shut for more than seven years. It also plans to add a multi-specialty hospital along with the maternity hospital. The corporation also announced a new medical college and 500-bedded hospital in Kalyan.Both these projects have been sanctioned by the general body last week.Ashwini Patil, medical health officer, KDMC, said, “The civic body has plans to come up with better infrastructure facilities, which is the need of the hour. We had plans to develop these facilities earlier. However, it never took off. The commissioner has now prioritised them.”The multi-specialty hospital with a maternity home will be built under Public Private Partnership (PPP) basis in Dombivli. The construction will be in two parts – the first will be the maternity hospital and the second, multispecialty hospital.The corporation will operate the state-of-the-art maternity home on the first and ground floors that include OPD, waiting area, radiology centre, reception room, security guard cabin, pharmacy, casualty, laboratory, record room as well as two operation theatres. The private agency will operate the multi-specialty hospital on the second floor.This ground-plus-one storeyed 30-bedded maternity home in KDMC was turned into a scrap shop in 2018 as it was shut for renovation. It was built in 1983 during the establishment of the municipal corporation, and shut in October 2013 due to its dilapidated condition.Till the time it was operational, many women visited the maternity home on a daily basis. After its closure, the services provided at the maternity home were diverted to the Shastri Nagar civic hospital in Dombivli and Rukminibai civic hospital in Kalyan.In 2015, the KDMC health department claimed that work cannot be started due to lack of funds.Suryavanshi said, “We have got a nod for the development of this maternity home and multi-speciality hospital and also the 500-bed hospital and medical college from the general body. The state health minister also assured to provide all the help for the same. We will take up these projects on a priority basis.”Raju Shinde, a resident of Dombivli, expressed that the civic body should take this pandemic as a lesson to improve infrastructure. “The existing civic hospitals are not capable of dealing with more patients or giving advanced treatment to the patients. If the civic-run hospitals are as good as a private hospital or at least have the basic facilities, people will get quality treatment at affordable prices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maternity-multi-speciality-hospitals-to-boost-kalyan-dombivli-health-infrastructure/story-nSx12XdrrlqQV2AbcveQJK.html
21-11-2020||City||Schools closed till December 31: Thane teachers throng Covid-19 testing centres amid confusion over decision||Thane district collector Rajesh Narvekar late on Friday evening announced that schools in the district will remain closed till December 31. “We had a meeting with Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde and decided that although the Covid-19 situation in the district is under control, there are chances of a second wave. So keeping the safety of children in mind, we have decided that all schools will remain closed till December 31,” said Narvekar. The development came following confusion over the reopening of schools in Thane district prevailed throughout the day on Friday, as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had announced to not reopen schools this month in the morning. As confusion prevailed over the reopening of schools in Thane, teachers thronged the Covid-19 testing centres, leading to overcrowding at the facilities. The Covid-19 testing centres at Vasant Valley in Kalyan witnessed a huge crowd and teachers complained of mismanagement at the facilities, which led to delay in testing of most of the teachers who waited for long hours in the queue. Rajaram Patil a teacher of Sharda Vidyamandir Kalyan and president of Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad, said, “There was complete chaos at the centre as there was no proper management by KDMC (Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation). Several teachers who waited in the queue for the testing on Thursday had to come on Friday again as their testing was not done the previous day. There were several arguments between the teachers and the staff.” KDMC epidemic officer Dr Pratibha Panpatil said, “We have set up five testing centres in Kalyan and made proper arrangement at all the centres for the testing with whatever manpower we have.” Overcrowding was also observed in rural areas of the district. Sudhir Ghagas, president, Maharashtra Shikshan Kranti Sanghatna, said, “We received an official statement on November 17 about mandatory tests to be conducted for all teachers before schools reopened. It was difficult to complete the procedure within a week, that too before the weekend. This led to teachers gathering outside testing centres and forming long queues to get themselves tested. In Shahapur, there are fewer testing centres but many teachers. Teachers were worried that overcrowding at the testing centres could lead to spread of the virus. “The staff at the centre I visited in Thane asked me to provide a doctor’s prescription for the test. I had to explain to them that the government made it compulsory for teachers to get tested. As the testing centres were not aware of this rule, it added to the confusion. As we had limited time, it was difficult to get a doctor’s prescription first and then approach the testing centre ,” said Kalyani Karmarkar, a teacher of a civic school in Thane. Meanwhile, Raigad collector Nidhi Choudhary has announced that schools can continue to function if parents give a confirmation to send their children to school. However, Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC), which falls under Raigad district, has postponed reopening of schools until December 31. “If parents give consent and the RT-PCR reports of all teachers come negative, the schools can reopen from Monday . But, PCMC schools will remain closed for some more weeks as there are concerns of a second Covid-19 wave,” said Choudhary..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/schools-closed-till-december-31-thane-teachers-throng-covid-19-testing-centres-amid-confusion-over-decision/story-VJPidlN6TJQa6SuEhw9EJM.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Sale of top-end vehicles not impacted by lockdown as registration in Thane RTO rise||The economy might have suffered during the lockdown. However, that has not affected the sale of top-end imported cars and motorcycles, as per the Regional Transport Officer (RTO) Thane records.The RTO has registered 30 imported cars and bikes alone in the last three months in Thane region, including a ₹7.25Cr Rolls Royce and ₹2.5Cr BMW. The RTO also has earned ₹1.75Cr in revenue from taxes by registering these high-end vehicles merely in just the last three months.As per the RTO records, it had registered 88 vehicles from January to December, 2019. Jayant Patil, Deputy Regional Officer, RTO, Thane, said, “This year, since March the sale was not good due to lockdown. However, it has taken off in the last three months when we registered 30 vehicles in merely three months out of a total of 58 imported vehicles till date this year. The sale has especially been good since Dussehra. We have earned revenue of ₹1.75Cr in the entire Thane region, with taxes as high as ₹20L for a single car.”With the limitation on public transport, most people invested in private vehicles. The safety of private vehicles was also one encouraging factor.Patil added, “After the complete lockdown in March, the RTO had started registering vehicles from May. Registration in the first two months was low. However, it increased as there were no signs of public transport resuming.”Some of the vehicles sold during this period included Rolls Royce, Land Rover, Mark, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Ferrari, Porsche cars, and BMW and Yamaha motorcycles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sale-of-top-end-vehicles-not-impacted-by-lockdown-as-registration-in-thane-rto-rise/story-zKi1gvBo8XW6zcdx0NXapM.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra third state in country to cross 1-crore Covid-19 tests mark||With 70,546 tests conducted in the past 24 hours, Maharashtra became the third state in the country to cross 1 crore Covid-19 detection tests, after Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Since the outbreak, Maharashtra has tested 10,035,665 samples with a positivity rate of 17.62%.Health experts, however, maintain that the state, which has more than 500 laboratories including private labs, has not fully utilised its testing capacity. They said the state would have to ramp up testing to keep the probable second wave of Covid-19 in check by testing close contacts and super spreaders.According to data shared by Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance office, 60.43% or 6,064,735 of the total tests were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and the remaining 39.57% or 3,970,930 were rapid antigen tests.Maharashtra continued to report more than 5,000 cases for the third consecutive day with 5,640 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday. The total caseload in the state touched 1,768,695, of which 78,272 are active. The state also reported 155 fatalities, pushing the death toll to 46,511.After eight days of clocking less than 1,000 cases daily, Mumbai on Friday reported 1,031 new infections, taking the city’s tally to 273,486. The last time Mumbai reported more than 1,000 cases was on November 11. The city also reported 12 deaths, pushing death toll to 10,639. The number of active cases in Mumbai stood at 11,822.As anticipated by health experts and authorities, the number of cases reported is seeing an increase than the previous weeks. On Friday, Pune reported 748 cases, followed by 517 in Thane district (including municipal corporations in the district), 463 in Nagpur district and 379 in Nashik district.State health minister Rajesh Tope said he was concerned about the gradual increase in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai. Tope, who was in Ratnagiri on Friday to take stock of the situation, said people in the state must learn from what Delhi is facing and must not lower their guard. The minister added that if the second wave hits the state, it will prove “costly” for everybody.“Today, cases are gradually going up in Mumbai, and it is concerning. Therefore, people must remain cautious. We must learn from Delhi and Kerala where the growth rates are going up. People do not wear masks and are taking the situation for granted. The second wave will prove costly for everybody and we must prevent it,” he said.Awate, however, said there was no increase in case positivity rate and attributed the increase in cases to higher number of tests. “There is no major increase in cases and the positivity rate is still under 10%. The testing during Diwali period had decreased due to several factors. The increase in cases could be attributed to that. However, we are taking all precautions to contain the spread,” he said.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, advisor to the state on Covid-19 control and member of a state-appointed committee on communicable diseases, said the state must increase testing. “There was a downward trend before Diwali, and we are seeing some increase in cases in some cities and districts. Despite appeals from the chief minister, ministers and experts, people have not been adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour. Besides, the state must increase testing to its full capacity. For instance, Pune conducts around 3,500 test daily, but it should increase to 6,500-7,500 tests per day,” Salunkhe said.N Ramaswami, commissioner, health services, said the department has already directed to increase testing to contain the spread of the coronavirus. “During the festival season the number of tests had gone done. We have already instructed our field missions to conduct the maximum number of tests. Besides regular tests, we also have to test teachers now as schools are going to reopen. Testing is the only way we can control the spread,” he said.Tope said while the state government has unlocked almost all activities, people have to take masking and social distancing seriously to prevent another wave. The minister added that the state would now increase the limit of people allowed to attend weddings in the state.When asked if the need could arise for another lockdown in the state to prevent the second wave, Salunkhe said he would not recommend lockdown. “Now the role of lockdown would not be much. As there are multiple complex issues involved in it, I won’t prescribe a lockdown. But I certainly want people to wear a mask and follow social distancing,” he said.Ramaswami said the state’s health infrastructure is prepared even if there is a surge in cases as predicted by health experts and authorities. The second wave could hit the state by December-end or in January-February, according to the two prediction models. “We have already instructed that districts must prepare for 10% additional cases to what the district had recorded earlier. We are concentrating on prevention. Even if there is a surge, we will be able to tackle it. We are geared up satisfactorily,” he said.Meanwhile, Friday also saw 6,945 patients being discharged after recovery, taking the tally of total recovered patients to 1,642,916. The recovery rate in the state improved to 92.89%. Currently, 558,090 people are in home quarantine and 4,883 people are in institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-third-state-in-country-to-cross-1-crore-covid-19-tests-mark/story-uxNfN7HYg5WQI7aY8ibXNO.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||5 of chain-snatching gang arrested in Navi Mumbai||The Navi Mumbai crime branch arrested five persons from a chain-snatching gang, solving at least 20 cases in the city. The gang had started robbing women of gold chains shortly after the lockdown. They operated in a group of four men riding two motorbikes.The police have recovered valuables worth ₹20 lakh from their possession. Two of the prime accused were arrested from the Odisha-Jharkhand border early this week, police said.The men especially targeted elderly women in isolated locations, pillion riders on the bike would rob their victims. The other biker would follow the first bike to prevent them from getting caught in case the victims chased the robbers, police added.The gang managed to evade police for almost the entire year. Prior to resorting to chain snatchings, some of the accused were arrested for pickpocketing train commuters.“While investigating the recent chain snatching cases, we started tracing the bikes that the men used in the crimes. With the help of informants, we learnt that the prime accused was headed to Kolkata by train and with the help of Odisha and Jharkhand police, the accused was nabbed in time,” said Giridhar Gore, senior inspector, unit 2, crime branch.After it was confirmed that the prime accused, Tanvir Shaikh alias Dipak, 22, was on board a train with his accomplice, the Navi Mumbai crime branch coordinated with the railway police and authorities to track the train route. With a coordinated attempt at various railway stations, Shaikh and his accomplice were nabbed at Rourkela station.They were brought to Navi Mumbai on a transit remand and later placed under arrest following which the other accused were identified. Shaikh worked with Akil Khan, 25, a taxi driver, Harun Sayyed, 23, an auto rickshaw driver, Tasharruf Shaikh, 22, and a fourth wanted accused.The fourth suspect is the husband of Shabnam Shaikh, 25, who is a hawker in Panvel. After robbing their victims, the accused men would hand over the stolen jewellery to Shabnam. She would sell it to different jewellers.Since January, 45 chain snatchings have been reported in Navi Mumbai, out of which only 13 were solved until the gang’s arrest.

He was working in a Vashi-based finance company.The crash occurred at around 4 pm opposite Arunachal Bhawan in Sector 30, Vashi. The mini-bus was transporting employees of a pharmaceutical company from Mahape. The bus driver had dropped one of the employees at Vashi railway station and was further going to drop five others at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) at the time of the incident.“The bus had crossed the junction near Kalyan Jewellers when a garbage dumper coming from the adjacent road at a high speed crashed into it from the rear,” said Sanjeev Dhumal, senior inspector at Vashi police station.Police said it was unclear if the dumper first hit the pedestrian or the bus. Impacts of collision was seen on the dumper’s front and the rear left portion of the bus.“The dumper hit the bus towards the left rear side, causing it to topple to its side.

Four employees in the bus sustained minor injuries and all of them were taken to MGM Hospital in Vashi. Dhal was declared dead at the hospital.The Vashi police were in the process of registering a case against the dumper driver for rash driving and causing death due to negligence under sections of Indian Penal Code.Police said that after crashing into the bus, the dumper driver left the vehicle and fled the spot. Police have contacted the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation for help in tracing the driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pedestrian-killed-as-garbage-dumper-crashes-into-mini-bus-in-navi-mumbai/story-rUPSDA6ngjgubxFSdQRllM.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Do not visit Chaityabhoomi on Ambedkar’s death anniversary, Mumbai civic body appeals to citizens||Fearing a second wave of Covid-19 in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has appealed to citizens to not visit Chaityabhoomi this year on December 6 which marks the death anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar. Civic officials said no arrangements, such as temporary sheds, drinking water, mobile toilets among others, will be made for visitors this year. However, devotees can pay tribute from their homes as the event will be live telecast this year.Every year on December 6, followers of Ambedkar visit Chaityabhoomi in Dadar, where Ambedkar was cremated, to pay their respects to the Dalit icon. As per BMC’s estimates, nearly 10 lakh people visit Chaityabhoomi every year on the occasion.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G North ward (Dadar), said, “No stalls will be given any permission and no arrangements will be made for visitors. It is an appeal to citizens to pay tributes from their homes through the live telecast in these extraordinary times. We are also making sure that we are prepared with complete crowd controlling measures at the site.”Generally, around 500 stalls of books, lamps, calendars, decorations, posters, T-shirts, watches and other such with images of Ambedkar are put up at Shivaji Park for the occasion. Temporary sheds spread across around 1 lakh square foot are set-up by BMC for visitors. Apart from this, nearly 200 mobile toilets and several drinking water taps are provided by the civic body every year for visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/do-not-visit-chaityabhoomi-on-ambedkar-s-death-anniversary-mumbai-civic-body-appeals-to-citizens/story-W7g3FaxayuEU8i2RQlF0TJ.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||This year, most celebrate Chhath Puja from their building terraces in Thane, Kalyan||With an appeal from the state to avoid overcrowding at the water bodies, women from the north Indian community observed the Chhath Puja from the terrace of their residential buildings on Friday. Merely 3,000 to 4,000 people visited the seven lakes in the city compared to the one lakh people who visit every year.Chhath Puja is celebrated widely among the north Indian community wherein women observe a three-day fast and present offerings to the rising and setting sun facing any water body.Dhananjay Singh, Founder, Rudra Pratishthan, an organisation that works for the welfare of the north Indian community in Thane, said, “People who visited the lakes were sent one at a time maintaining social-distancing. We had volunteers at various spots to ensure rules of wearing masks were followed. We took many precautionary measures. The artificial lake at Upvan saw hardly 70 devotees whereas Railadevi Lake had more than a thousand devotees visiting on Friday.”Meanwhile, those who could not visit the lakes in the city carried out the ritual on their building terrace facing the setting sun on Friday.“We are supposed to perform the rituals facing the setting sun on Friday and rising sun on Saturday. We spent the entire year celebrating low key. This ritual is for the well-being of the family and hence as part of that we chose to stay indoors. Every year the lakes are overcrowded and we did not want to be a part of that during the pandemic, hence we completed the rituals within our society terrace,” said Ritu Jha, 32, resident of Umapati building in Kalyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/this-year-most-celebrate-chhath-puja-from-their-building-terraces-in-thane-kalyan/story-zcHdDSH8NsprauUAqpVlOJ.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Decision to not reopen schools in Mumbai till December 31 should have been taken earlier: Principals, parents||Schools in Mumbai have welcomed the civic body’s announcement to not reopen schools on November 23, but said that the decision should have been taken earlier. The schools will remain closed till December 31 owing to fears of a second Covid-19 wave in the city. After the Maharashtra education department’s green signal, schools had begun preparations to reopen for Class 9 to Class 12 students. In the past few days, around 9,000 teachers from schools in Mumbai underwent the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for Covid-19, after the state made testing mandatory for them in the standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued on November 10. A total of 25,000 teachers, including those from aided, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and private schools had to be tested. “The past few days have been really stressful for teachers and schools as they had to prepare for the reopening as per the guidelines. So while we welcome BMC’s decision to not reopen schools this month, we wished that the announcement would have been made earlier,” said Prashant Redij, spokesperson, Mumbai Principals Association. Several schools had also sanitised their premises as a preparation for schools to reopen. “The government has not given us any money for this and now all that effort has gone down the drain,” said the principal of a suburban school. Prasad Tulaskar, a Dadar-based parent who had been writing to the education department urging officials to not start schools, said parents heaved a sigh of relief after the announcement. “Our only question is why was our request not heard before? In a city like Mumbai, Covid-19 cases have always been high and it made no sense to announce reopening of schools. The state should understand that when a child goes to school, along with him, his family members also become vulnerable [to the virus],” said Tulaskar. On Friday, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad said that while the department has allowed schools to reopen for the higher classes, the final decision to do so rests with the local administration. “Local administration from each place would be able to take a decision on the basis of prevailing conditions and in consultation with principals and other stakeholders,” said Gaikwad in a statement. The SOPs too had mandated that the local administration has the final authority to decide on school reopening. The department had, however, said it would permit schools to reopen from November 23 following safety protocols like sanitisation of school premises, daily temperature checks of teachers and students, conducting a mix of online and offline learning and ensuring there is one student per bench in a class. Supplementary exams on schedule, students, staff allowed to take trainsThe department said the ongoing supplementary exams for Class 10 and Class 12 will continue as per schedule and the students, teaching and non-teaching staff will be allowed to travel by local trains till December 10. The CR and WR issued the permission late on Friday, on the directives of the railway ministry. Valid identity card and hall tickets of students will be checked while entering the railway station premises..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/decision-to-not-reopen-schools-in-mumbai-till-december-31-should-have-been-taken-earlier-principals-parents/story-FBzOMyBXyIYdRgc1DJUq3N.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||Lowest November minimum temperature in Delhi since 2006, shows IMD data||The minimum temperature in Delhi dropped to 7.5 degrees Celsius on Friday morning, the lowest in November since 2006, according to data from the met department, as experts predicted an early winter for the national capitalOn November 29, 2006, the minimum temperature had dropped to 7.3°C, officials said. Data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows that till November 16, the average minimum temperatures recorded in the city have been two to three degrees below the normal for the season.Friday’s minimum temperature was five notches below normal for this time of the year.In November 2019, the lowest temperature was 11.4°C and in the same month the previous year, this was 10.5°C.According to IMD scientists, the minimum temperature does not usually drop below 10 degrees Celsius in November. “It’s unusual for minimum temperatures to drop to single digits in mid-November. Winter is setting in early this year. The drop in night temperature is mainly due to a combination of cold winds blowing from the snow-clad western Himalayan region and largely clear skies in Delhi. When there is no cloud cover, the ground cools faster and minimum temperatures stay low,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.He added that snowfall in the Himalayas, which is an annual phenomenon, has an impact on temperatures across northwest India, but local factors such as absence of cloud cover also play a crucial role. Delhi this year also saw the coldest October in 58 years with the mean minimum temperatures for the month settling at 17.2°C. The last time it was this cold at night in the national capital was in 1962, when the mean minimum temperature for October was 16.9 degrees Celsius, as per IMD data.VK Soni of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said the minimum temperature is likely to remain around 7-8 degrees Celsius over the next two days. “On November 23, there will be a slight increase in the minimum temperature because of cloud cover in Delhi. Whenever there are clouds, there is a rise in minimum temperature,” he said.Meanwhile, falling temperatures and continuing stubble fires have kept the air quality in the far-end of the ‘poor’ category, despite strong winds. The average wind speed on Thursday was 15-16kmph, favourable for the dispersion of pollutants.Also Read: Delhi’s air quality deteriorates again, may improve marginally tomorrowAs per the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) 4pm bulletin, the average air quality index (AQI) was 296, up from 283 on Thursday.“The deterioration in air quality is mainly because the wind direction is north-westerly and since some stubble burning activity is still continuing, the smoke is travelling to Delhi and not allowing improvement. However, wind speeds are likely to remain high over the next two days and there may be a slight improvement in air quality. We don’t expect any significant deterioration at least till November 23,” Soni said.As per the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the Union earth science ministry’s air quality forecasting wing, the air quality may touch ‘very poor’ by Friday night, as the winds turn calm during the night. But, it is likely to improve marginally thereafter on November 21-22 with good winds speed expected in the city.The share of stubble burning to levels of PM2.5 (the most harmful aerosols in Delhi’s air) in the city on Friday reduced to 15% from 20% the previous day, the Safar bulletin stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lowest-november-minimum-temperature-in-delhi-since-2006/story-dvWfoCtZgBo0rfVdyFOecM.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||IIT-K’s air quality sensors highlight the need for hyper-local air quality monitoring||The air quality index (AQI) and particulate matter levels flashing on your nearest Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitoring station might not be correctly reflecting the air quality in your neighbourhood, according to an analysis of data recorded by IIT-Kanpur’s hyper-local air quality monitoring sensors in Delhi. Data from 30 hyper-local air quality sensors installed across Delhi show the role of local factors such as vehicular movement, local fires on the air quality and how it changes every few kilometres. These sensors were installed from October 21 with an aim of assessing neighbourhood air quality data. Some of these sensors are located near CPCB stations while others are at a distance of 1 to 10 km away.When entire Delhi was reeling under an air emergency between November 5 and November 11, recordings of PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) in CPCB’s 36 monitoring stations and the hyper-local sensors installed by IIT, were similar.Also Read| Lowest November minimum temperature in Delhi since 2006, shows IMD dataHowever, on November 12 and November 13, when, according to CPCB’s monitoring stations, the pollution levels improved to ‘very poor’ levels (PM 2.5 levels below the 250ug/m3 mark) in places such as Mundka (near Ghevra), Rohini sector-4, Pooth Khurd Village, Narela sector A-8 and Chhawla BSF Camp, the PM 2.5 levels recorded by the hyper local sensors at the same places continued to remain above the 450ug/m3 mark (emergency levels).Scientists said this was proof of how important it was necessary to have more air quality monitoring at a local level and across the city. Professor Sachchida Nand Tripathi, head of the department (civil engineering), member of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) who is leading this project along with professor Abhay Karandika, director, IIT-Kanpur, said while data from primary air quality monitoring stations were important, it was those from these hyper-local sensors that actually affected the lives of people. “If I want to go out for a run or I have a senior citizen or a child at home and want to know the air quality levels in my area, I need to know the pollution level in my location. The nearest CPCB or DPCC (Delhi Pollution Control Committee) monitoring station could be six, seven or even 10 kilometres away. So, what is actually affecting me is not shown in the readings of monitoring stations,” explained Tripathi. For instance, in an area like Najafgarh, which has sources such as stubble fires, open burning and road dust, there is only one monitoring station covering a 30 km area. Similarly, despite the heavy traffic volume in Dhaula Kuan, the nearest CPCB monitoring station is located at RK Puram, around eight kilometres away.On November 15, a day after Diwali, the readings of these IIT-Kanpur neighbouring sensors showed that in 28 out of the 30 localities, the PM 2.5 levels were above 480ug/m3. It shows that in residential areas such as Rohini sector-4, Noida sector-134, Noida sector-78 and RK Puram, the levels were higher compared to industrial areas and transport hubs, which clearly showed the impact of cracker bursting. Between October 21 and November 3, when the city was receiving relatively cleaner air, the PM 2.5 reading at the Sahibabad sensor was above 200ug/m3 for 13 out of the 14 days. In Jahangirpuri, Anand Vihar and Bawana, the levels were above the 200ug/m3 mark for 12 out of 14 days. Explaining the data reading, Tripathi said when micro-climates in a locality were at play, there was a difference in the recordings of these sensors compared to the 36 CPCB monitoring stations.It was also noted that in the absence of any major change in micro-climate (local factors), the readings in these sensors and the CPCB stations were similar. “This shows the accuracy of these low-cost neighbourhood sensors. Delhi-NCR is a vast region and improving air quality monitoring is the only way to solve the problem of pollution here. At present, we have around 36 monitoring stations, but for a city like Delhi, you need at least 200-300 air quality sensors to correctly assess the pollution levels. In cities such as Beijing and London, there are hundreds of air quality monitoring systems, which ensures the accuracy of information,” he said. A senior CPCB official, who did not wish to be identified, said they are working with states concerned in Delhi and NCR to increase monitoring. “From around 16-17 stations, we have increased our monitoring to 38 and now we will be increasing the network more. Surely, with more data, the analysis of pollution will be better,” the official said. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, also stressed on the importance of neighbourhood monitoring for a more accurate analysis of pollution levels.“Importance of accurate data cannot be underestimated because for any action to control pollution levels will have to come after analysing this. In many states in northern India, pollution levels are high but because there are only one or two AQI monitoring stations, we do not get a clear picture of the extent of the problem,” she said. Also Read: Delhi’s air quality deteriorates again, may improve marginally tomorrowThe development of these sensors, which have been designed to measure particulate matter of the size 10 micrometres (PM 10) and 2.5 micrometres (PM 2.5), is part of a collaborative project between IIT-Kanpur, Mumbai-based Respirer Living Sciences and Ericson (India), which for the first time in India has used the Narrow Bandwidth-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) technology. This new technology primarily helps saves energy and can sense and transmit more effectively than the air quality monitoring sensors already installed in Delhi-NCR, IIT-Kanpur scientists explained. Data generated from these sensors will be shared on a common platform to help community groups in understanding air quality situation in their areas and will government agencies to mitigate policies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/iit-k-s-air-quality-sensors-highlight-the-need-for-hyper-local-air-quality-monitoring-in-delhi-ncr/story-rSqUbTGV08v2ska1XjHXsO.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||Finer, deadlier PM1 shoots up in Delhi due to crop burning, crackers||Unchecked instances of crop stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana and the cracker bursting in Delhi on Diwali has resulted in a steep rise in the tiniest and deadliest of air pollutants, the PM1 or particulate matter with a diameter less than 1 micrometres, in the Delhi-NCR between October and November, according to a joint research by three Central universities. PM1 is so fine that it can reach the blood stream and organs. Scientists say these particles are highly toxic as they are formed by complex chemical reactions between pollutants in the air, and are at least 50-70 times finer than human hair. In comparison, PM10 is around 5-7 times finer than hair, and PM2.5 is around 20-30 times finer. PM10 can reach up to the upper air passage of the human body, and PM2.5 can reach the lungs.The new analysis conducted by researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and the Delhi University shows that the levels of PM 1 in Delhi was between 200ug/m3 and 300ug/m3 in October and November, as compared to less than 100ug/m3 in September this year. Unlike PM2.5 and PM10, which have set permissible limits, there is still no global safe limit for PM1 because it is a pollutant which started being measured only recently. Between November 6 and November 11, the 24-hour observations show a very high concentration of both PM2.5 and PM1. The analysis was conducted jointly by SK Dhaka, associate professor of physics, Rajdhani College, Delhi University; AP Dimri, professor, JNU; and Palak Balyan, Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-Delhi. While the levels of PM1 are not recorded by either the Central Pollution Control Board or the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the analysis has been conducted based on a new network of low-cost sensors set up in Delhi-NCR and in Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh. The initiative has been funded by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) and is led by RTI International, in collaboration with IIT-Delhi and Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).At present, there are about 35 sensors operational, which are providing real time data along with temperature and humidity. The analysis shows that PM1 particles were of high density, ranging between 250-280ug/m3, between November 7 and November 11, primarily because of high humidity levels and low temperatures, which formed a conducive environment for the accumulation of these fine particles. Also Read: IIT-K’s air quality sensors highlight the need for hyper-local air quality monitoringAccording to Balyan, PM1 can penetrate the mucous membrane of the lung and enter the blood stream. “Depending on the chemical nature of the particle, it can precipitate acute inflammatory reactions in persons with compromised heart function and can cause acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction. It can trigger systemic allergic reactions as well,” he said.Professor Dhaka said immediately after Diwali even as rain and easterly winds cleaned up the air, and the air quality index moved from ”severe” to ”poor”, PM1 gained in density.Explaining the health risk associated with prolonged exposure to PM1, Dr Arun Sharma, director, community medicine, University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi University, said, “Particles of size 1.0 micron or less are more harmful, as they can cross the mucus barrier and through the blood stream enter any organ to cause damages or increase the risk of cancer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/finer-deadlier-pm1-shoots-up-in-delhi-due-to-crop-burning-crackers/story-ZdAAmxKw5lOwblhFqdzywJ.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||Tubs, cemented tanks and inflatable bath tubs: Chhath Puja performed amid unprecedented restrictions||From humble tubs and cemented tanks on terraces to inflatable bath tubs and pits hastily dug on empty plots, devotees in Delhi found their own way -- in the face of unprecedented restrictions owing to the spike in Covid-19 cases -- to offer prayers to the sun god as part of the Chhath Puja festivities that began on Friday evening. With worship in public spaces banned by the Delhi government, many were compelled to share common water spots, which eventually meant that the threat of infection remained despite them not visiting the Yamuna ghats, where the crowds, had they been permitted, would have been much higher. The more fortunate ones were able to arrange private water spots as well as ensure that only those without infection shared the worship space. The water body plays an important role in Chhath Puja as devotees have to stand in water and offer prayers, before taking a dip. In any case, the Delhi Police said there were no violations of the government order, issued last week, prohibiting Chhath prayers at the common ghats. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, on Thursday, had appealed to residents to perform the Chhath prayers from their homes rather than venturing to the ghats. Also Read: 6,608 new Covid-19 cases in Delhi, positivity rate drops to 10.59%While a few devotees said that a week-long notice was enough for them to make alternative arrangements, others said they struggled to come up with practical options. Ram Yadav, a professional photographer living in Dwarka’s Sector 22, said eight Purvanchali families in his colony joined hands to set up two cement tanks on the terraces. “Four people performed puja in one tank, and three others used the other one. Although the risk of infection exists while sharing a tank, we were fortunate to know that none of us was infected,” said Yadav. Raj Kishore, a driver who lives with some other poor families in jhuggis near JNU in south Delhi, said he and three other families had to dig a pit in the fields nearby to perform the puja. “We had to do the digging on our own as we didn’t have the money to hire anyone. And this is a festival that can’t be missed, even on account of a pandemic or anything else,” said Kishore. Kanchan Devi, a resident of south Delhi’s Sanjay Vihar, joined hands with a few neighbours to dig a pit measuring 6X4 feet in an empty plot near their house and then used a water pump to fill it. “Relatives were insistent on many of them attending the puja. But we had to be firm and ensure only two performed the puja at once,” said Devi. Many said the puja this year was a “compromise” and that they lacked the “satisfaction”.“The tradition is to take a dip in the water body. But how do you take a dip in a tub,” said Archana Karn, a resident of Mandi House who had earlier performed the puja at the India Gate pond. This time, she bathed in her house and then visited the terrace to do the puja. “I sought forgiveness of Chhath Mata for any mistakes. It’s the first time in 25 years that we have had to make such arrangements,” said Karn. In neighbourhoods where residents did not have avenues to make arrangements, local Chhath Puja samitis stepped in. Arvind Thakur, president of the Purvanchal Chhath Puja Committee (Dwarka-Najafgarh), said that people living as tenants mostly faced problems due to lack of space and terraces. “We advised them to use plastic sheets and bricks to prepare makeshift tubs. We knew of the restrictions in time and alerted them to make alternative arrangements,” said Thakur. He said while no one missed out on performing the puja eventually, the fervour was missing. “It is a different joy to gather in thousands at the ghats. We tried to make up for it by playing puja songs on loudspeakers,” said Thakur. In south-east district, the local police distributed tubs to slum residents to perform the puja, said the deputy commissioner of police, RP Meena. Also Read| Religious institutions to help distribute masks: KejriwalPolice said that they had been urging residents not to gather at the ghats. “We made announcements in Bhojpuri, and sent out WhatsApp videos about the new rules. We held over 50 meetings with local residents. We also deployed our personnel at the ghats to prevent a gathering,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP (south).The police said that there were no gatherings at the ghats across the city. PK Mishra, DCP (Rohini), said that areas in his jurisdiction such as Aman Vihar, Prem Nagar and KN Katju Marg have a high population of Biharis. “We deployed our personnel since noon itself. No one visited the ghats,” said the DCP. A similar puja is scheduled for Saturday morning, but the police said they were prepared for that as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tubs-cemented-tanks-and-inflatable-bath-tubs-chhath-puja-performed-amid-unprecedented-restrictions/story-9B1auIwb7iaSz2gkZDM2PO.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||Religious institutions to help distribute masks: Kejriwal||On a day when the fine for not wearing masks in public spaces was hiked from Rs 500 to Rs 2000, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said a few religious institutions have come forward to help the government in prevention of Covid-19 by distributing masks.In a series of tweets, Kejriwal said he spoke to the heads of Akshardham temple, Iskcon India and Radhasoami Satsang Beas, who assured him that their volunteers would distribute masks in public.Kejriwal tweeted, “I just spoke to Baba Ji of Radhasoami Satsang Beas on phone. He assured his support in dealing wid corona situation in Delhi. He assured that he will ask his followers to not only wear mask themselves but also distribute it to those not wearing it in public places Thank u Babaji.”With more than 7,000 Covid cases being reported in the city daily, the Delhi government is stressing on preventive measures. The decision to increase the fine on not wearing masks was a step in this direction. Kejriwal is reaching out to religious institutions to create awareness about the need to wear masks.On Thursday, after he announced an increase in the penalty for not wearing g masks from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000, Kejriwal had urged religious and spiritual leaders to join hands in distribution of masks.Earlier, Kejriwal, who is the national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), had asked all MLAs, councillors and party volunteers to distribute masks in public places.After he spoke to the head of Akshardham temple, Kejriwal tweeted, “Just spoke to Sh D B Swami ji of Akshardham temple. They have agreed to combine efforts with Delhi govt by mobilizing their volunteers to help distribute masks at public places. Extremely grateful for their support.The CM also spoke to Iskcon India’s chairman Gopal Krishna Goswami. Kejriwal tweeted, “Spoke to Iskcon India’s chairman Gopal Krishna Goswami and sought his support in our fight against Covid. He has assured me their support and said that devotees of Iskcon will follow all the preventive measures, distribute masks and create awareness.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/religious-institutions-to-help-distribute-masks-kejriwal/story-9PyP3wHviOR6WtuO6PF0JI.html

Parallelly, the number of testing centres are also being increased. High-risk individuals, whose records will be maintained in a separate database, will be visited periodically to ascertain their well-being.” The survey was directed by Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday in his meeting with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and lieutenant-governor Anil Baikal. Shah had also directed that tests should be doubled in the national capital, in the light of the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases.Delhi on Friday recorded 6,608 new Covid-19 cases and 118 more deaths, the government’s health bulletin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-starts-mammoth-door-to-door-survey-to-identify-those-at-high-risk-of-getting-covid-19/story-PQ4SGUhxP9PJpqGpemkeAI.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC warns of contempt notice over damage to 300-yr-old Banyan tree||The Delhi High Court on Friday came down heavily on the Delhi government’s tree officer and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation for their failure to remove concrete around a 300-year-old Banyan tree that has been damaged due to illegal construction in Old Delhi’s Nai Sadak area. The court asked why a notice of contempt should be not issued against officers for “wilful disobedience” of the court’s order.Justice Najmi Waziri said it appears the officer has not visited the site and so is not aware of the ground reality. He said photos shown to the court pointed to the presence of a concrete structure and iron girders at the basement of the tree.The court was hearing a plea filed by one Nitin Gupta, filed through advocate RK Kapoor, seeking restoration of the tree that had been damaged due to construction. Kushmakar Rastogi, a resident, had also filed an application to save the banyan tree. On Friday, Rastogi’s counsel showed pictures showing iron girders and other construction causing damage to the tree base. He said the authorities, including the Delhi government’s tree officer and the North Delhi civic body, had done no work to restore the tree.The pictures irked the court, which said the tree officer had “given up” and MCD officials had done “no work” at the site . He said his earlier direction of setting up a tree helpline was also not implemented.The court said due to the “wilful disobedience of its repeated instructions, it is inclined to conduct contempt proceedings against all authorities”. He asked the authorities to file an affidavit with details of the situation.The court asked the deputy commissioner of the North MCD to file an affidavit, saying the “grand old tree” is like “a patient who has to be nourished”.It appears the tree officer has not visited the site. The photos show status quo with the iron girders still present and the tree suffering as earlier. “Nothing has been done so far as the ground is dug up,” the court said.The court asked advocate Gautam Narayan, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, to ask the principal secretary, forest, to look into the matter while threatening to seek a report from the chief secretary.“Let’s do something for the city. We are gasping for fresh air,” the court said and posted the matter till November 27.North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said the court’s directions should have been complied with.

21-11-2020||Delhi||No lockdown, but please ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour: CM to traders||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday urged trader bodies and market welfare associations to ensure Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in their business areas even as he tried to allay concerns about a possible lockdown.“I met representatives of market associations and removed their anxieties. The government does not wish to shut any market. They assured that anyone not wearing a mask in the market will be provided a free mask by the association. All shops will be asked to keep spare masks and sanitisers. The agenda of the meeting was to seek cooperation in ensuring Covid-19 appropriate behaviour at market places,” said Kejriwal.Representatives of several trader bodies and market associations participated in the meeting through video conference facility.Also Read: 6,608 new Covid-19 cases in Delhi, positivity rate drops to 10.59%“We have specifically pointed out about all forms of encroachment in Delhi markets. Because of encroachment, there is hardly any space left for social distancing in markets. Unless the government works in this regard, they cannot ensure full compliance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. We are yet to get any assurances on that,” said Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarv Vyapar Mandal.Brijesh Goel, president of the chamber of trade and industry, said: “The meeting with the CM has helped calm down anxieties among traders. We will work towards further ensuring Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in markets.”Kejriwal had said on Tuesday that he has sought permission from the central government to allow the Delhi government to temporarily shut down markets assessed as potential Covid-19 hot spots from time to time in the light of the violation of social distancing norms and Covid-19 regulations.Under the present guidelines, states need the approval of the Union home ministry for imposing any local lockdown-like restrictions.The announcement has led to anxiety among traders in the city even as the government has been insisting that this should not be perceived as a “lockdown”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-lockdown-but-please-ensure-covid-appropriate-behaviour-cm-to-traders/story-TOumkRb2MDFf1xRXePVjgL.html
21-11-2020||Delhi||Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam’s judicial custody extended||A Delhi court on Friday extended the judicial custody of Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for their alleged role in the Delhi riots, till November 23.Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat extended their judicial remand after the duo was produced through video conferencing from Tihar jail.During the proceedings, special public prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad said their custody should be extended for three days till November 23 as it would also mark the end of the 90 days of the arrest. Police have to file charge sheet in a case within 90 days, but in connection with UAPA cases, the timeline to file the charge sheet can extended up to 180 days after getting the court’s permission.The special prosecutor said it would let the court know on the next hearing about the supplementary charge sheet in the case. While the police have charged 15 people, including former AAP councilor Tahir Hussain, former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan and several student activists for allegedly orchestrating the riots, it is yet to file a charge sheet against six more persons, including Imam, Umar Khalid and Faizan Khan (who was accused of supplying a sim card to Jamia scholar Asif Iqbal Tanha).During the hearing, the court asked Khalid if he was facing any problems in jail after he had complained of mistreatment on the last date of hearing, October 23. Khalid said he was not facing any other issues apart from “a curb on his liberties and a malicious investigation.” Advocate Surabhi Dhar, who appeared for Imam, told the court she filed an application seeking certain writing material of Imam which he had penned while he was in custody at Assam. At this juncture, Khalid said some people from jail no 1 had come to his cell and were looking for Imam’s notebooks, which have gone missing. On the last date, Imam had told the court that while he was brought from Guwahati to Delhi, the authorities had seized some of his documents and still not returned them. He had told the court the papers included documents related to his PhD and submissions to professors, and should be returned to him.The matter would be now heard on November 23.Communal riots had broken out in north-east Delhi riots in February, claiming 53 lives and leaving 400 others injured .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/umar-khalid-and-sharjeel-imam-s-judicial-custody-extended/story-nEYoiw0nr6DYhku6u7LgVJ.html
21-11-2020||Pune||Pune sees spike in fresh cases post Diwali, early indication of ‘second wave’||Pune: Post the five-day Diwali festive season, Pune district has reported an alarming number of new Covid-19 cases indicating early signs of the much anticipated second wave of the virus. Despite the administration’s repeated messages to residents to follow respiratory hygiene and social distancing norms in public places, Punekars were found to be roaming without masks and even spitting at crowded places. The central team during its visit in October had warned the administration of a possible second wave post Diwali, following which the local authorities had started preparations based on the state government’s strategy paper for the second wave. The administration, including the city mayor, have repeatedly warned citizens to not let their guard down, but markets on Laxmi road, Tulsibaug and Mandai areas were found to be crowded throughout the week before Diwali which could have possibly led to the spike in fresh cases, according to experts. Pune district recorded a declining trend in cases prior to Diwali since the second half of October. The district saw the highest active cases on September 16 when 82,172 were still undergoing treatment for Covid in hospitals or were in home isolation. The number of active cases continued to drop as more people were discharged as compared to fresh cases being reported. However, post Diwali, the number of new cases rose leading to more number of active cases. The city that reported a daily average of 200-300 new cases in 24 hours in the week prior to Diwali found itself burdened with above 500 positives since the festival. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, epidemiologist and chairman of the state technical committee on communicable diseases, said, “This is exactly what we had anticipated and what we are witnessing. The cases are rising drastically. Although, we do believe that the severity of the second wave would not be as much as the first one as we are seeing in European countries, however, there is still a sizable population in the city which has not yet been exposed to the virus which is still as much susceptible as they were earlier. So, we need to be more careful. Even after the vaccine comes in, it will take time to reach the last person in the line and so we much not behave irresponsibly.” Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol tweeted that Pune is seeing a spike in cases and citizens need to strictly follow safety norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-sees-spike-in-fresh-cases-post-diwali-early-indication-of-second-wave/story-wKh988U2Zf7swUlXessCgJ.html
21-11-2020||Pune||IISER study finds 15% sero survey samples in Pune might never develop antibodies against Covid||A follow-up study by city’s Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) on the pilot sero (seroprevalence) survey has found that about 85% samples tested positive for neutralising antibodies which can act effectively against SARS-CoV-2 which causes Covid-19, while the remaining samples tested negative. The samples were collected from the city’s five most affected wards and tested positive for antibodies indicating that they were infected at one point of time. However, 15% of the samples tested for neutralising antibodies showed no such activity hinting that this is the vulnerable group if a second wave hits Pune. The study was conducted by multiple institutes and led by IISER and Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). It was a follow up of the pilot sero survey conducted in July and made public in August. Random samples were collected from 1,659 asymptomatic individuals from five sub-wards in Yerawada, Kasbapeth-Somwarpeth, Rastapeth-Ravivarpeth, Lohiyanagar-Kasewadi and Navipeth-Parvati. Out of these, 51% had tested positive for antibodies. Experts involved in the study had said that although it needs to be further studied if these antibodies have the neutralising activity to fight against SARS-CoV-2. The paper states: “From the 857 (receptor-binding-domain) RBD-IgG (Immunoglobulin G) positive sera, 697 samples were randomly selected and tested for the ability to inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) using a specific ELISA-based surrogate virus neutralisation test (sVNT)20. At least 85•1% of the RBD-IgG positive sera were sVNT positive.” Dr Aurnab Ghose, associate professor, IISER and also the corresponding author of the paper said, “Out of the samples that we tested to detect neutralising antibodies against Covid, we found that 85% did show the neutralising properties which are the early indicators of population level immunity loosely also referred to as herd immunity. However, in the remaining 15% of the samples there were no traces of such antibodies which states that even though they might have been infected at one point they are vulnerable in the second wave.” The paper further states: “While 57•2% of the 18-30 years age-group showed ≥50% inhibition, this increased to 64% in the 31-50 years category and became 75% in the population above 50 years (p<0.001 or less than one in a thousand chance of being wrong). However, no association was found with sex. An explanation for the age factor could be the association of RBD-binding antibody levels with age, as high sVNT values are likely to be positively correlated with high RBD-binding activity.”Dr Ghose said the samples that tested positive for neutralising antibodies showed varied proportions of the antibodies ranging from as less as 25% to more than 75% depending on age groups. The paper also stated that the presence of chronic illness, travel history, working status, exposure to Covid patients, history of quarantine, participation in social gatherings, self/family members working in health care set up did not reveal any significant association with sero-positivity. While infection risk was similar between men and women, the sero-prevalence (presence of antibodies) in the elderly population (65+ age-group) was lower than the younger population. This observation is in contrast to what has been reported from Delhi and Mumbai. Dr Ghose said that it will take further studies to identify these vulnerable groups which will help the administration to keep a close watch on such vulnerable populations. A similar study was done by BJ Medical College based on the number of plasma donors who approached the hospital for blood donation. The study found that of the 351 plasma donors who were tested for antibodies only 237 tested positive and could donate plasma for the treatment of Covid patients which is 67.52% of those tested positive for the antibodies. Both the studies indicate that while there is a considerable chance that a person who has been infected once is likely to be re-infected even if they do test positive for antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/iiser-study-finds-15-sero-survey-samples-in-pune-might-never-develop-neutralising-antibodies-against-covid/story-oiNapRP96GRTc4i9R71MnO.html
21-11-2020||Pune||Schools in Pune city to resume for Class 9-12 from Nov 23||After the Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced to restart schools from November 23, Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar on Thursday and Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Friday issued orders to resume physical classes at schools within Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits. All the PMC-run, government and private schools are allowed to resume the academic session, offline, for Classes 9 to 12 from Monday, November 23. The schools have been instructed to strictly follow Covid safety protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the state government. The order issued by Kumar states: “All the schools in PMC limits with standard 9 to 12 are allowed to restart their classes for standard 9 to 12 from November 23. Also, hostels and residential schools for same standards, especially for foreign students, are also allowed to restart from the given date”. The order issued by Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Friday also stated the same information. According to the guidelines issued by the authorities, it is compulsory for each student coming to school to get a written permission from the parent. According to a circular issued by PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agrawal on Friday, PMC officials will be visiting the schools under its jurisdiction and check the safety measures as per the SOPs given by the education department. Schools will be allowed to resume classes only after getting permission from these officials. Meanwhile, parents of students are anxious about the Covid infection risk. “I am worried to send my daughter to school from November 23 as there is always a risk of getting infected. My husband is willing to send the child as he says that all safety measures will be followed by the school,” said Archana Kakade, a parent. “Medical experts say that despite the coronavirus spread, a large number of people do not show symptoms. In such a situation, how to constantly check the children or teachers? The big question can arise if a teacher is tested positive. If 50 per cent of children are present, how will parents plan transportation and creche for them? How can we ensure that children keep a safe distance during the 50 per cent attendance? Does the consent of parents end the responsibility of schools? The government has not given satisfactory answers to all these issues,” said Mukund Kirdat, coordinator, Pune Parents United. “The government should first implement a home-based nutritious diet for poor-weaker section children. Another issue is the need to strengthen online facilities. A temporary competent direct education system should be set up using unemployed diploma in education (DEd) and teacher eligibility test (TET) teachers. Also, the upper fee cap should be announced for online education immediately. An ordinance should be issued amending the Fee Regulation Act with reference to court orders from other states regarding school fee concessions. Otherwise, the minister will be responsible for the academic loss of children,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/schools-in-pune-city-to-restart-from-nov-23/story-MGEfoHv9o6bMHoeX9or1yH.html

21-11-2020||Arts||Click hear: This Mumbai duo beat pandemic blues with radio-era live gigs||Do you remember Saturday Date? That All India Radio show, popular from the ’60s until well into the ’90s, that played mailed-in requests from Bombay folks who wanted to hear easy-listening pop that everyone simply called English numbers? The 10pm weekend hour was a double treat – a rare chance to hear contemporary Western music and dedicate a song to a loved one. In the lockdown, one Mumbai cover band has given the long-forgotten format a 2020 revival. For Reena & Lindsay’s Saturday Date, requests pour in as Facebook posts. The set-list is determinedly retro — think Jim Reeves, Dolly Parton and stuff your uncle hums. But their weekly gigs on Facebook Live, beamed via mobile phone, with a living room sofa in the background, have become something of a weekend staple for thousands of fans around the world. “We started in May with hour-long gigs like the radio show,” says Reena Vaz, 42. “But people loved the idea and requests kept coming in. On Facebook, listeners can also see what others have picked and keep adding new songs.” An average of 500 requests are made every week. And what started as an hour-long show at 10pm now extends past midnight.  Sample their sound here:Lindsay Pitter, 50, Vaz’s partner and the other half of the cover band, says the secret lies in the playlist. “We play the music that the radio show would have aired, we even play bits of the signature title tune,” he says. “Christians loved that show. Their children grew up with these songs playing at home, and the community has spread around the world — some families, now in five different countries, coordinate on WhatsApp so they can all watch together.” Comments on the Facebook page have people saying they clear out Saturday-night chores to hear the band, or make a party of it with drinks and terrace barbecue. Nostalgia fans are tuning in from The Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Korea, and Malaysia. “I think it’s also because no radio channels really play this kind of music any more,” Vaz says. In a typical gig, Reena & Lindsay croon their way from The Bellamy Brothers and Kenny Rogers to the ’80s’ power ballads and ‘90s’ boy band harmonies. Ricardo Pereira, 42, a Mumbai-based travel service provider, has been watching the duo live for years. He’s now a regular at their Saturday Date. “It’s a great selection of songs and Reena and Lindsay have a nice sense of humour between their renditions,” he says. “It’s not quite like a live show, where the crowd would be dancing too, but it’s amazing to see the comments flying in as thousands more fans tune in.”The duo’s chemistry comes through too. Their professional and personal partnership goes back 20 years, to when they broke from a six-piece band to perform covers together. They’ve played parties, wedding receptions, hotel lounges and events and, before the pandemic, were typically booked for four to six nights a week. “There were 24 gigs in February alone,” Vaz says. “I was so exhausted, I just wanted to do nothing for one month.” The lockdown made them both regret that wish. It also gave Pitter the idea of playing virtually from home. “Even though we’re at home and the gig is free, we treat it like every other show,” he says. They dress in their stage outfits. Vaz puts on make-up and slips into heels, even though they’re never in the frame. The free gig has led to paid virtual engagements too, and offers to play to new audiences in Goa, Singapore and Uganda when it’s safer to travel. It’s also being monetised by Facebook’s Stars initiative, which allows users to shower stars, priced at one cent each, on popular performers. Foreign viewers have been especially benevolent. “They’ve rained stars down like the Milky Way,” Pitter says.Even when the pandemic ends, they say, neither is willing to give up Saturday Date. “We’ll move it to a different day, perhaps play a Sunday brunch so people in different time zones can tune in comfortably,” Pitter says. “It’s unbelievable how far and wide the show has reached. Someday, I’m going to write a book about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/click-hear-one-mumbai-duo-beat-pandemic-blues-with-a-retro-radio-revival/story-6JmniNcJQl6M2VcE7gQS7H.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra mulls freeze on flights, trains from Delhi as Covid-19 cases spike in Capital||The Maharashtra government is considering halting flight operations and train services between cities, including Mumbai, in the state and Delhi owing to a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in the national capital. Maharashtra chief secretary Sanjay Kumar said a final decision was yet to be taken on implementing the curbs. “We have been reviewing the situation. In the wake of surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, we need to take precautionary measures to ensure that Maharashtra is not affected. There are limited trains and flights operating between Delhi and Mumbai and other cities in Maharashtra. The decision to either curtail them further or stop them entirely will be taken in due course,” said Kumar.The issue was discussed at a recent review meeting, convened by Kumar, and the state government, according to officials, is also deliberating measures to ensure the infection does not spread through people entering Maharashtra from other cities and states that have high cases. Maharashtra government officials, however, said implementing a completing ban on flights and trains between Mumbai and Delhi will be difficult. “Central government will not concede to our proposal of entirely banning flights between Mumbai and Delhi, which is the busiest route in India. Even in May, when we had tried to push the resumption of flight services [between the two cities] by a few weeks, the Centre was firm on starting it immediately. In such a scenario, we will have to go for stricter screening of passengers at airports if we are not allowed to completely stop operations,” said a state government official, on condition of anonymity. Also Read: Covid-19 patients may be most infectious during first week after symptom onset: Study. “The policy will have to be uniform for the state and it cannot be only for Mumbai. The final decision is expected after a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.”Another official, on condition of anonymity, said trains not only originating from Delhi, but also passing through the national capital, will have to be stopped. He said it could be a tough task as it could halt travel from many other states in north India.The railway ministry, meanwhile, clarified that no decision had been taken regarding cancellation of trains on the Mumbai-Delhi route. “There have been reports in sections of media today about cancellation of certain trains on Delhi-Mumbai sector. It may be clarified that Railways has not taken any decision regarding cancellation of trains on Mumbai-Delhi sector,” the ministry tweeted on Friday.Railway officials, however, said that as earlier the West Bengal government had restricted movement of trains from places with high coronavirus cases, the Maharashtra government can do the same. “The decision will be taken by the railway ministry on the operation of trains between both the cities, but the Maharashtra government can propose on cancellations. Earlier, the West Bengal government had done the same, which included trains from Maharashtra,” said a senior Western Railway official, who did not wish to be named..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mulls-freeze-on-flights-trains-from-delhi-as-covid-19-cases-spike-in-capital/story-6FqCLG8nZRvDYIhOCvErsO.html
21-11-2020||Mumbai||64.52 lakh consumers in Maharashtra have not paid power bills since April: MSEDCL||Around 64.52 lakh consumers in the state have not paid a single rupee towards their power bills since April 1, recent data shared by the Maharashtra Electricity Distribution Company’s Limited (MSEDCL) showed. The state discom supplies power to over 2 crore consumers in the state.According to a circular issued by the state discom in November, non-payment of dues this year has amounted to ₹7,154 crore (till October). Of this, high-end user dues amount to ₹946 crore while low-end user dues across categories amount to ₹5,089 crore. It has further to recover close to ₹700 crore for power supplied for street lights and other utilities. As per data shared by MSEDCL, the total arrears as of October-end is ₹59,149 crore.According to the circular, it has assigned roles to various employees with a target to recover dues by the year-end. A senior official from MSEDCL said, “The employees have been asked to get in touch with consumers and public representatives to give them information about the various schemes and achieve their targets by year-end.”In August, the state had said that it was planning to waive excess bills by bearing the surplus amount for April, May and June. State energy minister Nitin Raut in October had also said that consumers will get good news during Diwali. However, on Tuesday, Raut announced that the state will not be able to provide any relief to consumers owing to its poor financial status and lack of aid from the Central government. The announcement came as a shock to thousands of consumers who had reported inflated bills after the lockdown period.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) slammed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, alleging that it had betrayed the people who were reeling under pandemic-induced problems.Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that Raut was misleading people by giving wrong statistics related to the losses to electricity companies. “The MVA government is cheating the people of Maharashtra. The announcement was done by some of the ministers after a cabinet meeting. Now they have been saying that it was not possible because of the financial burden. To cover up their failure, the ministers have now been pointing fingers at the Central government. The state government should not have announced the bill waiver in the first place when it was not possible to give one due to the financial constraints. The Centre was ready to give loans to the electricity companies, why did not the state government opt for it?” he said.Vishwas Pathak, BJP spokesperson, said, “So many people lost their jobs during the pandemic. The inflated bills just added to their woes. The government was expected to provide relief to the common man, but they could not. People have seen the insensitive face of this government again.”On Wednesday, Raut took to Twitter to say that the BJP could not recover pending dues even in “normal times”, and the losses mounted to ₹50,000 crore during its reign. “MSEDCL faced its biggest loss when BJP was in power. The losses just mounted during the Covid-19 period,” he said. Owing to the pandemic, the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) had suspended meter reading and asked discoms to charge consumers based on an average. However, since lakhs of consumers complained of hefty bills, the state energy department had proposed providing relief to consumers.As of Wednesday, a total of 37,048 complaints related to inflated bills have been received, of which 31,151 are of MSEDCL, 3,016 of BEST, 2158 of Tata Power and 723 of Adani Electricity. The power suppliers together have to recover ₹5,676 crore from consumers. The state had also sought a grant of ₹10,000 crore from the Centre to tide over the financial stress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/64-52-lakh-consumers-in-maharashtra-have-not-paid-power-bills-since-april-msedcl/story-tmlQwSYp5MuW1sfQ9RMjwK.html
21-11-2020||World||Trump’s attempts to overturn poll outcome fail, Biden forges ahead||Georgia on Friday certified President-elect Joe Biden as the winner in the state and Michigan Republicans declared they had seen nothing so far to warrant reversing the outcome in their state after a meeting with President Donald Trump, rebuffing his efforts to overturn the election.The Trump campaign can still seek a recount of the Georgia votes under the state’s law, but its Republican leaders appear in no mood to indulge the president and his allies’ efforts to question the election outcome, with nothing more than stray instances of irregularities and loads of allegations and wild theories.“We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan and, as legislative leaders, we will follow the law and follow the normal process regarding Michigan’s electors, just as we have said throughout this election,” Lee Chatfield, speaker of the Republican-controlled state House and Mike Shirkey, leader of the Republican-controlled state Senate, said in a joint statement after their meeting with the president at the White House.The meeting was unprecedented in itself and seen as a sign of the president’s growing desperation. In his first public appearance in days, the outgoing president falsely claimed once again he had won. It was a briefing on pricing of medicines but he took no questions.Trump has refused to admit defeat, launched legal challenges that have all fallen without impacting outcome, and his lawyers and allies have taken to citing conspiracy theories that have together tainted the election among the president’s supporters who, polls show, believe it was unfair.The Trump administration has refused to cooperate with the incoming Biden team, which has had to resort to workarounds to prepare itself to take charge on January 20, inauguration day. Biden met a bipartisan group of governors to discuss Covid-19, which he has said will be a top priority for his administration.He has also continued to announce members of his team. Indian American Mala Adiga was named on Friday as policy director to Jill Biden, the incoming first lady. She is a lawyer who earlier served in the departments of state and justice in the Obama administration, and had worked on the 2008 Obama-Biden campaign.The president-elect is expected to name members of his cabinet around Thanksgiving next week, and Vivek Murthy, another Indian American, is among leading contenders for secretary of health and human services. The former US surgeon general currently co-chairs Biden’s advisory team on Covid-19.Biden has also met CEOs and business leaders and the US chamber of commerce, the most powerful lobbyist for the private sector, has urged the president to start the transition process without any delay. Republican governors, who are critics of the president, have also joined in.The public face of the Trump administration’s obduracy is Emily Murphy, a Trump-appointee who heads the federal General Services Administration, which must under law officially issue an “ascertainment” recognising Biden’s election to kickstart the transition process. She has refused thus far.Asked if the Biden administration can get access to everything that they needed pending that ascertainment, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Friday that the administration has done “everything statutorily required, and we will continue to do that”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-attempts-to-overturn-poll-outcome-fail-biden-forges-ahead/story-jodf50mExXSTzxUGeUOtgM.html
21-11-2020||World||Trump tweets about voter ‘Fraud’ during G-20 opening meeting||As leaders from across the globe began a virtual summit discussing issues from the coronavirus pandemic to climate change, Donald Trump’s thoughts were elsewhere -- on the tussle over the US election.The president kept his head down, staring at something on his desk out of sight during a nine-minute speech on Saturday by Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz, who welcomed countries taking part in a meeting of the Group of 20 nations hosted by his kingdom. The speech and footage of other leaders was shown live on the official G-20 website.Then, within moments of the monarch ending his remarks, Trump tweeted to comment on an encounter with Republican leaders of the Michigan state legislature. He promised: “We will show massive and unprecedented fraud!”Trump’s post was in response to a tweet by Michigan Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, who met Trump at the White House on Friday along with House Speaker Lee Chatfield. “We have not yet been made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the election in Michigan,” Shirkey and Chatfield wrote in a joint statement.Trump went on to send further tweets alleging voter fraud and commenting on his son, who has been diagnosed with Covid. That’s even as leaders continued their discussions in private.The optics underscored Trump’s disinterest in such forums, with the president often clashing with other leaders during the past four years, especially on issues such as multilateralism, climate change and international trade.Trump subsequently gave his own opening remarks to the summit, where he said the US under his watch had made the world safer, strengthening NATO, defeating Islamic State and fighting terrorism, according to a European official with knowledge of the proceedings. He claimed America had been efficient in fighting the pandemic while touting low unemployment and what he said was surging demand in the US economy.Specifically on a Covid-19 vaccine, Trump repeated his long-held stance that “every American” who wanted one should have access, according to another official with knowledge of his remarks -- implying such shots should be optional. Unlike other leaders in their comments to the meeting, Trump did not speak of the need to share vaccines around the world, especially with poorer nations.After delivering his remarks to the summit, Trump left the White House shortly afterward for his Virginia golf club.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-tweets-about-voter-fraud-during-g-20-opening-meeting/story-UqO0QFZQ5rwDFGVteVK5NM.html

The Friday’s visit amounts to an acknowledgment of both the democratic system of CTA and its political head.Sangay was invited to the US State Department for the first time in 60 years last month.The CTA informed that Dr Sangay met with White House officials, and prior to this meeting, he had met them in undisclosed meetings and locations over a dozen times in the past 10 years since he became the CTA’s Sikyong in 2011.“Though he nears the end of his term as the Sikyong of the Central Tibetan Administration, Dr. Sangay has tirelessly advocated for the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019,” said the release.Earlier this week, Dr Sangay held several virtual meetings, through which he discussed Tibetan Policy and Support Act (TPSA) and other matters with the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China Chairman Jim McGovern and senior Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffers, both on the Republican and Democrat side.Representative Ngodup Tsering and Kelsang Dolma had also accompanied Dr Sangay on these meetings.In October, after Sangay was invited by the State Department, the Chinese government has asked the US to stop interfering in China’s internal affairs or undermining the development and stability of the country’s Tibet region.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily briefing in Beijing on Tuesday that Destro “violated the commitment and the policy stance of the US side on not supporting Tibet’s independence and not acknowledging this government in exile”.

21-11-2020||World||FATF urges G20 to set example, act now on money laundering||The G20 must start leading by example and act now to stop money laundering, said the Financial Action Task Force president Marcus Pleyer.“There are hundreds of ways to conceal the source of illicit money. It is one reason why so many countries’ financial systems are exposed to money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing. Yet even as the G20 publicly calls for the full implementation of Financial Action Task Force standards around the globe, not all G20 members have taken effective action to make a real difference,” Pleyer wrote in his article titled ‘Lead by Example’.The FATF president added that money laundering is not a “victimless crime” and the ramifications of ineffective action are real. “Failing to take action means organised criminals trafficking people, drugs, arms and wildlife, and corrupt stakeholders and terrorists, operating with impunity,” he added.“Taking the profits out of these crimes will protect people, the environment and the economy. The G20 must start leading by example and act now to stop money laundering. G20 members must root out criminality by tracing illegal profits,” the President wrote further.This year’s G-20 Summit is being held via video conferencing which began on Saturday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald among several other leaders sharing the platform.

21-11-2020||World||China’s Sinopharm says almost a million people inoculated with experimental Covid-19 vaccine||Nearly a million people have taken an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by Chinese company Sinopharm, the firm said, although it has not yet provided any clear clinical evidence of efficacy.China has been giving experimental Covid-19 vaccines to people including state employees, international students and essential workers heading abroad since July.Sinopharm’s chairman told media this week that nearly a million people have now received their vaccine for emergency use, though he did not provide a specific figure.“We have not received a single report of severe adverse reaction, and only a few had some mild symptoms,” Liu Jingzhen said in an interview re-published by the state-owned firm on Wednesday.China has been bullish about the development of its vaccine for the new virus -- which first emerged in the centre of the country late last year -- with four vaccines now in late-stage testing.Many of the trials are taking place overseas, as China has largely brought the virus under control within its borders.Sinopharm is testing two vaccines in late-stage trials in countries including the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Peru and Argentina.The company claimed this week to be “leading the world in all aspects” of vaccine development, although it did not offer clinical evidence from ongoing trials.Instead it cited anecdotal experiences from those who have been inoculated, including “construction personnel, diplomats, and overseas students” who it said have gone on to visit more than 150 countries after vaccination without being infected.President Xi Jinping has declared that any Chinese vaccine would be a “global public good”, after the country came under criticism, particularly from the US, for its early handling of the outbreak.Many who have been inoculated in China are not formal participants in drugmakers’ trials and are said to have done so voluntarily.Competition has intensified among pharmaceutical companies racing to develop a Covid-19 shot, with two vaccines -- one by US company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, and another by US firm Moderna -- publishing large-scale trial data this month that showed their jabs were around 95 percent effective against Covid-19.bys/rox/ohoPFIZERBioNTech||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-sinopharm-says-almost-a-million-people-inoculated-with-experimental-covid-19-vaccine/story-mF1bMhysC9I7gPX5miAGxO.html
21-11-2020||World||China used Covid-19 for strategic gains in Indo-Pacific: Think-tank||China used the Covid-19 crisis for strategic gains across the Indo-Pacific region, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) has said in a report which noted that the pandemic was replete with “significant” geopolitical ramifications.China’s increasingly active drive and India’s rivalry with Pakistan will continue to dominate the regional security environment when the pandemic dies down, said Strategic Survey 2020: The Annual Assessment of Geopolitics, which was launched virtually on Friday.“Competition intensified in the region. Beijing seemed steadily more intent on asserting strategic primacy in its maritime littoral. The US government…saw evidence that China was taking advantage of other governments’ preoccupation with the Covid-19 pandemic to gain strategic advantage throughout what the US, its allies and other states including India and Indonesia increasingly referred to as the Indo-Pacific region”, it said.In South Asia, according to IISS, the pandemic severely disrupted economies and tested governance and public-health infrastructure. Densely populated urban areas, poverty and poor sanitation, weak public health systems, and low testing rates by Asian standards challenged the region’s ability to limit infections and deaths.Reviewing the events and issues related to the changed constitutional realities in Jammu and Kashmir, the think-tank concluded that during the year, although India’s actions resulted in greater international attention, Indian diplomacy successfully ensured that it remained a bilateral issue with Pakistan and avoided international mediation.Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, senior fellow for South Asia at IISS, said: “In effect, for 2021, India is likely to see the resumption of ‘hard power’ geo-politics amidst growing Sino-Pakistani security convergences and relative neglect by the US and the ‘Quad’ countries [India, US, Australia, Japan] ....a tough year, amidst a dramatically weakened economy.”In his perception, South Asia’s geopolitics in 2021 will be shaped by US president-elect Biden’s relative neglect of the region (in view of his domestic priorities and foreign policy constraints with a likely Republican-controlled Senate).It will also be shaped, he added, by continuing Chinese assertiveness on the Sino-Indian border amidst growing influence amidst India’s neighbours and in the Indian Ocean due to regional economies weakened by the impact of Covid-19; and a decreasing focus on the Indo-Pacific from a ‘free and open’ region to one of ‘security and prosperity’ by the US and Japan.“As a result, for India, its key priorities will be: to adroitly counter the repercussions of a political transition in Afghanistan and resultant loss in influence, by seeking to engage with a likely Taliban-dominated Afghan government to prevent ‘safe haven’ for anti-India terrorists while attempting to shield itself from a possible civil war in Afghanistan; counter Chinese assertive policy by building on its own economic and military capabilities and focusing on extending its influence and leverage in the Indian Ocean; and managing tensions with Pakistan with the possibility of an escalation of conflict”, Roy-Chaudhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-used-covid-19-for-strategic-gains-in-indo-pacific-think-tank/story-lLocRwlSLs9ueqZnr3B5cN.html
21-11-2020||World||Iran closes businesses, curtails travel amid coronavirus surge||Iran on Saturday shuttered businesses and curtailed travel between its major cities, including the capital of Tehran, as it grapples with the worst outbreak of the coronavirus in the Mideast region.Top Iranian officials initially downplayed the risks posed by the virus outbreak, before recently urging the public to follow measures like wearing masks and avoiding unessential travel.Iran has recorded daily death tolls of above 430 over the past five days. The Iranian Health Ministry said on Saturday that the total number of confirmed cases has risen to above 840,000.The new lockdown measures, which include shuttering most businesses, shops, malls, and restaurants, include Iran’s largest cities of Mashhad, Isfahan, and Shiraz. Iranian authorities have designated the nearly 160 towns and cities affected as hot spots because these urban centers have the highest daily per capita positive coronavirus test results.On Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in a televised speech urged people to follow the measures to help “lessen the death toll.” He added that the government plans to supply cash subsidies to Iran’s 30 million poorest people for four months to help them to manage the economic fallout from the new outbreak.The latest round of restrictions to stem the outbreak came as a spat among top Iranian health officials led to the resignation of at least two officials.Iranian newspapers said Saturday that the deputy health minister in charge of research, Reza Malekzadeh, resigned from his post in reaction to recent remarks by the Minister of Health Saeed Namaki, who said government-led research projects were not successfully addressing the current needs of the ministry.In reply, Malekzadeh in his resignation letter criticized public mismanagement of the virus outbreak by the minister.“The pandemic’s very wrong management that was caused by a lack of consultation and paying attention to warnings from experts has led to a large number of human deaths,” Malekzadeh said in his statement.Iranian news websites also said that Ali Nobakht, an advisor to the health minister, resigned over similar reasons, without providing further details.In Tehran, the head of the city’s chamber of commerce, Qassem Nodeh, said that the restrictions will lead to the closure of 70% of business in the capital and its surrounding areas.Manoochehr Nassiri, who runs a lighting shop in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, complained about the closures.“We shop owners don’t know what to do, considering the economic situation of the country,” he said standing outside his shuttered store.The closures are set to last two weeks but can be automatically extended.Beginning on Saturday, government offices that provide essential public services —including banks, post offices, communications and utilities services —will continue their work with half of the regular number of staff. All other government offices will continue working with one third of their staff.All schools in the capital will also be closed and required to switch to virtual instruction by Internet. Authorities will also close shrines in Tehran and cancel mass prayers in mosques, though it was not immediately clear if the same restrictions would apply in other cities, including the holy city of Mashhad.Any travel between the affected cities by private car is also suspended. Public transportation will be available but the use of private cars is banned between 9 p.m. to 4 a.m.People who have tested positive for the virus are required to stay at home and can face a roughly $8 cash fine if they appear in public.Media organizations, construction jobs, agriculture, heavy industry, and services for the elderly and assisted living are largely exempt from the closures.Iran has avoided the full lockdowns seen in other countries as it struggles to keep its faltering economy alive in the face of crushing U.S. sanctions. President Donald Trump re-imposed sweeping sanctions on the country after withdrawing from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-closes-businesses-curtails-travel-amid-coronavirus-surge/story-sZ4hMpaYuGqIkdxDcHEhUN.html
21-11-2020||World||UK signs trade deal with Canada to prepare for Brexit||The UK signed an interim trade deal with Canada on Saturday, the second major agreement the country has reached as negotiators hurry to cement trading relationships in preparation for life outside the European Union.While Britain formally withdrew from the EU in January, it continues to trade with other countries under the bloc’s umbrella during a transition period that is scheduled to end Dec. 31. Without a series of new bilateral agreements, trade with countries around the world may be hampered by barriers such as tariffs and increased paperwork.The UK government says the stopgap agreement paves the way for future negotiations on a new tailor-made UK-Canada trade deal.“This is is a fantastic agreement for Britain which secures trans-Atlantic trade with one of our closest allies. British businesses export everything from electric cars to sparkling wine to Canada, and today’s deal will ensure that trade goes from strength to strength,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.“Our negotiators have been working flat-out to secure trade deals for the UK, and from as early next year we have agreed to start work on a new, bespoke trade deal with Canada that will go even further in meeting the needs of our economy.”The deal with Canada follows an agreement struck last month with Japan, which largely replicated existing trading arrangements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-signs-trade-deal-with-canada-to-prepare-for-brexit/story-Cu5V5SMTBexgtxiAjQE8IO.html
21-11-2020||World||Covid-19 vaccine updates: How Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate has taken the lead||American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech are racing against time to get their vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) approved now that final trial results have shown that their candidate has an efficacy rate of 95 per cent. Countries all over the globe are rolling out detailed roadmaps for immunisation and Pfizer has secured its rightful place in it.Here are the latest updates on the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine1. Britain has formally asked its medical regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), to assess the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for its suitability, the very first step in making the shot available outside of the United States. Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, which has been found to be 95% effective in preventing the spread of a virus that has killed more than 1.3 million worldwide. Britain expects to have 10 million doses of the vaccine, enough to protect 5 million people, by the end of the year if regulators approve it.2. Spain has announced its plan to vaccinate a majority of the population by mid-2021. Pfizer and BioNTech have taken the lead alongside US firm Moderna in the race for immunisation in Europe. The Spanish government has been working on a plan for vaccination since September. 3. Both the pharmaceutical companies sought approval on Friday to roll out their Covid-19 vaccine early, a first step towards relief as surging infections prompt a return to shutdowns that traumatised nations and the global economy earlier this year. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said its vaccines committee would meet on December 10 to discuss the request for emergency use authorisation4. Pfizer is eyeing a rapid roll out of coronavirus vaccine in Latin America once it gets emergency authorization from the US. The firm was aiming to supply around 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year, said Alejandro Cané, the North America chief of scientific and medical affairs for Pfizer’s vaccines division, adding that the under trial vaccine candidate had shown high efficacy across different ethnicities. Pfizer/BioNTech said doses of the vaccine would be ready for distribution “within hours” after US authorisation, which could mean shipments beginning in the second half of December. They would initially be provided by a US factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and a Belgian plant in Puurs.5. The Netherlands is all set to rollout coronavirus vaccines to some 3.5 million people in the first quarter of next year, the health minister announced on Friday. It has concluded deals for vaccines with five manufacturers: AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Janssen, CureVac and Sanofi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-updates-how-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-candidate-has-taken-the-lead/story-NfwaOSBNXO4bX1bVRGnmdK.html
21-11-2020||World||Supporters in Pakistan mourn the death of radical cleric who protested against France||Tens of thousands of supporters on Saturday thronged the funeral of a radical cleric whose Islamist party has defended Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy law that calls for the death penalty for insulting Islam.The mourners gathered in the eastern city of Lahore, where the Islamist scholar and leader, Khadim Hussein Rizvi, died two days ago at the age of 54.Rizvi’s party, Tehreek-e-Labiak, holds only two seats in parliament, but his movement has repeatedly pressed its cause by staging large-scale demonstrations.Rizvi led last Sunday thousands of his followers at a sit-in in the capital of Islamabad protesting the republishing in France of caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, which he deemed blasphemous. Demonstrators briefly clashed with security forces at the rally, which was one in a wave of protests across the country expressing outrage over the caricatures.Pakistan’s government promised on Tuesday that the protesters’ demands for cutting diplomatic ties with France and expelling the French ambassador would be discussed in parliament soon. A spokesman for the Tehreek-e-Labiak, said the government had also agreed to release any party members detained at the recent protests.The radical Islamist party gained prominence in Pakistan’s 2018 elections, campaigning on a single-point agenda of defending the country’s blasphemy law.In November 2017, its followers staged a 21-day protest and sit-in after a reference to the sanctity of the Prophet Muhammad was removed from the text of a government form.Rizvi led the protests last year, after Pakistani authorities freed Aasia Bibi, a Christian Pakistani woman held on death row for eight years on charges of committing blasphemy. A court acquitted her but she had to flee to Canada after threats to her life.The prophet caricatures published in France sparked protests across Asia and the Middle East, with calls for the boycott of French products. They were also seen as the trigger for several deadly attacks against French nationals and interests in recent weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supporters-in-pakistan-mourn-the-death-of-radical-cleric-who-protested-against-france/story-7miNPXN0FtNUX38Au7GK6L.html
21-11-2020||World||Pakistan’s FATF future seems grim with its continuous involvement in Afghanistan||While Pakistan retained its position on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) grey list and was given another opportunity to avoid being dragged down to the blacklist, its continuous involvement along the border with Afghanistan may not bode well for its future in terms of its FATF status aspirations.A few days before its full-scale review meeting, the FATF had reprimanded Pakistan for its ‘meagre progress’ in combating terror financing and money laundering, while the FATF’s Asia-Pacific Group (APG) had expressed dissatisfaction as Pakistan has so far only complied to only two of the 40 recommendations provided to address issues of anti-money laundering and combating financing terror, reported Don McLain Gill for Centre for Peace Asia.It is believed that the concessions granted to Pakistan have a lot to do with the presumption that Pakistan will toe a supporting line with the US amidst the crucial peace deal with the Taliban. However, shreds of evidence received from multiple intelligence reports suggest that Pakistan has starting nesting terror networks in Taliban safe havens of Afghanistan.Also Read | Pak opposition slams Imran Khan-led govt for failing to exit from FATF grey listThe Centre for Peace Asia wrote that although Pakistan has desperately tried to erase its footprints through its alleged ‘crackdown on terrorism’, evidence has pointed out that the relatively ‘unruled areas’ along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, particularly in the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktia, Khost, Paktika, Zabul and Kandhar in eastern Afghanistan have enabled Pakistan to set-up terror training camps and bases, with the active support and cooperation from the Taliban, Haqqani Network and Al-Qaeda.It can be assumed that a nexus has developed between the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, Haqqani Network, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) along with the Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-KP) in the region. Moreover, Pakistani agencies’ links with the IS-KP, the Haqqani Network, JeM and LeT remain exposed in recent times if some scattered dots are to be joined.Huzaifa al-Bakistani, who was killed in a drone strike in Nangarhar province was an ex-LeT member, who along with his father-in-law Aijaz Ahangar (Usman al Kashmiri), an ISKP leader and ex-member of Pakistan-backed groups, namely Tehreek-ul- Mujahideen (TuM) and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM), was looking after India-centric affairs of IS.The recent Jalalabad Jail attack in August 2020 was a joint effort of sections affiliated with the Pakistani agencies, ISKP and HQN which worked very closely.The threads associating Pakistani agencies with the IS-KP became more apparent after the arrest of Maulavi Abdullah Orakzai alias Aslam Farooqi on April 4, 2020. This galvanized Pakistan authorities to summon the Afghan Ambassador to Pakistan to seek custody of Aslam Farooqi. Pakistan reportedly claimed Farooqi on the grounds that he had committed acts of violence against the Pakistani state. However, Kabul refused to concede to the request, wrote Center for Peace Asia.These proxies, having lines of communication to Pakistan have planned on targeting Indian interests in Afghanistan such as the recent attack in the Sikh Shrine.Also Read | Erdogan’s Turkey sole supporter of Pak for removal from Grey List at FATF Paris PlenaryWhile Pakistan’s symbiotic relationship with the Taliban in Afghanistan is a dire necessity for gaining strategic depth against India, a renewal of the Afghan-Pak terror nexus may not go down well for peace in this already troubled Asian region.This series of events does not bode well for Pakistan’s desire to achieve a favourable status as an advocate of counter-terrorism, instead, this is only going to further complicate its standing in the FATF.Gill wrote that there would be much pressure put on the government to deal with Pakistan’s grey list status in the long term. Pakistan is clearly treading a complex path towards its goals of escaping the FATF grey list especially with its indirect involvement in Afghanistan.The country must significantly address the issues of terror support and financing while adhering to FATF recommendations to have the slightest chance of improving its status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-fatf-future-seems-grim-with-its-continuous-involvement-in-afghanistan/story-gOJaKSPlfb7c77pC2jr8jI.html
21-11-2020||World||UK to buy a million doses of AstraZeneca’s antibody treatment||The UK has agreed to buy a million doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 antibody treatment if it succeeds in Phase 3 trials.The company is recruiting 5,000 participants globally to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination, called AZD7442, to prevent infection for up to 12 months in people who can’t be given vaccines or don’t respond well to them.Long-acting antibodies can potentially “treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected with the virus,” the company said in a joint statement with the UK government. The antibody can also be taken prior to exposure to the virus, and can be complementary to a vaccine.AstraZeneca is playing catch-up as it prepares to report key findings from the vaccine it’s developing with the University of Oxford. Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE requested emergency authorization of their Covid vaccine, shown to be 95% effective, in the US on Friday. Moderna Inc. has also released positive interim results from a final-stage trial.“As we move closer to a Covid-19 vaccine, we must keep driving forward clinical trials for new and alternative treatments that protect our vulnerable, particularly those who cannot receive a vaccine,” U.K. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-buy-a-million-doses-of-astrazeneca-s-antibody-treatment/story-hfdplUBqfTSiasUlGfMnjK.html
21-11-2020||World||US vow of early exit from Afghanistan raises threat of resurgent Taliban||Afghanistan’s government is struggling to maintain its grip on power after President Donald Trump’s decision to accelerate US troop withdrawal from the war-torn nation emboldened the Taliban and other militant groups.The United Nations has noted a dramatic surge in violence since Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani’s government and the Taliban began peace talks in September, ranging from attacks on Afghan army bases to attempts to capture key cities including Kandahar. Terrorists have launched assaults on Kabul University and other educational centers, killing dozens of students and on Saturday, unknown assailants fired a deadly barrage of rockets that struck residential areas in the capital.Trump’s decision to drawdown US troops sooner, especially without any reciprocity from the Taliban, gives militants a free hand to try and gain control over the country by violent means, according to Michael Kugelman, senior associate for South Asia at the Wilson Center in Washington. Meanwhile, expecting a surge in violence, many Afghans are fleeing the nation.“The prospects of civil war increase when the US troop presence is no more,” Kugelman said, adding that the absence of American air power opens up the possibility of the insurgent group making a push into cities. “Once the Taliban starts taking urban territory, it will be easier to gain more political power, and from that point it’s easier to seize power on the whole.”Some of the recent violence has been blamed on the Taliban, who have ignored Ghani’s warnings about using the attacks to gain leverage in the peace talks. The Islamic State, active in several parts of the country, has claimed responsibility for other attacks.Also Read |  Mortar shells hit Kabul residential areas; at least 8 deadExperts and even some top officials in Ghani’s administration have warned that even worse scenarios are possible.Afghanistan’s National Security Adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, last month warned that the surging violence and the American departure could result in “civil war.”Meanwhile, Afghans have been voting with their feet.In a quiet exodus driven by an absence of hope, nearly half of all refugee arrivals in Greece are from Afghanistan, which by the end of last year was the country with the highest number of migrants, according to International Organization of Migration figures.“We’re all in a limbo now,” said Kamila Zafari, 24, a student at Kabul University. “The country has weak leadership but a strong Taliban who know only killing. In this anarchic situation, the US leaving further adds to our desperation and fears.”The militant group has welcomed the news that the US will reduce troops from about 4,500 to 2,500 by Jan 15, with Trump looking to a complete withdrawal by May 2021 to deliver on his longtime pledge to exit from his country’s “endless wars.”“The new US administration should focus on the implementation of the US-Taliban agreement as it the most reasonable and effective tool for ending the war between our countries,” Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid said about President-elect Joe Biden, in a WhatsApp message this week. The Taliban seek “positive relations” with all countries including the U.S. in the future, he said.Fears, DesperationAfter being toppled by the US invasion in 2001, the Taliban were pushed to the margins, before starting to regroup in 2004. They re-emerged as a potent threat to the US and its Afghan government allies since 2009 and now control about half the country.The Ghani administration and the insurgents have been locked in a delicate dance, made more complicated by the peace deal the Taliban entered with the US in February. That agreement paved the way for the start of the US-brokered talks between the government and militants in Doha on Sept. 12. Those have made little headway with both sides failing to agree on even the most basic issues so far.And while the Doha process plays in the background, both sides remain bitter antagonists on the ground in Afghanistan.The Taliban haven’t minced words in denouncing the officials and troops working for Ghani’s government as un-Islamic mercenaries whose “killing is not prohibited.”Also Read | US decision to reduce troops in Afghanistan, Iraq draws ireWhile some in the Afghan government, like Mohib, have voiced concerns about the growing intransigence of the Taliban, others have tried to downplay the impact of the US troop cuts and early departure.The country’s acting Defense Minister, Asadullah Khalid, told parliament on Tuesday that Afghan troops were now carrying out almost all counter-terrorism operations on their own. He cited major attacks in Helmand and Kandahar last month where government soldiers were able to kill thousands of Taliban militants in a weeks long standoff.But the government is also still holding onto hopes that American influence may turn the intra-Afghan peace talks around. The country’s Second Vice-President, Mohammad Sarwar Danish, recently called on the new US administration to “fully review” the peace talks and pressure the Taliban to give in and accept a cease-fire.“The Taliban have become very powerful and now control many remote areas despite the presence of NATO, US, and the Afghan government,” said Ahmad Saeedi, an independent political analyst in Kabul and a former Afghan diplomat in Pakistan. “Ghani’s government alone seems to be unable to stop Taliban ambitions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vow-of-early-exit-from-afghanistan-raises-threat-of-resurgent-taliban/story-wuh2xgLFusn6VxgStIFdNO.html
21-11-2020||World||Pakistani opposition warns of ‘street battles’ if force used to stop Peshawar rally||The opposition’s Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on Friday vowed to defy government ban on its public gathering in Peshawar on Sunday and warned the district administration that use of force to stop the protesting citizens could spark street battles.While speaking at a joint press conference at the Peshawar Press Club, the representatives of the opposition parties declared that rallies across the country will be held as the PDM planned, until Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government is removed, reported Dawn.This came after the Peshawar deputy commissioner had refused to allow the opposition to hold their rally scheduled for November 22 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.“The COVID-19 positivity rate [in] District Peshawar has presently exceeded 13 per cent, which is alarmingly high and any large public gathering is likely to further increase the spread of life-threatening virus. The undersigned regrets to inform you that permission for the said event has not been granted,” Dawn quoted the Peshawar deputy commissioner, reported Dawn.Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) central information secretary Dr Nafeesa Shah at a separate presser also warned the government against playing with the emotions of the masses, asking the administration to allow the 11-party opposition alliance to hold its Peshawar rally in a ‘peaceful’ manner.Expressing serious concern over the increasing prices of life-saving drugs, food items and other essential commodities, Dr Shah said the existing inflation was the outcome of bad governance.She further added the government was trying to hide behind the pandemic but warned that it would not find any route to escape.The PPP leader also alleged that the recent Gilgit-Baltistan election once again proved that the PTI had come to power through election engineering.Meanwhile, several other opposition leaders also condemned the administration for turning down the permission for the Sunday gathering during the press conference, and said the rulers were using different pretexts to disturb the people’s movement against the government, according to Dawn.They further warned the government that any attempt to create hurdles in the holding of PDM’s meetings would spark street protests.“We are ready to go to extreme point against government,” said Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter chief Senator Maulana Atta-ur-Rehman.The PDM had earlier held massive rallies in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan, demanding Prime Minister Imran Khan’s resignation.Meanwhile, opposition candidates have led protests in Gilgit Baltistan, who accuse the local election commission of delaying and manipulating the results of Sunday’s polls to favour Imran Khan’s PTI party.

21-11-2020||World||Trump administration has done ‘everything required’ in event of transition, says White House||The Trump administration has done “everything statutorily required” to do in the event of a transition, the White House has said, asserting that a constitutional process is being played out to determine the winner of the November 3 presidential election.Click here for full US Election 2020 coverageIncumbent US President Donald Trump, a Republican, has refused to concede the election to 78-year-old Joe Biden, a Democrat, and has filed multiple lawsuits challenging the poll results in several states. Trump, 74, has made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence.Former US vice president Biden was declared the winner of the closely-fought US presidential election on November 7. Biden now has 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232 votes. To win the race to the White House, the successful candidate should have at least 270 electoral votes out of the 538-member Electoral College. His lead in the public vote overall stands at more than 5.9 million.Backing President’s Trump’s stance, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany refused to acknowledge President-elect Biden’s victory in a press briefing on Friday— her first press briefing since October 1 and since President Trump lost the election. “The president’s been very clear, he wants every legal vote to be counted,” McEnany said. She did not say when Trump would concede, but said there were “very real claims” of voter fraud without identifying any evidence. “There is a Presidential Transition Act that determines exactly what an administration needs to do in advance of an election. And we have done everything statutorily required, and we will continue to do that,” McEnany asserted. Biden is set to take office on January 20 as the 46th US president.Meanwhile, after a string of court defeats in his efforts to challenge the election results, Trump’s team is hoping to convince legislatures controlled by his fellow Republicans in key states to ignore the outcome and declare him the victor, according to multiple US media outlets.In the absence of certification of the election and conceding by President Trump, the General Services Administration (GSA) has refrained from taking the steps necessary to ensure smooth transition of power to the incoming Biden administration, including the release of over USD 9 million for the Congressional-mandated transition team. Emily Murphy, the Administrator of the GSA, a Trump appointee, is yet to formally recognise Biden’s victory, thus denying him access to contacts with federal agencies and access to classified intelligence briefings. The delayed transition has sparked concerns about national security and the impacts it could have on the incoming Biden administration’s Covid-19 response, especially the distribution of a vaccine.“The GSA will make the determination of ascertainment at the right moment. Right now, there is a constitutional process that is being played out. There are questions being asked in court. But the GSA will determine when ascertainment is reached,” McEnany said in response to a question.There is ongoing litigation, she emphasised.“What we know, 74 million Americans voted for this President, that is more votes any President has got in history. It is really extraordinary. There are very real claims out there that the campaign is pursuing -- 234 pages of affidavits publicly available in one county alone; that is Wayne County. And two individuals in the canvassing board there that have declined to certify,” she said, referring to the most populous county in the US state of Michigan.Democrats accuse Trump of abusing his office by trying to pressure the legislators to subvert the will of voters and seat their own electors to the Electoral College, which gathers on December 14. Amid the row with Trump, President-elect Biden has sought to plough on with the transition, this week announcing appointments and meeting national security experts.On Friday Biden met two top Democratic legislators, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, to discuss how to help “struggling working families and small businesses” during the worsening coronavirus outbreak.

Future discussions will alternate between the US and Taipei, Brent Christensen, director of the American Institute in Taiwan, said in a briefing in Taipei on Saturday.Both sides agreed that strategic cooperation on the semiconductor industry is a mutual priority, and will push for further collaboration in supply chains, science and technology, 5G and telecommunications security and global health. The talks were led by US State Department Undersecretary of State Keith Krach and Taiwanese minister John Deng.The agreement can be extended another five years once the current pact is over, Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said, adding he was confident the MOU would be supported by the next US administration.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo launched the Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue with Taiwan in an effort to bolster cooperation. The talks follow repeated calls from Washington and Taipei for negotiations over a formal trade deal with Taiwan.Last month, 50 senators signed a letter urging US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to begin talks with Taipei. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen echoed the call earlier this week, saying a trade deal would further strengthen the complementary nature of the two economies.Also Read |  Taiwan ‘confident’ over trade deal with new US government under President-elect Joe BidenPressure on Lighthizer to begin trade talks has increased since Tsai lifted Taiwan’s restrictions on the import of US pork and beef in August, a long-standing impediment to a free-trade agreement with the US Since then, the Taiwanese government, industry groups and US political figures had urged the Office of the US Trade Representative to start talks with Taiwan. The USTR has so far given no indication it intends to do so.China has repeatedly signaled its displeasure over improving ties between Washington and Taipei. When Krach visited Taiwan in September, China called the trip a political provocation and sent military aircraft over the median line of the Taiwan Strait.China’s ruling Communist Party in Beijing claims the democratically ruled island as part of its territory despite never having controlled it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/u-s-taiwan-sign-pact-to-hold-annual-economic-talks-for-5-years/story-yHHNszsRASV1sccYebrs4M.html

No one took immediate responsibility for the early morning attack that also targeted the posh Wazir Akbar Khan area of Kabul, which houses diplomatic missions.The Taliban issued a quick statement denying any responsibility for the attack. The Islamic State group affiliate also operates in the area and has claimed responsibility for recent assaults in Kabul including two devastating attacks on educational institutions that killed more than 50 people, many of them students.As well as insurgent groups, there are several heavily armed warlords with militias living in Kabul with long-standing animosities against each other.The mortar barrage comes as representatives of the Afghan government and the Taliban continued to hold talks in Qatar, though progress has been slow. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to press for a reduction in violence in his meetings with both Taliban and government negotiating teams later Saturday during a daylong stop in Doha. The Taliban have mostly ignored such previous requests.Hours before the attack rattled Kabul, a bomb attached to a car killed one security personnel and wounded three others in an eastern neighborhood of the capital, said Kabul police spokesperson Ferdaws Faramarz.Violence in Afghanistan has spiked in recent months with increasingly horrific attacks often claimed by the Islamic State group affiliate. Still the Taliban have been waging near daily assaults on beleaguered Afghan security forces.There have been increasing calls for a cease-fire if peace talks are to continue. The Taliban have been steadfast in their refusal, demanding that any cease-fire be part of the negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mortar-shells-hit-kabul-residential-areas-at-least-8-dead/story-bAz18BqLBOhHDJ9dV32swJ.html
21-11-2020||World||Germany may extend lockdown to slow Covid-19 spread before Christmas||Germany’s partial lockdown may be extended well into next month as Europe’s biggest economy seeks to regain control over the spread of the coronavirus before people head home for the holidays.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Officials are beginning to assume that the current curbs will have to be extended and are aiming to see them lifted shortly before the holiday period, according to a person familiar with the matter.State leaders are considering reopening hotels and restaurants at least during the lucrative Christmas and New Year period so they can generate much-needed sales, the person said, declining to be identified because the talks are private. Officials would look at reinstating the controls in January if the infection rate is still considered to be too high, the person added.More than two weeks into a partial shutdown -- which closed museums, bars and restaurants but kept schools and most shops open -- Germany’s contagion rates are still above the level that authorities have determined to be manageable, raising the prospect of tougher curbs over the festive period. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier entered quarantine on Friday after contact with an infected colleague, though Altmaier himself has tested negative.Still, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the one-month circuit breaker is effective and managed to “break the exponential growth” in new infections. “We agree that this is not enough, but it has succeeded -- once again,” Die Welt quoted the minister as saying.Also Read | Germany to prioritize vaccinations in care homesGermany added nearly 23,000 new coronavirus infections as of Saturday morning, lifting total cases to more than 900,000. The regions of Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony posted the highest infection rates recently, and the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care has “risen sharply” since mid-October, the Berlin-based Robert Koch Institute said.Government PlanChancellor Angela Merkel will meet with state leaders on Wednesday to lay out a long-term plan to fight the pandemic under mounting pressure to lift restrictions. The German leader drew widespread criticism from state leaders this week for proposing that children be limited to just a single playmate and that face masks should be mandatory in schools.There is far-reaching consensus that Germany’s lockdown should be prolonged until Dec 20, Berliner Morgenpost reported earlier, citing people from the state government in Berlin whom it didn’t identify.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-may-extend-lockdown-to-slow-covid-19-spread-before-christmas/story-Cfx2maJvlNwKSut7NZVnWJ.html

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Beijing in July of violating Tibetan human rights and said Washington supported “meaningful autonomy” for the region.Beijing officials have since accused the United States of using Tibet to try to promote “splittism” in China. China has also refused to engage with Destro.China seized control over Tibet in 1950 in what it described as a “peaceful liberation” that helped it throw off its “feudalist past”, but critics led by the exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama say Beijing’s rule amounts to “cultural genocide”.Chinese President Xi Jinping said in August that China needed to build an “impregnable fortress” in Tibet in order to protect national unity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tibetan-political-leader-visits-white-house-for-first-time-in-6-decades/story-jCaLlTZC6jPZnM7waFG5DK.html

Confirmed cases touched 320,417 on Friday, up nearly 5,000 over the previous day and a nearly 40% spike over a fortnight. Deaths stood at 11,334, with the daily toll going up by over 50% when compared to 14 days earlier.The provincial government of Ontario announced new lockdown measures beginning Monday including in Toronto. In-restaurant services will cease and non-essential businesses and malls will be impacted. These measures will remain in place for up to 28 days.Trudeau also supported the re-imposition of restrictive measures in the coronavirus hotspots. “Going into lockdowns and supporting businesses while we’re in that lockdown is a better way of ensuring their success in a few months, in a few years, than trying to tough through a virus that is running around unchecked.”Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr Theresa Tam asked for “urgency” from the public to limit their contacts, adding, “We’re not on a good trajectory.”In returning to the daily coronavirus update similar to this spring when cases first emerged, Trudeau said he was using his voice and position as PM to send out a clear message that “we’re in a serious situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/normal-christmas-out-of-question-says-trudeau-as-toronto-set-to-enter-lockdown/story-8I7ACaKGeJ9dcuNOUyX6MP.html
21-11-2020||World||Recent breakthroughs on Covid-19 vaccines offer ray of hope: UN chief Guterres||UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has described the recent breakthroughs towards development of Covid-19 vaccines as a “ray of hope” that needs to reach everyone and called on the G-20 nations to support the global collaboration to accelerate development of coronavirus treatments and drugs.This week, global drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech said their Covid-19 vaccine candidate is 95 per cent effective, including in adults over 65 years of age. “The recent breakthroughs on Covid-19 vaccines offer a ray of hope. But that ray of hope needs to reach everyone,” Guterres said at a news conference on Friday.“That means ensuring that vaccines are treated as a global public good — accessible and affordable to everyone, everywhere. A people’s vaccine. This is not a ‘do-good’ exercise. It is the only way to stop the pandemic dead in its tracks,” he said.Asserting that “solidarity is indeed survival”, Guterres said that the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator and its COVAX Facility are the vehicles to get nations there.Based on current projections, the companies expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. The major announcement came just days after Moderna said its virus vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.5 per cent.The announcements about the vaccines and their potential availability for use among the general population in the coming weeks and months has offered hope to millions around the world in a year that has seen the COVID-19 pandemic devastate lives and economies with no signs of abating.So far, the coronavirus has infected more than 55 million people around the world and killed over 1.3 million people even as governments implemented strict lockdowns and restrictions to slow the spread of the virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. A second wave of infections is threatening to derail economies and impact lives again as countries had gradually begun to ease restrictions and open up.Guterres said that over the past seven months, countries have invested USD 10 billion in the effort to develop vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics but that USD 28 billion more are needed — including USD 4.2 billion before the end of the year. “This funding is critical for mass manufacturing, procurement and delivery of new COVID-19 vaccines and tools around the world. G20 countries have the resources. I am urging all of them to fully support the ACT-Accelerator,” he said, referring to the global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to Covid-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. Launched at the end of April 2020, the ACT- Accelerator brings together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, and philanthropists and global health organisations (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI, FIND, Gavi, The Global Fund, Unitaid, Wellcome, the WHO, and the World Bank).Guterres, however, voiced concern that vaccine myths and wild conspiracies continue to spread on social media, saying it is unfortunate that there is no vaccine for misinformation.“Our UN communications networks are working to build vaccine confidence with factual, reliable and persuasive content — and reaching out to social media platforms to strengthen public trust. All of these efforts are vital to save lives and provide an exit strategy out of this global economic and human crisis,” he said.Responding to a question on whether common policies have been agreed or will be discussed for the distribution of the vaccine during the G20 summit, he said there are now more than 160 countries that have committed to the COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator.“The COVAX will be a system of coordination of the investments needed, both for the development, the production, and the distribution of the vaccines,” he said, adding that beyond the COVAX, there are other initiatives of different countries that are intending to buy vaccines for their own people. “And of course, I don’t blame a government that decides to protect its own people, but this needs to be done combined with their commitment to COVAX.” Guterres said several developed countries that have their own programmes already have joined the COVAX and already have invested in the COVAX to obtain vaccines also from the COVAX. “So, I’m hoping that the COVAX will be the main instrument to guarantee that, indeed, vaccines will become a global public good available and affordable for all. And the G20 has a very important role, and I appeal to all G20 members to become members of the COVAX.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/recent-breakthroughs-on-covid-19-vaccines-offer-ray-of-hope-un-chief-guterres/story-0Unop4s9lnEXYva2pjoWWL.html
21-11-2020||World||Indian-American uses Bollywood music to spread message of Biden and Harris during US polls||A Silicon Valley-based Indian-American entrepreneur used Bollywood music to effectively take the message of President-elect Joe Biden and his deputy Kamala Harris to the diverse community members in multiple languages during the just concluded presidential elections.Earlier this year, entrepreneur Ajay Jain Bhutoria voluntarily designed an innovative multi-lingual campaign based on some popular Bollywood numbers with the idea that Indian-Americans will feel more connected with Biden when campaign volunteers reach out to them in their language.“There were complaints that Indian-Americans don’t vote. But I ask, ‘have you ever reached out to them in their language?’ When a campaign volunteer speaks to a voter in their language, they are more likely to listen,” Bhutoria told PTI in an interview.“Not necessary all Indians speak English,” he said, adding “people get connected when someone talks to them in their language.” He launched several viral digital outreach campaigns in many Indian languages to attract all the Indians across the US.Slogans like- “America Ka Neta Kaisa Ho Joe Biden Jaisa Ho”, “Trump Hatao America Bachao”, “Biden-Harris ko Jitao, America ko aage badao” and “Jaago America Jaago- Biden Harris ko Vote do”- were released in 14 Indian languages.At a time when every vote mattered, particularly in the battleground states, Bhutoria said his purpose was to reach out to every Indian-American with the message of their party candidate in the language they spoke and the medium they understood.Bhutoria and his wife Vinita released the video “Chale Chalo, Chale Chalo Biden Harris ko Vote do” (Let’s go vote for Biden Harris) which was a super hit with the Indian-American community.This was the first-ever South Asian musical video for the presidential campaign. He said that “people connect with music, food, language, and culture.” “There was lots of excitement,” he said, adding that “the vast majority had never experienced such campaign outreach previously.” “We present the diversity of people in our community, inspired by Biden’s vision of hope and change,” reads the video’s description. “We come from all ages, places, and professions, but we are united in our passion for a candidate who represents our common values,” he said in response to a question.Based out of Fremont in California, Bhutoria is an influential Indian-American community leader, political activist, author and tech entrepreneur. For over a decade, he has served as a prominent leader in the Democratic Party’s National Finance Committee. He has served as a national leader of the Asian-American Pacific Islander (AAPI) on the Biden 2020 campaign and in the Biden South Asian Foreign Relations Policy Committee.Born in Rajasthan, Bhutoria was raised in Guwahati, Assam.Inspired by his father, Bhutoria, like many immigrants, came to the US with a suitcase and an empty bank account, searching for limitless opportunity.He began his career of political activism by getting involved with the 2008 Obama for America presidential campaign, as a community leader for the Democratic National Committee and its National Finance Committee.Drawing inspiration from Obama, he became closely involved to boost civic engagement and drive national Indo-American political participation.Bhutoria hosted former President Bill Clinton at his home for the 2016 presidential campaign and was a co-host for Hillary Clinton fundraisers over 20 times in various events, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, eBay CEO John Donahue, and LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman. He has raised a substantial amount of funds and co-led the AAPI leadership council for Hillary for president.He was probably the only Indian-American to have flown in from California to be present in Philadelphia on May 18, 2019, when Biden formally launched his presidential campaign. “I believe it is only he (Biden) who can put the United States back on the path of development. The United States needs to lead the world,” Bhutoria then told PTI after the launch event.A few months later, he hosted Dr Jill Biden in a national effort to raise funds for the Biden Campaign at his residence. In addition to raising grassroots funds for the campaign, Bhutoria said he focused on ensuring that 1.3 million Indian-American votes in the swing states were delivered for Biden. He helped strengthen and build the AAPI for Biden Leadership and grassroots team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-uses-bollywood-music-to-spread-message-of-biden-and-harris-during-us-polls/story-4C7bL2zqssIpzdJzhX7OCK.html
21-11-2020||World||Taiwan ‘confident’ over trade deal with new US government under President-elect Joe Biden||Taiwan’s foreign minister voiced confidence on Saturday that the incoming government of US President-elect Joe Biden would support a long sought-after bilateral trade agreement, following high level economic talks with the outgoing administration.Last month, Frank Jannuzi, a key Biden aide when the president-elect was in Congress, wrote that Washington should prioritise free trade negotiations with Taiwan to encourage others, including Britain, the European Union and Japan, to follow suit.In August, Taiwan eased restrictions on imports of US pork and beef, which had been a stumbling block to free trade talks.Speaking in Taipei after Taiwan-US economic talks, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu noted the cross-aisle support for Taiwan’s meat decision, as well as October’s call by 50 US senators from both parties for President Donald Trump’s administration to begin negotiating a trade deal with the island.“I think bipartisan support on Capitol Hill is still very strong, and I think that kind of support for a Taiwan-US BTA will continue into the new administration,” Wu said.Friday’s talks, under the auspices of a new Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue, were not related to a possible trade deal, instead focusing on areas including science and technology, supply chain restructuring and 5G networks.In a nod to tech-heavyweight Taiwan’s importance as a global chip maker for the likes of Apple Inc, Taiwan’s government said both sides “confirmed that strategic cooperation on the semiconductor industry is a mutual priority”.The world’s biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, announced plans this year for a $12 billion semiconductor factory in Arizona, a move US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said would increase US economic independence from China. The US State Department said in a statement on the talks that the two agreed to negotiate a science and technology agreement, and that future talks would help strengthen their economic relationship and “our shared commitment to free markets, entrepreneurship, and freedom”.The dialogue, held virtually and in person in Washington, is part of increased US engagement with Taipei by the Trump administration which has angered Beijing. China claims the democratic island as its sovereign territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-confident-over-trade-deal-with-new-us-government-under-president-elect-joe-biden/story-dFtznmd5SLszZ2CNFVbIaM.html

They asked not to be identified because Biden hasn’t announced a nominee.The president-elect may yet make history by appointing a woman to lead the Treasury Department for the first time. Janet Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, would meet his description of a person acceptable to the entire party. Progressives support her in part because she has endorsed the idea of taxing carbon emissions to fight climate change.Biden said Thursday that he had decided on a nominee but wouldn’t say who it is. However, he gave a clue, telling reporters that his choice “is someone who I think is, will be accepted by all elements of the Democratic Party, from the progressive to the moderate coalitions.”Brainard is opposed by some liberal groups because of perceptions she defended the Obama administration’s conciliatory position toward China and hasn’t advocated for strong climate change policies while at the Fed.Brainard declined to comment through a Fed spokesperson. Yellen also declined to comment.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fed-governor-lael-brainard-frontrunner-for-new-us-treasury-secretary-falls-behind-in-race/story-vwiFNdGULykxZyFzNqTzmM.html

Many have pinned their hopes on vaccines as reports of two of them, including the candidates of Pfizer and Moderna, being highly effective and others clearing advanced stages of trials come in.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageExperts have highlighted several concerns that lie ahead as the world seeks to come up with a fair system for distribution of vaccines once they are out.The rush to buy in advancePfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine candidate BNT162b2 was recently found to be 95% effective without any major safety concerns and Moderna announced that preliminary phase three trial data showed its vaccine was 94.5% effective.Even as none of these vaccines has been approved yet, countries are purchasing doses in advance. According to Duke University in North Carolina, 6.4 billion doses of potential vaccines have already been bought, and another 3.2 billion are either under negotiation or reserved as “optional expansions of existing deals”, the BBC reported.When can countries expect a working vaccine?Clare Wenham, assistant professor of global health policy at the London School of Economics, told BBC that whichever country can pay the most in early stages of production of the vaccine would get to the front of the line and the “vast majority” of vaccine doses that have been bought so far have been by high-income countries.Also Read: Bharat Biotech to recruit volunteers for trial, Pfizer files for emergency use authorisationWhile Serum Institute of India has said it will keep half of all doses it produces for domestic distribution, Indonesia is partnering with Chinese vaccine developers and Brazil is partnering with the trials run by the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “equitable distribution is particularly important in the area of vaccines, which, if used correctly and equitably, could help to stop the acute phase of the pandemic and allow the rebuilding of our societies and economies.”Pfizer has said it hopes to produce up to 50 million doses in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021 and Moderna too has also shown promising results. The Moderna vaccine also has fewer requirements around keeping it cold, which has been a concern for poorer countries, particularly in warmer areas.WHO’s equitable vaccine distribution planA landmark global vaccine plan by WHO known as Covax seeks to ensure an equitable distribution of future coronavirus vaccines. “Once a vaccine(s) is shown to be safe and effective, and authorized for use, all countries receive doses in proportion to their population size, albeit initially in reduced quantities. This will enable every country to start by immunizing the highest priority populations,” WHO advises.“In the second phase, vaccines would continue to be deployed to all countries so that additional populations can be covered according to national priorities,” the organisation adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-some-countries-rush-to-buy-covid-19-vaccine-in-advance-will-others-be-left-out/story-5LfkOukjrOSfQXYMb4bodP.html
21-11-2020||World||Twitter to hand @POTUS account to Joe Biden on inauguration day||Twitter will hand control of the presidential @POTUS account to Joe Biden when he is sworn in on inauguration day, even if President Donald Trump has not conceded his election loss, US media reported Friday.The social media giant is “actively preparing to support the transition of White House institutional Twitter accounts on January 20th, 2021,” Twitter spokesperson Nick Pacilio told Politico in an email.The process is being done in consultation with the National Archives, as it was in 2017, he said.The handover will see all existing tweets on @POTUS, as well as @FLOTUS, @VP and other official accounts, archived.The accounts will then be reset to zero tweets and transferred to the incoming Biden White House that day. Trump, who still has not conceded his November 3 loss, used Twitter to help build his political brand and, later, wield the power of the presidency -- though he mainly uses his personal account, @realDonaldTrump, whose 88 million followers dwarf @POTUS’s 32 million.The @POTUS account is largely used to retweet Trump’s personal account as well as the White House and other accounts.Trump’s frequent habit of abruptly announcing new policies on the platform has led to long-standing complaints of governing by tweet.Twitter has long come under pressure to curb the president’s use of the site to spread misinformation and conspiracy theories.Since the election the company has slapped warning labels on many Trump tweets as he continues to insist, despite evidence to the contrary, that he won the vote, and that Biden’s victory is down to massive fraud.Biden, for his part, is a far more sedate Twitter user. He has sent less than 7,000 tweets to his 19 million followers, compared to Trump’s 58,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-to-hand-potus-account-to-joe-biden-on-inauguration-day/story-OjiFhuRyDKOo6TXlFAIfdK.html
21-11-2020||World||At least 8 dead as barrage of rocket fire hits Kabul||At least eight people were killed Saturday when a barrage of rockets struck densely populated parts of Kabul, officials said, marking the latest attack in an ongoing wave of violence sweeping the Afghan capital.“The terrorists fired 23 rockets on the city of Kabul. Based on the initial information, eight people were martyred, and 31 others were wounded,” said interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian, who blamed the Taliban for the attack. A police source also confirmed the toll.The salvo slammed into various parts of central and north Kabul -- including near the heavily fortified Green Zone that houses embassies and international companies -- just before 9:00 am (0430 GMT).“This morning, the terrorists fired 14 rockets on the city of Kabul,” interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said. Photos and videos circulating online showed several buildings with damage to walls and windows, including at a large a medical complex.No group immediately claimed the blasts and the Taliban denied responsibility.Recent big attacks in Kabul, including two horrific assaults on educational institutions that killed nearly 50 people in recent weeks, follow a familiar pattern in the aftermath, with the Taliban denying any involvement while the Afghan government pins the blame on them or their proxies. “The rocket attack in Kabul city has nothing to do with the mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said, using the insurgents’ name for Afghanistan.“We do not blindly fire on public places.”The Taliban are under pressure not to attack urban areas, having pledged not to do so under the terms of a US withdrawal deal signed in February.Any acknowledgement of overt involvement in such incidents could in theory slow the American pull-out, though outgoing US President Donald Trump has made clear that he wants US forces out regardless of the situation on the ground. The Islamic State group claimed the two attacks on educational centres, but Kabul said the Taliban’s ultra-violent Haqqani network was responsible. - Pompeo heads to Doha -Taliban and Afghan government negotiators launched peace talks in Doha in September but progress has been slow and violence has raged across Afghanistan regardless.Officials told AFP on Friday however that a breakthrough was expected to be announced in the coming days, and the US State Department announced late Friday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would meet negotiators from the Taliban and the Afghan government in Doha. Trump has repeatedly vowed to end “forever wars,” including in Afghanistan, America’s longest-ever conflict that began with an invasion to dislodge the Taliban following the September 11, 2001 attacks.President-elect Joe Biden, in a rare point of agreement, also advocates winding down the Afghanistan war although analysts believe he will not be as wedded to a quick timetable.Earlier this week, the Pentagon said it would soon pull some 2,000 troops out of Afghanistan, speeding up the timeline established in a February agreement between Washington and the Taliban that envisions a full US withdrawal in mid-2021.In the past six months, the Taliban carried out 53 suicide attacks and 1,250 explosions that left 1,210 civilians dead and 2,500 wounded, interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said this week.The interior ministry said two small “sticky bomb” explosions had been reported earlier Saturday morning, including one that hit a police car, killing one policeman and wounding three others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multiple-blasts-rock-kabul-casualties-feared-report/story-EAVarcjkOgMK1Mw0fgUr2O.html
21-11-2020||World||Covid-19: Air travel bubble with Hong Kong to begin on Sunday as planned, says Singapore||The uncertainty surrounding the high-profile Hong Kong-Singapore air travel bubble has eased after Singapore’s civil aviation authority on Saturday announced that its planned travel bubble with the former British colony will commence on Sunday as planned, despite a surge in Hong Kong’s cornovarius disease (Covid-19) cases.“Hong Kong has a comprehensive public health surveillance system and the overall incidence rate is still low,” the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said in a statement on Saturday, explaining why the travel bubble would proceed ahead as planned.Hong Kong reported 45 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, its highest daily count in three months, a day after reporting 26 cases, of which 21 were local.The uncertainty surrounding the bubble had risen after Hong Kong on Friday announced several measures to control what authorities here described as a probable “fourth wave” of Covid-19.“Hong Kong’s epidemic has shown rapid deterioration and experts have said the fourth wave is inevitable,” secretary for food and health Sophia Chan had said in a briefing on Friday. “We have done a series of measures to strengthen control, but we still see the situation turning bad,” she had further said. Various measures announced by the Hong Kong government to control the virus’ spread include suspension of classes for primary school levels 1 to 3 for two weeks starting November 23, as well as mandatory mass testing among certain groups.Commenting on the situation, the CAAS had said on late Friday it was working closely with the Singapore health ministry to “gather the facts.” Responding to queries on whether the air bubble would indeed proceed ahead as planned, it said, “The Singapore and Hong Kong governments are in close contact on the situation.”Hong Kong and Singapore had entered talks over a possible air travel bubble last month and, last week, confirmed November 22 as the start date of the bubble. This arrangement between the two financial hubs is the world’s first quarantine-free travel arrangement open to all residents. Under the agreement, the travel bubble would be suspended for two weeks once the seven-day moving average of local, untraceable cases on either side rise to over five.Hong Kong’s figure is currently at 2.14 and will be exceeded if more than 22 unlinked cases are reported over the next three days, the CAAS said,(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-hong-kong-witnesses-fourth-stage-of-covid-19-concerns-rise-over-air-travel-bubble-with-singapore/story-HuXTHgWyHgVWZWdoRnV8FK.html
21-11-2020||World||Indian-American doctor identifies possible Covid-19 treatment||An Indian-American scientist has discovered a potential strategy to prevent life-threatening inflammation, lung damage and organ failure in patients diagnosed with Covid-19. Published online in the journal Cell, the research coming from the lab of Dr Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, an Indian-born researcher working at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee, identified the drugs after discovering that the hyperinflammatory immune response associated with Covid-19 leads to tissue damage and multi-organ failure in mice by triggering inflammatory cell death pathways. The researchers detailed how the inflammatory cell death signaling pathway worked, which led to potential therapies to disrupt the process. “Understanding the pathways and mechanism driving this inflammation is critical to develop effective treatment strategies,” said Kanneganti, vice chair of the St Jude Department of Immunology. Kanneganti was born and raised in Telangana. She received her undergraduate degree at Kakatiya University in Warangal, where she majored in Chemistry, Zoology, and Botany. She then received her M.Sc. and Ph.D from Osmania University in India. She joined St. Jude, in Memphis, Tennessee, USA, in 2007. “This research provides that understanding. We also identified the specific cytokines that activate inflammatory cell death pathways and have considerable potential for treatment of Covid-19 and other highly fatal diseases, including sepsis,” she said. The other researchers were Shraddha Tuladhar, Parimal Samir, Min Zheng, Balamurugan Sundaram, Balaji Banoth, R K Subbarao Malireddi, Patrick Schreiner, Geoffrey Neale, Peter Vogel and Richard Webby, of St. Jude; and Evan Peter Williams, Lillian Zalduondo and Colleen Beth Jonsson, of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Covid-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The infection has killed more than 1.2 million people in less than one year and sickened millions more. The infection is marked by increased blood levels of multiple cytokines. These small proteins are secreted primarily by immune cells to ensure a rapid response to restrict the virus. Some cytokines also trigger inflammation. The phrase cytokine storm has been used to describe the dramatically elevated cytokine levels in the blood and other immune changes that have also been observed in Covid-19, sepsis and inflammatory disorders such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), St Jude’s said in a statement. But the specific pathways that initiate the cytokine storm and the subsequent inflammation, lung damage and organ failure in Covid-19 and the other disorders were unclear. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that comprehensively define cytokine storm was also lacking. Kanneganti’s team focused on a select set of the most elevated cytokines in Covid-19 patients. The scientists showed that no single cytokine induced cell death in innate immune cells, it said. “The findings link inflammatory cell death induced by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma to Covid-19,” Kanneganti said. “The results also suggest that therapies that target this cytokine combination are candidates for rapid clinical trials for treatment of not only Covid-19, but several other often fatal disorders associated with cytokine storm,” she said. “We were excited to connect these dots to understand how TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma trigger PANoptosis,” said co-first author Rajendra Karki, a scientist in the Kanneganti laboratory. “Indeed, understanding how PANoptosis contributes to disease and mortality is critical for identifying therapies,” added co-first author Bhesh Raj Sharma, a scientist in the Kanneganti laboratory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-doctor-identifies-possible-covid-19-treatment/story-ez0uOaOl6Lwfa6REVUaNFO.html
21-11-2020||World||Google, Facebook and Twitter threaten to leave Pakistan over new rules||Internet and technology companies have threatened to leave Pakistan after the government granted blanket powers to authorities to censor digital content, a move critics say was aimed at curtailing freedom of expression in the conservative Islamic nation.Thursday’s warning from the Asia Internet Coalition, which represents global technology giants including Google, Facebook and Twitter, comes after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan granted enhanced powers to government media regulators Wednesday.Also Read: Imran Khan drags India into his letter to Facebook opposing IslamophobiaThe coalition said it was “alarmed by the scope of Pakistan’s new law targeting internet companies, as well as the government’s opaque process by which these rules were developed.”Under the new regulations, social media companies or internet service providers face a fine of up to $3.14 million for failure to curb the sharing of content deemed to be defamatory of Islam, promoting terrorism, hate speech, pornography or any content viewed as endangering national security.Social media companies are required to provide Pakistan’s designated investigation agency “with any information or data in decrypted, readable and comprehensible format,” according to Pakistan’s DAWN newspaper. Pakistan also wants the social media companies to have their offices in the country.The coalition said the “draconian data localization requirements will damage the ability of people to access a free and open internet and shut Pakistan’s digital economy off from the rest of the world.” It said the new rules will make it difficult for its members “to make their services available to Pakistani users and businesses.”There was no immediate comment from Khan’s government, which has repeatedly said it was not against freedom of expression.Khan’s office had previously said the new rules were made after observing a delayed response in the removal of anti-Pakistan, obscene and sectarian-related content by social media sites since 2018, when Khan’s government came into power.Under the new regulations, social media companies are required to remove or block any unlawful content from their websites within 24 hours after being reported by Pakistani authorities.The latest development comes weeks after Khan’s government temporarily banned the video-sharing platform TikTok, saying it took the step after receiving complaints of “immoral and indecent” content.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-new-rules/story-LIBChHJbeR9Vjy2CYJs9dJ.html

Wham posted a picture of himself holding the sign on his social media accounts.The rights campaigner, who has already served two brief stints in jail this year, faces a fine of up to $5,000 Singaporean dollars (US$3,723). “These charges against me only show how absurd the situation has become,” Wham said in a text message. “Calling what I did an assembly is an abuse of the English language. How can one man standing in public for a few seconds for a photo-op be a threat to public order?” Wham argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-man-faces-action-for-holding-up-smiley-outside-police-station/story-euA4dHbK7z4RPFfqaMOcOO.html
21-11-2020||World||Mike Pompeo visits Israel museum honoring Christian Zionists||Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrapped up a trip to Israel on Friday with a visit to a museum in Jerusalem that honors Christian Zionists and was founded by a prominent evangelical adviser to the Trump administration.The museum visit came a day after Pompeo became the first secretary of state to visit an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank. He also announced a new policy allowing settlement products exported to the US to be labeled “made in Israel” and a new initiative to combat the Palestinian-led international boycott movement.Christian Zionism is a belief by some Christians that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land and the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 were in accordance with biblical prophecy.The Friends of Zion Museum was founded by Mike Evans, a prominent evangelical supporter of Israel. Evangelical Christians are among President Donald Trump’s most loyal supporters and have hailed his unprecedented support for Israel. They would also be an important constituency should Pompeo pursue elected office following Trump’s presidency.Pompeo did not deliver any public remarks at the museum and departed Israel midday.The Trump administration has broken with decades of US policy to support Israel’s claims to territory seized in war and to isolate and weaken the Palestinians.It moved the US Embassy to contested Jerusalem, adopted the position that settlements are not contrary to international law, recognized Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights — which Pompeo also visited on Thursday — and released a Mideast plan that overwhelmingly favored Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians. It has also adopted a “maximum pressure” campaign against Israel’s archenemy Iran while brokering normalization agreements with Arab nations.The moves Pompeo announced Thursday are largely symbolic and could be easily reversed by President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration. But it was a powerful show of support for Israel and its Christian allies.Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war, territories the Palestinians want for their future state. The Palestinians view the settlements as a violation of international law and a major obstacle to peace, a position shared by most of the international community.Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in the same war and later annexed it. Last year, the US became the first country to recognize it as part of Israel, a position Pompeo reaffirmed during his visit to the strategic plateau on Thursday.Biden is opposed to settlement construction and has vowed to adopt a more evenhanded approach aimed at reviving peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-visits-israel-museum-honoring-christian-zionists/story-aUCnPIot5ZHoGHVDLmc1LP.html

Swat district is among the top 20 sites in Pakistan which is home to every kind of tourism like natural beauty, religious tourism, cultural tourism and archaeological sites.Several places of worship of Buddhism are also situated in Swat district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-300-year-old-hindu-temple-discovered-in-northwest-pakistan/story-epNXvI69fpLIV1DR3wQLfM.html
21-11-2020||World||After Georgia recount, Joe Biden tightens grip on presidency||As President-elect Joe Biden’s 306-232 lead in electoral college votes was reaffirmed on Thursday by a recount in the state of Georgia, President Donald Trump yet again launched efforts to overturn the US election’s outcome after having failed to mount a credible legal challenge in the battleground states that he lost.Biden, who turned 78 on Friday, and his team have maintained a public posture of confidence in the outcome. “It’s hard to fathom how this man thinks,” he told reporters on Thursday. “I’m confident he knows he hasn’t won, and is not going to win, and we’re going to be sworn in on January 20.”The Democrat president-elect did speak disapprovingly of Trump’s behaviour, which he felt was “totally irresponsible” and sent “damaging” messages to the rest of the world about how democracy works, conveying a “horrible message about who we are as a country”.Georgia’s hand recount of votes lasted six days, but brought no real relief to Trump. He can, however, still seek another recount under the state’s election rules. Wisconsin, meanwhile, began a recount in two counties on Friday, as demanded by the Trump campaign.Trump and Republican allies have filed more than 30 lawsuits since November 3, when polling closed for the 2020 election. They first alleged election fraud and irregularities, and then dropped them, indicating how tenuous they were. Mitt Romney, a Republican senator who has been critical of Trump, said, “Having failed to make even a plausible case of widespread fraud or conspiracy before any court of law, the president has now resorted to overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election. It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic act by a sitting American president.”Trump has invited a group of Republican legislators from Michigan, a battleground state he lost, to the White House on Friday in a reported bid to persuade them to reject the election’s outcome. Trump lost Michigan, which has 16 electoral college votes, by more than 150,000 popular votes and tried earlier to persuade local Republican officials to not certify the result in the state’s largest county, which is mostly black. He has had no success yet.The US president will need to deploy this strategy based on the use of the power of his office in other states to overturn the 306-232 verdict and could next target Georgia (16 electoral votes) and Arizona (11) - states with Republicans in control of the legislatures and the governorships. Biden is set to hold his first in-person meeting since winning the election with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Friday. He will host the top Democrats in the House and Senate at his makeshift transition headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-georgia-recount-joe-biden-tightens-grip-on-presidency/story-uSIvabvwhZscJS0MEx0TKJ.html
21-11-2020||World||Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $120 million damages in New York baby powder case||Johnson & Johnson has been ordered by a New York state judge to pay $120 million in damages to a Brooklyn woman and her husband, after she blamed her cancer on asbestos exposure from using the company’s baby powder.Justice Gerald Lebovits of the state supreme court in Manhattan reduced the payout from the $325 million a jury awarded Donna Olson, 67, and Robert Olson, 65, in May 2019 following a 14-week trial.While upholding the jury’s liability finding, Lebovits wrote on Nov. 11 that the damages were too high, and the Olsons could either accept $120 million or have a new trial on damages.The judge approved the lowered payout on Wednesday, court records show. It includes $15 million of compensatory damages and $105 million of punitive damages, down from an original $25 million and $300 million, respectively.Johnson & Johnson said it will appeal the verdict, citing “significant legal and evidentiary errors” at the trial.“We deeply sympathize with anyone suffering from cancer, which is why the facts are so important,” the company said. “We remain confident that our talc is safe, asbestos free, and does not cause cancer.”Jerome Block, a lawyer for the Olsons, said they were satisfied with the result and confident it would stand.He also said Donna Olson’s mesothelioma “is at an advanced stage, and we are hoping for the best.”Donna Olson had testified that she used Johnson’s Baby Powder or Shower to Shower daily for more than 50 years.Lebovits wrote that jurors could find that Johnson & Johnson was for many years “knowingly deceitful about” or “willfully blind to” potential health risks of its talc products, in part to maintain market share and profit.The New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company is appealing to the US Supreme Court a $2.12 billion damages award in Missouri to women who blamed their ovarian cancer on asbestos in its baby powder and other talc products.Johnson & Johnson has faced intense scrutiny of its baby powder’s safety following a 2018 Reuters investigative report that found it knew for decades about asbestos in its talc. Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, J&J’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-ordered-to-pay-120-million-damages-in-new-york-baby-powder-case/story-ajJS1sAbFhZGiZCuwB0LaN.html

21-11-2020||World||8 injured in US mall shooting: Police||Police in Wisconsin say that eight people were injured in a shooting Friday at a suburban Milwaukee mall and that they are still seeking the suspect.Wauwatosa Police Chief Barry Weber gave no motive for the attack at Mayfair Mall in a brief update about three hours after the 2:50 p.m. incident. He said the extent of injuries to the eight — seven adults and one teenager — was unknown, but all were alive. He added that the shooter was “no longer at the scene.”Weber said based on statements from the wounded, police were seeking a white man in his 20s or 30s and were working to identify the man. He called the mall an active crime scene and asked people to continue to stay away.Wauwatosa Mayor Dennis McBride said in an afternoon statement that a suspect remained at large after the shooting at Mayfair Mall, where witnesses told WISN-TV that they had heard what they believed to be eight to 12 gunshots.WISN reported that at least five people were taken away from the mall on stretchers, at least two of whom were sitting upright and appeared to be conscious. Some people remained in the mall while police searched for a suspect. The station interviewed several people outside the mall who said they had friends sheltering in stores inside.Jill Wooley was inside Macy’s with her 79-year-old mother when they heard eight to 12 gun shots just outside the store entrance.“We heard the first shot fired and knew immediately it was a gunshot,” Wooley told CBS58 in Milwaukee. “We both just dropped to the floor.”Wooley said she didn’t see anyone but the shots were “very close.” She added that they ran in the opposite direction to the basement of the store, where they then hid.Trish Cox’s 19-year-old nephew works at Finish Line sporting goods store. She said she was worried because the store’s phone wasn’t being answered. She was waiting frantically while FBI agents cleared the mall.An agent who wouldn’t give his name said the mall was being “methodically” cleared. Heavily armed FBI personnel were visible at the mall.Mall operator Brookfield Properties said in a statement they were “disheartened and angered that our guests and tenants were subject to this violent incident today.” They declined further comment.The Mayfair Mall was the site of a February shooting in which a city police officer, Joseph Mensah, shot and killed Alvin Cole, a Black 17-year-old. Police said Cole was fleeing from police; Mensah, who is also Black, said he shot Cole because Cole pointed a gun at him. The mall was the target of sporadic protests over several months in the wake of the shooting.The Milwaukee County district attorney declined to file charges against Mensah, but the city this week agreed to a separation agreement in which Mensah will be paid at least $130,000 to leave the force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/8-injured-in-us-mall-shooting-police/story-O3AfpcqhgpZ3PzZ5nDA3dO.html

Cases continue to spike and authorities complain some people are being more careless about taking precautions.Trudeau, saying “a normal Christmas is quite frankly right out of the question”, spoke shortly after Theresa Tam, chief public health officer, predicted new daily cases could soar to 60,000 by the end of the year from less than 5,000 now.“Cases across the country are spiking massively ... we’re really at risk of seeing case loads go up and hospitals get overwhelmed,” said a clearly upset Trudeau.He dismissed the idea of Ottawa invoking emergency powers to reintroduce the kind of widespread national shutdown that provinces imposed earlier in the year, saying “I’m not looking to bring in a federal hammer to try and do things”.Tam said the worst case scenario, a spike to 60,000 daily cases, would occur if people became more sociable. Even if current restrictions on gatherings are maintained, new daily cases will jump to over 20,000 by Dec 31.Only if people reduce their personal contacts can the situation be kept stable and even then, the experience of European nations strongly suggests more curbs will be needed, she said.“Absolutely do not go above what we have now (in terms of daily cases) otherwise we are really in trouble,” she said.Officials predict that by Nov. 30 the total death toll could be between 11,870 and 12,120, with the total cases between 366,500 and 378,600. Canada has recorded a total of 315,751 cases and 11,265 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-seeing-a-massive-spike-in-covid-19-cases-hospitals-could-be-swamped-pm-trudeau/story-qUk2ZkliwztLJQvgUxm3SJ.html

The European Commission said on Thursday that Hungary’s plan raises safety concerns, opening a new front in the EU’s fraught relations with Budapest.Hungary is in touch with all three Chinese companies working on a vaccine and they will soon send the documentation to Hungary that will allow local authorities to decide whether to allow use of the vaccines, Szijjarto said.“The approval for the export procedure is already in progress. If laboratory tests in Hungary are positive, 500,000 to one million doses of Chinese vaccines could arrive in the next few months,” he said.Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government said it would begin importing a small number of doses of Russia’s Sputnik V this week, which could lead to larger imports and mass production in Hungary.Under EU rules, all vaccines must be authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before they can be marketed in any of the bloc’s 27 member states.Asked about Orban’s Sputnik V plans, a spokesman for the Commission, the EU’s executive, said: “The question arises whether a member state would want to administer to its citizens a vaccine that has not been reviewed by EMA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-could-receive-up-to-one-million-doses-of-chinese-coronavirus-vaccine-foreign-minister/story-muymP7lbtuyZdHRecaKnxM.html
21-11-2020||World||Britain asks regulator to assess Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for suitability||Britain has formally asked its medical regulator, the MHRA, to assess the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine for its suitability, the first step in making the shot available outside of the United States. Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, which has been found to be 95% effective in preventing the spread of a virus that has killed more than 1.3 million worldwide and crippled the global economy.Britain’s health minister, Matt Hancock, said the government had taken the step after the two companies applied for emergency use authorisation in the United States.“That has given us the confidence ... formally to start the process here,” he told a news conference. “This is another important step forward in tackling this pandemic,” he said. “If a vaccine is approved it will, of course, be available across the UK from our NHS (National Health Service), free at the point of delivery, according to need, not ability to pay.” Hancock said Pfizer-BioNTech have already starting supplying data to the medical regulator and will submit more in the coming days.Pfizer spokesman Andy Widger said that the company is continuing to work closely with the MHRA and is in the process of providing the data to allow the regulator to make a full assessment.The MHRA has launched an accelerated review of the shot, to speed up the process of approving a successful vaccine in the country, by allowing researchers to submit findings in real time, without waiting for studies to conclude.The aim of the “rolling reviews” is to speed up evaluations of promising medicines during the pandemic while maintaining the same standards of safety and effectiveness.Britain expects to have 10 million doses of the vaccine, enough to protect 5 million people, by the end of the year if regulators approve it. Health officials stressed that the MHRA was independent and highly regarded. Jonathan Van Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said the MHRA would work “at the speed of science”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-asks-regulator-to-assess-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-for-suitability/story-OKCeiOxcPtQE6hfZrCvCXL.html
21-11-2020||World||Georgia Secretary of State to certify Biden’s win||Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is to certify Joe Biden’s win in the state Friday, a day after completing a hand audit of the state’s more than 5 million ballots, starting the clock for electors to be named and any further recount demand from President Donald Trump’s campaign.The deputy secretary of state, Jordan Fuchs, said an earlier announcement that the certification had already occurred had been sent in error.“A team member sent out the wrong press release,” Fuchs said. She said the certification involves signing thousands of documents and that the error was not a reflection of any pressure on Raffensperger, who is a Republican, not to certify the results.Biden won Georgia by a margin of 12,284 votes, or about 0.3 percentage points, marking the first time a Democrat won the state since 1992.“Numbers don’t lie. As secretary of state, I believe the numbers that we have presented today are correct,” Raffensperger said in a press conference ahead of the certification. “The numbers reflect the verdict of the people.”Republican Governor Brian Kemp will have until Saturday to approve the state’s electors. Kemp has scheduled a news conference at 5 p.m. New York time on Friday to discuss the results.Because of the slim margin, Trump will have the right to request a recount by Tuesday. Absent a court order, any recount would only require counties to feed ballots through scanners again instead of the more time consuming process of tallying them by hand. The Trump campaign has not said if it will request such a count, but Thursday night said it intends “to pursue all legal options to ensure that all legal ballots are counted.”The Associated Press called the state for Biden when the audit was complete.Certification is an important legal milestone because it’s the state’s official declaration of who won unless a court intervenes, and it also triggers the appointment of state electors to the Electoral College.The president’s efforts to reverse the results of the election have launched lawsuits and demands for recounts in several states. A federal district court denied a Trump supporter’s bid to delay certifying the results in Georgia on Thursday.In Georgia, the election and its aftermath have pitted Republican against Republican, including a call for Raffensperger to resign from Republican U.S. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, both of whom face competitive run-off elections in January.Raffensperger has defended the integrity of the vote. In an interview on Tuesday, he criticized what he called “a campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/georgia-corrects-news-release-says-election-certification-due-later-on-friday/story-QJzxFDVrAgerVh4xSKuI8O.html

I don’t think we should rock the boat at the present moment,” Guterres told reporters when asked about US plans.A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthi group. UN officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country’s suffering is also worsened by an economic and currency collapse and the Covid-19 pandemic. “In the absence of immediate action, millions of lives may be lost,” Guterres said in a statement earlier on Friday.The United Nations describes Yemen as the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its population in need of help. A senior Western diplomat said an FTO designation of the Houthis by the United States “would certainly not contribute to progress on Yemen.”“It’s likely that they want to do whatever it takes to increase the pressure on Iran,” said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.UN aid chief Mark Lowcock has said the United Nations has received less than half of what was needed this year - about $1.5 billion - for its humanitarian operations in Yemen. Last year it received $3 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-says-yemen-in-imminent-danger-of-famine-warns-against-unilateral-moves/story-wBhmnMmkiDS6E7Mc2i4STN.html

The event organised by the Royal Commonwealth Society (RCS) included readings from the winning pieces by Indian actor Kareena Kapoor and British actor-writer Stephen Fry.This year, the competition’s theme was “Climate action in the Commonwealth”.Choudhury’s essay was titled “Voices from the Blue World”, which imagines a grouper fish speaking at an underwater conference on the impact that climate change has had on the ocean community.Mukerji wrote “The Waters Rise”, which imagines an impassioned call to recognise the impact of climate change on small island states, and the need to take action. The junior winner was Cassandra Nguyen (13 years) from Canada while Eleni Bazikamwe (10 years) from Ghana was the runner-up.The Duchess of Cornwall said, “Amazingly, since the launch, there have been 12,888 entries from young people across the Commonwealth: one of the most successful competitions on record. I am incredibly proud of all of you for overcoming the year’s challenges with your outstanding creativity on this vitally important subject.”Linda Yueh, RCS chair, said, “We are delighted that, during a period of great uncertainty and disruption across the globe, this year’s competition attracted almost 13,000 entries from nearly every country in the Commonwealth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-indian-origin-student-wins-queen-s-commonwealth-essay-contest/story-4UQDcUcI6RRPdOvoZgMaWP.html
21-11-2020||World||UK secures early access to 355 million doses of prospective Covid-19 vaccines||The UK government has secured early access to 355 million doses of various coronavirus vaccines currently under various stages of trials - the most, 100 million, are of the vaccine currently in advanced trial stage at the University of Oxford.Officials said early access had been secured to over 355 million vaccines doses through agreements with vaccine developers at various stages of trials. The UK has invested over £230 million into manufacturing any successful vaccine.Health secretary Matt Hancock said on Friday that recent news from Pfizer and Oxford trials was promising. “The likely big numbers, if it comes off, and I stress on the ‘if’... will be next year for a Covid vaccine. But we still hold out hope that we might get some going in December this year,” he said.Mass vaccination at over 40 centres across the UK has been planned by the National Health Service, with retired doctors and nurses joining the initiative. The regulator, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said there are two routes to obtain a Covid-19 vaccine approval: through a full marketing authorisation or through a temporary authorisation route known as regulation 174.As regulation 174 is a public health-related measure, manufacturers cannot apply for this authorization; it is the government that requests the MHRA approval for specific products as part of a public health response.The MHRA will apply the key criteria of safety, quality and efficacy before authorising the use of a vaccine under either route after receiving the full results of the trials.This means that, for both routes, once the data is submitted, MHRA scientists and clinicians will carefully and scientifically review the safety, quality and effectiveness data - how it protects people from Covid-19 and the level of protection it provides.The data must include: results from the lab and clinical trials in humans; manufacturing and quality controls; product sampling; and testing of the final product.“The safety of the public will always come first. A Covid-19 vaccine will only be approved for use via either route once it has met robust standards on safety, effectiveness and quality through clinical trials,” the MHRA said.After thoroughly reviewed the data via either route, the MHRA will seek advice from the independent advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines, which will critically assess the data before advising the UK government on the safety, quality and effectiveness of any potential vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-secures-early-access-to-355-million-doses-of-prospective-covid-19-vaccines/story-MoFTIUjHWr7dM2afSltpwN.html
21-11-2020||World||UK’s Boris Johnson stands by minister found to have bullied staff||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson refused to fire or censure his interior minister on Friday despite an investigator’s conclusion that she bullied members of her staff.A report said Home Secretary Priti Patel had not met the standards required of a government minister, and concluded her behavior fit the definition of bullying.Cabinet ministers found to have breached the ministerial code are generally expected to resign. But the government said the prime minister had “full confidence” in Patel and “considers this matter now closed.”Johnson’s adviser on ministerial standards Alex Allan, who led the investigation into Patel, resigned instead, saying he could not continue in his job.“I recognize that it is for the prime minister to make a judgment on whether actions by a minister amount to a breach of the ministerial code,” Allan said. “But I feel that it is right that I should now resign from my position as the Prime Minister’s independent adviser on the code.”Patel has been under investigation since March after several civil servants accused her of bullying. The top civil servant in the Home Office, Philip Rutnam resigned that month, saying Patel had belittled employees and fostered an environment of fear in the department. She denied the allegations.The investigation’s conclusions were published Friday after months of delay by Johnson’s office.Allan concluded that Patel “has not consistently met the high standards required by the Ministerial Code of treating her civil servants with consideration and respect.”He said there were “occasions of shouting and swearing” that had upset people, though he accepted that Patel may not have intended to have that effect.“Her approach on occasions has amounted to behavior that can be described as bullying in terms of the impact felt by individuals,” Allan said. “To that extent her behavior has been in breach of the Ministerial Code, even if unintentionally.”He said that Patel also felt, “justifiably in many instances,” that there was a lack of support and responsiveness from senior civil servants.Patel said she was “sorry that my behavior in the past has upset people,” though she stopped just short of apologizing for the behavior itself.“I’m here to give an unreserved apology today and I am sorry if I have upset people in any way whatsoever,” she told the BBC. “That was completely unintentional.”In a separate statement, Patel said “I acknowledge that I am direct and have at times got frustrated.”“I am very grateful for the hard work of thousands of civil servants who help to deliver the government’s agenda,” she said.Opposition politicians accused the prime minister of condoning bullying. The prime minister’s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, insisted Johnson took allegations of bullying “exceedingly seriously.”“He loathes bullying,” Stratton said. “It is not his belief that Priti Patel is a bully.”Patel was appointed by Johnson to the key post responsible for immigration and crime-fighting after his December 2019 election victory. A law-and-order hard-liner, she has vowed to stop migrants trying to cross the English Channel from France in small boats, though without much success.She was fired as International Development Secretary by Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, for holding unauthorized meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials during a private trip to the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-boris-johnson-stands-by-minister-found-to-have-bullied-staff/story-Ga8mmIjyOjU214vlTmcCNL.html
21-11-2020||World||UK bullying row: Prime Minister Boris Johnson stands by home secretary Priti Patel||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday expressed “full confidence” in home secretary Priti Patel after an inquiry into her alleged bullying behaviour with civil servants concluded that she did behave in a way that amounted to bullying.Alex Allan, the UK government’s standards adviser, resigned soon after Johnson stood by Patel, prompting another political row, days after Downing Street witnessed the resignations of two top advisers that were seen as the prime minister resetting his office.Patel, who has faced such allegations while working in the home office and other departments, apologised for her behaviour that the adviser said amounted to breaching the ministerial code of conduct. Several Conservative MPs lent her support.Labour leader Keir Starmer said, “Yet again, the prime minister has been found wanting when his leadership has been tested. If I were prime minister, the home secretary would have been removed from her job.“It is hard to imagine another workplace in the UK where this behaviour would be condoned by those at the top. The government should be setting an example. Instead, it is one rule for Boris Johnson and his friends, another for everyone else.”He added, “The prime minister has previously said he loathes bullying. Yet when one of his own ministers is found to have bullied their staff, he ignores the damning report sat on his desk and instead protects them.”A government spokesperson said Johnson is reassured that Patel is sorry for inadvertently upsetting those with whom she was working. As the arbiter of the ministerial code, Johnson’s judgement is that the code was not breached, the spokesperson added.“The prime minister has full confidence in the home secretary and considers this matter now closed. He is grateful to the thousands of civil servants working extremely hard to support delivery of the government’s priorities,” the statement said.Breaching ministerial code usually leads to a minister resigning. Patel had been asked to resign by former PM Theresa May in 2017 for holding unauthorised official meetings during a holiday when she was the international development secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-bullying-row-prime-minister-boris-johnson-stands-by-home-secretary-priti-patel/story-gAOyLu3WkmGQQnmVZlGu0L.html
21-11-2020||World||One in five US hospitals face staffing crises within a week||Hospital workers, many of them beleaguered since early in the coronavirus pandemic, have more pain ahead.This week, 1 in 5 American hospitals anticipated a critical staff shortage within seven days, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. The ratio was a record as cases swell and patients flood facilities for a third time since the pandemic began.North Dakota, Missouri and Wisconsin reported the highest share, each with almost half of its hospitals in need of medical staff as of Wednesday. That tracks with the trajectory of the virus, which by some measures is ravaging the Midwest in a way the rest of the country hasn’t seen. The seven-day average of new cases in the region is higher than at any point in the Northeast, West or South, Covid Tracking Project data show.A dearth of nurses, doctors and other key health-care workers could not only endanger patients, but also risk burning out existing staff, many of whom have been laboring -- and struggling -- since March. Frontline workers are vulnerable to the consequences of overwork, propelling turnover, prompting mistakes and, in the most serious cases, mental illness and even suicide.The US reported an additional 182,832 cases on Thursday, according to Covid Tracking Project data. There have been more than 252,000 deaths cumulatively, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-in-five-us-hospitals-face-staffing-crises-within-a-week/story-4XuCQiKFimtVlibTnj1SLM.html
21-11-2020||India||Karnataka’s Malenad region can support 1,300 tigers, estimates study||Though the area under tiger habitat did not increase in Karnataka’s Malenad region between 1970 and 2015, the number of tigers rose from 70 to 391 there due to strong law enforcement, interventions by non-government organisations, and voluntary relocation of people from wildlife reserves, according to a paper published in Elsevier’s Journal of Biological Conservation on November 16.The paper said the Malenad landscape, which includes 14 protected areas including Bandipur, Nagarhole, Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple (BRT), and Anshi-Dandeli wildlife sanctuaries, has a potential tiger habitat of 21,000 km. The area can potentially support 1300 tigers. The paper however has ignored the social consequences of voluntary relocation of forest dwellers who have a right to live in and conserve forests, independent experts said.Also Read: Delhi zoo’s 15-year-old tiger B-2 diesIndia recorded a 33% increase in tiger numbers between 2014 and 2018, according to the All-India Tiger Estimation Results released on Monday. The tiger census released last year indicated there were 2,967 tigers in India in 2018, compared to 2,226 in 2014. The paper authored by veteran wildlife biologist K Ullas Karanth, N Samba Kumar, and conservation scientist Krithi Karanth is based on field data and practical experience gained in the Malenad Tiger Programme (MTP). MTP is a multi-disciplinary initiative by the Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS)’s Ullas Karath. The programme consisted of a series of inter-related projects focused on the recovery and rigorous monitoring of wild tiger populations in the landscape.The study found that tiger recovery in Malenad region has occurred amid significant human population growth, increased life expectancy, and overall poverty reduction in the region.“From our analyses, we conclude that despite fragmented habitats, tiger populations have been able to recover in regions of India with high human population densities, economic growth, and development. In contrast, other tiger landscapes in Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and the hills of North-eastern India support more extensive, less-fragmented forests and have lower levels of human population density and development,” the paper said. It added this may be due to factors that do not promote the effective law enforcement which can lead to tiger conservation.The authors of the paper recommend conservation interventions that are kept in the context of people’s aspirations and socio-economic development. Their main recommendations include focusing on future tiger recovery efforts and investments in wildlife areas currently well below their carrying capacities. Currently, the focus is limited to older reserves such as Nagarahole and Bandipur.Second, earlier tiger recovery patterns in Malenad also show that effective law enforcement and voluntary village resettlements are two key interventions that increase prey and tiger densities. It is essential to focus on these two interventions by prioritising them in budgets and action plans for tiger recovery, the authors have concluded. According to the paper, Anshi-Dandeli, Bhadra-Kudremukh, Nagarahole-Bandipur and BRT Cauvery clusters are currently at 96%, 72%, 39%, and 76% below their respective carrying capacities.“The key to bringing back tigers and other such threatened species lies in apportioning the land wisely separating nature preservation and human development, recognising the continued need for effective law enforcement, encouraging rather than stifling non-governmental conservation efforts, and, accepting the reality that wildlife conservation must succeed under the broader societal mandate for economic and technological progress” said K Ullas Karanth, the lead author of the study.Independent experts said the paper fails to capture the conservation efforts by tribal communities living in the forests and their rights over forests.“The authors rely on very little evidence for their two key suggestions that resettlement and law enforcement works for tiger conservation. This anti-human position ignores the fact that tiger numbers have doubled in landscapes such as the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve in which Adivasis have acquired forest rights for residence and use. The people that the authors hope to see evicted and dispossessed are the poorest and most disenfranchised of all citizens in these forested landscapes. That they would ignore the social implications of their recommendations defies social justice norms. The paper invokes colonial era tropes of local people being the main problem and ironically offers eco-modernist mantras such as tourism and technology as solutions for tiger conservation. I am particularly surprised that a peer-reviewed journal would publish such recommendations given that they are based not on evidence, but on imagined, racial and neo-colonial ideas,” said Nitin D. Rai, fellow at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE).“The current approach of relocating tribal and forest-dwelling communities from tiger reserves is in violation of laws and in fact defeats the purpose of tiger conservation. Communities in India have a long history of forest and wildlife conservation. The community conservation efforts have been recognised and strengthened by FRA. The very few examples of recognition of community forest rights in tiger reserves such as in Simlipal of Odisha and BRT of Karnataka have led to the strengthening of conservation efforts,” said Tushar Dash, member of Community Forest Rights, an advocacy group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-s-malenad-region-can-support-1-300-tigers-estimates-study/story-fq5Kc6aUULDsUsE0B41xgN.html

21-11-2020||India||‘Covid-19 biggest challenge since World War 2’: PM Modi at G20 summit||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called for greater transparency in governance systems and decisive action by the G20 to counter the impact of the Covid-19 crisis that should focus on both economic recovery and preserving the earth. Modi participated in the two-day virtual summit being chaired by Saudi Arabia along with the heads of state and government of the 19 member countries and representatives of the European Union and international organisations. Describing the pandemic as an important turning point in history and the biggest challenge faced by the world since World War 2, he called for decisive action by the G20 that should not be limited to economic recovery, jobs and trade, but also focus on preserving the earth. Modi called for greater transparency in governance systems to inspire people to deal with shared challenges and said dealing with the environment as “trustees rather than owners” will lead to a holistic and healthy lifestyle, a principle whose benchmark could be a per capita carbon footprint. He also sought a new global index for the post-Coronavirus world consisting of four elements – creation of a vast talent pool, ensuring technology reaches all segments of society, transparency in governance systems, and dealing with the earth with a spirit of trusteeship. This can help the G20 lay the foundation of a new world, he said. In the past few decades, there was an emphasis on capital and finance and the time has now come to focus on multi-skilling and re-skilling. This will enhance the dignity of people and make them more resilient to face crises, he said. He added any assessment of new technology should be based on its impact on ease of living and quality of life. Since “work from anywhere” is the new normal in the post-Covid-19 world, Modi suggested the creation of a G20 “virtual secretariat” as a follow-up and documentation repository. This was the third summit this month where Modi and President Xi Jinping were on the same platform amid the India-China border standoff. They had earlier joined the summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping. The summit with the theme “Realising opportunities of the 21st century for all” has assumed importance in the wake of the pandemic, and its agenda includes two sessions focused on overcoming the pandemic, economic recovery and restoring jobs, and building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future. There are also side events on pandemic preparedness and safeguarding the planet. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Gavi Board chair, told the event on pandemic preparedness: “The virus is winning. Only through adequate financing for a global exit strategy like Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) can economic vitality be restored at home and catastrophe in the poorest countries averted.” A commitment by G20 leaders to invest $4.6 billion to fill the ACT Accelerator’s immediate funding gap will save lives, lay the groundwork for mass procurement and delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, he said. In his opening remarks, Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz said the G20 countries pledged over $21 billion to support global efforts to combat the pandemic and injected over $11 trillion to support individuals and businesses. “Although we are optimistic about the progress made in developing vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics tools for Covid-19, we must work to create the conditions for affordable and equitable access to these tools for all peoples. At the same time, we must prepare better for any future pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-biggest-challenge-since-world-war-2-pm-modi-at-g20-summit/story-MKWXYFqMW206eK4ipuUVpO.html

21-11-2020||India||There’s a lot in a name, says JP 77, a BJP nominee from Kerala’s Kozhikode||Keralites’ love for Russian and Latin American names is well known. Move around and you can still meet many Breshnev, Khrushchev, Lenin, Che Guevara and Fidel Castro in the countryside. But JP 77 is a little different. Five years ago, when JP Seventy Seven went to Dubai for a trip, airport authorities had a tough time and asked him repeatedly to reveal his full name. He convinced them with much difficulty that it was his real name. Despite such minor irritants, JP 77 basks (on his Aadhaar card it is JPseventyseven, he says space was missing in true Aadhaar style) in the glory of his name. Though his father was an ardent fan of late socialist Jayprakash Narayan his 43-year-old son belongs to the BJP camp. He is the party candidate from one of the wards in Kayanna in Kozhikode district in north Kerala. Now, how did JP 77 get his name? “I was born in 1977, the year emergency was lifted. My father was a big fan of Lok Nayak Jayprakash Narayan. It was the beginning of a new dawn after the dark days of the emergency so my father was keen to join both, emergency and JP, as a result I was named JP 77,” he said.JP 77 works in the marketing department of Janmabhoomi, the mouthpiece of the BJP. He said he’s known in his area as JP and 77 does not bother him much these days. “When I grew up many people advised me to change my name but I stick to it as it was fondly given by my late father T V Ramadas. More than one’s name, a person is known by his work, behaviour and attitude,” said JP 77. He’s locked in a fierce three-cornered contest in the local body polls. He said in the last local election the BJP came a close second and his mission is to bridge the small gap and emerge victorious. At least 30 km away from his ward, Brasilia, a former councillor of the Muslim League, is trying her luck again in Kozhikode Corporation (north Kerala). An ardent fan of the Brazil soccer team, she was named after the Brazil capital by her soccer-crazy uncle. Kozhikode’s football craze is well known. During the soccer World Cup many fans wear the jersey of their favourite player and they are known after their player till the tournament is over. And they also love to name their newborn children after their favourite soccer teams or players. Last year, the Idukki district Congress Committee had called a meeting of those who bear the name of Gandhi to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation. At least 100 ‘Gandhis’ from various parts of Kerala and neighbouring Tamil Nadu responded to the invitation. Naming after all-time greats and plays is prevalent in many parts of the world. According to NBC News, more than 4,500 children in United States were named after the characters of the Game of Throne (American fantasy drama series) in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-s-a-lot-in-a-name-says-jp-77-a-bjp-nominee-from-kerala-s-kozhikode/story-Qo6QvBUZnX5OTurH66QjZJ.html

The panel also highlighted that lack of specific guidelines in treating Covid-19 patients and inadequate amount of hospital beds led to private hospitals charging high fees.The report titled ‘Outbreak of Pandemic Covid-19 and its Management’ was submitted to Vice President and Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu by Samajwadi Party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav.The report outlined, “Cost of health service delivery increased due to absence of specific guidelines for COVID treatment in private hospitals as a result of which patients were charged exorbitant fees.”The panel, according to PTI, also pointed out that the amount of money spent to allow government-run healthcare facilities are ‘abysmally low’. It said that the ‘fragile structure’ of the Indian healthcare system led to such a response against the Covid-19 pandemic.The report advised, “The committee, therefore, strongly recommends the government to increase its investments in the public healthcare system and make consistent efforts to achieve the National Health Policy targets of expenditure up to 2.5 percent of GDP within two years as the set time frame of year 2025 is far away and the public health cannot be jeopardised till that time schedule.”The panel also highlighted that the government hospitals were ill-equipped to cater to non-Covid-19 patients as well while struggling to treat increasing numbers of Covid-19 patients.While highlighting that the sustainable pricing model could have helped save many lives the committee also noted that private-public partnership in the healthcare sector could be beneficial for the general public.The report praised all doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals for their dedication during the initial months of the pandemic. It also thanked other frontline workers for their service and proposed that doctors who died during the outbreak on the line of duty be acknowledged as martyrs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sustainable-pricing-model-could-ve-saved-more-lives-parliamentary-panel-on-covid-19-deaths/story-gEWLg9sWGYlcp4FqKoAdkK.html

21-11-2020||India||Security being used as pretext to impede, customise democracy in J&K, says Farooq Abdullah||The PAGD continued on Saturday with its tirade against the administration of its candidates being allegedly prevented from campaigning and security used as a “pretext to impede and customize democracy” in Jammu and Kashmir, a week before the first democratic exercise post the abrogation of its special status. People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration president Farooq Abdullah sent a two-page letter to Jammu and Kashmir Election Commissioner K K Sharma, saying providing security to a select few and “literally interning” the rest was a “gross interference” in a democracy.Also Read | J&K: PAGD releases fourth list for DDC polls“I am taking the liberty of writing to you about the upcoming DDC (district development council) elections. A strange and a unique feature has come to the fore,” the National Conference leader said in the letter. “Candidates put up by the PAGD are immediately whisked away to ‘secure locations’ in the name of security and confined to those ‘secure locations’,” he said. “They are not allowed to canvass, they are completely out of touch with those from whom they are supposed to seek votes.” The former chief minister said the current state of affairs in the realm of security was “blatantly oriented” towards providing security to a select few and confining others. “This comes across more as an attempt to interfere in the democratic process than any real concern for the wellbeing of the contestants. Security cannot and should not be used as a tool or an excuse to interfere in democratic processes,” the Srinagar MP said. The PAGD president’s letter comes amid allegations by the Valley’s major political parties, including the NC and the Peoples Democratic Party, of not having a level-playing field for the polls. The parties have accused the administration of locking up their candidates in accommodations at several places and not allowing them to campaign. The DDC polls will be held in eight phases beginning November 28 and ends on December 24. The PAGD is an alliance of several political parties seeking the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status abrogated by the Centre in August last year. Abdullah said the parties part of the PAGD had been in power in the past and were aware of the challenges posed in the realm of security in a place beset by violence. Asserting that the evolution of democracy in Jammu and Kashmir was distinctive compared to any other part of the country, Abdullah said this evolution was a “bloodied journey”, soaked in the blood of thousands of political workers who have laid down their lives for the sake of democracy. He acknowledged that security was a challenge, which should be countered by the government in a manner that was fair and transparent, but “providing security to a select few and literally interning the rest is a gross interference in democracy”. PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, who is also the PAGD vice president, accused the Centre of “sabotaging” the participation of political parties other than the BJP in the DDC polls by not allowing them to campaign freely. “GOI sabotaging participation of non BJP parties in DDC polls. PDPs Bashir Ahmed despite having adequate security has been detained at Pahalgam on the pretext of security. Today is the last day for filing nominations and have spoken to DC Anantnag for his release,” Mufti tweeted, tagging Lt Governor Manoj Sinha. Police have said the candidates were being provided collective security and put up in secure areas as providing protection to every candidate was difficult.Also Read | Amit Shah aims at Gupkar group on ‘foreign link’ Kashmir Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said the candidates were provided a double escort, and the security forces guard an area where they want to visit and campaign after leaving their secure accommodations. On Friday, PAGD convenor and CPI(M) leader M Y Tarigami had released a letter from Sinha, who assured a smooth campaign for the local body elections and said the polls would go a long way in strengthening panchayati raj institutions in the Union territory. The Lt governor said he had taken note of the concerns and issued “necessary instructions”. Tarigami, a former MLA from the militancy-hit Kulgam district of south Kashmir, had informed the Sinha that after filing their nomination papers, the candidates were not allowed to campaign due to “perceived threat to their lives” and had been bundled in “cluster accommodation”. “Confining candidates against their wishes has severely restricted their movement and ability to campaign. Even in some cases, they are not allowed to attend party meetings,” the CPI(M) leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-being-used-as-pretext-to-impede-customise-democracy-in-j-k-says-farooq-abdullah/story-KLTn1RusExZfkinyQAL4rI.html
21-11-2020||India||Extending our support to NC in interest of the people of Kargil: Namgyal||Despite their ideological differences, the BJP will continue to support National Conference in Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council-Kargil for a stable administration to ensure the development of the region, BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal said on Saturday. He also asserted that the restoration of pre-August  5, 2019 position, when Ladakh was part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, is impossible. “We extended our support to NC in the interest of the people of Kargil and its development. There is no compromise on ideological basis,” Namgyal said. The Ladakh MP’s remarks came in the bakdrop of the BJP attacking the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), led by NC leader Farooq Abdullah, which is demanding the restoration of special status and statehood to J-K. The BJP leadership including Union Home Minister Amit Shah had slammed the PAGD as a “gang” that wants foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir. Replying to queries at the end of his three-day visit to Kargil, Namgyal said his party will continue to support the National Conference in the LAHDC-Kargil to ensure that it completes its full term of five years. Of the 26 elected members of the LAHDC, 10 are from the NC, eight from Congress, three from the BJP and five (Independents). The Ladakh Union Territory administration nominates four members to the 30-member council. The 2018 elections to the Kargil Hill Council had produced a hung verdict. The NC initially had an alliance with the Congress; the PDP had two councillors and the BJP had one. After the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the NC and Congress fell out, and the NC entered into a coalition with two PDP councillors and four Independents to continue in power in the Council. A few months later, both PDP councillors joined the BJP, which extended support to the NC. Responding to a question on the issue, the MP said, “The NC stitched an alliance with PDP and later PDP merged with BJP…. “We both have different ideologies. The coalition is based on BJP’s focus on the development of Kargil, welfare of its people and to ensure that the council completes its full term of five years so that people are not forced into mid-term elections.” He said the Kargil hill council had never completed its full term in the past. “We thought that there should be no betrayal with the mandate of the people and the council should complete its full term,” he said. At the same time, he said the BJP is against the Gupkar ‘gang’. He said some people are talking about the restoration of Article 370 and the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir as it existed before August 5 last year. “Both these things are impossible. All the people know it very well. The formation of Ladakh Union Territory is now a part of history and history cannot be changed,” he said, adding Ladakh got a budget of Rs 11,000 crore which was unheard of when there was Article 370. He said funds are flowing into Ladakh after it was carved out of J&K. “Ask the Chief Executive Councillor of LAHDC Kargil, (Feroz Khan), who happens to be affiliated with the National Conference, how the council budget was enhanced manifold, ask councillors whose budget was increased from Rs 18 lakh to Rs 90 lakh.” The BJP leader said people who are raising political slogans are doing so as they are no longer enjoying personal benefits. “The people from the Gupkar gang came with high hopes to Kargil but returned disappointed. They did not dare to visit Leh,” he said, referring to the visit of PAGD delegation led by former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah to Kargil recently. Referring to his meetings with officials, he said centrally sponsored schemes have not been implemented fully in the district. “I have asked the officers to speed up the implementation of the schemes so that the ordinary people including the poor, students and the sick can avail the benefits,” he said and warned stern action against officers found lacking in fulfilling their responsibilities. He said the officers were given a clear cut message that if anyone is interested in politics, he should leave the job. “We will not tolerate dereliction in duty. We have only thought of development and do not believe in dirty politics. “We have shifted the officers from the Union Territory J&K to UT Ladakh. We can transfer any officer to any other UT in the country we know they have families back home and do not want any harsh step,” he said. He said the BJP had promised to complete the Zojilla tunnel to ensure all-weather connectivity between Srinagar and Leh and it will be done well within the stipulated time. The new airport will also be completed and dedicated to the people of Kargil within five years, he said. Seeking the support of the people, he announced Haji Abdul Hussain as the BJP’s district president of Kargil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extending-our-support-to-nc-in-interest-of-the-people-of-kargil-namgyal/story-gGRIIvzbCyQngnDiHsngiM.html

The list includes TMC party veterans and heavyweights such as Saugata Roy and Suvendu Adhikari, Singh added. “At least five TMC MPs could resign any moment. Saugata Roy maybe speaking on behalf of the TMC in front of the camera but he would also join the list once the camera is removed,” Singh told the media on Saturday. “In the coming days, the BJP will form the government (in West Bengal). The day Suvendu Adhikari joins BJP; the present TMC government will not be able to remain in power. The government will fall,” he added. Roy, however, has rubbished the claims as BJP propaganda and said that he would either quit politics or die but would never join the BJP. “Arjun Singh is a known Bahubali and an accused. It could be his dream or a part of the BJP propaganda. I will quit politics and die but I will never join BJP. I am not a saleable commodity,” Roy said. Adhikari, who also holds the portfolio of state transport minister, has been throwing a veiled challenge at the TMC leadership over the past few days. Adhikari, however, could not be contacted. Senior TMC leaders had earlier said that Adhikari was particularly unhappy with organizational decisions taken by Abhishek Banerjee, Lok Sabha member and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and election strategist Prashant Kishor who was roped in after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Causing embarrassment for the ruling TMC some of its party legislators have already spoken out against election strategist Kishor, while one MLA, who was branded a rebel last month, has said that Mamata Banerjee is no more in control of the party.

21-11-2020||India||Kerala govt launches twin attacks against opposition, Centre as probe agencies close in||With central agencies tightening the noose around the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala over a number of issues including the gold smuggling case, the worried government has launched a twin attack against the Congress-led opposition and the Central government. After the arrests of former party secretary Koderiyeri Balakrishnan’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri in a narcotics case and the CM’s former secretary M Sivasankar in the gold smuggling case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned another secretary of the chief minister, C M Raveendran. He was summoned last month but he could not appear after he tested positive for Covid-19. In trouble, the government has devised a counter–attack. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday gave the nod for vigilance to register a case against opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and two former ministers in the previous Oommen Chandy government. The vigilance case is based on the revelations of a controversial businessman Biju Ramesh. The liquor baron had claimed last month that he had mobilised Rs 10 crore on the instruction of then excise minister K Babu for a favourable liquor policy during the last UDF regime. He said the first installment of Rs one crore was paid to Chennithala, Rs 50 lakh to Babu and Rs 25 lakh to another minister V S Sivakumar. But Congress leaders said it was a desperate attempt to distract attention from serious trouble that had gripped the government. “It is nothing but a witch hunt. The central agencies have reached the CM’s office so the government will have to save its face somehow. We are not worried and we will take legal recourse to challenge the retrograde step,” Chennithala said. The LDF has also announced a series of steps against the central agencies. On November 25, it will organise a state-wide protest before the local and civic body headquarters. “The central agencies are being misused to weaken a democratically- elected government. Deviated from the gold smuggling case it seems they have a one-point agenda to implicate the state government. We will oppose it,” said the LDF. On November 16 also the LDF had organised a protest meet against the Union government. The smuggling case came to light on July 5 after the seizure of 30 kg of smuggled gold from a consignment camouflaged as diplomatic baggage at the UAE consulate in the state capital. Later, the CM had written to Prime Minister Modi seeking a central agency probe. A multi-agency team headed by the NIA is probing the case and 34 people have been arrested so far. While investigating the gold smuggling case, probe agencies also came across alleged irregularities and commissions in some pet projects of the government. When Sivasankar was arrested on October 28, the government quickly distanced itself from him but in Raveendran’s case it will be difficult for the party to drop him. Besides the government, the party also drew enough flak after the arrest of party secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri in connection with the Bengaluru drugs case. Later, Balakrishnan was forced to proceed on leave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-launches-twin-attacks-against-opposition-centre-as-central-agencies-close-in/story-kgjfuHa9PF6c3FA2yO3sJJ.html

After completing my graduation in Industrial Biology and I left my PG midway to pursue Hindi literature from the University that had given us names like Ali Sardar Jafri, Kunwar Narayan, Pandit Pradeep and many more,” said Mishra, a gold medalist in his course from LU.Talking about his period in LU, “My head of department for the first year was Surya Prakash Dixit succeeded by Indu Prashar. I enjoyed those days as it was deeply associated with my inclination towards literature and writers. As I was an avid reader and book lover, I spent a lot of time in library reading and discussing the subjects with my professors. The LU library was well-equipped for book enthusiasts like me.”For Mishra the campus connect does help in the long run, “Yes, I believe campus interaction helps every student in one way or the other as it does give them opportunity to meet and work together with so many people, which otherwise is not possible. Campus connect you can say was our network set up in those days,” he shares.Mishra who has already penned books like ‘Yada-Kada’, ‘Ayodhya Tatha Anya Kavitayen’, ‘Devpriya’, ‘Sur Ki Baradari’ a book on the life of thumri singer Girija Devi, dancer Sonal Mansingh and shehnai maestro Ustad Bismillah Khan along with notable ‘Lata: Sur Gatha’. He is currently working on Gulzar’s authorised biography slated to be launched next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/campus-connect-was-our-network-set-up-in-those-days/story-Mcnb2i9jX8qF1YOHXuFK5J.html
21-11-2020||India||‘I will always cherish those LU days’||Folk singer and Padma Shri recipient Malini Awasthi, during the IIT-Kanpur Fest, randomly acted in skit to fetch those vital five team points which eventually helped Lucknow University get the winner’s shield that year. A victory march was taken out to celebrate the achievement on the university campus. “Sushain Bhatnagar directed the play and we were competing with strong teams like IIT-Delhi, Lady Shriram and others. I would like to mention that as an artiste anyone who has been on stage for student festivals will be able to perform in front of any audience. My stage exposure did help me while acting too,” remembers the singer, as LU celebrates its centenary year. From 1984 to 88, she studied in LU and completed BA (Hons.) in History with Political Science and Sanskrit as subjects. Reminiscing her University days, she said, “From Balrampur Hospital campus we used to go on rickshaw to first LU and in evening to Bhathankdey Music Institute. I remember the old Monkey Bridge (parallel to Hanuman Setu) was there. As a girl it was my first opportunity to study in a co-education practice. While queuing to deposit fees, boys used to come up to us and ask ‘laiye fees jama kara de’. It used to be an awkward moment for we girls and initially scared us too but today I have a hearty laugh at it.” While in University she presented a ghazal ‘Aap humse agar na bolengey, apni palkon ko hum bhigo lengey’ at Lucknow Mahotsav then, “Next day it got featured in newspapers with a my photo and the same headline. And when I reached my department that day, boys in the class started singing that ghazal loudly which made me numb. Nowadays, it’s considered as a fun incident but then it was surely a big deal for girls.” She also remembers her ragging day. “For many days I saved myself from being ragged. But one fine day I was caught. One of the senior said: ‘Bada ghazalein gaa rahi kuch suniye’. Since performing was no big deal for me so I sang a few lines and thereafter I was never caught.” “Those were very beautiful days as there were no mobiles and all. Making notes, going to libraries, travelling on rickshaw and performing at student fests — I will always cherish those LU days,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-will-always-cherish-those-lu-days/story-Ol902wln89gTME9JYhu9yL.html

21-11-2020||India||LU years have been instrumental in my life, says DJ Narain||Lead vocalist of the band ‘Aryans,’ Dharmendra Jai (DJ) Narain says that it has been 33 years since he left Lucknow University but those four years remains most influential, instrumental and exhilarating in his life. Ahead of his performance on the campus (Tuesday), the civil servant turned singer said, “I sum it like: Four years of Lucknow and how it outweighs all the best moments of my life everywhere else! I got my calling — be it for music, academic interests or other abilities in this university. LU laid the foundation stone of my existence, music and friendships.” DJ completed his graduation (1983-87) in Economics and Mathematics followed by Masters in Economics. He also did a part-time lectureship for a year in LU. The ex-director of Film Television Institute of India (FTTI) said, “I was lucky to witness the renaissance period at LU. A lot of norms were being challenged — student politics, idealism, social sector, music and culture. The campus provided me platform to grow in all directions. Today it’s easy to start but then it was not so.” The singer-musician reminisced good old days and shared, “There were around 15 good pop and rock group within the LU. Each department used to have musical festival. We were group of people who were composing original music, experimenting and had dreams to reach the sky. I was playing with different amateurish groups and then we formed ‘The Dreams’ in 1987 with my musical soulmate Gullu (Dinesh Khushwaha) and others. We dreamt of becoming Beatles of India.” Ten years after Aryans was formed, which became a rage with ‘Ankhon Main Tera Hi Chehra.’ “We are presently on our own individual soul trips. Hopefully we will jam together again. We remain in touch and are great friends,” he said. DJ is dedicating his show to his father JN Srivastava, a freedom fighter, who unfurled Tricolour in 1937 at the same LU campus during the British raj. DJ remembers what his teacher once said, “Prof NN Srivastava got a bit philosophical and said something that people come and go every year but you need to leave an impact that remain for years. That left a deep effect on me.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lu-years-have-been-instrumental-in-my-life-says-dj-narain/story-YaVQiZZix5nERWKcVfEUwJ.html

The study titled “Efficacy and safety of favipiravir, an oral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor, in mild-to-moderate Covid-19: A randomized, comparative, open-label, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial” was published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. The significant improvement in time taken for clinical cure suggests that favipiravir may be beneficial in mild-to-moderate Covid-19, the study states. Intake of favipiravir has improved the clinical cure by around three days and cleared the infection two days faster than those on standard treatment. Noting that favipiravir, a drug under investigation in many countries for treatment of Covid-19, treatment led to significant improvement in time to clinical cure and it may be a safe and effective treatment in mild-to-moderate of the coronavirus infection. Stating the method, study mentions that it was carried out on adults of age group 18-75 years who had tested positive for Covid-19 with RT-PCR testing mechanism and showed mild-to-moderate symptoms. The study also included people who were asymptomatic through their course of infection. It concludes that dosage of 1800 mg on day one and 800 mg of the drug spanning over a period of 14-days course ideally can prove to effective. The study has also measured the time a patient takes for their clinical cure.“While a statistically significant difference in the primary endpoint was not achieved, statistically significant results were observed on the clinically meaningful secondary endpoint of time to clinical cure,” the study highlights.It adds: “ There also was a statistically significant difference in time to first use of oxygen, although this observation must be interpreted with utmost caution because of the small number of patients (7 in each treatment group) who required supplemental oxygen suppport in this population. In addition, when evaluating by Covid-19 severity, patients with moderate Covid-19 showed a statistically significant benefit with respect to time to clinical cure.”Favipiravir, according to the study, was found to be safe and well tolerated in this study, despite the potential bias for overreporting of TEAEs in open-label trials. “There were no new safety signals, and no adverse events that led to drug discontinuation or change in dosing regimen; a single patient in the control group experienced an SAE, acute respiratory distress syndrome, which led to death,” it states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/favipiravir-helps-in-mild-to-moderate-covid-19-cases-reduces-treatment-time-study/story-XOPRPkzRRIqYLZysWM39SP.html

People are being tested randomly on Delhi-Gurugram borders; 400 people have been tested so far with three resulting Covid-19 positive. According to the authorities, random testing on borders will help in identification of the most affected areas.Noida was the first district near Delhi to launch random Covid-19 checks at the borders on Wednesday. As per the officials, Noida’s Delhi border reported higher positivity rate of Covid-19 in comparison to the other areas of the district.The Delhi government, meanwhile, has put in place stringent measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has asked for strict adherence to the Covid-19 protocol and increased the fine for not wearing a mask, spitting in public or not following social distancing from Rs 500 to Rs 2000.Also Read | Punjab ready to help Delhi govt to fight Covid-19 crisis: Amarinder SinghDelhi in November broke its previous records by reporting more than 8,000 cases on a single day while also surpassing the five lakh-mark.

21-11-2020||India||Country’s first moss garden comes up in Uttarakhand’s Nainital district||The Uttarakhand forest department on Friday dedicated the newly-built Moss Garden to the people, claiming that it is the country’s first such garden, spread over 10 hectares in Kumaon’s Nainital district. The moss garden, which took nearly a year to build, was inaugurated by Water Man of India Rajendra Singh. Singh said it is a good initiative taken by the Uttarakhand forest department and will go a long way in mending the relationship between mankind and Nature. “Now, it is time to rekindle the relationship between people and Nature. If we don’t take any initiative now to rectify our errors, we will be treading the path of destruction,” he said. Last year, the state forest department had approved research projects to study moss species, considered the most significant indicator of ecosystem fluctuations as they are more sensitive towards habitat and climate changes. Of the 2,300 moss species found in India, 339 are found in Uttarakhand according to experts. Mosses are non-vascular plants that belong to Bryophyta division. They are small flowerless plants that typically grow in damp and shady locations. They play a very important role in maintaining and developing the ecosystem and biodiversity including soil formation, water retention, checking erosion and acting as nutrient sink. Sanjiv Chaturvedi, chief conservator of forests (CCF) and in-charge of the state forest research wing said it is the country’s first moss garden spread over 10 hectares, with an interpretation centre, 30 representative moss species and other bryophyte species, including two species listed in IUCN Red List (Hyophila involuta and Brachythecium buchananii ) and a moss trail nearly 1.25 km long. Chaturvedi said the Moss Garden built near Khurpatal under the CAMPA scheme was developed under a project approved in July 2019, with the aim to conserve various species of moss and other bryophytes and to make the people aware of ecological and other useful roles of moss in our environment. “Moss gardens are very popular in Japan and are the craze there but in India, we have neglected this side so far,” he said. “It has an interpretation centre, in which different aspects of Moss are displayed through models, including First World War paintings showing the use of Sphagnum moss as a dressing for wounds as it absorbs liquids about three times more quickly than cotton, is cooler, softer, and less irritating than cotton and has antiseptic properties. There is also a Dinosaur model showing the existence of Moss since the Jurassic era. Then there are nests of birds using moss for temperature regulation and antibacterial purposes,” he said. The CCF said the moss species are pioneer species, and the first plants to grow on rocky land by breaking down the rocks and the soil they help create a suitable environment for other plants to grow. “They also act as bio-indicators for environmental pollution because they get most of their nutrients directly from the air and rain, rather than the soil,” he said. Chaturvedi said, unfortunately, these species face a threat from mounting pressures of urbanization, habitat destruction, deforestation and pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/country-s-first-moss-garden-comes-up-in-uttarakhand-s-nainital-district/story-ef282Q4p9qHQ0nm5RyL2uI.html

Rane, who earlier this week had said that there wasn’t any need to test or ban people coming in especially from Delhi, however, changed track after holding an ‘emergency meeting’. “In view of the rising Covid-19 cases in Delhi, the Government of Goa will adopt SOPs of [the] Maharashtra government and other state governments for flights and trains coming from Delhi. Secretary Health to have an emergency meeting on protocols for people coming in from the state of Delhi,” Rane said. “With the end of Chhath Puja, a large number of migrant workers will start coming to the state. In view of the same, a note has been sent to the Secretary Health for immediate deliberations on protocols for labourers, SOPs for Industries and for the state with regards to testing,” Rane said. Earlier this week, Rane had said that “as long as the state had the capacity to treat patients”, there would not be any need to impose restrictions on people coming from Delhi. He instead suggested that hotels keep aside a few rooms for isolating those tourists who might develop symptoms or if they get themselves tested and are found positive. Maharashtra, which is the worst-affected state by the Covid-19 pandemic said it was considering banning flights and trains coming from Delhi as the capital has begun witnessing what some say is a third wave of coronavirus cases. “We are also bringing new SOPs, so that every hotel will now have to have some isolation rooms. They need to maintain such rooms. Suppose they have some guests, who turn positive, it is their responsibility to isolate them,” Rane said, while speaking on Wednesday. Goa is recording between 100-150 Covid-19cases per day down from 500-700 cases a few months ago, but has seen an influx of tourists across the month of November as the state reopened in a bid to revive the tourism dependent economy. More than 46,000 people have contracted the disease in the state so far while 672 people have succumbed to the viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-to-adopt-curbs-like-maharashtra-on-arrivals-from-delhi-says-health-minister-vishwajit-rane/story-oens9SpIxse7qWZibkcVwJ.html

Protesters set fire to vehicles and blocked the national highway which led police officials to fire tear gas shells in order to disperse the protesters.Several local organisations under the Joint Movement Committee (JMC) were protesting against the resettlement of Bru-Reang refugees in Kanchanpur sub-division and they had demanded that the state government resettle the members of the displaced community equally among Tripura’s eight districts. They had also called for a districtwide shutdown on November 16.The Brus are a displaced community who have been living across several relief camps in Tripura and Mizoram since 1997 after ethnic clashes broke out between Mizo tribes and Brus. Close to 30,000 Bru tribals had fled the state due to the tensions in Mizoram.The process to resettle the Bru community had begun in 2009 by the governments of Tripura and Mizoram but did not result in any success. In November 2018 Centre decided to resettle Bru refugees in Mizoram but due to protests by the Bru community that plan was too left unimplemented.In 2020 a fresh agreement was signed which said the Brus will not be forced to return to Mizoram. The Centre has also sanctioned a Rs 600 crore rehabilitation package to help resettle the displaced community and along with Tripura government decided to rehabilitate the Brus across North Tripura, Dhalai, Unakoti, Sipahijala and Khowai districts.The locals protesting against the resettlement have complained that the government is trying to resettle all 6,000 displaced families in the Kanchanpur sub-division itself. Speaking to PTI, JMC chairman Zairemthiama Pachuau said that despite assurances that not more than 1,500 families would be settled in the area the numbers have now gone up. He said, “The government is trying to settle 6,000 families. If they go ahead with this, the entire sub-division will be affected environmentally, ecologically, socially and demographically which is not acceptable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bru-resettlement-issue-heavy-security-deployed-in-north-tripura-as-protesters-block-national-highway/story-MK8SCACsvXzMyS82uKmrYK.html

The study ‘Status of Radicalisation in India: An Exploratory Study of Prevention and Remedies’ will be done under the leadership of GS Bajpai, Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice who is also the Registrar of National Law University.According to Bajpai, the study will focus on the process of radicalisation, its actors, target youths and will be probably conducted in four states like Maharashtra, Assam, Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir where cases of radicalisation have been reported.Currently, there is no clear definition of radicalisation in the legal system. On the basis of the study’s findings, Bajpai said that changes in UAPA Act will be suggested to the government.“This study is about the status of radicalisation in India. This study will analyse the pattern and dynamics of radicalisation. Also, we will study actors of radicalisation and how they are targeting youth,” Bajpai told ANI.“Thirdly we will study who are vulnerable targets. These targets are selectively identified by actors of radicalisation. Fourthly, we are interested in the idea of de-radicalisation. We need the blueprint to counter radicalisation,” Bajpai said.On giving suggestions to amend UAPA Act on the basis of study’s findings, Bajpai said, “We will also critically reviewing the current legal aspects, UAPA Act primarily. We would study to define radicalisation and de-radicalisation.”“Approximately 75 radicalised individuals, those undergoing de-radicalisation and de-radicalised individuals shall be sampled from each state. Similarly, 75 functionaries from law enforcement agencies, officers of correctional services and judges will be interviewed from each state,” Bajpai said.“Lastly, approximately 50 relatives of the individuals, psychologists, psycho-social workers, counsellors, religious and community leaders will be sampled from each state,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-approves-study-to-analyse-phenomena-of-radicalisation-recommend-changes-in-uapa/story-ifvLL8TFxnrTZAfDmjt83M.html

The Tamil Nadu Assembly polls are expected to take place on April-May next year.Shah is on a two-day visit to Chennai where he is scheduled to hold crucial meeting with BJP office-bearers and party’s district-level presidents.The alliance between AIADMK and BJP has come into strain after over the latter’s Vetrivel Yatra (victorious spear march). The state government has denied permission citing the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, and AIADMK’s mouthpiece called it “divisive”. However, BJP members have continued with the yatra across Tamil Nadu since November 6, courting arrests and being let off later.A crucial consultative meeting was also held on Friday - a day before Shah’s visit - where the BJP showed its reluctance to accept chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami (EPS) as the candidate for the top job in the 2021 Assembly election, said a party leader on the condition of anonymity.Last month, after days of internal power tussle, Paneerselvam had officially announced Palaniswami as the AIADMK’s chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, Shah took to Twitter to thank the city for its love and support.“It is always great to be in Tamil Nadu. Thank you Chennai for this love and support,” he said in a tweet accompanying a video clip of his walk on GST Road.Shad had earlier visited Tamil Nadu in August 2019 to release a book on Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu’s two years in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-bjp-alliance-to-continue-for-2021-tamil-nadu-polls-o-paneerselvam/story-U8HwqlnNL9grRSCb8tLM1L.html

In view of the increase in Covid cases in some of the north Indian states, the Centre has advised all states and UTs [Union territories] to ramp up testing,” Union health ministry said in a statement.After dropping to 3.4%, India’s daily positivity rate, or the number of samples that test positive among those tested, has remained at just over 4%. Experts say the spread of the infection is under control if the positivity rate remains at 5% or less for around two weeks.India has been conducting one million tests daily and performed 130 million since the country started testing in mid-January.Delhi has reported a third surge in the number of cases since the second-week of October. The highest--8,593--cases were recorded on November 11 and most deaths in a day (131) were reported on November 18. Delhi has been conducting the highest number of tests per-million population.States like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Rajasthan have reported the highest new cases but conduct fewer tests per-million than the national average of 94,679, as per the health ministry data.Of the 564 deaths reported on Friday, 83% were in 10 states. Maharashtra topped the list with 155 deaths, followed by Delhi (118), and West Bengal (50).With the number of cases and positivity rate slightly lower than last week, experts believe the higher number of deaths in Delhi is because of the cases that had been reported earlier. “The increase in the number of deaths is not unexpected. There is always a lag between the spike in the number of cases and deaths. It is the time between people getting diagnosed; their hospitalisation and death. Also, when...the number of cases is huge, the number of deaths will also be more. But the case fatality ratio continues to be 1.57%,” said Dr Rajinder K Dhamija of the Lady Hardinge Medical College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-uts-to-ramp-up-covid-19-testing/story-ZNgkCvk0j5tycmMejOKMJK.html

I ask BJP leaders if these marriages come under the definition of ‘love jihad’,” the Congress was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.A war of words over ‘love jihad’ began when Gehlot took to Twitter on Friday to say that the BJP has ‘manufactured’ the term ‘love jihad’ to divide the nation and curb individual rights of citizens.Gehlot also said that the marriage between two individuals should be a personal matter to those individuals concerned and the government has no part to play in it. The BJP’s Rajasthan chief Satish Poonia lashed out at Gehlot and accused him of ignoring “the plight of our daughters” and said the comments display his “small thinking”.The row over ‘love jihad’ has gained momentum as several BJP-ruled states like Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh are considering a ban on religious conversion for the purpose of marriage.Several right-wing organisations believe ‘love jihad’ is a ploy to get more Hindus converted to Islam using love and marriage as a tool to lure Hindu women into marriage with Muslim men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-interfaith-marriages-performed-by-bjp-leaders-be-called-love-jihad-asks-chattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghel/story-MCSNfhlStiPOXGuWxfHoNL.html

The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) also released a report on the state of investigation into the case. The organisation demanded security for the family and their rehabilitation through the Nirbhaya fund. The whole family is in a way under house arrest conditions and their normal social life has been cut off, PUCL members Kamal Singh, Farman Naqvi, Alok, Shashikant, and K B Maurya told reporters here. The victim’s family members fear for their lives once the CRPF protection is withdrawn, they said. The PUCL members said cases must be lodged against officials for a hurried cremation of the victim. Action should be taken against District Magistrate Praveen Kumar, SP Vikram Veer, and the area SHO in this regard. The 19-year-old Dalit woman died at a Delhi hospital a fortnight after her alleged rape by four men from her village in Hathras district on September 14.She was cremated in the middle of the night in her village. Her family members claimed that the cremation, which took place well past midnight, was without their consent and they were not allowed to bring home the body one last time. The PUCL members said action should also be taken against those responsible for “defaming” the woman’s family.They demanded that cases lodged for the alleged bid to incite violence in the name of the incident should be brought under the ongoing CBI investigation. Currently, these cases are being probed by the state’s Special Task Force(STF), they added. Alok and Farman Naqvi alleged that the name of the Popular Front of India (PFI) has been dragged into the controversy to create a Hindu-Muslim chasm and divert attention. Kamal Singh said the PFI is not on the list of banned organisations but Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath calls it an extremist body. If that is so, then why a ban has not been imposed against it, he asked. Four people, said to be members of the PFI, were arrested in Mathura while on their way to Hathras last months. The Uttar Pradesh police had said the four, including a journalist, had links with the Popular Front of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hathras-rape-victim-s-kin-living-in-conditions-akin-to-house-arrest-civil-rights-body/story-3QGmcZtcSaL6oGqA8urLBM.html

I have said that earlier also,” he said. Singh lauded the healthcare and frontline workers of Punjab for their “excellent” work in handling the pandemic in the state. He assured full preparedness by his government to augment healthcare facilities to prepare for a possible second wave of the pandemic. Singh said while nobody knew when the second wave of infection would strike Punjab, the experience of the NCR and other states and regions showed it was almost certain. The chief minister expressed confidence that the health department will once again rise to the occasion to meet any challenge, a government release issued here said. It was the duty of the state government to support the healthcare and other frontline workers, many of whom have got infected and some have even lost their lives to Covid-19, Singh said. He also exhorted the people to actively help the state in the fight against the pandemic by strictly following all safety norms. “Mask hi vaccine hai” (mask is the vaccine), as a resolve for the next few months till a vaccine against infection finally is available, Singh said. The chief minister also launched 107 health and wellness centres to boost the healthcare infrastructure in the state and to provide health services to patients at their doorsteps in both rural and urban areas. He said these new centers would take the state’s health infrastructure to a new level of efficacy amid the pandemic. Of the 3,049 centres planned in the state, 2,046 were now operational and 800 more would become operational in the next two months, with the remaining to be opened in 2021, Singh said. He said the state government was focused on strengthening healthcare facilities, especially levels two and three, with the aim to save lives through early testing and treatment. Urging people to avoid crowded places and not have large gatherings and social functions indoors, he stressed the need to observe all precautions, especially washing hands and wearing face masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-ready-to-help-delhi-govt-to-fight-covid-19-crisis-amarinder-singh/story-ZvfrqhDycdQyOcWsXyH6eK.html

All movement of stock can be digitally tracked and those receiving vaccines can also be traced after two to three weeks if the vaccine requires two shots. This will ensure last mile vaccine delivery.”Prime minister Narendra Modi held a high-level meeting on Friday with NITI Aayog member VK Paul, foreign secretary Harshvardhan Shringla, principal secretary to the prime minister Dr PK Misra and several other senior officials from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) and the health ministry to review the country’s preparation ahead of a vaccine rollout.After the meeting he tweeted, “Held a meeting to review India’s vaccination strategy and the way forward.

21-11-2020||India||Tibetan administration head Lobsang Sangay invited to White House||The head of the Tibetan administration in exile visited the White House on Saturday for talks with American officials in response to the first such invitation in six decades, with the development coming against the backdrop of heightened tensions between the US and China. The visit by Lobsang Sangay, president of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), to the White House was described by the Tibet.net website run by CTA as a “historic feat”. Last month, Sangay became the first CTA chief to be invited to the state department to meet assistant secretary Robert Destro, the special coordinator for Tibetan issues. “In the last six decades, the head of CTA was denied entry to the US State Department and White House; the logic for both denials was that the US government does not recognise the Tibetan government in exile,” a report on the website said. “Today’s visit amounts to an acknowledgement of both the democratic system of the CTA and its political head,” it added. Sangay met White House officials and the meeting “will set an optimistic tone for CTA participation with US officials and be more formalised in the coming years”, according to the report on Tibet.net. There was no official word from the White House on the meeting. Earlier, Sangay met White House officials at undisclosed locations more than a dozen times in the past 10 years since he became the CTA’s president in 2011. Earlier this week, Sangay held several virtual meetings with US officials and lawmakers. During meetings with Jim McGovern, chair of the Congressional executive commission on China, and senior Republican and Democratic staffers of the Senate foreign relations committee, Sangay discussed the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019 and other matters. These developments have come against the backdrop of heightened tensions between the US and China on key issues such as trade, human rights, Beijing’s assertive actions in the South China Sea and elsewhere and the India-China border standoff. The Chinese government has reacted angrily to Sangay’s meetings with the American officials and called on Washington to stop interfering in Beijing’s internal affairs and undermining the stability of Tibet. This week, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution on the significance of advocacy for “genuine autonomy for Tibetans” and the work done by the Dalai Lama to promote global peace and harmony. The resolution, tabled by Congressman Ted Yoho, recognised the “cultural and religious significance of a genuinely autonomous Tibet” and commended the Dalai Lama for his commitment to peace and non-violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tibetan-administration-head-lobsang-sangay-invited-to-white-house/story-e9HV0pOZTrMJxrifBDi6cJ.html

Akbar had filed the complaint against Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago when he was a journalist. Ramani had said the allegations against Akbar, made in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018, were her truth and were made in public good. Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Ravindra Kumar Pandey posed the query on Saturday as he started hearing afresh the final arguments in the case since the previous judge hearing the matter was transferred to another court on Wednesday.  Senior advocate Geeta Luthra, appearing for Akbar, said she needed time to talk to her client before making a decision on the issue. The counsel for Ramani, advocate Bhavook Chauhan, said there was less chance of any settlement since the facts of the case were peculiar. The court asked both the parties to respond on the point of settlement and get back on November 24, the next date of hearing. The previous judge, ACMM Vishal Pahuja, had started hearing the final arguments in the case on February 7 this year. Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani in October 15, 2018. He resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018. Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation. He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment by women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him. Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by M J Akbar while they were working as journalists under him. He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing”” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/metoo-court-asks-mj-akbar-ramani-if-there-is-scope-of-settlement-in-defamation-case/story-gMqRZCwsX3SY3wooVBRg7O.html
21-11-2020||India||‘Whisper a prayer’: Good samaritan leaves clothes for needy in Kohima||Amid the day to day hustle, an unidentified good samaritan(s) mysteriously left used but reusable items, including clothes of varying sizes, bags and purses etc., on a pavement in Kohima with a simple message - “Pick any and whisper a prayer”. The phrase “good samaritan”, meaning someone who helps a stranger, derives from the parable told by Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Luke in the Holy Bible. It tells about a traveller who was beaten and left half-dead on a road. A Jewish priest and a Levite who passed by him avoided him but a Samaritan helped the injured man even though he did not know him.A photograph of the items was posted on a popular social networking platform by a youth who saw the giveaway items lying on the streets. The youth, Chenio N Odyuo, who is the sports ambassador of Aainball Federation of India, said he was returning from a friend’s house on Friday night when he spotted the items laid out on a pavement.

Odyuo posted the pics on different groups on Facebook with the caption “Whoever did this, God bless you”. The post has so far garnered more than 5,000 likes and still counting. Facebook users reacted enthusiastically to the post. Some are even suggesting to make it a trend to donate reusable items to the needy across different locations to spread goodwill.“I am touched by the fact that humanity still exists,” commented a user while another said, “It is truly heartwarming to see such an act of kindness towards the needy. May God bless the cheerful giver”. “Now this is what making a difference looks like,” another remarked. Although Nagaland has the distinction of not having beggars or homeless roaming about the streets in any of its towns, except for the Dimapur railway station area where some beggars could be spotted occasionally, there are, as in any other society, needy people who barely get by. This incident has grabbed the attention of many and is being seen as an apt action with the onset of the festive season. Christmas season is usually considered as a time of goodwill and cheer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whisper-a-prayer-good-samaritan-leaves-clothes-for-needy-in-kohima/story-lZdFOY8fp70yBMwnbeuX8J.html

We traced his bike and caught him. The suspect opened fire on police and was injured in the shooting. He has been admitted to the district hospital,” A Satish Ganesh, inspector general of Agra range, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The man attacked Dr Nisha Singhal with a knife and slit her throat even as her children were in another room, according to reports. Her two children, who witnessed the crime, were also attacked by the man. The children received knife wounds and are being treated in a hospital, reports said.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav and the Congress’ women’s wing tweeted about the crime as they questioned the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government’s stance on crime in the state.“The state is stunned by the incident in Agra where the throat of a woman doctor slit inside her house in a busy residential area.

21-11-2020||India||UP home department sends proposal to law ministry for tough law against ‘love jihad’: Official||The Uttar Pradesh Home Department has sent a proposal to the state’s Law Ministry for a stringent law to deal with the alleged religious conversion of women in the name of marriage, which the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) leaders refer to as “love jihad”. The development follows an announcement by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath during recent election rallies that his government would come out with a law to deal with the “love jihad”. A proposal for strict law against “love jihad” has been sent to the Law Department, a government spokesman confirmed on Friday.Stressing on the need for a strict law to deal with “love jihad”, UP Law Minister Brijesh Pathak on Friday told PTI. “There has been a rise in such cases in the state which have caused social disharmony and enmity. These incidents are also bringing a bad name to the state and therefore a strict law is the need of the hour.” “We will do whatever is required as soon as we receive a proposal from the Home Department as we have already made all necessary preparations,” Pathak said.  Addressing by-elections rallies in Jaunpur and Deoria on October 31, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had said his government would come out with a law to deal with ‘love jihad’ and used the Hindu funeral chant ‘Ram Naam Satya Hai’ to threaten those who don’t respect their daughters and sisters.Welcoming the Allahabad High Court ruling which had declared that conversion for the sole purpose of marriage is not valid, the chief minister had also said posters would be put up of those involved in ‘love jihad’, a derogatory coinage referring to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love.“We will bring an effective law. It is my warning to those who play with the honour and dignity of sisters and daughters by hiding their real names and identities. If they do not mend their ways, their ‘Ram Naam Satya’ journey will start,” Adityanath had said. The Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission had submitted a report last year suggesting a new law to check the forcible religious conversions.“The commission is of the view that existing legal provisions are not enough to check religious conversion and on this serious matter, a new law is needed like in some other states,” the report said.The report was submitted by the Law Commission along with draft legislation, Uttar Pradesh Freedom of Religion Bill, 2019.  In Kanpur, accotding to officials, the police had earlier set up a Special Investigation Team to look into reports of “love jihad”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-home-department-sends-proposal-to-law-ministry-for-tough-law-against-love-jihad-official/story-joVHXezLiQeKm6E0g7VjKN.html
21-11-2020||India||‘Desist from policy of supporting terror’: India slams Pak over planned JeM attack in Nagrota||India on Saturday summoned Pakistan’s senior-most diplomat in New Delhi and lodged a strong protest over an attempted attack by the UN-designated terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) that was recently foiled by security forces in Jammu and Kashmir.The external affairs ministry summoned Aftab Hassan Khan, chargé d’affaires at the Pakistan high commission, and demanded that “Pakistan desists from its policy of supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from its territory and dismantle the terror infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries,” according to an official statement.Khan was told the Indian government is “firmly and resolutely committed to take all necessary measures to safeguard its national security in the fight against terrorism”.On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said security forces in Jammu and Kashmir had foiled a plan by JeM to “wreak major havoc and destruction” by killing four members of the group and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives. The four terrorists were gunned down during a three-hour gun battle on the Jammu-Srinagar highway on Thursday.The statement said security forces had thwarted a “major terror attack” in Nagrota, and that initial reports indicated the attackers were “members of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a terrorist organization proscribed by the United Nations and several countries”. Also read: 4 Jaish terrorists killed in Nagrota got orders from Masood Azhar’s brotherThe huge cache of arms, ammunition and explosives seized on Thursday indicated “detailed planning for a major attack to destabilise the peace and security in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, in particular, to derail the ongoing democratic exercise of conduct of local district development council elections”, it added.“The government of India expressed its serious concerns at continued terror attacks by JeM against India,” the statement said. India’s long-standing demand that Pakistan “fulfil its international obligations and bilateral commitments to not allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India in any manner” was reiterated to the Pakistani chargé d’affaires.The statement said the JeM has been part of several attacks in India in the past, including the suicide attack in Pulwama in February 2019 that killed 40 Indian troopers and triggered a standoff between the two sides. India had carried out an airstrike on a JeM facility in Balakot in retaliation for the suicide bombing.On Friday, Pakistan had rejected allegations levelled by the PM Modi and contended they were part of “India’s desperate attempts to divert international attention from” the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. A statement issued by the foreign office in Islamabad also accused India of involvement in “state-sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan”. “It is evident that India has stepped up anti-Pakistan propaganda, following presentation of the dossier by Pakistan providing irrefutable evidence of India’s state-sponsorship of terrorism,” it said, referring to a dossier that was unveiled earlier this month by the civilian and military leadership.Pakistan claimed the dossier contained proof of the alleged involvement of Indian intelligence operatives in acts of terrorism but the allegations were rubbished by India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/desist-from-policy-of-supporting-terror-india-slams-pak-over-planned-attack-by-jem/story-RFa20R5d8SpOsAT3QxZSIK.html

He added they are not allowed to campaign due to perceived threats to their lives. “Confining candidates against their wishes has severely restricted their movement and ability to campaign.”Tarigami said in some cases, the candidates are not even allowed to attend the meetings of their parties. “Some cases have surfaced where opposite candidates are sent in the same vehicle to a village for campaigning and are asked to campaign together. Several candidates from far off places were sent to hotels in Srinagar soon after they filled the nomination forms last week. Not just the voters, but the families of the candidates are also concerned.”Tarigami called it a big concern and said there is a lot of dissatisfaction over such arrangements.“Who wins and who loses, the decision must lie with the electorate. Democracy must finally win. For that, the process must be made secure and credible. It is advisable not to put avoidable restrictions on the contesting candidates and instead their legitimate movement for the campaigning in their respective areas must be effectively facilitated. Ensuring a free and fair environment for this process is essential.”Former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah earlier accused the police of harassing their workers ahead of the polls from November 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpi-m-writes-to-lg-over-confinement-of-gupkar-alliance-candidates-ahead-of-j-k-local-polls/story-19nHKN6ESv2cnXSTKUwyLI.html

It will a provision of five years in jail for forced conversions for marriage. The Haryana government also indicated on the same day that it will constitute a committee of officials to study and draft law to that effect. Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka have also said they will bring in legislation to end love jihad.However, according to experts, the charges of “love jihad” are bogus and that adult men and women are free to convert under the right to freedom of religion.

Last year, the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission submitted a report to Adityanath, suggesting “a new law to check forcible religious conversions.” Kanpur Police had also set up a special investigation team to look into “love jihad” cases.Madhya PradeshThe central state’s home minister Narottam Mishra had said on Tuesday the Madhya Pradesh Dharm Swatantrey (freedom of religion) Bill, 2020, will be passed in the next session of the state assembly. Mishra said the law -- with a provision of five years in jail for forced conversions for marriage -- was necessitated because of rising cases of love jihad. He insisted that the BJP government was not against interfaith marriages but only against incidents of love jihad.Also read | New Madhya Pradesh bill likely to replace 1968 law“We are going to table the Madhya Pradesh Dharm Swatantrey Bill, 2020, in this winter session in December against love jihad, which means a woman is forced or lured by a person of other religion for marriage and later she is tortured for conversion,” said Mishra.The proposed law doesn’t mention any religion in particular in its provisions. Mishra said the bill proposes rigorous imprisonment for five years for “luring a person through fraud and forcing marriage by religious conversion”. Other proposed provisions include making it mandatory for kin of the person being converted for the purpose of marriage to file a complaint.“The forceful conversions and marriages will be a cognisable offence and non-bailable. There will be a provision for declaring such marriages null and void,” said Mishra. Besides, those assisting in such acts will be made co-accused in the case, he added.HaryanaHaryana home minister Anil Vij said the state government intended to constitute a committee of officials to study and draft law against love-jihad. “We will first have a discussion with the chief minister, ML Khattar, in this regard,’’ Vij said.

This committee will study similar laws enacted by other states, he added.KarnatakaThe BJP national general secretary CT Ravi said on Friday that a ban on “love jihad” and cow slaughter would be a reality in Karnataka very soon.

21-11-2020||India||Govt may approach ICAI for action against 3 CAs over GST frauds||The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) is likely to ask the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) to take action against three chartered accountants (CAs) arrested for their alleged involvement in generating bogus bills to fraudulently avail input tax credit (ITC) under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, two officials said.The three have been arrested as part of the government’s nationwide drive against the GST frauds, the officials added requesting anonymity.ICAI is a statutory body established under the Chartered Accountants Act for regulating chartered accountancy in the country. The Institute functions under the administrative control of the ministry of corporate affairs. The ICAI is the second largest professional body of CAs in the world.The DGGI and the Central GST Commissionerate continued their drive against fraudsters. It has arrested 41 people, including three CAs and a Chennai-based businesswoman, as part of the drive. The three CAs are from Hyderabad and Ludhiana.DGGI (Hyderabad) arrested one CA for his role in arranging and organising fake invoices of fictitious firms for one company that led to fraudulent claims of ITC worth Rs 27.4 crore. Another CA from Hyderabad was arrested for a similar crime resulting in fraudulent claims of ITC worth Rs 10.37 crore.A Ludhiana-based CA was arrested for his role in creating three fake firms, through which he fraudulently availed of ITC and monetisation of ITC through refunds and bogus billing.Using tools such as artificial intelligence and data analytics on the e-way bill portal, it could be established that these firms had a common set of ghost partners. They generated bogus bills worth Rs 158 crore, involving fake ITC of more than Rs 21 crore and monetisation of fake ITC of over Rs 5 crore through cash refund, one of officials said.The second person, who works for DGGI, said, “With total 41 arrests of GST fraudsters so far, the agency has filed 577 cases against 2,221 identified entities in the eighth day of its drive against the GST fake invoice frauds.” Recent arrests were made in Gurugram, Nagpur, Kolkata and Mumbai, he added.The government is also tightening the procedure for new GST registration to check frauds. “The businesses, whose owners or promoters do not have commensurate income-tax payment records, will require physical and financial verification before their companies can be given GST registration,” the first person said.Explaining the menace, he said, fake invoices were not only issued for availing ITC fraudulently but also for activities leading to tax evasion, bank loan fraud, money laundering, and hawala transactions. “These activities have been largely carried out by non-existent or fly-by-night firms and by using a network of firms to game the system to usurp ITC on the commission basis,” he added.These activities have been carried out, primarily, by those elements who have exploited the ease of doing business conveniences in the existing system by getting a GST registration easily and quickly. They took advantage of the liberalised norm for grant of registration in GST.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-approach-icai-for-action-against-3-cas-over-gst-frauds/story-bqOOHvZ2tAj4ysJEAGTyeO.html

Bihar Police had registered a zero FIR at Utkarsh’s hometown of Muzaffarpur based on his family’s complaint against his girlfriend and her sister.Officials say it is unusual for the police in one state to try to investigate a crime that primarily relates to another. But Bihar Police had departed from this standard practice in August this year when it registered an FIR for abetment to suicide, dishonestly inducing delivery of property and breach of trust in actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in Mumbai on a complaint from his father KK Singh.The zero FIR has been transferred to Amboli Police from Bihar according to the procedure. The FIR was registered in Mumbai’s Amboli police station under sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 34 (acts by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), according to police officials cited by news agency ANI.Amboli Police officials said that they are investigating the matter and booked a struggling actress and her sister on Thursday for allegedly killing Utkarsh.Utkarsh was found dead in his rented apartment in Mumbai’s Andheri area on September 27. According to Amboli Police officials, he died by suicide and was depressed due to lack of work. His family, however, had dismissed claims, saying Utkarsh was murdered. Amboli Police had initially registered an accidental death record (ADR) in connection with the case.Akshat’s father Vijaykant Chaudhary had said in a written complaint that a struggling actor who was a friend of Akshat wanted to marry him. But when he refused to marry her, she with the help of her sister killed him, said Amboli Police officers.An FIR can be filed in any police station irrespective of the place of incident or jurisdiction. The FIR is filed at a police station that does not have jurisdiction over the incident and is known as a ‘zero FIR’.

With many countries, especially in Europe, experiencing a second wave of the pandemic, the need for a Covid-19 vaccine is being increasingly felt.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn what offers a glimmer of hope, India’s Bharat Biotech International Limited, which is conducting phase three trials of its vaccine candidate in the country, has said it plans to enrol 1,000-2,000 volunteers each in metros like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Also, America’s Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech SE have applied for emergency use authorisation in the United States for their joint vaccine candidate.Here are the latest updates on a potential Covid-19 vaccine:1. Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, whose vaccine candidate is called Covaxin, said in a statement to Mint that interested volunteers staying near the trial site can meet the principal investigator for participating in the trial. People below 18 years of age, as well as those who earlier tested positive for Covid-19, will not be eligible, the company said. Bharat Biotech began phase three trials of Covaxin earlier this week in what is the largest efficacy trial ever in India. The company is also in touch with Brazil, the world’s third worst-hit country, to offer the South American nation its vaccine candidate, executive director Sai Prasad told Reuters.2. The emergency use authorisation (EUA) sought by Pfizer and BioNTech comes just days after the two companies reported their vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, was found 95% effective without any major safety concerns. In a video posted on the company’s website on Friday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla confirmed an application has been made to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with regards to emergency use authorisation.3. Britain-based AstraZeneca on Saturday started late-stage trials of an experimental long-acting monoclonal antibody combination drug it hopes could be used to protect those at risk of contracting coronavirus for up to 12 months. A total of 5,000 people from European countries and also from the US will be recruited for phase trials of the drug, called AZD7442. The treatment from the said drug would differ from that through a vaccine in that it introduces antibodies, rather than prompting the body’s immune system to make them.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-vaccine-updates-bharat-biotech-to-recruit-volunteers-for-trial-pfizer-files-for-emergency-use-authorisation/story-f4QeoFebgnw2kLs1d2LaqN.html

According to people familiar with the matter, initial data from a global positioning system (GPS) device and mobile phones carried by the four terrorists shows that they were in touch with Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) operational commanders Mufti Rauf Asghar and Qari Zarar with the objective of wreaking havoc in the Valley. Mufti Asghar is the younger brother of JeM chief and UN designated global terrorist Masood Azhar.Also Read: ‘Major havoc, destruction once again thwarted,’ PM thanks security forces a day after Nagrota encounterOn Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was briefed about the entire operation by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval in the presence of Home Minister Amit Shah, Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla and the two intelligence chiefs. Following this, the PM said in a tweet: “Neutralizing of four terrorist belonging to Pakistan based terrorist organizations JeM and the presence of large cache of explosives with them indicates that their efforts to wreak havoc and destruction have once again been thwarted.” Thanking the security forces for their brave action, PM Modi said that their alertness had scotched a nefarious plot to target grassroots level democratic exercises (reference to the Panchayat elections) in Kashmir.The people familiar with the matter added that the Pakistani deep state is, as is its wont, using pan-Islamist jihadist groups such as JeM to target India by sending in suicide attackers across the border. HT learns that Pakistani agencies have decided to hand over the Balakot terror training facility to JeM, more than one and a half years after it was bombed by IAF jets.NSA Doval was informed about the Ban toll plaza encounter early on Thursday morning as soon as the firing started at 4.50 am. Preliminary investigations have revealed that the four terrorists, all from Pakistan’s Punjab Province, moved from across Shakargarh bulge and crossed over to India in the Samba sector.

The terrorists were battle trained as despite repeated attempts of the J&K police to capture one of them alive, they refused to give in and fought till the end.Indian intelligence officials say that apart from being an attempt to sabotage the electoral exercise underway in the region, the aborted attack may also be a diversionary tactic by the Pakistani army and ISI chiefs, under pressure from Opposition parties in the country, to bring the focus back on Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-jaish-terrorists-killed-in-nagrota-got-orders-from-masood-azhar-s-brother/story-kKe6ImIr1rhQSdWztyHD4I.html
21-11-2020||India||Major attack foiled with killing of JeM terrorists: PM Modi||Security forces foiled Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM)’s terror plot to wreak “major havoc” and target “grassroots level” democratic exercises in Jammu and Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday, a day after four suspected infiltrators were gunned down in a three-hour encounter on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway. Modi held a review meeting with home minister Amit Shah, National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla and top intelligence officials to take stock of the security situation in the Union Territory, where investigators said that the Jaish plan had a dual objective: to carry out a strike on the 12th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks and to fan fear ahead of the upcoming local body polls in the region. “Neutralising of 4 terrorists belonging to Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed and the presence of large cache of weapons and explosives with them indicates that their efforts to wreak major havoc and destruction have once again been thwarted,” Modi tweeted after the review meeting.

Thanks to their alertness, they have defeated a nefarious plot to target grassroots level democratic exercises in Jammu and Kashmir,” he added, referring to the district development council (DDC) elections, which will be held from November 28 to December 22. The four Jaish terrorists, believed to be Pakistani nationals, had sneaked into India from the Samba sector in the early hours of Thursday along with a huge consignment of arms and ammunition, including six AK-56 rifles, five AK-47 rifles, three pistols, 16 AK magazines, a packet of RDX, 20 Chinese hand grenades, six UBGL grenades and 20 kgs of explosive, according to security officials in J&K who did not want to be named. Acting on intelligence inputs, security forces intercepted the truck ferrying the terrorists to the Kashmir Valley around 4.50am at Ban toll plaza near Nagrota in Jammu district. The terrorists were shot dead in the gun battle that followed. Two security officials suffered injuries in the operation. They are said to be stable. The driver of the truck is on the run. “A few days ago, (Jaish founder Masood Azhar’s brother) Abdul Rauf Asghar aka Rauf Lala was seen across the International Border in Shakargarh area of Narowal district. The area has launch pads (to push terrorists into India),” said one of the officials cited above, requesting anonymity. Intelligence agencies had warned of a possible infiltration bid and a major terror attack on November 26 (coinciding with the 2008 Mumbai attacks and just before the beginning of the local body elections), this official said. He said that the Special Operations Group of the Jammu and Kashmir Police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were ready. The truck that was carrying the terrorists had a fake number plate, according to the officials who have identified the vehicle. It was spotted at 8.31pm on November 1 at Lakhanpur (in Kathua district bordering Punjab) and was headed for Punjab. It returned (to Lakhanpur) with rice grains around 10.33am on November 9, they added. The truck was not seen on the highway from November 10 to November 18. On November 19, it was seem in Samba district on the Pathankot-Jammu highway at 3.43am, where it paid toll tax, the officials said. It reached the Ban toll plaza, the site of the encounter, around 4.45am via Bajalta Chowk on Sidhra by-pass of Jammu district, according to the investigators. “The driver fled from the spot as security personnel approached the vehicle; they came under heavy fire,” the official cited above said. According to investigators, the terrorists were asked to surrender but they fired at the forces and threw grenades at them. The truck, loaded with rice sacks, caught fire during the encounter. As guns fell silent, the bodies of the terrorists were recovered from inside the truck. Officials said that medicines with Pakistani markings found on the terrorists proved they infiltrated from across the border. “These terrorists usually use rivulets and marshy land along the 198-km International Border in the winters, when fog reduces visibility, to sneak into the Jammu region,” an Indian Army official who did not want to be named said. “Once into the Indian territory, it is not a big deal for these terrorists, trained in guerrilla warfare, to cover the distance from the International border to Jammu-Pathankot highway (10-15km),” this official added, pointing out that they also get help from sleeper cells on the Indian side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/major-attack-foiled-with-killing-of-jem-terrorists-pm-modi/story-z2WICbBvyTvuJqBaMJPv4H.html
21-11-2020||India||ED registers money laundering charges in TRP manipulation case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered a money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in the Television Rating Points (TRP) manipulation case.ED’s case is based on Mumbai police’s FIR that is being investigated by a special investigation team (SIT) of Mumbai Crime branch. SIT officials previously claimed that Republic TV’s distribution head paid ₹15 lakh a month for seven months to a fixer to boost the viewership of the channel. SIT officials also suspected some Hawala transactions took place between the executives of some channels and vendors to boost the viewership of their channels illegally. ED may look into these suspicious financial transactions.ED is the second central agency to get involved in a case concerning TRPs. Interestingly, soon after the Mumbai Police launched its investigation, the Central Bureau of Investigation registered a case on a TRP racket in Uttar Pradesh. A senior ED officer confirmed to HT that an EICR has been registered in the TRP manipulation matter and the probe has begun. HT learns that the probe will cover all the channels named in the original FIR and not just Republic TV. ED officials said senior executives of all these channels will be summoned for questioning by ED officials.Mumbai police had begun investigation in the matter after ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group. In October, while sharing details of the findings of preliminary inquiry, the Mumbai police claimed that TRP ratings, which decide who will get the biggest share of advertisements, were being manipulated by three channels, two regional channels and Republic TV. Later, 12 people were arrested by the SIT in connection with the manipulation. Republic TV has denied any wrongdoing. SIT also arrested Republic TV’s distribution head Ghanshyam Dilipkumar Singh, from his Thane residence. Singh allegedly paid monthly ₹15 lakh for seven months to a vendor to boost viewership of his channel, the crime branch claimed in the remand copy filed before the court. Police also claimed that hawala channels were also used for these transactions. “Relentless attack on Republic Media network continues; Republic Distribution head AVP Ghanshyam Singh detained by crime branch; Ghanshyam had been cooperating in the Mumbai police’s fake TRP case probe,” the channel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-registers-money-laundering-charges-in-trp-manipulation-case/story-Qwag6ea01JVXsU9aLfwlLJ.html

21-11-2020||India||IAF helps Sri Lankan women pilots break glass ceiling||Rangana Weerawardhana and Pavithra Gunaratne, the first women pilots in Sri Lanka’s air force, expressed gratitude to the Indian Air Force on Friday for helping them script military history in the island nation. The two pilot officers were commissioned as military pilots in Sri Lanka earlier this week, a year after they completed a crucial part of their flying training at the Dundigal-based Air Force Academy near Hyderabad in 2018-19.“Becoming a military pilot was a childhood dream,” said Weerawardhana. “We never thought we would get an opportunity to pursue flying training at AFA, Hyderabad. We would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to IAF for helping us achieve our dreams,” she said. “Watching the Su-30 and other fighter aircraft was like a dream come true. It further strengthened our resolve to become military pilots,” she said, recalling a study tour to Pune where they saw the IAF’s Sukhoi-30 fighter planes for the first time.Weerwardhana also became the first woman in SLAF’s history to command a parade at the commissioning parade on November 16 at the SLAF Academy in China Bay. The pilot officer was also awarded the Sword of Honour for outstanding all-round performance.The two women, who were among the 53 cadets commissioned as officers this week, started training with the SLAF in July 2017 and were sent to India after they completed a basic combat course. At AFA, they completed their basic flying training on the Pilatus PC-7 MkII aircraft, before returning to Sri Lanka last year, for their advanced training on the Chinese Y-12 light transport aircraft. Ahead of joining the AFA in June 2018, Weerawardhana and Gunaratne said, they watched several documentaries on the AFA to get a sense of the IAF’s training activities and the challenges they would be up for in Hyderabad.Recalling their visit to India as their first trip abroad, the two women fondly recalled their IAF instructors. “The specialty of military flying is to achieve expected levels of performance in a limited time. These levels cannot be achieved individually,” Gunaratne said. The performance of a cadet is a not just the reflection of his or her effort but also the effort of the instructor, she said. “The perfect guidance given by our instructors raised our confidence. We should also not forget the contribution of the methodical training programme towards the performance of the student,” Gunaratne said. Both agreed that despite excitement for the training in India, they were also uncertain about what would follow. “We had a feeling of uncertainty when we started our basic flying training. The PC-7 is a sophisticated aircraft with modern systems. We felt proud when we got into the cockpit first time. We worked really hard to complete the basic flying course successfully. Methodical use of flying simulators helped a great deal,” said Weerawardhana. Gunaratne fondly remembered her fellow Indian cadets at the AFA, and said, “They were like our brothers and sisters who made us feel at home throughout the training period. Their smiling faces gave us extra strength during the rigourous training. The stories we shared during leisure gave us an opportunity to have a great understanding of each other’s cultures and traditions.” “We had great excitement when we stepped into the AFA. The feeling we had was totally opposite on the day we had to return to our country. With all the memories of the academy and India, it was not easy for us to leave,” Gunaratne said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-helps-sri-lankan-women-pilots-break-glass-ceiling/story-EovP2VNZP3UM1VmvKzAMDK.html

21-11-2020||India||Gujarat brings in restrictions to check spread of Covid-19||The Gujarat government has imposed a 57-hour curfew in Ahmedabad in the face of surging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases that are being described as the third wave of infections, even as chief minister Vijay Rupani said the curfew was not a precursor to an indefinite lockdown.The decision was taken late on Thursday after the state recorded 1,340 cases, the highest surge in infections in 47 days. In the 24 hours to Friday, Gujarat recorded 1,420 Covid-19 cases, taking the state tally to 194,402. It also recorded seven new fatalities due to the virus, with the death toll now at 3,837, according to the health bulletin released by the state government on Friday.Ahmedabad accounted for the highest jump in Covid-19 cases, with 246 new infections, followed by Surat (239), Vadodara (149), Rajkot (137) and Gandhinagar (80). Till Thursday morning, there were 2,845 active cases in Ahmedabad.In addition to the curfew, the state government has also put off its decision to reopen schools and colleges from November 23. The Gujarat Public Services Commission (GPSC) has also postponed exams to recruit medical teachers, which were to begin on November 22, official statements said.The government on Friday also announced a night curfew between 9pm and 6am in Surat, Rajkot and Vadodara from Saturday. A night curfew has been already announced in Ahmedabad from 9 pm next Monday. In addition, a 57-hour weekend curfew would begin from 9 pm in the city on Friday night and end at 6 am on November 23.Rupani said the sudden spike in the cases were because of Diwali and related activities as well as the onset of winter. Diwali festivities are a week-long affair in Gujarat, and stretch till Labh Pancham (this year, it ended on Thursday). It saw thousands of people thronging markets, malls and streets. In fact, all appeals by authorities to avoid bursting firecrackers fell on deaf ears.“The blame [for surge in cases] surely lies with the carelessness of the people at large; there was no sense of responsibility at all. But this is also because a tough and clear message has not gone from the Gujarat government,” said Dr Mona Desai, president of the Ahmedabad branch of the Indian Medical Association. Additional chief secretary Rajiv Gupta, who is also the officer on special duty for Ahmedabad Covid-19 management, told reporters that around 1,500 new beds had been added in hospitals in view of the rising cases. Health department officials said the cancer and kidney wings on the state-run Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad have been reopened to treat coronavirus cases.Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of the Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said 93% of 2,300 beds in private hospitals are occupied. Civil Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr JV Modi said several of the new patients have come with severe viral load requiring oxygen support. However, unlike May, the hospital is better prepared with more ventilator beds and better facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-brings-in-restrictions-to-check-spread-of-covid-19/story-u7EaU2lYpOkaO5FrbOMRkN.html

21-11-2020||India||Kerala HC rejects plea seeking trial transfer||The Kerala high court on Friday declined to transfer the trial in the case of alleged abduction and sexual assault of an actress in which Malayalam actor Dileep is among the accused.The actress, who was allegedly assaulted in 2017, and the Kerala government had sought the transfer of the case, alleging “a discriminatory approach” by special judge Honey M Varghese. The prosecution contended that the trial judge remained a “mute spectator” when the victim was “harassed and intimidated” by the lawyers of the accused during cross- examination.Dismissing the pleas, the court said unless the court and the prosecutor work in sync it results in the guilty escaping the clutches of law and innocent being punished.In her plea, the actress alleged she was aggrieved by the biased and hostile attitude of the trial court and that it sat like a mute spectator when she was being examined and harassed by the counsel for Dileep.She complained that the court failed to restrict the number of lawyers for the accused present inside the court hall when she was being examined and failed to uphold the spirit of in-camera trial.The state government, in its October 27 memorandum seeking transfer of the trial, submitted it was aggrieved by the “biased, hostile and partisan” conduct of the trial court.The actress, who has worked in Tamil and Telugu films, was abducted and allegedly molested inside her car for two hours by the accused, who had forced their way into the vehicle on the night of February 17, 2017 and later escaped in a busy area. The accused also filmed the incident to blackmail the actress.There are ten accused in the case and initially, police arrested seven people.Dileep was arrested subsequently and let out on bail later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-rejects-plea-seeking-trial-transfer/story-s1mRIhFBw1b1lrOIc2Ss9H.html

The man is accused of kidnapping his minor cousin, and according to the petition, they were in a “live-in relationship”.The court said that marriage which petitioner man wants to perform with the girl, who is his first cousin, was also per se illegal.“After hearing learned counsel for the parties, I find that... the petitioner has not disclosed about the fact that he is first cousin of .... (of the girl) and, therefore, the submission in the present petition that as and when she attains the age of 18 years, they will perform marriage is also per se illegal,” the bench of justice Arvind Singh Sangwan said. The state counsel, while opposing the bail plea, contented that the girl was a minor and her parents had lodged the FIR as she and the man were first cousins and their fathers were brothers.The man’s counsel told justice Arvind Singh Sangwan that the petitioner had also filed a criminal writ petition, along with the girl, for protection of life and liberty. The court file of the criminal writ petition was summoned during the hearing and as per its memorandum of parties, the girl was stated to be 17 years of age and the petitioner man had filed the petition with the submission that both of them were in a “live-in-relationship”.The judge, after hearing counsel for the parties in the present petition, said, “I find that in the present petition also, the petitioner has not disclosed about the fact that he is first cousin of the girl and, therefore, the submission in the present petition that as and when she attains the age of 18 years, they will perform marriage is also per se illegal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/marriage-between-first-cousins-illegal-punjab-and-haryana-hc/story-mQPsdWDzBtyBUJWkncikKL.html

21-11-2020||India||Narendra Modi reviews India’s vaccination strategy||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday reviewed India’s procurement and delivery strategy of vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “Held a meeting to review India’s vaccination strategy and the way forward. Important issues related to progress of vaccine development, regulatory approvals and procurement were discussed,” Modi tweeted. “Reviewed various issues like prioritisation of population groups, reaching out to HCWs (health care workers), cold-chain Infrastructure augmentation, adding vaccinators and tech platform for vaccine roll-out,” he added. The meeting was attended by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, principal scientific advisor Vijay Raghavan, and Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, among others. According to officials who did not want to be named, the PM was apprised of the progress on the research related to Covid-19 vaccine candidates within the country and also globally. “It was a review meeting of almost all departments that are involved in various stages — be it vaccine research, procurement, delivery and administration,” said a senior government official in the know of things. Five vaccine candidates are at the human clinical trials stage in the country at the moment. The PM was informed about the trial results and what is expected in weeks to come and regulatory approvals, the official added. The progress of talks with other countries and foreign vaccine manufacturers was also discussed. Since India is looking at vaccinating 250-300 million people by July next year, Modi was also informed about the priority list that has so far been drafted to administer vaccine in the initial phase. “The states have been asked to draw up a list of health care and frontline workers who will essentially be given the vaccine in the first phase. The number comes to about 30 million as it is being estimated for now,” said the official quoted above. Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said at the 18th Hindustan Times Leadership Summit on Thursday that he hoped at least 30% to 40% Indians will get the vaccine by the end of next year. Corona warriors and people above 65 years of age, and those between 50 and 65 years and less than 50 years with chronic diseases are expected to be given priority. Another important aspect of cold storage management as well as the human resource factor that would be involved in vaccine delivery was also discussed at Friday’s review meeting. “Vaccinators are being trained; and for cold chain there have to be deep freezers, vans and other facilities to be put in place. Private players are also being roped in,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narendra-modi-reviews-india-s-vaccination-strategy/story-kLTtSRE3feVGYR4DSSr5hJ.html
21-11-2020||India||Govt may rush Covid teams to more states||After sending high-level teams to four states to take stock of the Covid-19 situation, the Centre is considering rushing more expert teams to other states and Union territories (UTs) reporting a rise in new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infections. These teams will assist the local administration in disease management. “The teams will visit the districts reporting high number of COVID cases and support the State efforts towards strengthening containment, surveillance, testing, infection prevention and control measures, and efficient clinical management of the positive cases,” the Union health ministry said in a statement on Friday. On Thursday, the ministry announced it was sending teams to Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Manipur to take stock of the situation. Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, is leading the three-member team to Haryana. Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, is heading the Rajasthan team. Dr SK Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), is leading the Gujarat team, while Dr L Swasticharan, additional deputy director general, directorate general of health services of the health ministry, is heading the team to Manipur. In at least two of the states — Haryana and Manipur — Covid-19 cases per million is higher than the national average. While the national average stood at 6,492 cases per million, the figure in Haryana and Manipur was 7,341 and 7,219, respectively. While Gujarat has 3,000 cases per million, the number in Rajasthan stands at 2,867. “With the surge in the daily new cases and the spike in the daily fatalities in UT of Delhi, the spillover effect is being observed in the NCR regions within the states of Haryana and Rajasthan where the number of COVID positive patients is on the rise,” the statement added. The health ministry also advised states on Friday to adopt aggressive and widespread testing to ensure that undetected positive Covid-19 cases are promptly identified for timely and effective tracing, containment and subsequent treatment. “There is no other way to pick up infections early but to increase testing. The more you test, better are the chances of not missing the infected, especially asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients who otherwise will be moving within society and spread infection,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head, department of virology, Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore (Tamil Nadu). High levels of widespread testing have ensured that the cumulative positivity rate across the country is sustained at low levels. According to government data, the cumulative national Covid-19 positivity rate stands at 6.95% as of Friday. According to experts, higher volumes of testing eventually lead to a low positivity rate. And for disease transmission to be termed under control, the positivity rate ideally should be either 5% or below. At least 20 states and Union territories currently are reporting a cumulative positivity rate lower than the national average of 6.95%. Six states are reporting a positivity rate below 5%. These are Bihar (1.81%), Uttar Pradesh (2.95%), Jharkhand (2.99%), Gujarat (3.09%) where certain districts are reporting higher number of cases, Assam (4.84%), and Punjab (4.93%). “As an ongoing effort to strengthen efforts of various State/UT Governments for COVID management, the Central Government has been deputing Central teams from time to time to visit various States/UTs. These teams interact with the State/UT authorities and get a first hand understanding of the challenges and issues being faced by them so as to strengthen their ongoing activities and remove bottlenecks, if any,” the health ministry said on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-rush-covid-teams-to-more-states/story-K2Vgu3lnuLCE1aHwQiTa7J.html

The timing of the consultative meet of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) with Palaniswami, his deputy O Paneerselvam (OPS), senior ministers, district secretaries and zonal in-charges at the party headquarters holds significance as it comes a day ahead of Union home minister Amit Shah’s visit to Chennai to participate in government programmes and hold internal meetings with the BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit.“Only those who accept EPS as the chief ministerial candidate can remain with us,” a veteran leader reportedly said in the meeting. But Palaniswami pacified the situation and maintained that their relationship is cordial and that the BJP’s state and central leadership had not caused them any trouble or obstructions, the party official said.Last month, after days of internal power tussles, Paneerselvam officially announced Palaniswami as the AIADMK’s chief minister candidate as they made their bid to secure a third consecutive term in Tamil Nadu. Friday’s meeting focussed on enumeration of voters amongst other election related matters, the party leader cited above said. The party planned to introduce a special women’s booth-level committee. “This is a first in the history of the AIADMK,” said steering and manifesto committee member JCD Prabharkar. “Normally there is a general booth committee that includes men, women and young cadre. We are going to introduce an exclusive booth committee of women.” The aim, he said, is to appease women voters who outnumber the male electorate in Tamil Nadu. Apsara R, who identifies as a transgender woman, re-joined the AIADMK on Friday after quitting the Congress.“Both EPS and OPS are confident of the party coming back to power because people are comfortable with us, particularly in our handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The leaders reiterated that we have to stick together,” said the senior party leader.The deliberations come at a time when the relationship of the AIADMK and the BJP is strained over the saffron party’s Vetrivel yatra (victorious spear march). The state government has denied permission citing the Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, and AIADMK’s mouthpiece called it “divisive”. However, BJP members have continued with the yatra across Tamil Nadu since November 6, courting arrests and being let off later. “AIADMK would have wanted to set its house in order so that they don’t speak in two voices when they meet Amit Shah,” said Ramu Manivannan, head, politics and public administrations department, University of Madras.However, party leaders who were part of the meeting said they didn’t speak on the alliance, meeting with Shah or on the impending release of expelled leader VK Sasikala (late chief minister J Jayalalitha’s close aide) early next year. “We instructed district and regional secretaries on how to coordinate and effectively patrol the booths,” said Prabhakar. Earlier in the day, in an interview to a vernacular media, AIADMK spokesperson and minister for fisheries D Jayakumar had said that they would raise the issue of the release of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case in their meeting with Shah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-before-amit-shah-s-visit-aiadmk-holds-meet/story-d9xj9cCftM7fqTe385cRDM.html
21-11-2020||India||Winter arrives early in north as mercury dips||Winter has arrived in many parts of northwest India, both in the hills and the northern plains, with the minimum temperature dipping below 5 degrees Celsius below normal in several cities, according to scientists.On Friday, Gulmarg (Jammu and Kashmir) recorded a minimum temperature of -7° C, 5.5 degrees below normal. In Palampur (Himachal Pradesh), the minimum temperature was 3° C, 6.4 degrees below normal.In the plains, town such as Hisar (Haryana), Churu (Rajasthan) and Adampur (Punjab), too, recorded minimum temperatures that were 4-5 degrees below normal. The Regional Meteorological Centre has warned that Delhi, Haryana and north Rajasthan could experience cold wave conditions for the next two days. A cold wave is declared when minimum temperature is under 10°C and the departure from normal is 4.5° C for more than a day. The onset of winter, which usually takes place around mid-December, seems to be happening earlier due to the influence of back-to-back western disturbances, according to scientists.They also said that La Nina, a global weather pattern which is prevailing this year, is also linked to substantially below normal temperatures in northwest India in winters. According to them, a colder than normal winter is expected this year. “Winter months are January and February but normally cold is felt in December when both maximum and minimum temperatures are under 22° C and 10° C respectively,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.  Moderate La Nina conditions are prevailing over equatorial Pacific and sea surface temperatures are below normal over central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) Pune’s El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) bulletin.“After the western disturbance, which brought widespread snowfall to the entire western Himalayan region last Sunday, snowfall has continued in certain parts of the Himalayas. Again, a western disturbance will affect the region on November 22; it will bring widespread snowfall. So there is a substantial fall in temperature in the hills. In the plains, northwesterly cold winds are blowing and there are clear skies. So heat is radiating back at night, making mornings really cold. We are seeing minimum temperatures fall significantly quite early this year,” Shrivastava said.He added that due to back-to-back western disturbances, the weather department expects snowfall in the hills to continue. This means that minimum temperatures will gradually fall further after the next western disturbance passes, he added.Also Read: Finer, deadlier PM1 shoots up in Delhi due to crop burning, crackersAccording to IMD’s weekly weather report, northwest India recorded 220% excess rain in the week ending November 18 due to the influence of a western disturbance. For the next two weeks, the minimum temperature is likely to be 2°-5° C below normal. A cold wave is likely to prevail in isolated pockets of northwest India between November 20 and 26.El Nino and ENSO are a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/winter-arrives-early-in-north-as-mercury-dips/story-syQaIYTZ5E1a79so2A6CbN.html
21-11-2020||India||ED assures SC of no coercive action against Chanda Kochhar||The Enforcement Directorate on Friday assured the Supreme Court that it would not take any coercive action against former ICICI Bank CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar in a money laundering case.A bench headed by Justice S K Kaul was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the agency would not take any coercive step in pursuance of the enforcement case information report (ECIR) registered in the ICICI Bank-Videocon Group loan case. ECIR is equivalent to a police FIR. “Although there is a sword hanging on your head, there is no hurry as such,” said the bench, also having Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy.In the hearing, the former ICICI Bank CEO was represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi and lawyer Vijay Aggarwal. The top court was hearing three separate pleas filed by Kochhar. One plea sought quashing of the money laundering case against Kochhar on various grounds including that the probe was “violative of the procedures established by law”.“The petitioner is invoking the writ jurisdiction of this court while impugning the investigation proceedings in the ECIR...which have been commenced and continued against her under the PMLA without following the procedure established by law. Whereas Deepak Kochhar, the husband of the petitioner, has already been arrested in these investigations, the petitioner has also been summoned and apprehends the arrest,” the plea said.The bench adjourned the hearing on two separate petitions filed by Chanda Kochhar against the arrest of her husband Depak Kochhar in the money laundering case and challenging her termination from the services as the CEO of ICICI Bank. Rohatgi said Deepak Kochhar’s regular bail plea is coming up for hearing before a trial court on Monday. He urged the bench to make an observation to ensure that hearing on the bail plea of Deepak Kochhar before the special judge does not get affected on account of the pendency of plea in the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-assures-sc-of-no-coercive-action-against-chanda-kochhar/story-EzxmSHca2ey411LmGGq3LP.html
21-11-2020||India||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh calls farmers for talks today amid stir||Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has invited leaders of farm unions for a meeting on Saturday to resolve ongoing standoff over stoppage of passenger trains by the trade unions in the state.The farmers are up in arms against three farm laws passed in Parliament. They say these laws are a deterrent to their interest.Since October 7, the Centre has imposed restrictions on movement of freight trains asking the unions to allow movement of passenger trains if they want the goods trains to run in the state.“We are hopeful of resolving the standoff. I am sure they (farm unions) will show regards towards the CM’s initiative by resolving the matter,” said minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, who is a part of three-member ministers committee to talk to protesting farm unions.The invitation was sent to the leaders of all 31 farm bodies in the state.People aware of the matter said the chief minister was keen to resolve the standoff. He has also sought appointment from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah. State authorities are expecting a confirmation from the Centre by Saturday.Also Read: Famers plan protest in Delhi from Nov 26Due to the restrictions on freight trains, urea stocks for wheat crop has not arrived, coal supplies have dried up leading to shutting down of two thermal plants and food grain stocks are also piling up in the state.Saturday’s meeting with the farm unions will be the second such initiative taken by the CM. Last meeting was held on September 29, in which the CM promised farmers to bring laws to counter the three central laws. The state committee of ministers, however, has met the farm unions a number of times.Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakounda), said: “We have held meetings with office bearers of our union and a near agreement has reached to allow freight trains for the good of Punjab. We are in touch with other farm bodies also who are thinking on similar lines.”The farm unions are expecting that Amarinder Singh will press for opening of toll plazas as a number of them are on state highways and the state government is incurring heavy losses.Jagmohan Singh said all 30 farm bodies will hold a meeting before meeting the CM.In a meeting with the unions on November 13, union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal asked them to vacate the properties of railways and allow movement of passenger trains only after which the freight be permitted to enter Punjab. In their meeting on November 18, the farm bodies asked the Centre to first send freight trains, after which they will let passenger trains run.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarinder-calls-farmers-for-talks-today-amid-stir/story-GkvjzTw8UcTjRTfYPXTX5I.html
21-11-2020||India||Tracking the coronavirus pandemic: First signs of a 2nd wave||Delhi is in the midst of the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of daily new confirmed cases in Delhi has been rising for about a fortnight now. The Union territory reported more than 7,500 new cases on Thursday. As the focus continues to stay at the national capital, data from other states suggests that India may be beginning to see the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayDaily new cases have stopped droppingIndia saw an increasing trend of daily new confirmed Covid-19 cases for about six months after the infection first started spreading in the country. The number of daily new cases peaked just short of the 100,000 mark on September 10 (when 99,181 new cases were reported). This was followed by a decreasing trend in the daily new cases till the end of October before the rate of decrease slowed and the curve of daily new cases flattened. To be sure, the daily new cases significantly decreased earlier this week, mainly due to a decrease in the number of tests conducted over the weekend, which coincided with the festival of Diwali. An average of 45,800 new cases were reported in India on Wednesday and Thursday, which is a little more than the average of daily new cases reported on weekdays last week. Recorded cases typically lag tests by a day. Only 735,551 tests were conducted on Sunday as compared to an average of 1,09,8200 every weekday last week. How this is a sign of the second waveThe trajectory that the graph of the daily new cases in India is following — it first rose to a peak, then decreased and is now stagnant — has been similar to that in other big countries which have seen subsequent waves of the pandemic as well. This has been seen in the US (it is in its third wave of the pandemic now), the United Kingdom (which seems to be near the peak of the second wave), Russia and Italy (both are seeing much stronger second waves). The subsequent waves in the US and Russia came almost immediately after the daily new cases from the previous wave stopped dropping. In the case of Italy and the UK, there was a longer gap between the first and the second wave. Cases are again increasing in some big statesTime will tell how the case trajectory in India moves, but data from several of India’s big states other than Delhi shows that the cases there have started to increase in the last fortnight. These states include Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab. Union territory Chandigarh has also shown a slightly increasing trend in daily new cases. These states and Delhi are home to nearly a quarter of India’s population. Three of these states — Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan — were among those that led the first wave of the pandemic in the country. These are big states, so a sharp increase in cases there is bound to increase the national case tally. To be sure, there are other big states where the trajectory of daily new cases continues to decrease, such as Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.  How bad will the wave be?India is far better prepared to handle a surge in Covid-19 cases than it was when the infection first started spreading. The country also has more resources for testing. The world in general is now better aware of what treatments work and how to handle the symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. India’s monthly case fatality rate — new deaths as a share of new cases — has been decreasing over time: It was 3.24% in April but fell to 1.15% in October. But even as the country may be better prepared and more aware, a steep surge in cases could overburden the country’s health care infrastructure and thereby lead to higher fatality rates. This makes it all the way more important to take precautions such as wearing a face mask and maintaining social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tracking-the-coronavrius-pandemic-first-signs-of-a-2nd-wave/story-GqqlGjcHRBhJFbPrmBbzrI.html
21-11-2020||India||Police constable, sister and mother hacked to death over petty fight in Banda||A police constable, his sister and mother were killed over a petty fight on Friday evening in the Banda district of Uttar Pradesh. The victims were identified as Abhijeet Varma (25), his mother Rameshwari (52) and sister Nisha (19). Abhijeet was posted in Naini Prayagraj and had come home in the afternoon.Inspector General (IG) Chitrakoot Dham K Satyanarayana said two of the accused have been arrested adding that raids were on to nab the third one. The two accused, Devraj and Shiv Pujan are Abhijeet’s cousins. According to the police, Devraj said that his daughter threw food in a ditch close to Abhijeet’s house. An argument broke out as Abhijeet objected to the throwing of food which further enraged Devraj and others who attacked him. Abhijeet’s mother and sister were also killed while trying to save him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-constable-sister-and-mother-hacked-to-death-over-petty-fight-in-banda/story-42hXmU6yMxv574zV2E1D1L.html
21-11-2020||India||Congress’ new internal panels include old guard||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday constituted three committees to consider and discuss issues and policies related to economy, foreign affairs and national security, accommodating some Congress members who have in recent months raised issues about the functioning of the party. All committees will be headed by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Apart from Singh, the committee on economic affairs will have former Union ministers P Chidambaram, Mallikarjun Kharge and Jairam Ramesh, who will also be its convener, besides former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijaya Singh. Chidambaram was one of those who expressed concern over the party’s performance in the Bihar elections. In the committee on foreign affairs, Singh will be assisted by former Union ministers Anand Sharma, Shashi Tharoor and Salman Khurshid besides Saptagiri Sanka Ulaka, a Lok Sabha member from Koraput in Odisha. Khurshid has been named its convener.Tharoor and Sharma were among the 23 signatories of a letter to party president Sonia Gandhi in August this year, seeking internal elections and organisational overhaul. The former PM will also head the committee on national security. Its members are Ghulam Nabi Azad (another signatory of the August letter), former Union minister M Veerappa Moily (also a signatory), Vincent H Pala, a Lok Sabha member from Shillong in Meghalaya, and V Vaithilingam, a former chief minister of Puducherry. Pala is its convener.The committees should help the party come up with consistent messaging on important issues. For instance, the Congress position on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership has come across as confused. While Ramesh said India has done the right thing by not joining the grouping, Sharma, a former trade minister termed not joining the grouping “a strategic blunder”. The appointments come against the backdrop of rumblings within the Congress over the outcome of the assembly elections in Bihar, and by-polls to 58 seats across 11 states.Out of these, the Congress won just 12,while the BJP won 40, comfortably retaining power in Madhya Pradesh and getting a majority on its own in Manipur. The Congress held 44 of these 58 seats earlier and failed to win any seat in the by-elections to Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Manipur, Nagaland, Odisha and Telangana. In Bihar, the Congress won just 19 of the 70 seats it contested and, according to some analysts, impacted the chances of the opposition alliance to oust the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.In the wake of the outcome, a war of words erupted in the Congress. Senior leader and former Union minister Kapil Sibal, one of the 23 signatories, questioned the leadership on the poll debacle and asked if it was “business as usual”.Sibal was countered by Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, former Union ministers Salman Khurshid and Mallikarjun Kharge, and the party’s leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Youth Congress president Srinivas BV, Delhi unit chief Anil Chaudhary and other leaders.In an interview to Dainik Bhaskar earlier this week, Chidambaram said the party’s performance in the assembly elections in Bihar and by-polls show that there is either “no organisational presence on the ground, or it has weakened considerably”. He said the Congress fought more seats in Bihar than its organisational strength, and called for a “comprehensive review”. Chidambaram added that he was “more worried” about the by-election results.Chidambaram, a former finance minister, on Monday tweeted, “RCEP born, it is the world’s largest trading body. 15 nations in our region are members of RCEP, India is not among them. There are pros and cons to India joining RCEP, but the debate has never taken place in Parliament... It is another bad example of centralised decision-making unacceptable in a democracy.”The Congress president had last year stated that signing RCEP will deal a “body blow” to the economy. After India walked out of the mega free trade agreement last year, the Congress claimed victory, saying its forceful opposition had ensured that the BJP-led government backed out from the deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-new-internal-panels-include-old-guard/story-oCvt6puzKhuvRMAzSUALyK.html
21-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Friday was an important day in the world’s fight against Covid-19. The day saw an informal meeting of the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council to discuss a proposal made by India and South Africa in October, and which has since been supported by around 100 other countries. The proposal, also supported by many leading non-governmental organisations working in the area of public health, calls for a waiver of intellectual property rights on several products related to protection from and treatment of Covid-19 – from masks to vaccines – till the worst of the pandemic passes. But the move isn’t supported by many first-world nations including the US, the UK, Japan, and many countries from the European Union. The discussion comes amidst a scramble by countries to secure vaccines for their population – through pre-approval deals with companies developing vaccines. Announcements by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna on the efficacy of their vaccines – both came in the past fortnight – have only served to intensify the scramble. Nature reported back in August that rich nations have signed deals to buy at least two billion doses of vaccines. According to that article, based on data from health care analytics firm Airfinity, the UK has struck deals to cover its populations five times over. And that was three months ago.Also Read: One in five US hospitals face staffing crises within a weekOver the past month, countries have finalised their positions on the India-South Africa proposal – reiterated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a meeting of the Brics grouping earlier this week – based on internal discussions. But Friday’s meeting, details of which were awaited when this column was being written, is unlikely to be the last word on it, although it is important from the perspective of understanding the support for the proposal. The lines are clearly drawn. The Wall Street Journal, in an editorial titled “A Global Covid Vaccine Heist” accused India and South Africa of wanting to “obtain this [vaccine] technology without paying for it and then use their generic-drug manufacturing base to produce, distribute and sell copycats worldwide”. “This is theft, not sharing,” it wrote. Yet, keeping these vaccines out of reach from the global south – most vaccine capacity for next year has been booked by the global north – will only deepen existing divides. Still worse, vaccinating only part of the world is unlikely to solve the problem, unless countries with access to the vaccine create bubbles around themselves, placing significant restrictions on movement of goods and people across their borders.Interestingly, this isn’t the first time such a request is being moved at WTO. In 2001, following long-drawn and sometimes bitter discussions surrounding treatment for HIV/AIDS, WTO’s Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health established that countries had the right to disregard patents and other intellectual property rights in case of national health emergencies. Some believe that the resulting wave of generics helped many countries get HIV/AIDS under control. In 2003, an amendment was made to allow inexpensive generics to be exported to countries that did not have capacity to manufacture the medicines. The main flexibility allowed by the 2001 declaration was compulsory licensing, which entails the patent-holders being compensated adequately.Also Read: PM Modi holds review meet to decide India’s vaccination strategyBut what of companies that have spent billions on research? Will they be happy with such compensation? And will it be fair to them?There are no easy answers. But the debate, and the divide it is threatening to exacerbate, point to why it would have been better for everyone – rich, developing and poor countries, and vaccine developers – if WHO’s Covax facility had managed to sign on more rich countries, and also struck deals with vaccine developers. In the absence of a mechanism such as this, it was always going to get messy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-a9Q9cyRfkkjElMa2SwR75J.html
21-11-2020||India||AG Venugopal grants consent to initiate contempt proceedings against Kunal Kamra||Attorney General KK Venugopal on Friday granted consent to initiate contempt proceedings against comedian Kunal Kamra for his November 18 tweet, saying it was “grossly vulgar and obnoxious” and tended to lower the Supreme Court’s authority.Venugopal’s response came after a contempt request was filed by Allahabad-based lawyer Anuj Singh on Thursday.Granting his approval, the AG said, “…is to deliberately insult the CJI which would equally be an insult to the Supreme Court of India itself, which the CJI heads.”“The said tweet is grossly vulgar and obnoxious. I have no doubt that it (tweet) would tend to lower the authority of the Supreme Court of India as well as undermine the confidence that the litigant public have in the institution of the Supreme Court itself….I accordingly grant consent,” the AG said.The AG’s fresh consent for contempt has come close on the heels of another contempt petition being filed against Kamra for a series of tweets where he criticised the Supreme Court’s favourable ruling on Arnab Goswami’s bail request.In his letter dated November 12, AG Venugopal had said the tweets were a “gross insinuation” against the Supreme Court. “...the freedom of speech is subject to the law of contempt and I believe that it is time that people understand that attacking the Supreme Court of India unjustifiably and brazenly will attract punishment under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1972,” the AG said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ag-venugopal-grants-consent-to-initiate-contempt-proceedings-against-kunal-kamra/story-B9GgouBOnCiZEE1O9DZQYL.html
21-11-2020||India||Odisha IPS officer transferred over custodial death in Puri||The Odisha government on Friday transferred the Superintendent of Police of Puri district amid allegations of the custodial death of a 33-year-old man who was picked up from his home on Wednesday night but died a few hours later after reportedly getting injured in a scuffle with the police.The home department transferred Puri SP Akhileswar Singh and attached him to police headquarters in Cuttack. Sambalpur SP Kanwar Vishal Singh has been transferred to Puri in his place. The DGP also suspended a sub-inspector and two constables of the police station in Puri town where the 33-year-old man was taken after being arrested.The transfer came on the day the Orissa High Court sought a detailed report from the state government over the alleged custodial death while the National Human Rights Commission issued a notice to the state expressing its displeasure that such custodial deaths are still occurring despite the Supreme Court’s guidelines on custodial treatment of accused.On Thursday, 33-year-old Telugu youth K Ramesh, a resident of Lokanath Road area of Puri town was picked up by police over some old cases. While being arrested he allegedly had a scuffle with the police following which he was hospitalised where he died. His family members alleged that his body was cremated without being handed over to them.Following the death, Puri-based lawyer Sarat Kumar Rayguru on Friday filed a PIL with the Orissa High Court seeking a court-monitored probe into the matter demanding stringent action against the errant police officials and compensation for the deceased’s family.In New Delhi, NHRC directed the Odisha Chief Secretary and DGP to submit detailed reports on the matter within four weeks while expressing its displeasure over the fact that custodial deaths are still occurring despite the Supreme Court’s guidelines on custodial treatment of accused. “This is not acceptable in a country governed by the rule of law,” the Commission pointed out while taking a veiled dig at the state government over its failures to adhere to the SC guidelines,” said the NHRC responding to a petition by BJP’s national spokesperson Sambit Patra on the issue. BJP had threatened agitation if the Puri SP was not transferred immediately.“The way Ramesh was tortured by police personnel in custody is not justified. We have demanded punitive action against the officials involved in the brutal murder. I complained about the inhuman way the deceased’s parents have been picked up by the local police and are being held at some undisclosed location. The NHRC assured us help,” said Patra.The NHRC directed the state government to submit the copies of the FIR, arrest and inspection memos of the person who allegedly died in police custody. The Commission has also asked the government to notify whether the family members of the victim were informed about his arrest. In another case of alleged custodial death, human rights activist Prabir Das filed two separate petitions seeking Odisha Human Rights Commission probe in the alleged custodial deaths in Puri and Sundargarh. He also urged the OHRC to direct the state government to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation to family of each deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-ips-officer-transferred-over-custodial-death-in-puri/story-nmJwCIjYuSpEqZhQuzPOhM.html

Their relationship which apparently started at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy for Administration in Mussoorie and subsequent wedding grabbed the attention of the nation for more than one reason. While Tina ranked first, Athar ranked second. Many people hailed their wedding as a symbol of communal harmony. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had congratulated the IAS couple and had tweeted, “May your love grow from strength to strength and may you be an inspiration to all Indians in this age of growing intolerance and communal hatred. God bless you.”Venkaiah Naidu, Sumitra Mahajan, Ravi Shankar Prasad had attended their wedding reception in Delhi. There were three wedding receptions — the first in Jaipur which was simple court ceremony, the second in Pahalgam and the third in Delhi. Both Dabi and Athar were allocated to the Rajasthan cadre of the IAS. Individually too, both of them represent heights of achievement as Tina Dabi was the first ever Dalit woman to top the UPSC examinations. Athar, who is a year older than Tina, is from restive South Kashmir. Tina Dabi hails from Bhopal and both his parents are in the Indian Engineering Services. She studied Political Science at Lady Shri Ram College. Athar is a BTech from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Mandi, Himachal Pradesh.Initially, both of them were in the same city, but Tina Dabi was later posted to Sri Ganganagar as Chief Executive Officer, Zila Parishad. Athar was posted to Jaipur as the CEO of Zila Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ias-toppers-tina-dabi-athar-khan-file-for-divorce-in-jaipur/story-e76Tci9UM8cFcWFqmMchNK.html
