25-11-2020||News||How India can benefit from SCO||The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a unique plurilateral grouping that holds two summits a year, one at the Heads of State and the other at the Heads of Government level. India will host the Heads of Government summit on November 30, following Moscow’s hosting of the former summit on November 10 — both conducted virtually. This will be India’s first time as host of a major SCO conference, having joined it as a full member in 2017. SCO holds special fascination for India as the host nation. The grouping comprises India’s strategic partner and friend, Russia, two adversarial neighbours — China and Pakistan — and four important Central Asian Republics (CARs) — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. A rare blend of history, geopolitics, cultural, civilisational and economic imperatives connect India to Central Asia. New Delhi has a clear three-pronged policy approach — deepen ties with Russia; monitor and counter the influence of China and Pakistan; and expand cooperation with CARs. The Heads of State summit released a 19-page-long Moscow Declaration. It covers political and security issues; trade and economic cooperation; cultural, humanitarian and public exchanges; and international contacts. What, then, is left for the Council of Heads of Government to do at its November 30 meeting? This is the second-highest organ of SCO, with a dual mandate to decide on budgetary matters and devise details of economic cooperation. The lack of adequate connectivity with the CARs has been a major constraint for India, especially due to Chinese dominance through the Belt and Road Initiative and a thick cheque book. So it is necessary to conceive creative measures that enable India Inc to expand its footprint in the region’s markets.Accordingly, India’s economic diplomacy in SCO is focused less on Russia, China and Pakistan and more on CARs. India’s trade with them rose from $1.4 billion in 2017-18 to $2.7 billion in 2019-20. So did investment by India’s private and public sector companies — in gold mining, uranium, power and agro-processing. But a better performance is desirable through new steps.First, the country’s start-up companies should be encouraged to lead the charge for creating new linkages. According to Niti Aayog, India is now “the third-largest tech start-up globally”, with 38,756 officially recognised start-ups. At SCO, India has proposed setting up a special working group on innovation and start-ups. Second, traditional medicine is of considerable interest to the region. As a leader in the field, India is ready to collaborate with interested parties. A working group on this theme has also been proposed so that, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi put it, “the knowledge of traditional and ancient medicine is spread across SCO countries and the headway in contemporary medicine” can complement it. The third measure is to encourage cooperation in the micro, small and medium enterprises sector in agriculture, energy, education, pharmaceuticals and information communication technology. Fourth, given the salience of Buddhist connections, priority should be accorded to tourism. The SCO Heads of State have already expressed their admiration for India’s joint digital exhibition on Shared Buddhist Heritage, which runs from this month till next February in New Delhi. Fifth, a granular dialogue on a trade and investment promotion programme is essential through sectoral working groups of the SCO Business Council. Hosting of the SCO Business Conclave by FICCI on November 23 was a welcome strep. A final suggestion — the SCO Secretariat should overcome its exclusive reliance on Russian and Chinese languages. Having admitted India and Pakistan as members, the grouping should include English as a working language. This will ensure smooth communication and ready availability of documentation. India Inc aims to focus on practical and targeted steps. Its goal is to connect the past of Central Asia and India to their present and future. The sweep of medieval history will then join the 21st century to bring prosperity to both regions.Rajiv Bhatia is a retired ambassador and a distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-india-can-benefit-from-sco/story-lvHNVzB99Asw6EPcgfE6NK.html

Cities need to be redesigned to address the concerns of women; so that women can work, look after their families easily, and without having to expend more energy, time and money than men do. The 2019 Safe City Index, prepared by the Economist Intelligence Unit, ranks Mumbai and Delhi as one of the worst cities where women’s safety is concerned. The Index ranked cities on indicators of personal security, digital security and infrastructure security, among other things. All these have a multiplier effect on the position of women — these can negatively affect their access to public spaces, jobs and even how much leisure time they can spend. Indifference to concerns of women results in a difficult commute and poor childcare facilities.To make cities women-friendly, urban planners must focus on two core issues —greater safety from violence and adequate childcare support. Much of the current discourse focusses on improving street lighting and providing safe toilets. These are important but even more critical to making public spaces safer is mixed land-use planning. The segregation of commercial and residential areas automatically increases the commute from work to home and creates entry barriers to mobility for women. Mixed land-use, by encouraging office space and commercial areas in residential localities, makes for regular use of streets, better lighting and encourages women to use public spaces.We already have an example in the planned city of Chandigarh, one of the safest for women in India. This city factored in local markets, commercial offices, schools, public parks, post offices, police posts and medical clinics into the design of each small locality or sector. Shaded footpaths were created for walking such that it was possible to cover the city on foot and remain in the shade. And, yet, extensive mixed-use was simply not replicated in other Indian cities. Chandigarh remained an isolated example.A 2019 Ola Mobility Institute study, which surveyed men and women in 11 cities in India, said that while 80% respondents lived within a 15-minute walking distance of a bus stop, only 47% either walked or cycled to the bus stop. The others used shared transport, two-wheelers and cars. Shared transport has been found to be generally unsafe. But in the absence of dedicated footpaths or cycle tracks, women commuters have little option.In reimagining urban spaces, we must not focus on somewhat vacuous efforts such as creating special transport services for women. It would, instead, be far more beneficial to sensitise men to be more civil. Already, various surveys have shown that the majority of men in India do not approve of boorish behaviour towards women. The 2015-16 National Family Health Survey indicated that 58% husbands disapproved of wife-beating. In a UN Women-sponsored household survey on sexual violence in public spaces in Delhi in 2012, 94% men said that people should intervene if they see sexual harassment in public spaces. This needs to be built upon and civility inculcated.The other priority must be reliable childcare facilities, which are necessary if we expect women to enter the job market, sustain jobs and also pursue leisure activities. Ensuring that enough creches are available throughout the city is important to set women free and support them in discharging their parental duties. For construction sites, mobile creches could be the answer.Recent research by economist Ashwini Deshpande shows that in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, those with children below five years suffered the most in the job market. In April 2019, the average employment of women in this category was 7.8%. This dropped sharply to 2.9% in April 2020. In August 2020, it recovered slightly to 3.5%. What is noteworthy is that it was the most highly-educated women who suffered the maximum job losses. For those with qualifications higher than post-graduate and children below five years of age, the average employment shrank drastically in April 2020, as per the report. With work-from-home becoming the norm, it is the aspirational group of women who lost out the most. An institutional support structure that can take care of this responsibility would improve female participation in the labour force. It is entirely possible to address such gaps through pilot projects in smaller townships. If well executed, such projects will draw the population away from the mega-cities. The safety of women is a major concern in any household location decision. Undertaking such projects does not require much by way of capital. Various projects for upgrading city infrastructure are already in execution throughout India. Those can easily be tweaked to incorporate gender perspectives. To make cities women-empowering, we need more imagination and will.Meeta Rajivlochan is an IAS officer and currently member-secretary, National Commission for Women The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/redesigning-urban-spaces-for-women/story-xkw0YpAZDPlEQoICgJgiAM.html

The metropolitan authority has appointed J Kumar Infraprojects Ltd for the ₹1,276-crore project, with a letter of authority issued to the company last month.SWEC is a 4.5-km elevated corridor connecting the under-construction MTHL at Sewri on the east and the upcoming coastal road at Worli on the west.According to a statement issued by MMRDA, the project alignment starts from Sewri (East), crossing the eastern freeway and harbour railway line, passing over RA Kidwai Road and Acharya Donde Marg, crossing above the existing flyover at Ambedkar Road, Elphinstone bridge in Parel and flyover at Senapati Bapat Road and then making its way through Kamgar Nagar and Dr Annie Besant Road before it connects at Narayan Hardikar Marg at Worli. “The project includes two rail overbridges (RoB) at Sewri and another two-tier bridge at Prabhadevi. The latter crosses the Central Railway and the Western Railway lines,” said a senior official from MMRDA. The project is expected to be completed in three years. The 22-km MTHL, connecting Mumbai and Navi Mumbai, was expected to be completed by September 2022, however, it is facing a six-month delay owing to the pandemic, officials said.In July, the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) had given a clearance to the project. The coastal zone authority had asked MMRDA to conduct a public hearing for the project, stating that it will cause an impact for those staying at Worli Seaface. Around 438m of land on both ends of the corridor also falls under CRZ-II (coastal regulatory zone which is developed up to the shoreline and falls within the municipal limits).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-5-km-sewri-worli-elevated-corridor-project-for-mumbai-trans-harbour-link-awarded-to-contractor/story-H0ZjUolx0m6IFjamEim0JM.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body panel mulls taking back Bandra plot from film corporation||The improvement committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is considering taking back a prime plot in Bandra that was leased to National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) as part of an initiative to promote the arts and cinema in particular. BMC had handed over the plot to NFDC in 2015. On Wednesday, the civic body tabled a proposal to take the plot back, citing failure on part of NFDC to set up the proposed film cultural centre and a children’s theatre at the site.In 2014, BMC’s improvement committee and general body cleared a proposal to hand over a prime plot in Bandra to NFDC for 30 years, with Rs 1 as annual rent. The plot, which already has a theatre, is on Sherly Rajan Road, and measures about 712 square meters. NFDC and BMC signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that NFDC would develop the plot as part of a project to promote arts and culture. On Wednesday, a proposal to cancel the MoU with NFDC and take back the theatre was tabled before the improvement committee. The committee will visit the theatre before taking a decision. A senior civic official said, “Several show-cause notices were served to them [NFDC] as they failed to set up the centre and there were several delays. We are now proceeding to cancel the lease.”BMC listed six breaches of lease conditions, including failure on NFDC’s part to start the proposed film and cultural centre, and renovating the existing children’s theatre. Other breaches include loss of revenue due to non-functional centre and not including a representative of BMC in the advisory committee formed by NFDC for the film and cultural centre.An official from NFDC, requesting anonymity, said, “There were many hurdles including delays in registration and financial troubles that led to the overall delay of this project. We have explained this to the civic body and are expecting an extension.”Corporators have demanded the civic administration submit a list of other plots handed over for promotion of art and culture where no progress has taken place. Congress corporator Ashraf Azmi said, “There could be many such plots which have not been developed by the caretakers to whom they were handed over. I am writing to the municipal commissioner to submit details of all such plots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-panel-mulls-taking-back-bandra-plot-from-film-corporation/story-Je195fQOCJ0vAfSMDYKezN.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||MH-CET 2020: Engineering aspirants in Maharashtra to be awarded full marks for 29 questions with errors||After months of delay, engineering aspirants awaiting the results of their entrance exam have reason to cheer. In a circular released on its website, the state common entrance test (CET) cell has revealed that many objections raised by students against errors in questions in the CET exams held in September and October have been accepted. This means that all students who appeared for the exam will be awarded full marks for at least 29 questions.“Students had raised objections on a large number of questions. Many were certain the CET cell will accept the challenges this year because they had proof that the questions themselves were wrong or that in some cases, the correct answer was not incorporated in the options mentioned,” said Abhay Joshi, an engineering aspirant. The circular, shared by the CET cell, has stated that objections were accepted for 65 questions. Maximum questions that are being awarded full marks are either due to an error in the question itself or the errors in the options provided per question. It further explains each unique question ID across the four sections (physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics) for which objection was raised by students and accepted by an expert committee put together by the CET cell.This year, a nationwide lockdown due to increasing Covid-19 cases pushed entrance exams for all undergraduate professional courses by a few months, and the state CET cell conducted the CET exams for engineering aspirants in September. However, after receiving complaints, several students who missed the exams in September due to Covid-19 were allowed to appear for the exam in October. The CET cell displayed their answer key on their website on November 10 and started accepting objections and grievances regarding the exam between November 10 and 12.“As per the report submitted by experts in this matter, changes suggested by the experts will be incorporated in the database, and accordingly the results will be processed,” stated the circular released on Wednesday. Results for the MH-CET exam will be declared on November 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mh-cet-2020-engineering-aspirants-in-maharashtra-to-be-awarded-full-marks-for-29-questions-with-errors/story-3uSXsI5IP4aPdeV5WIS1kN.html

25-11-2020||City||Restaurant, marriage palace owners seek relief in night curfew curbs||Imposition of night curfew in the state from December 1 has come as a shocker to the hospitality sector. City’s hotel and restaurant owners rued that while their businesses were already affected due to the ongoing pandemic, the imposition of night curfew will further take its toll. As per the directions issued by the Punjab government on Wednesday, night curfew will be clamped from 10pm till 5am and all hotels, shops and marriage places will have to down shutters by 9:30pm.Restaurant owners said that most of the footfall is witnessed after 8pm and the new restrictions will hit their existing business by 50%. Also, the labour force will again move out in absence of work, they added. The vice-president of Hotels and Restaurant Association, Amarjit Singh, said, “We were already getting 35-40% response due to the ongoing pandemic and the imposition of night curfew will further bring down the footfall. The restaurant business will again shrink. The government should review its decision.”The restaurant owners have demanded that the government should at least allow home delivery of food during night, otherwise “it will be difficult for them to survive amid pandemic”.Owner of Basant restaurants, Bhupinder Basant, said, “The dine-in business will almost come to an end with the imposition of night curfew. The government should allow home delivery of meals to prevent the sector from collapsing. Already, many of the labourers have not come back after the lockdown and more will leave in the absence of work.”Traders stated that the announcement has also put the shopkeepers in a tight spot. Even though the night curfew is not expected to affect traders as most of the shops are shut by that time in the city, it has instilled fear among them about their future prospects. General secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, Sunil Mehra, said, “The government should have discussed the matter with traders before announcing the night curfew. No relief has been provided by the government and this move will further reduce footfall in the market as the public will now fear stepping out of the houses even during the daytime.”Wedding plans in troubled watersPanic has gripped the owners of marriage palaces and their customers, who have booked night events between December 1 and 15. Owners said that patrons have already started calling to cancel or reschedule the ceremonies.Marriage palace and banquet hall owners have sought from the government a ban on the entry of new guests after 9.30pm, while urging it to allow the guests who have already arrived to attend the functions post-deadline. President of Hotels and Restaurant Association Amarvir Singh said, “We will not allow new guests after 9.30pm. The government should pay heed to our problems, otherwise we will suffer huge losses as bookings have already been made.”Marriage Palaces Welfare Association chief Amarjit Singh Sant said they were now in a tight corner. “Even the customers are in panic and continuously calling up to cancel or reschedule the events,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/restaurant-marriage-palace-owners-seek-relief-in-night-curfew-curbs/story-vTkgvNTzOhpdsDgAKchCGP.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||You will soon fear probes, don’t forget Shiv Sena is in power in Maharashtra, Raut threatens BJP||A day after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) carried out searches at the properties of Shiv Sena legislator Pratap Sarnaik, Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that they are not afraid of such probes. He went on to warn ally-turned-foe, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that they will soon fear similar probes.Raut’s statement came in response to leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis’ comment that nobody should be afraid of the investigation if there is no wrongdoing. Raut said that the BJP should not forget the Shiv Sena is in power in Maharashtra and Uddhav Thackeray is the chief minister.“Nobody fears an investigation; there is no reason to. I will say that now you all will have to fear investigations. Don’t forget that we are in power in Maharashtra and that Uddhav Thackeray is the chief minister. Soon, everybody will know who fears probes,” he told reporters in Mumbai on Wednesday. “You are shuffling cards now, but we will beat you at your game,” Raut added, without naming the BJP.He added that he will not be surprised if he or other “pillars” of the Maharashtra government receive a notice from the ED soon. “I have not received any notice from ED. I am awaiting it. I will not be surprised if I or Ajit Pawar gets one. I have come to know that they are digging old graves. We are prepared for it.”The Shiv Sena chief spokesperson added that he will soon send a list of 120 leaders from the BJP to ED. “Assets of some leaders have gone from ₹1 crore to ₹5,000 crore in a year, but the ED will not touch them… Let this political vendetta in the name of an investigation get over. I will send names of 120 leaders from the ruling party to ED and finance ministry. Then I will see who ED summons,” he said.Responding to Raut’s statements, BJP Maharashtra chief Chandrakant Patil said, “It is extremely good; I suggest he should send it [names] at the earliest… who has tied your hands or legs or shut your mouths [to start any probe].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/you-will-soon-fear-probes-don-t-forget-we-are-in-power-in-maharashtra-raut-threatens-bjp/story-1vNWbh9YmhSAdhUuyyheDJ.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government issues GR to restart admissions for professional UG courses||The state government issued a government resolution (GR) on Tuesday, restarting the admissions process for most professional undergraduate (UG) courses. As per the GR, admissions to undergraduate engineering, medical, law and architecture courses may be completed without reserving 12% for socially and economically backward classes (SEBC). The GR will remain in effect until the Supreme Court’s (SC) final order on the SEBC quota.On September 9, SC stayed all admissions to educational institutes in Maharashtra under the SEBC quota for the 2020-21 academic year. The only exception was postgraduate medical admissions. On September 21, the Maharashtra government filed a petition in SC to vacate the stay on admissions. The state government released a GR on November 24, directing all admissions to be conducted without the SEBC quota for the time being. Admissions completed before the SC’s order of September 9 will not be affected by the GR.Earlier this month, admissions to UG medical and dental courses started without the SEBC quota. “Too much time had already been wasted waiting this year, first due to the lockdown and now for clarity on the SEBC quota so the state medical department allowed for MBBS and BDS admissions to commence without the quota,” said a senior official from the state department of higher and technical education.Commissioner of Maharashtra’s common entrance test (CET) cell CD Joshi said admission schedules may be released by next week. “We are studying the new GR and have also sought clarity on some issues from the government, especially when it comes to admissions to professional courses,” said Joshi. With no clear admission schedule in sight, many candidates have opted for admissions outside Maharashtra. Mumbai resident Meena S, 19, is awaiting her CET results for architecture, but on Monday, began online classes at a college in New Delhi. “I was hopeful of securing admissions in JJ School of Architecture or Rachna Sansad College of Architecture, both of which are close to home. However, I have already secured a seat in New Delhi and have begun classes,” said Meena, whose preference remains the colleges in Mumbai.Engineering students are facing a similar dilemma, particularly those seeking direct admission to second-year engineering after completing diplomas. CET exams for admission to technical courses were held in October and results are expected on November 28. “The third semester for second-year students is at its end now. Even if I get admission, how will I cope with the semester? I am hoping colleges make special arrangements for lateral entry students,” said a diploma holder. The uncertainty has meant the University of Mumbai (MU) was unable to prepare an academic calendar for professional courses. “We always follow MU’s academic calendar and accordingly plan syllabus, practicals, term test etc. We haven’t been able to do so this year, so there is no plan in place at all,” said Vaibhav Narwade, senate member of MU and a professor at an engineering college in Navi Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-issues-gr-to-restart-admissions-for-professional-ug-courses/story-tHfwpaT4NX27aGzNI7xrTM.html

He has also been charged for hatching a conspiracy to orchestrate the riots and funding the communal carnage.A trial court, on October 22, had denied bail to Hussain in the case related to the looting of a shop in Dayalpur which had caused a loss of about ₹20 lakh to the shop owner.Hussain, in his present plea, has sought bail on the grounds that there were only general allegations in the FIR and no specific allegation was made against him. He also contended that there were 10 accused in the case and nine have already been granted bail and only he was still in jail.Hussain further said he was not even named in the FIR and claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case. Hussain’s legal counsels have in the past denied all the allegations and said he was a victim of political rivalry.The FIR was lodged on March 4 on the complaint given by one Zeeshan, who owns a furniture shop at the main Sherpur Chowk in Dayalpur. Zeeshan stated that on February 25, he had received a call that the shutter of his shop had been broken and articles looted by rioters as a result of which he had incurred a loss of ₹20 lakh.Communal violence had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 400 injured. While Delhi Police has claimed that violence had erupted from a standoff between protesters and supporters of the amended citizenship law, several civil society members and student activists have criticised the Delhi Police for its lopsided investigation into the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-hc-seeks-police-response-on-tahir-hussain-s-fresh-bail-plea/story-HhC0Na298MFU8JDCA40odP.html
25-11-2020||City||2 trains carrying urea reach Ludhiana||Two trains carrying urea reached the district on Wednesday, bringing much-needed respite to the farmers.Shortage of urea was severely affecting the wheat and potato crops. According to Ludhiana chief agriculture officer Narinder Singh Benipal, two trains carrying around 2,650 tonnes of urea each have reached Khanna and Ludhiana railway stations on Wednesday and more such trains are expected in next couple of days.Due to train blockade in Punjab, there was an acute shortage of urea in Ludhiana. As of October 31, just about 7% stocks of urea and around 71% stocks of DAP fertiliser were left in the district.Benipal informed that although some stock of urea and DAP was coming in trucks, the quantity was still not enough to meet the demand of farmers as each truck can carry a maximum of around 500 bags of urea (about 20 tonnes). “Whereas today, 1,18,000 bags of urea have arrived in two trains alone,” he added. In Ludhiana district, wheat is sown on nearly 2.5 lakh hectares and potato on around 13,500 hectares, along with some other crops. For that, 1.1 lakh tonnes of urea is required and till Tuesday, the pending demand was of 65,000 tonnes. Now, with the arrival of about 5,300 tonnes of urea, the cooperative societies of the district would get the supplies.The sowing of wheat had started in the first week of November and shortage of both urea and DAP was affecting the operations, adding to the farmers’ woes.As per officials of the agriculture department, there is a demand of 47,432 tonnes of urea in the cooperative societies of the district — 6,772 tonnes in Payal, 7,043 tonnes in Ludhiana (West), 5,989 tonnes in Ludhiana (East), 7,452 tonnes in Raikot, 2,763 tonnes in Khanna, 5,603 tonnes in Samrala and 11,857 tonnes in Jagraon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-trains-carrying-urea-reach-ludhiana/story-X3kUXPsIXTSPkoSEjwFWKN.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||Rai asks BJP to stop blame game and help in curbing pollution||New Delhi: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday slammed the BJP for undermining the efforts of the Delhi government to control pollution in the Capital. Rai said that instead of finding faults with the Delhi government for distributing the Pusa bio-decomposer free of cost to farmers to find a solution to the problem of stubble burning in Delhi, the BJP should contribute towards curbing pollution in the city. Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, a day after the Delhi BJP accused the Delhi government of not providing the bio-decomposer developed by the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) to farmers in Delhi, Rai said that his government was taking measures to fight pollution but the BJP leaders, on the other hand, were misleading people. “No BJP leader is seen participating in any campaign, they are just seen playing blame game and doing politics. The bio-decomposer solution was sprayed on 2,000 acres of land across Delhi after the farmers filled the forms. The government has the record of the forms filled for spraying the solution on the fields, as evidence against the charges of the BJP leaders,” Rai said. He added that based on the effectiveness of the bio-decomposer, the Delhi government had filed a petition in front of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Tuesday. “Under the leadership of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the people of Delhi have waged a war against pollution. We introduced ‘red light on gaadi off’ campaign to curb vehicle pollution, anti-dust campaign to combat dust pollution, we have deployed teams and are taking action on biomass burning across Delhi. We have introduced the bio decomposer technique in association with IARI, Pusa, to combat pollution due to stubble burning in Delhi,” said Rai. Hitting back at Rai, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “By spending crores of rupees, CM Kejriwal is campaigning on TV to make fertilizers from the paddy stubble, but the farmers said that neither any fertilizer is being made in any area nor has any farmer been contacted in this regard by the Kejriwal government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rai-asks-bjp-to-stop-blame-game-and-help-in-curbing-pollution/story-vtzvClqF7rib5TfewIt9JJ.html
25-11-2020||City||EDMC demands tax dues from Delhi govt||New Delhi: The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Tuesday asked the Delhi government to release Rs 216 crore as part of the civic body’s basic tax assignment (BTA) share. The municipality, which passed a proposal to this effect in its House meeting on Tuesday, alleged that the government had deducted Rs 216 crore from its BTA share in the name of interest for an old loan. The civic body representatives said the municipality was already going through an acute financial crisis and deduction of money from its BTA share will only make things worse for the corporation in the time of the coronavirus pandemic.The Delhi government did not respond to requests for a comment.A senior official of the EDMC explained that BTA is part of a tax share which the Delhi government collects as electricity tax, advertisement on DTC buses among others on behalf of the municipality. “As per our BTA share, the Delhi government has to give us Rs 720.75 crore in three quarters, i.e. April-June, July-September and October-December But we got only Rs 144 crore from the government,” the official said.East Delhi mayor Nirmal Jain said the Delhi government had earlier told the corporation that its revenue collection had dipped due to the pandemic and so they would pay EDMC only 50% of the total BTA share this year. So, according to the new arrangement, the Delhi government had to pay EDMC Rs 360 crore instead of Rs 720.75 crore as BTA share, Jain said. “But the government paid us only Rs 144 crore. When we asked, they said Rs 216 crore was deducted towards an old loan taken by the civic body in 2012-13. Such an act is not fair and we demand that the Rs 216 crore should be paid back to the corporation immediately as its financial condition is not good,” Jain said.Jain said the loan the government was talking about was given to the civic body in 2012-13, amounting to around Rs 1,000 crore. But the government added around Rs 900 crore to it as interest, he said.Jain said a proposal to demand back the deducted amount was passed in a House meeting. “When the central government has implemented a moratorium scheme, why is the state government deducting funds from our share in the name of interest,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/edmc-demands-tax-dues-from-delhi-govt/story-3TXMXYrunRfNvRcIUSS1eO.html

They are yet to come to terms with the fact that an old and frail man committed such a heinous crime.As per the police, prima facie evidence indicated that Rajiv had killed his wife Sunita Sunda, 58; son Ashish Sunda, 35; daughter-in-law Garima Sunda, 32; and grandson Suchet, 12. Expressing shock over the deaths, Rajesh Kumar, brother-in-law of the accused, said, “A man of short stature, Rajiv appeared to be harmless. My sister Sunita was married to him for 36 years. Due to Rajiv’s introvert personality and rude behaviour, all his relatives used to stay away from him. I used to visit them occasionally, but could not imagine that he could end up killing his family in such a brutal manner.” He said that Rajiv Sunda was born in an affluent family in Jharkhand. The only brother of four sisters, Rajiv completed his graduation from Kolkata. After facing losses in business, his family moved to Ludhiana. Rajiv’s sisters are married in Ludhiana in well-off families as well, Rajesh said. “Rajiv had enough money to run the house. It is difficult to speculate that any financial constraint would have driven him to take such a step,” he added. “He brought toys worth over ₹10,000 for his grandsons once he went out to shop with me,” said Ashok Kumar, father of Garima, who is facing allegation of abetment to suicide as per the note left by Rajiv.‘My family suffered double blow’Ashok said it was on October 13 that he lost his wife Anita to a sudden cardiac arrest. “We were recovering from the shock and this happened. Garima was looking after us. She used to visit us and cook food for me and my son Gaurav. On Monday, she prepared meal that could last four days and told me that her father-in-law was objecting to her frequent visits. I left her at a distance from the house, unaware of the fact that it could be the last time I saw her,” lamented Ashok Kumar. He said there used to be skirmishes in the family, but he had never imagined that if would turn fatal.‘Rajiv turned religious recently’Ashok said that while Ashish, who had invested money in the share market, and his mother Sunita were religious, Rajiv had started taking keen interest in worshipping recently. Meanwhile, the relatives gathered at the civil hospital mortuary expressed regret over the death of Suchet. Ashok remembered him as a beautiful child with an infectious smile.Suchet used to study in Class 7 at a Civil Lines school.“Even Rajiv loved his grandson a lot. I wonder how he would have mustered the courage to take the lives of his son, wife and grandson. Suchet called us around 6am and told us that a fight had ensued at their house. We assumed it to be a routine affair. Had I reached there in time, I could have saved them,” Ashok said as he broke into tears.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mayur-vihar-murders-can-t-believe-rajiv-could-kill-say-relatives/story-pw0sh1FYHvsSOMlEXNBcfI.html
25-11-2020||Noida||Allahabad High court directs drone surveillance to check violation of social distancing and mask norms||Ghaziabad: The Allahabad high court on Tuesday directed that all crowded places should be manned with the help of drones 24 hours a day to identify instances and places where people are not wearing masks and are not adhering to social distancing norms in view of the rising Covid-19 cases. The surveillance activity will be taken up in the districts of Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Kanpur, Gautam Budh Nagar and Prayagraj, the court said. A bench of Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar gave the directions while hearing a petition on the ‘Inhuman Condition at Quarantine Centres And for Providing Better Treatment to Corona Positive.’ Giving directions to Prayagraj Police, the court directed, “The court is of the view that vigilance vis-a-vis wearing of masks should continue for at least 30 more days. On the next date fixed, the learned additional advocate general may also inform regarding the surveillance that would be done by drones. This surveillance should be done by the available drones in crowded areas on a 24 x 7 basis.” It directed, “The learned additional advocate general to see that surveillance is done vis-a-vis wearing of masks in the districts of Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Kanpur and Gautam Budh Nagar where there is a great upsurge in the spread of the Covid-19 infection. This surveillance should be done on the same pattern as it is being done in Allahabad (sic).” Enforcement against those not wearing face masks needs a major boost in Ghaziabad as the city police, according to official records, could penalise only 487 persons in the first 23 days of November for violations. In contrast, the records show the police penalised 2,353 persons in October, 5,779 in September, 11,410 in August and the highest, 20,936, in the month of July, besides 17,917 in June and 2,131 in May. “We are conducting regular drives and will step up the activity further. The court’s directions will be complied with. We have 2-3 drones and more can be hired for surveillance,” said Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, Ghaziabad. According to state control room records of November 25, Ghaziabad district had a total of 22,008 cases while the neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar district had a tally of 21,801 cases with both emerging at the third and fourth spots, respectively, in terms of highest number of active cases in Uttar Pradesh. After the directions, the Ghaziabad district administration on Wednesday directed officials to rope deploy drones for surveillance. “We have ordered deployment of 10 drones in the first phase and they will be placed at locations where people gather in large numbers, such as markets and other public places. A close watch will be maintained on people flouting social distancing or not wearing masks. For the purpose, we have directed a separate wing at our control room where the drone activity will be displayed on screen,” Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, said. The district magistrate has also assigned a nodal officer to keep track of drone surveillance. “The records of drone surveillance will be preserved. I have directed that responsibility will be fixed on local SHOs and traders’ associations if there is violation of norms in public places or markets,” Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/allahabad-high-court-directs-drone-surveillance-to-check-violation-of-social-distancing-and-mask-norms/story-lv31Zrk4VIVOnrC8aVUJ9I.html
25-11-2020||Noida||Realtors demand time extension and other relief||To cope up with the Covid-19 pandemic impact, realtors on Wednesday demanded multiple relief measures from the Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority (UP-Rera), including last mile funding, restructuring of existing business loans and more time to deliver projects.“We need an additional six months to deliver ongoing housing projects as nationwide lockdown due to the pandemic affected our work schedule. The UP-Rera had earlier given us six months time but we want more in view of the market situation,” said RK Arora president of the UP chapter of national real estate development council (Naredco), which arranged a webinar as part of its three-day Infrastructure Summit-2020 from Wednesday. UP-Rera chief Rajive Kumar participated in the webinar during which the requests were put forward.The realtors also demanded additional funds to complete certain projects that are 80% to 95% complete. Another demand is that existing loans should be ‘restructured’.“It means that if a developer is unable to pay the loan then he should be given opportunity to get the loan amount rescheduled so that he gets more time to repay and loan instalment should be rescheduled. It will help the realtor not to become non performing assets,” said Arora.Naredco national president Niranjan Hiranandani also attended the meet.Meanwhile the confederation of real estate developers association of India (CREDAI), another builders’ group asked the state government to reduce the stamp fee from 5% to 2%.“Maharashtra government has reduced stamp fee to 2% to help the homebuyers. We demanded the UP government do the same. And we also demanded 1% of total property cost on registration fee should be waived off,” said Subodh Goyal secretary of CREDAI’s Western UP chapter. The UPRERA chairman Rajive Kumar assured the realtors help on prevailing issues.“We discussed these issues with the realtors and assured them (realtors) help. We are in the role of supporting the real estate sector and we will do the needful. We have already made recommendations to Reserve bank of India and the ministry of finance on the issue of last mile funding and restructuring of loans. Now if Naredco gives in written then we will again do the needful after looking into these issues. And on stamp fee issue we have already made suggestions and let the state government take a positive decision on it,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/realtors-demand-time-extension-and-other-relief/story-Z2sEoMHzSKwCEfUdCMnUYM.html
25-11-2020||Noida||Health minister says ‘no’ to another lockdown, cross-border restictions||Uttar Pradesh health minister Jai Pratap Singh on Wednesday said that despite a surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi movement across the borders will not be restricted and stressed on precautionary measures. “With all commercial activities open now, no lockdown can be imposed now in any case. Only a thorough behavioural change like restricting the gathering in social functions and festivals, can put brake on the spread of this virus,” said the minister who was in Noida’s sector 59. Singh said that the state government had been executing tried and tested protocols to check the spread of Covid-19 in districts sharing borders with the national capital and that the situation was under control. “Our target is to test at least 175,000 people a day across the state and we are on track. As spike in positive cases can’t be ruled out particularly after the festive season, we have asked the health officials of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts, to conduct random sampling at borders. The state government has also asked for random testing at different airports, railway stations, bus stands and inter-state borders,” he said. The health minister, who is also the in-charge minister for GB Nagar district, said that the administration has been asked to intensify their target on residents of Noida or Ghaziabad who work in Delhi and vice-versa. “The trend clearly indicates that there is no major infection among those who don’t need to cross the border to eke out their livelihood. We are focussing more on surveillance than cursing the mechanism like the Delhi government. After all, we have to develop the winning instinct with the resources available. The Central government has been providing all the helps to check the spread,” he said. Earlier, Singh also took stock of Covid-19 preparedness in GB Nagar, after the sudden surge in Delhi. The minister also inaugurated dialysis in district hospital and CT scan facility in Covid-dedicated hospital in sector 39.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/health-minister-says-no-to-another-lockdown-cross-border-restictions/story-l5ueDSpe0bc5mNyHSjOkgK.html

On Monday, the government had capped guest limit in closed spaces like halls/room at 50% capacity, subject to maximum of 100 people. This was reduced from 200 earlier. The order also limited gathering open spaces at below 40% of capacity, which previously had no limit.District magistrate Suhas LY clarified that organisers of other events -- cultural, political, social and religious, among others -- will have to take prior permission. “There will be no separate permission required for weddings provided that there is strict compliance of government directions. The wedding organisers will be required to send information to two email IDs -- city.mag.noida@gmail.com and ad.cplogbn@gmail.com. The relaxation is not for other events. Our officials will conduct surprise inspections and will take suitable action if directions are flouted,” Suhas, said. Organisers will have to sanitise the venue before the wedding and ensure availability of sanitizers, masks, thermal scanning and social-distancing. Meanwhile in Ghaziabad, people queued up outside the office of the sub-divisional magistrate on Wednesday for permission to events like marriages and hired lawyers to draft their application. “During the past three days or so we have issued around 2,000 wedding permits. Those applying have to give details about guests, venue and even the hall,” said DP Singh, sub-divisional magistrate (Sadar). “We are telling applicants that musicians in bands and even Halwais will be counted under the guest limit.” “With the new guest limit, we are now forced to call our guests and telling them about the directions of the government and to avoid travelling,” said Harish Sharma, a resident of Sahibabad who had come to the SDM office seeking a wedding permit. Mani Kant Sharma, a resident of Maliwara, said that he has already limited the number of guests to minimum after the new directions were issued on Monday. “The capacity of the farmhouse which we have booked is for 800 people. But we have limited the total guests to about 225 which is less than the below 40% limit set for open spaces. This is done to avoid any action. We had already obtained the permission before the new order by the government was issued. Still, we will invite only limited guests,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gautam-buddh-nagar-relaxes-condition-over-weddings-no-need-for-permissions-just-send-two-emails/story-zvL5hXxdiWihbgsiIeVXIJ.html
25-11-2020||Noida||UP directs for increasing share of RT-PCR tests||Ghaziabad: The Uttar Pradesh government on Wednesday directed districts to ensure Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Covid-19 tests, considered to be the most accurate, is 40% of all tests. UP’s additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad said that the total tests conducted in the state on Tuesday was a record 178,549 and that included 72,808 -- or 40% of all tests -- RT-PCR tests. A majority of the rest of the tests were rapid antigen tests that is less accurate but much faster.“The chief minister has directed that the ratio of RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing will be 40:60. Earlier the targets was 33% RT-PCR tests,” Prasad, said. The state government on November 12 had revised the antigen test targets for the both Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar from 2,000 per day to 3500 per day besides the regular RT-PCR tests. Ghaziabad officials said that they were are meeting the 3,500 target given by the state government and also conducting about 1500-2000 RT-PCR tests per day. “Since the RT-PCR test is confirmatory, we will increase the RT-PCR testing in the district. We can contract more of lab technicians for the purpose and will be able to add about 10 more teams to our present resources,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, Ghaziabad district magistrate. Ghaziabad had conducted a total of 526,533 tests till November 24 of which 58.8% were rapid antigen tests. “RT-PCR tests and can even detect low viral load and is preferred as a confirmatory test. We are now conducting around 1500-2000 RT-PCR tests a day at 30 locations and will be able to deploy more teams once we get more lab technicians to conduct RT-PCR tests,” said Dr. NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “The specificity (ability to identify healthy individuals) of both rapid antigen kits and RT-PCR is almost similar but the sensitivity (ability of test to detect disease in individual) of RT-PCR is more at about 80% as compared to 70-75% sensitivity of rapid antigen kits. So, RT-PCR becomes a preferred choice rather than testing a patient first with rapid antigen kit and then following a negative result with RT-PCR test. In my opinion, the RT-PCR should be conducted for all ILI and SARI patients,” said Dr Ashish Agrawal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-directs-for-increasing-share-of-rt-pcr-tests/story-zNkkEpw0r3wHXLUXblF4uJ.html
25-11-2020||Noida||Cages set up, drone survey ordered to trace missing Leopard||Ghaziabad: District officials have made elaborate arrangements to trace the missing leopard that surfaced at Raj Nagar on Tuesday morning and was captured in CCTV cameras installed at residences in the locality. The district administration officials said at least five cages have been set up to trap the animal. They have directed the forest department to make use of drones to trace the leopard in the thick vegetation. The leopard, stated to be a female, had emerged from the generator room of the official residence of Kanchan Verma, vice-chairperson of the Ghaziabad Development Authority. Later it jumped to the adjacent Raj Kunj locality before disappearing into the campus of nearby school, Ingraham Institute, located on Hapur Road. Police PCR vans are making announcements, asking residents to be careful and not to venture out after dusk, and to switch on lights outside houses at night. “The leopard is yet to be traced and forest department teams are camping at the school. They have set up five cages at different places to trap the animal. I have told them they can make use of surveillance drones to trace it as the nearby areas have thick vegetation,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said . Official sources said they have not found any carcass of dogs or cattle from nearby areas. Rumours of a leopard moving around was also doing rounds from nearby Dadri in Gautam Budh Nagar. Gautam Budh Nagar officials denied the claims. “We have not received any complaint, nor has anyone spotted a leopard in Dadri or any other range of the district,” said Kitab Singh, range forest office, Dadri. The school campus spans about 23 acres and houses two English and Hindi medium wings, besides a polytechnic, staff quarters and other facilities. There are also vast open areas with thick vegetation. “Our wing is located at a distance from the spot where the animal was stated to have entered the campus. We do not have students at present and we have alerted our staff members who live in the campus. An alert has been issued by the district administration. Meanwhile, we have deputed some of our staff to stay alert and keep a watch on open spaces,” said Aparna Ruth, principal of Ingraham Institute English Medium School. The district administration on Tuesday evening had confirmed that the animal was a leopard and its surfacing had scared residents of Raj Nagar, Kavi Nagar and nearby areas. “Everyone is keen to know whether the animal has been captured or not. People are hesitant and scared to venture out. A leopard is a shy animal and generally moves around in search of food,” said Ruchin Mehra, a city-based animal activist. “It is quite possible the animal has probably strayed into the city limits from areas such as the Muradnagar canal or Loni where such sightings have come to light during past years,” he said. In December, 2014, the body of a leopard was discovered near the river Yamuna in Pychara village in Loni. A day later, another leopard was found dead in the fields of Abupur in Modi Nagar, Ghaziabad and was suspected to have died due to electrocution. Besides these, an animal from the cat family, possibly a leopard, was spotted in Vaishali’s Sector 3 on August 1. On December 17 last year, a three-and-half year old male leopard was trapped and captured from the Hindon airbase. Also, in April, 2017, a male leopard was captured from Krishna Vihar Kuti area close to the Hindon airbase after it injured a man, a child and a cattle. According to officials, the leopard, Panthera pardus, is listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and included in Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wildlife Fauna and Flora). It is listed as Near Threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. They said that a leopard is known to travel 50-100km in the fields at night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/cages-set-up-drone-survey-ordered-to-trace-missing-leopard/story-v1j77WHxNqhCwt56SpnA4I.html
25-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad most polluted for 4th consecutive day, officials blame Ghazipur landfill fire for spike||Ghaziabad: For the fourth consecutive day, Ghaziabad emerged as the most polluted city across the country as its pollution levels hovered high in the “severe” category on Wednesday. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) records showed that the city has been topping the list of most polluted cities in India since November 22. On November 22, the air quality index (AQI) stood at 288 in the “poor” category category, at 365 at “very poor” on November 23 and at 428 in the “severe” zone on November 24. The AQI was 444 in the “severe” category on Wednesday. The officials said the burning of garbage at the Ghazipur landfill site in East Delhi affected the AQI levels at the Indirapuram and Vasundhara monitoring stations. “Apart from the already prevalent pollution concentration, the fire at the Ghazipur landfill site affected the air quality in the city with the Indirapuram and Vasundhara monitoring stations recording ‘severe’ pollution levels. So, the overall AQI has deteriorated,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer, UP pollution control board. Teams from the Delhi Fire Services were working to control the fire after they received call around 10pm on Tuesday. The fire was raging till Wednesday afternoon. Several air quality monitoring stations in East Delhi also showed a major spike in pollution levels. At Patparganj, the station recorded an AQI of 427 at 4pm on Wednesday while Anand Vihar recorded 448 at the same time. The landfill site is located close to Khoda Colony near UP Gate. The two monitoring stations in Indirapuram and Vasundhara in Ghaziabad are also located nearby. The AQI at 4pm on Wednesday was recorded at 445 in Indirapuram, 476 in Loni, 419 in Sanjay Nagar and 438 in Vasundhara. “The AQI levels at Loni are already high as work on road construction, drains, U-turns, etc., are going on. Besides there is local housing construction as well. So, the reading at Loni has basically remained high during the present season. All these factors combined have directly affected the pollution levels in the city,” he added. Officials of the Indian Meteorological Department had said on Tuesday that the wind speed reduction has been detrimental to the dispersal of pollutants trapped in the region. Wind speed is likely to pick up after November 26 and will help in flushing out pollutants. The officials had said instances of stubble burning counts have decreased drastically and the activity is in the final phases. According to the forecast of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels stood at 12%, 6% and 4% on November 22, 23 and 24, while it reduced further to 2% on November 25. “Despite chalking out numerous plans, there is hardly any implementation at the ground level. Instances of burning of waste and garbage are rampant and construction works are still going on. It was essential that construction of roads, etc., should have been completed before the onset of the winter season. The pollution board also has a severe resource and staff crunch and it is very difficult for them to carry out enforcement and surveillance,” said Vikrant Sharma, a city-based environmentalist and a lawyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-most-polluted-for-4th-consecutive-day-officials-blame-ghazipur-landfill-fire-for-spike/story-hlLpZ5E9GZRWFaVVSBsYgK.html

While neighbouring Ghaziabad has been reeling under ‘severe’ air quality in the past 48 hours, the air in Greater Noida has been in the ‘very poor’ category, threatening to slip into ‘severe’. Monitoring agencies expect pollution levels to drop slightly from Thursday onwards.However, higher humidity levels and low temperatures will make dispersion of pollutants difficult as heavier air (due to low temperatures) trap pollutants better. Meanwhile, the agencies stated that winds directions are currently easterly, which means that the intrusion of smoke from neighbouring states is minimal. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind speed will remain largely calm over next two days, and certain regions may see a slight drizzle. “The wind direction on Wednesday was easterly and south-easterly directions reached maximum speeds of 8 kmph . Certain parts of NCR received drizzle or traces of rain on Wednesday while some areas are expected to witness some drizzling on Thursday morning. However the low intensity will only give rise to the humidity, due to which even if wind speed increases, the ventilation will be low,’ said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. However, the agencies do believe that the ongoing fire at Ghazipur landfill site – one of the largest landfill site of Delhi on the north-west side of Noida – could be a contributing factor. The Ghazipur landfill site had caught fire around Tuesday, 10 pm, leading to smouldering of the solid waste throughout the day. “We have not received any update about the possible effect on air quality. However, it is logical and obvious that a huge fire near the district will definitely have some effect on the overall air quality of the region,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), Noida. According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Wednesday was 414 or ‘severe’ against 396 or ‘very-poor’ a day earlier and 301 on Monday. The AQI of Greater Noida was 394 against 382 a day earlier and 286 on Monday. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 444 against 428 a day earlier, both ‘very-poor’ against 365 on Monday. The AQI between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’ and above 400 is considered ‘severe’. The pollution mass remained high for all three cities, with PM2.5 for past 24-hours in Noida recorded at 243.94 microgrammes per cubic against 229.74 microgrammes per cubic metres a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 250.9 units against 238.16 units a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Ghaziabad was 331.23 against 335.35 a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 units. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is likely to see slight improvement in coming days. “Winds are forecasted to pick up and improve the ventilation condition by Thursday. The AQI is forecasted to improve towards the middle-end of the very poor category by tomorrow and likely stay in the lower end of very poor on 27th and 28th November,” said a SAFAR statement on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-air-quality-slips-to-severe-again/story-bsewR1T4srSIpCsM4O4mQM.html

25-11-2020||Noida||Air ‘severe’ in Noida, Ghaziabad; ‘very poor’ in Faridabad||The air quality in Noida and Ghaziabad deteriorated to reach “severe” level on Wednesday, while it remained “very poor” in Greater Noida and Faridabad and “poor” in Gurgaon, a government agency said.Noida had its air quality in the “severe” category on November 15, a day after Diwali, when large parts of the National Capital Region recorded high pollution.   Presence of PM 2.5 and PM 10 pollutants also remained high in the five neighbouring cities of Delhi, according to the air quality index (AQI) maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).According to the index, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The average 24-hour AQI at 4 pm on Wednesday was 444 in Ghaziabad, 414 in Noida, 394 in Greater Noida, 348 in Faridabad and 299 in Gurgaon, according to the CPCB’s Sameer app.  On Tuesday, it was 428 in Ghaziabad, 396 in Noida, 382 in Greater Noida, 360 in Faridabad and 296 in Gurgaon. It was 365 in Ghaziabad on Monday, 301 in Noida, 286 in Greater Noida, 285 in Gurgaon and 272 in Faridabad. On Sunday, the AQI was 242 in Gurgaon, 234 in Faridabad, 288 in Ghaziabad, 273 in Noida and 270 in Greater Noida, it showed.The CPCB states that an AQI in the “poor” category may cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure, while “very poor” may cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure and “severe” could affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.The AQI for each city is based on the average value of all stations there. Noida, Faridabad, Ghaziabad have four stations each, while Gurgaon has three and Greater Noida two, according to the app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/air-severe-in-noida-ghaziabad-very-poor-in-faridabad/story-r94V0UiVW1cQnXi6lTVxdP.html
25-11-2020||Noida||Police on high alert for farmer movement, labour strike||Police in Gautam Budh Nagar are on high alert in light of the nationwide farmer movement and labour union strike called for Thursday. Several farmer organizations have called for a ‘Delhi chalo’ movement on November 26 and 27 following which police in Delhi-NCR are on high alert. “Organisations in our district are not participating. So there was no need for any additional force deployment but we will stay on alert and monitor the situation closely,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh. Drone cameras will also be used to keep an eye on public movement. Police carried out flag marches on Wednesday in various industrial belts to keep workers from assembling in public during the trade unions’ strike on Thursday.The trade unions are protesting against “anti-worker” and “anti-farmer” policies of the government. “Public gatherings are not allowed in the current scenario (due to the pandemic). Action can be taken against any unlawful assembly. Workers can also be booked for the violation of the essential services maintenance act. We have requested workers in industrial belts to continue with their work like normal tomorrow. That is why the flag marches were carried out,” said Singh. Police will be carrying out extensive patrolling across the district to ensure law and order. The police commissionerate also launched six specialised patrolling vehicles to monitor the Yamuna expressway. “These vehicles will keep at eye on the Jewar airport construction sites. They will patrol the expressway to ensure law and order, keep street crime at bay and to provide necessary support in cases of accidents specially during nights,” said DCP, zone 3, Rajesh Kumar Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/police-on-high-alert-for-farmer-movement-labour-strike/story-rEG2QbZTbGGeHBtA13V7pK.html

We had kept a bag containing ₹4.5 lakh cash and ₹2.5 lakh worth jewellery there and locked it before proceeding to attend the ceremony,” said Sunny, the groom’s older brother. He alleged that someone had broke in and decamped with the bag containing the valuables. “As soon as we realised this we immediately informed the manager. But when we checked the CCTV footage, we found that the cameras had not recorded anything,” he said. Family members alleged that they noticed a particular waiter who was nowhere to be found after the burglary was discovered. “The waiter in question was not serving properly, which is why we noticed him. He was not even on the list of the staff. Someone must have helped him carry out the burglary. We immediately alerted the police,” said Dharmendra, a relative. Based on the complaint, a case of burglary (section 380 of the Indian Penal Code) was registered at the sector 24 police station. “A probe in the matter is underway. We will question all the staff to identify him. There is no CCTV footage of the incident,” said Prabhat Dikshit, station house officer, sector 24 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/burglary-at-banquet-hall-in-noida/story-xTCV8O9Xaq3r5MwEjijJrK.html

After we received information from the hospital, a team was rushed to the spot and the body was sent for autopsy,” said Prabhat Dikshit, station house officer, sector 24 police station. He said that the family found a suicide note from the spot. “In the note, the man has said that he was taking full responsibility for his actions and no one else was responsible or was to be blamed for it. He also mentioned that his family or friends should not be bothered for his death. But there was no specific reason mentioned in the note. The family has also not indicated any trouble which might have prompted him to end his life,” said the SHO. Later, the body of the man was handed over to the family following the autopsy. The man had retired three years ago from the managerial post of a private company and was living with his family in Noida. The family, so far, have not filed any complaint in the matter. Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/elderly-man-dies-by-suicide-in-sector-24-leaves-behind-note/story-hxVHxwbiii5kScHJHirZHM.html
25-11-2020||Noida||Greater Noida authority on a lookout for agency to help them acquire land||The Greater Noida authority is likely to hire a private agency that will help in land acquisition for new industrial sectors. The authority realised that it does not have enough staff to process the files of landowners, said officials.“The agency to be hired will assist the authority in keeping land records, conduct a land audit and also inform farmers about the process. The agency will make the process quick, easy for both the authority and farmers,” said Narendra Bhooshan chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.Interested agencies can apply for the job till December 16 as the authority has issued a request for proposal (RFP) on its official website- www.greaternoidaauthority.in. The authority issued request for proposal (RFP) on November 23 and the pre-bid meeting is scheduled for, said officials.The agency’s work will be for at least 36 months with possible extension depending upon the requirement. The agency will prepare proposals for land acquisition, conducting social impact assessment on socio-economic conditions of farmers, whose land is to be acquired and implementation of section 11 and 19 of land act-2013, said officials.The authority had on August 4, 2020 in its 118th board meeting decided to spend Rs2000 crore on buying the agricultural land from the farmers in the financial year 2020-21 with a aim to prepare fresh land meant to set up industrial units in the city. The authority aims to buy at least 2500 acres of land in this 2020-21 financial year so that it can develop the same and allot it to interested corporate houses and international and domestic investors, who want to set up manufacturing units in this city. The authority has allocated Rs2000 crore for the land buying because it has focused on creation of jobs in this region for the youth so that the local economy can be fuelled, said officials. Officials hope once the agency will be hired the land acquisition work will be expedited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-authority-on-a-lookout-for-agency-to-help-them-acquire-land/story-tsAPwTuHJcact7I468jYgO.html
25-11-2020||Gurugram||City air on the verge of ‘very poor’ zone, rain to improve AQI on Thursday||Air quality in the city remained in the ‘poor’ zone on Wednesday, with a reading of 299 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin, marginally worse than the AQI of 296 recorded the previous day. Experts attributed the lack of improvement in air quality to local factors and slow wind speeds, due to which pollutants couldn’t be dispersed. Gurugram remained the least polluted city in the National Capital Region (NCR) for the second consecutive day, as the AQI in neighbouring Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad worsened to the ‘severe’ category, while Faridabad was in the ‘very poor’ category. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional weather forecasting centre, said that since Gurugram was located to the south, local factors, such as geography and relatively better dispersion of pollutants, might have played a role in keeping the air quality marginally better than other NCR cities. “Wind direction and location play a role due to which there might be a variation in the air quality of different cities. When we look at Palam or Gurugram, towards the south, the dispersion is slightly higher, whereas places such as Delhi are densely populated and vehicular emissions are also higher, due to which dispersion doesn’t take place properly. Comparatively, winds also slightly faster on the outskirts,” said Srivastava. The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was at 243.38 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) on Wednesday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. The PM2.5 level was almost four times the permissible limit of 60µg/m³.According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to improve significantly and reach the lower end of ‘poor’ category on Thursday, with a chance of light rain. The air quality is likely to improve further but remain in the ‘poor’ category on Friday.“Since stubble burning has decreased these days, the air pollution is mostly due to local factors and emissions from industries. The pollutants are not getting dispersed on account of slow wind speed,” said Srivastava.The minimum temperature of Gurugram increased by two degrees on Wednesday, to settle at 11 degrees Celsius, as per IMD data, up from a minimum temperature of 9.6 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 22.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, which decreased by one degree from the day before, according to the IMD’s Palam observatory in Delhi, which, according to the MeT department officials, gives a fairly accurate reading of the city’s weather. The IMD’s automatic weather station (AWS) did not record the city’s maximum temperature on Wednesday. Srivastava said that the minimum temperature would remain in a similar range on Thursday while very light rain may occur in a scattered manner in some parts. “The city might see very light rain or drizzling on account of the western disturbance on Wednesday night or Thursday morning. The temperature won’t be affected much and will stay around 10-11 degrees Celsius in Gurugram,” said Srivastava. He said that while the minimum temperature had stayed in a similar range over the past two days, the maximum temperature had fallen by a degree or two. “Due to a cloud cover, the maximum temperature might fall marginally on Thursday. The minimum temperature will stay in a similar range,” said Srivastava. He said that the temperature would again dip from November 28-29 once the western disturbance passes. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature will hover around 24 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature is expected to stay at 13 degrees. As per the weekly forecast, clear skies will prevail on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-air-on-the-verge-of-very-poor-zone-rain-to-improve-aqi-on-thursday/story-l256NT1C9WLP7oEsFlSWzK.html
25-11-2020||Gurugram||661 new cases in Gurugram district, total count reaches 46,555||The Covid-19 count in Gurugram district reached 46,555 with 661 new cases reported on Wednesday, according to health department data. Active cases rose to 6,181 while the death toll stood at 272 as three deaths related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus were confirmed on Wednesday. To flatten the curve of new infections, the health department said it has ramped up overall testing, while gradually increasing the proportion of rapid antigen tests. However, according to experts, a higher percentage of rapid antigen tests masks the accurate prevalence of the disease due to its poor accuracy in detecting cases. Data shows that in the last one week, rapid antigen tests have increased by almost 16 percentage points. Out of the total 47, 795 tests conducted in the last one week, nearly 27% were antigen tests. If compared to the previous week, the proportion of antigen tests was just 11% when more than 25,000 tests were being administered.The daily average, including 4,500 tests conducted in a single day on November 21, shows nearly 1,800 rapid antigen tests have been conducted every day in the last one week, out of the 6,000 overall tests administered in a day. On Wednesday too, at least 6,284 Covid-19 tests were administered, of which 4,873 were the gold standard Revers Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and 1,411 were rapid antigen.The rapid antigen test has to be done in high-risk areas with repeat testing to control the transmission of the virus. Due to its poor accuracy in identifying true positives, the test is generally not preferred. Studies shows that increased antigen testing impacts the test positivity rate - total number of positive samples of the total samples collected – an important indicator to gauge the prevalence of infection. In the last one week, due to the increased rapid antigen tests, the weekly positivity rate has even come down to almost 12%, compared to the previous week positivity rate of almost 17%. Scientifically, it has been one of the major drawbacks of antigen tests that it masks the exact positivity rate.Experts suggest that positivity rate through RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests should be separately calculated to have a clearer picture of the prevalence of infection. “Gurugram should declare break up of tests done, cases detected through RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests, respectively, on a daily and a cumulative basis and show their positivity rates separately to present more accurate picture,” said Dheeraj Singh, a data scientist who has been monitoring district’s Covid-19 data. An antigen test can detect coronavirus disease cases only when the viral load is high. In some cases, it even misses out the symptomatic person. Therefore, as per the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines, it is mandatory to conduct RT-PCR for every rapid antigen negative test. However, it is left to the decision of the lab technicians at the time of testing based on the symptom of the suspected cases. A record 37,244 tests were administered across the state on Wednesday, with Faridabad conducting the highest sample collection of 14,209 on Wednesday.Sampling dayThe state health department has decided to observe November 28 as sampling day across the state. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, state health department, said, “The target is to do a minimum test of 50,000 tests across the state, of which 80% should be RT-PCR. Health health department has been directed to tie up with labs in advance. The sampling would be targeted as well as random.”He said that the Haryana Medical Service Corporation Limited will ensure the supply of Viral Transport Medium kits and other materials.More than 30,000 tests are administered across the state every day. According to the state health bulletin, 3,269,677 tests have been administered in the state till Wednesday, of which 88% tests have been conducted by government labs. Sirsa, Panipat, Ambala, Narnaul and Panchkula have conducted the fewest tests in the state. Earlier this week, senior state officials clarified that testing will be specifically increased in Gurugram, Faridabad, Hisar and Rohtak, where cases are highest in the state. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “Based on the resources available, the department will chalk out the strategy for the upcoming sampling day on November 28. We will have to consider logistics, availability of manpower and delivery of test results within 48 hours if a record number of RT-PCR tests are to be administered. Sites where testing camps will be held will be decided on Thursday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/661-new-cases-in-gurugram-district-total-count-reaches-46-555/story-BknJ3EIkluh2oJU8yNSzOK.html
25-11-2020||City||DTCP refuses completion certificate to Malibu Towne over violations||Gurugram: The department of town and country planning has refused to grant completion certificate to Malibu Towne, a residential colony on Sohna Road, on account of alleged violations of the layout plan and illegal construction. DTCP officials said directions have been given to the developer to remove these deficiencies and apply for the completion certificate again. A completion certificate is granted to certify that a developer has completed all works and laid services in a colony as per the plan. A developer, after obtaining it, has to take care of the colony for five years after which it can be handed over to a government agency for maintenance. The department said Malibu Estate Pvt Ltd had applied for a completion certificate in 2017. A detailed check by officials revealed that the developer had not obtained occupancy certificate for four community buildings despite extension given by the department to amend violations, it said. The department listed violations such as construction of an office and sewage treatment plant in green belt, a telephone exchange and water works in green area and similar illegal constructions. The department has asked the developer to submit a certificate stating that the profit earned from this project was not more than 15%, which is part of the licence conditions. “A number of complaints pertaining to these matters have been lodged with the department and after inspection, several irregularities were found after which completion was refused,” Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, said. Mann said that for a plotted colony to be handed over to MCG or any other government agency for maintenance, obtaining a completion certificate was a must. “A completion certificate means all services and infrastructure have been laid and the colony can be taken over for maintenance. Without it, the handover can’t happen,” he said.MCG had recently sought information from the department regarding the status of infrastructure and services in Malibu Towne colony for taking over its maintenance. Vijay Shivnath, a member of the volunteer group managing the colony, said that there were several deficiencies in the colony but many of these are minor and could be overcome if the department and developer work in unison. “It is important that the colony gets a completion certificate soon so that it can be transferred to MCG and get integrated with the large civic system of the city,” he said. A representative of Malibu Estate Pvt Ltd did not reply to phone calls and a message seeking a response in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dtcp-refuses-completion-certificate-to-malibu-towne-over-violations/story-b9RJiGx3W66ZZCbbZP6XUP.html
25-11-2020||Gurugram||Man wanted for nine murders held in Uttarakhand||The police on Tuesday arrested 23-year-old Pawan Nehra, a wanted gangster, from Haldwani in Uttarakhand for his alleged involvement in nine murders, including a triple murder in Basai this August. The police had announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for information leading to his arrest after he had fled the spot. Nine of his close aides, however, were arrested following the incident. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that Nehra had shot dead three people over in a feud over a 1,000 square yard plot in Basai. “Joni Kataria, who is in jail in a murder case, had an ancestral plot in Basai, which was usurped by Nehra’s aide and this led to a feud. The opposite gang had joined hands with late Ashok Rathi’s group and killed Nehra’s right-hand man about two years ago. In retaliation, they murdered nine people of the other gang,” he said. Two of his aides, Sawan alias JD, of Jhajjar, and Monu alias Sukha, of Rohtak, were also arrested with Nehra, said police, adding they were planning to rob a vehicle when they were caught. The police recovered three mobile phones, three internet devices and three countrymade pistols from him and two of his gang members. Sangwan said Nehra was released on bail from Bhondsi jail last September. He had been arrested in connection with robbery cases and he had been on the run since. He is involved in hundreds of cases of loot, robbery, gang wars, attempt to murder, murder and kidnapping. He was leading a gang in Basai and had recruited more than 70 members. Nehra had allegedly started making extortion calls to businessmen in Gurugram and had opened fire at a few places when they refused to pay. On August 20, around 5pm, unidentified armed men had shot dead two people after cornering them in an empty plot near Wings Apartment in Bhawani Enclave. Another person was shot dead in Basai village within a few minutes of the first shooting. The police had recovered CCTV footage in which several suspects were seen chasing one of the victims on scooters and later, shooting the victim. Sangwan said that after shooting two of the gang members, they followed another into the residential society and killed him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/man-wanted-for-nine-murders-held-in-uttarakhand/story-3VWBMjaxASAqeHI48Tr8uL.html
25-11-2020||Gurugram||DTCP seeks applications for commercial projects on vacant plots||The Department of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) has sought applications for setting up commercial projects on vacant plots across the state. The commercial colonies will come up under the net planned area of residential sectors, the notice issued by the department stated, adding that developers can submit applications within two months.As per the DTCP notice, commercial projects can have a minimum area of 0.2 acre and the licences can be sought across the state. The said commercial projects will be governed by the policy notified by the department in 2017 for grant of licence for setting up colonies, under which there is a cap on the net planned area. Under a commercial colony, malls, multi-purpose buildings with stores and offices, independent shops and similar projects are allowed. DTCP officials said that such projects can come up in leftover land pockets such as unlicensed land, unacquired land, areas released from acquisition proceedings or that have remained unlicensed since they independently fulfil the area norms for grant of licence in residential sectors. Sanjeev Mann, senior town planner, said that a window of two months has been given to developers to seek licences for such commercial projects. “There are many small plots of land and leftover pockets that can be developed commercially under this policy. This will help in reducing unauthorised constructions,” he said. In a related development, the enforcement wing of the DTCP on Wednesday carried out a demolition drive along the Dwarka Expressway, in which 15 shops, 10 boundary walls and one shed constructed in Sector 119 were razed. “The shops were constructed illegally and being used as offices by property dealers. Three earth moving machines were deployed in the demolition and a large police team was supporting the enforcement department,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement. Ashish Sharma, assistant town planner, said that in the coming weeks, the department will carry out anti-encroachment drives in developing sectors along the Dwarka Expressway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-seeks-applications-for-commercial-projects-on-vacant-plots/story-b9ZpgGH4QBM9HZZjjqA9SL.html
25-11-2020||Gurugram||Enforcing manufacturer responsibility for plastics remains a challenge, say HSPCB officials||Officials with the state pollution control board said that enforcing the extended producer responsibility clause of the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, remains a challenge as most manufacturing units continue to operate under the radar.Earlier this month, a public notice was issued directing all manufacturers, importers and brand owners introducing plastic products into the market in Haryana to register themselves with the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) at the earliest, or face penal action. The responsible parties have also been tasked with working out their own logistics to comply with the extended producer responsibility (EPR) clause of the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) Plastic Waste Management Rules (PWM), 2016.As per the EPR clause, which was added to the PWM Rules via an amendment in 2018, “Producers, importers and brand owners who introduce these products into the market... need to establish a system for collecting back the plastic waste generated due to their products.” However, HSPCB officials said enforcing the guidelines remains a major logistical challenge. This is evidenced by the board’s annual reports on implementation of the PWM Rules, which pegs the estimated plastic waste generated in Haryana in 2019-20 at 190,163 tonnes. The report, however, lists only 45 registered manufacturing units in the state, along with 46 recycling units. A total of 5,897 challans worth Rs 12.77 lakh were issued in the last financial year for violations of the PWM Rules.The numbers suggest that Haryana’s plastic waste problem is ballooning. In 2018-19, Haryana generated an estimated 68,375 tonnes of plastic refuse, which shot up by 178% in 2019-20.“Our observation is that there are several such manufacturers operating without registration, in areas where such industries are disallowed, and who are also manufacturing carry bags less than 50 microns thickness. These are all violations of the PWM Rules,” said Satender Pal, senior environment engineer, HSPCB. Officials failed to provide a specific number or an estimate of the number of unregistered manufacturing units, either at the state or district level.According to a 2018 CPCB report, there are at least 1,020 unregistered units involved in either the manufacture or recycling of plastic across the country. “We have issued a public notice on November 12, which is a chance for such unauthorised manufacturers to come forward, register themselves, and submit their plans for compliance with EPR. Failing this, regional officers at the district level will be forced to identify such violators through physical inspections and take legal action,” Pal said.Detailing the issues with enforcement, S Narayanan, member secretary, HSPCB, said, “The responsibility of coming forward here lies with the polluter, who does not really have any incentive to do so. Moreover, a large portion of the industry is still unregulated and there is little directional framework that is being given to them. We have to find a better way to ensure compliance.” Narayanan added that Central rules for solid waste, e-waste and construction waste management clearly lay out the logistics for collection of waste, involving guidelines for citizens and urban local bodies. “With plastic waste management rules, the modalities for collection of waste are left to the producers and importers, who have to work out their own channels to get back the waste they produce. This is again tricky to enforce, not just for us, but the manufacturers themselves,” Narayanan said.The HSPCB’s public notice, officials said, mainly targets smaller manufacturers and not larger companies, such as e-commerce giants or those manufacturing bulk quantities of thermoplastics. “The EPR clause has been monitored directly by the CPCB. It is only after recent NGT orders that states have been tasked with cracking down on smaller manufacturers, most of whom are unregistered. Larger companies, such as e-commerce providers, who operate in more than two states, are required to register with the CPCB directly,” said Kuldeep Singh, the HSPCB’s regional officer for Gurugram. “At the district level, we will soon be creating an inventory of possible violators and submitting it to our headquarters in Panchkula. We will go ahead and prosecute them as per provisions as provisions of the Environment Protection Act once when we get the go-ahead. We expect this to take a couple of months,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/enforcing-manufacturer-responsibility-for-plastics-remains-a-challenge-say-hspcb-officials/story-7mxZwmpYHVXjCpPy24r5GP.html
25-11-2020||Chandigarh||At 19ºC, Ludhiana logs lowest max temp on November 25 since 1997||Cold, foggy and cloudy weather conditions continued to make the residents shiver as the city recorded the lowest maximum temperature ever since November 25, 1997, on Wednesday when the mercury fell to 19ºC. In 1997, the lowest temperature on this particular day was recorded at 16.5ºC. As per the school of climate change and agricultural meteorology, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), the maximum temperature in the city was recorded at 19ºC, which is 5.2 degrees lower than the normal temperature recorded at this time of the year, while the minimum temperature was recorded at 11.6ºC, 2.7 degrees above normal. PAU experts said that weather conditions are expected to remain cloudy on Thursday with chances of thunderstorm at isolated areas. Dry weather conditions have been predicted Friday onwards. Head of department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, PK Sidhu, said the winter season arrived early this year and lowest temperatures are being recorded since the past three to four decades. The western disturbance will move past Jammu and Kashmir area by Thursday following which, dry weather conditions are expected in the state, Sidhu added. Meanwhile, winter season this year has caught the residents by surprise with low temperatures being witnessed even during the day. One of the residents of Nehru Nagar, Gurminder Singh, said, “Winters have arrived early this year and low temperatures are being recorded. Usually, we start wearing jackets in December, but this year, the chilly weather has forced people to pull out the woollens in November only.” Weather conditions beneficial for cropsPK Sidhu said that the dip in maximum temperature is good for wheat crop and vegetables. When the minimum temperature falls to 2-3ºC, then it starts damaging the winter vegetable crops, but till now it has been going well for farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/at-19c-city-logs-lowest-max-temp-on-november-25-since-1997/story-JcQpqgQFKFoq8xPUu6O0RM.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai mayor’s warning: ‘Follow Covid safety norms or we will have no choice but to impose lockdown’||As she completed one year in office on November 22, mayor Kishori Pednekar on Wednesday spoke to HT about her priorities for the city. Amid plan to distribute Covid vaccine, Pednekar said “the authorities may not be left with any other option than lockdown in case of a second wave, if citizens do not follow safety protocols”. Excerpts from an interview with the health worker-turned-politician, who is the city’s 77th mayor: How was your first year in office as a mayor? Very challenging, thanks to the Covid-19 epidemic. Four months after I took charge as the mayor, we had to handle the unprecedented health crisis. I think our handling of the pandemic has been much better than several cities. Besides, I have taken up several initiatives to streamline the administrative process. Do you think Mumbai will have to go into a lockdown if a second wave hits Mumbai? It is very clear from what chief minister Uddhav Thackerayji said a few days ago. Nobody wants another lockdown, but if the second wave hits us and citizens continue to flout safety protocols, there is no other option. It may be debatable whether lockdown solves the purpose or not, but to some extent it does. We need to understand that unless we have an actual vaccine in our hands, wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing is the only vaccine. I am not saying that citizens are not following safety protocols, but say out of 100, there are always two people who flout it. It is because of these two people that the other 98 will have to suffer. If people do not listen despite so many requests, the administration or the state government will have no other option. Also read: Follow Covid-19 norms to avoid lockdown: CM Uddhav Thackeray tells people of MaharashtraHow does the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plan to distribute the vaccine? Do you think that by next year at least 50% of Mumbai will be vaccinated, considering we get a vaccine by January 2021? As of now, I cannot give any timeline. Mumbai is a huge city and we will definitely want to vaccinate all citizens as soon as possible. There are two or more companies in the race for the vaccine, and we expect the vaccine to come soon. The timeline will depend on when we are likely to get the vaccine and how many doses each individual will require. Some vaccines would require one dose, while some require more than one. For a city like Mumbai, if we have to give every citizen three doses, there is a possibility that this exercise might go on till 2023. Hence, it will be wrong to give a statement on any date for now. What about setting up infrastructure for quick distribution and administration of vaccine? The state government has appointed a taskforce to plan vaccine distribution mechanism. From the BMC’s end, we are also preparing a master plan on vaccine storage and distribution. Detailed planning on setting up network to administer the vaccine and who will get it first will be made in the coming days. There are several allegations of corruption by civic officials in awarding contracts during Covid-19. What is your reaction? It is not that the administration has the power to spend the funds the way they want. They have to follow certain rules and guidelines. If there is any violation or wrongdoing by the administration, action will be taken. The BJP has made allegations that you misused your position as a mayor and also obtained tenements allotted by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) illegally. How do you respond to that? In case of allegations that are made against me, there is an authority named SRA involved. So we should ask the authority if there was any wrongdoing. This will bring out the truth. I am ready to clarify things. If there is anything wrong, I am here in front of everyone. Nobody is untouchable in case of wrongdoing. Also read: Mumbai mayor visits hospital in nurse’s uniform, encourages health staffWhat is the plan for your remaining tenure? Tackling Covid-19 will remain a priority. Health infrastructure will be on top of our agenda followed by education, better roads, water and fire safety. Taking steps to safeguard environment will also be one of our priorities. All parties have started preparations for the 2022 civic polls. Are you confident that the Shiv Sena will retain power in BMC? I am confident of our workers and elected representatives who work for citizens at ground level and not just during the elections. Mumbai’s citizens will vote for us again. I do not want to comment on the BJP, Congress or NCP. As far as the alliances are concerned, the decision will be taken by the Sena leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-mayor-s-warning-follow-covid-safety-norms-or-we-will-have-no-choice-but-to-impose-lockdown/story-7ndp7VMowPHa1fqksB1jHI.html

Festival.The festival, popularly knows as the Tata Lit Fest, was held virtually over six days starting November 16 and had more than 10-lakh attendants. The festival culminated with the awards evening on November 22.Published by HarperCollins, “The Making of Hero”, was pitted against strong contenders including works by Arvind Panagariya and Jaspreet Bindra. After reaching the short list, it edged out Sudhir Sitapati’s “The Brand Factory” and BS Ajaikumar’s “Excellence Has No Borders” to emerge victorious.“I wrote this book to celebrate the life and times of my father and uncles in a ravaged India, a struggling India and emerging India. They are the true heroes of this story. I hope readers see this as a timeless story of aspiration and power of the human spirit and derive some lessons from it. Stories of grit must be told to as many people in as many ways as possible. I am delighted that a Hindi edition will also be published early next year,” said Munjal said.The book narrates the inspirational story of four partition-displaced brothers -- Dayanand Munjal, Satyanand Munjal, Brijmohan Lall Munjal and OP Munjal – who went on to lay the foundation of one of most prestigious “Make in India” stories. How the Munjal brothers laid the foundation of Hero Cycles in 1956 in a partition-ravaged Punjab, and scripted a success story, is the crux of this book.

25-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai railway stations see crowding as BMC begins Covid-19 screening||Crowding was witnessed at railway stations, with little regard for social distancing, as the civic body from Wednesday began screening travellers for Covid-19 at six railway stations. As images from Bandra Terminus went viral, the Western Railway (WR) issued a statement on Wednesday evening, stating the crowding was a result of flouting of the prescribed standard operating procedures (SOP) by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “Initially, the authorities of BMC started conducting 100 % Rapid Antigen tests of all passengers which was not as per SOP issued by BMC. It resulted in mass assembly of passengers in the subway,” stated the WR statement. “It was brought to their notice by Railway Authorities that as per the SOP according to BMC Circular, passengers without symptoms would be allowed to go home while passengers who displayed symptoms shall be segregated & made to undergo Rapid Antigen test. Later on, the BMC started following the provisions of SOP regarding asymptomatic passengers which also eased the situation. Also, initially two testing booths were set up by BMC. On request of Railway Authorities the number of booths was increased to six to speed up the testing.” At the time of going to press, BMC had not commented on the statement issued by WR on the crowdingThe BMC screened 9,779 passengers at six railway stations – Borivli, Dadar, Bandra Terminus, CST, Mumbai Central and Kurla terminus – using rapid antigen kits and found 10 positive cases. The decision to screen passengers was taken after the state government made it compulsory to test citizens arriving from four states – Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Goa - at airports and railway stations, including at land borders. Also read: Maharashtra won’t allow passengers from 4 states without Covid-negative reportThe highest number of passengers – 3,400 – was screened at Mumbai Central, but no cases were detected, followed by second highest (2,046) at Bandra terminus, where five cases were detected. Further, 2,000 passengers were screened at Dadar, in which one positive case was detected; 1,079 passengers were screened at CSMT (0 cases detected.) Lastly, at Borivli, 918 passengers were screened and one person was found positive, followed by 315 screened at Kurla Terminus, in which three tested positive. As per guidelines issued by the Maharashtra government, passengers have to produce a negative RT-PCR report even on landing at airports in Maharashtra. The test should have been done 72 hours prior to the scheduled journey. According to BMC officials, incoming passengers from the four states were screened at the city airport. However, only those passengers not carrying negative reports were made to undergo RT-PCR tests, for which the data will be available by Thursday. Meanwhile, those travelling by roads to Maharashtra, too, will have to undergo screening at the borders check posts. People with symptoms will have to undergo antigen test. If found positive, travellers will be admitted to Covid centres and would have to bear the treatment cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-railway-stations-see-crowding-as-bmc-begins-covid-19-screening/story-JU2iIGawSElt7zJ1ppWkJO.html

Following this, several colleges have tied up with the health department to conduct the tests. Many colleges have decided to reopen only after coronavirus cases decline and the situation is under control. At Punjab College of Technical Education (PCTE), 250 students were tested on Wednesday. They were accommodated in the college hall and social distancing was maintained. Doctors and assistants conducted swab tests. More than 205 students were tested last Friday. Only one tested positive and has been home quarantining as per guidelines of the health department. KNS Kang, director general, said, “Abiding by the instructions from PTU, a team from the health department is conducting Covid tests for students. The staff has already been tested and over 700 students have been tested so far. We are planning to start with only practical classes, and for theory, online classes will continue .”At Gulzar group of Institutes, staff members have been tested for the virus.

25-11-2020||Chandigarh||Train services resume: Coolies, vendors struggle to make ends meet in Ludhiana||With limited trains plying on the tracks of the Ludhiana railway station, coolies and vendors are struggling to make ends meet. On Wednesday, the food stalls at the station were also found closed as vendors opted to keep their establishments closed due to low footfall.Income of coolies has also been affected adversely due to limited passengers visiting the station and majority of them opting to carry their own luggage to avoid getting infected. As per schedule released by the railways, 15 trains were expected to halt at the Ludhiana Railway Station on Wednesday. Of these, Paschim Express from Bandra to Amritsar, which was scheduled to reach Ludhiana at 8am, arrived four hours late. Passengers finally boarded the train at 1.10pm. A passenger, Gopal Krishan, said: “I reached the station at 8am with my family to board the train to Amritsar. But, we had to wait for four hours. Due to surging Covid cases, there was low footfall at the station. Officials of the government railway police were asking all passengers to maintain social distancing and most people were wearing masks and abiding by safety protocols.” The Sachkhand express from Nanded to Amritsar, which was scheduled to reach Ludhiana at 5.35am, was cancelled.A coolie, Radhe Shyam, who has been working at the Ludhiana Railway Station for the last 12 years, said: “I reached the station early in the morning as two trains were expected to arrive between 5am and 8 am. But, one of them was cancelled and another was running late. I rested at the platform and the first train arrived at 1.10 pm. I managed to earn only Rs 100 till afternoon. Due to few trains halting at the station, and passengers preferring to carry their own luggage, coolies are struggling to make ends meet.”All food stalls and trolleys from platform numbers one to seven have been non-operational since March, when trains services were suspended amid the Covid outbreak. Even when the train services have partially resumed now, vendors have decided not to reopen as most passengers are carrying eatables on their own.Earlier, around 150 to 200 trains used to traverse from Ludhiana, and the station witnessed a footfall of around 80,000 passengers everyday.Som Nath, President of the Vendors’ Cooperative Society, said, “After the railways suspended train services in March, all vendors lost their source of income and have been without work since then. We are ready to open the stalls at the station as our income has been affected for many months. Majority of the vendors at stalls and moving trolleys sell food items such as ‘chhole kulche’, chips, cold drinks, biscuits, water bottles, etc. But, due to limited passengers visiting the station, it is not feasible for them to reopen.”Ludhiana railway superintendent Ashok Salaria, said: “Out of the 15 trains expected to arrive at the station on Wednesday, one of them was cancelled and few were running late.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/train-services-resume-coolies-vendors-struggle-to-make-ends-meet-in-ludhiana/story-5w8wekj5McflraoxuWhetM.html

25-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana seals borders with Punjab, water cannons used to stop farmers’ march||Undeterred by heavy security arrangements, farmers in Haryana on Wednesday brazenly challenged the police personnel, used tractors to remove and demolish multi-layer barricades on highways and marched towards the national capital in vehicles to join the ‘Delhi Chalo’ stir against the Centre’s three agriculture laws. The Haryana police also used water cannons against the state’s farmers on the national highway in Ambala and Kurukshetra to stop them from moving to Delhi. The state has also suspended its transport bus service to Punjab with immediate effect because of the stir. “We have suspended roadways service to Punjab for the next two days,” transport minister Mool Chand Sharma said.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday had said the state government has decided to seal the Haryana-Punjab border on November 25 and 26 and Haryana-Delhi border on November 26 and 27 in view of the proposed ‘Delhi Chalo’ call given by the farmers. Haryana had set up road barricades on borders with Punjab and deployed additional police forces to prevent farmers’ entry into the state. Cranes were used to put boulders on roads to stop their movement and traffic was diverted to alternate routes. Water cannons and ambulances were also stationed on the inter-state borders. Restrictions have also been imposed at other inter-state borders with Punjab, including Sirsa, Kurukshetra and Jind districts. Ambala was the epicentre of confrontation between police officials and peasants. Security forces deployed across the state were on their toes as Haryana sealed its border with Punjab to prevent entry of farmers from the neighbouring state. Despite appeals to withdraw the ‘Delhi Chalo’ call, farmers gathered in sizeable numbers on the national highway near the new grain market in Ambala Cantonment. Farmers, mostly from northern districts of Haryana— Ambala, Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra, Kaithal and other nearby areas—had begun assembling in the forenoon. The peasants led by Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Gurnam Singh Charuni hit the roads using tractor trailers, cars, bikes. They were also carrying ration and tents. Tension prevailed as farmers outnumbered the cops and resorted to removing barricades even as police exercising restraint desisted from using force to prevent law and order situation. Police used water cannons when the farmers managed to break the barricades in Ambala. Superintendent of police (SP) Rajesh Kalia said the farmer vehicles had tried to run-over the police. It was after a failed round of talks between police and BKU state chief Gurnam Singh Charuni that the activists started marching towards Delhi. They were stopped on the outskirts where police had erected cemented and iron barricades which were later broken by the agitating farmers. Police made yet another futile attempt to stop the farmers who on their vehicles broke the barricades and crossed Ambala towards Kurukshetra. Stating that police avoided direct confrontation with the farmers, Ambala SP accused them of creating law and order situation. “The farmers resorted to stone-pelting...they tried to hit the cops with their speeding vehicles and run-over them...some cops might have got injured... we will lodge an FIR against them,” the SP said.Police failed to stop the farmers’ cavalcade in Kurukshetra district despite installing barricades and using water cannons. Barricades were set up at Karnal’s Karan Lake where the farmers were expected to reach late night. Police also tried to stop the farmers at Tyora vllage near Shahbad in Kurukshetra where water cannons were again used to stop them. However, the farmers managed to cross the barricades to march forward. “We are farmers and don’t have any plan or strategy but we will not clash with the police and continue our march peacefully,” Charuni said. He said they will try to reach Delhi and start their protest wherever the police will stop them. The district administration of Kurukshetra and Kaithal districts has blocked the state border to prevent entry of farmers from Punjab. “Police have been deployed at the state border in Cheeka of Kaithal district and farmers from Punjab will not be allowed to enter Haryana,” said Kaithal SP Shahank Kumar Sawan.The farmers stopped their cavalcade near Samana Bahu village of Karnal district for the night and will proceed for Delhi on Thursday morning.With inputs from Karnal, Rohtak, Ambala||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-seals-borders-with-punjab-water-cannons-used-to-stop-farmers-march/story-rlKgIVh7Ga1cVfJfkh1qRI.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||MMR’s air quality turns poor after Diwali||The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) witnessed a sharp spike in pollution levels on Wednesday, according to data from the Central and state pollution control bodies. MMR’s AQI on Wednesday was much worse than in the entire Diwali period (November 14-16) when overall AQI remained in the moderate category.The air quality index (AQI) on Wednesday entered the poor category at 206, calculated from an average of 16 locations in MMR, with the prominent pollutant being PM2.5 — tiny pollutant particles that can easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Read: Mumbai’s pollution levels spiked in October; highest so far in 2020, according to MPCBIt was 137 (moderate) on Tuesday with PM2.5 as the prominent pollutant.Even the AQI, according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), was in the moderate category at 180 during the day, but increased to poor (201) by Tuesday evening from an average of 10 locations.CPCB and SAFAR both categorise AQI levels from 0-50 as good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 as moderate, 201-300 is poor, 301-400 is very poor, and above 401 is severe. Researchers said Mumbai’s air quality was likely to remain poor for the next two days at least. “The wind pattern over Mumbai region is presently northerly to north-easterly with winds coming from the land bringing more dust over the city. At the same time we expect temperatures to drop due to northerly winds and pollutant particles getting accumulated and suspended close to the surface. Thus, air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of the moderate and lower end of the poor category,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR.Location-wise AQI, according to pollution control board data, showed Vasai was the most polluted location in MMR with an AQI of 303 (very poor), followed by Worli 301 (very poor), Kurla 272 (poor), and Kalyan 267 (poor). Colaba had the cleanest air at 118 (moderate).According to SAFAR, BKC, Andheri and Chembur recorded the worst AQI in the poor category.The concentration of PM2.5 was 91 microgrammes per cubic metre (µg/m3) against the safe limit of 60 µg/m3 while PM10 levels were 167 µg/m3 against the safe limit of 100 µg/m3.An AQI of 190 (moderate) has been predicted for Thursday, said SAFAR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmr-s-air-quality-turns-poor-after-diwali/story-puEOrN4ELKJg5qXpey8uNM.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||Ahmed Patel: The key Congress man in Maharashtra, from UPA to MVA||Ahmed Patel, the Congress’s master strategist or ‘Chanakya’ who passed away on Wednesday, had played a key role in the formation of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government comprising three parties with different ideologies around this time last year. After the Shiv Sena fell out with its long-standing ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), following the Assembly polls in October last year, the Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), who were in talks for formation of the government, approached the Congress for an alliance. The party’s national leadership was reluctant to join hands with the Sena, which was seen as the party advocating Hindutva and was known for its stand against outsiders or migrants. Also read: The centrality of Ahmed Patel in Indian politicsThe party’s south Indian leaders, including organisational secretary KC Venugopal, had reportedly warned the leadership about the fallout of such an alliance in other parts of the country, according to state Congress leaders. Then, Congress leaders from Maharashtra approached Patel to stress the need to form the government to keep the state unit together, after the poor performance in the past two Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. “A majority of the 42 MLAs elected were of the opinion that the party should be part of the coalition. Some of the younger MLAs had also warned of a split in the party if the Congress did not concede to their demand to be part of the government. The leadership then appointed Patel to take stock of the situation and look at the pros and cons,” said a state Congress leader. Leaders and MLAs felt that being in power would help keep the BJP out of power and give an opportunity to regain lost ground in the state, where the party was born 135 years ago. Also read: Ahmed Patel: Congress’ indispensable man, an emissary and an archetypal party person“Patel also convinced the central leadership that the Sena had shed its aggressive stand over north Indians and minorities. He had meetings with NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray separately before forming the government to decide the terms. He was keen on a common minimum programme which could underline the secular face of the alliance. He also clarified the Congress would not agree to secondary treatment in terms of sharing of power, although it was a junior partner in terms of number of MLAs,” said the leader, adding that Patel was common link between Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Pawar and Thackeray in the entire process. Revenue minister and former chief minister Ashok Chavan said, “Ahmedbhai presented the political position in the state before the party leadership. He spoke to the MLAs and conveyed it to the leadership impartially. It helped us in forming the government in Maharashtra.” “Ahmedbhai also had a dialogue with party MLAs who were lodged in Rajasthan to avoid any attempt of poaching,” said a senior Congress leader requesting anonymity.Thackeray, in his condolence message, said: “The party has lost its Chanakya, who would stand by them in every moment of challenge. He was actively involved in social work, besides his political engagements. His guidance and experience helped us a lot while forming the three-party alliance that formed the government in Maharashtra last year. Not only the Congress, but even the MVA has lost its guide.” Pawar tweeted, “Deeply saddened to know about the demise of veteran Congress leader Shri Ahmed Patel. His contribution to @INCINdia will always be remembered. My sincere condolences to members of his family.” Patel shared cordial relations with Pawar. He was Congress’s pointsperson to communicate with the NCP leadership, especially during the UPA government at the Centre. He had played a key role in forming the Congress-NCP alliance that ruled Maharashtra from 1999 to 2014. “The two parties came together to form a government in Maharashtra in 1999 in just a few months after Pawar quit the Congress to form his own outfit. The alliance after the fallout was a strategic move in which Patel played a major role,” another party leader said. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray said, “Over the years, Patel forged relationships even beyond the political sphere. He valued each of them and stood by his friends in good and bad times. I have fond memories of Patel and will always cherish those.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ahmed-patel-the-key-congress-man-in-maharashtra-from-upa-to-mva/story-rHHSOxv8EcOOhzg5eAk8uK.html

But amid Covid-19 pandemic, this tradition and its celebration has gone virtual at hotels in Delhi-NCR. While most hotels have chosen not to conduct cake-mixing ceremony this time around, a select few have come up with innovative solutions to maintain social distancing. Cake mixing tradition live streamingThis year, it was more of a “virtual bond” than a physical gathering. Chef Rajesh Roy, executive chef, Le Meridien Gurgaon, says, “Preparing for a celebration is truly an event where people bond with each other by performing this ritual of pouring and mixing of dry fruits with much fun and enthusiasm. This year we created the festive mood by live streaming the cake mixing tradition, which enables an audience to join us and savoured the moment.” Sanitised kitchens, and social distancingThe annual Christmas cake mixing ceremony was an intimate affair this year unlike previous years. “In order to ensure the safety of our guests and associates, and as part of our restrengthened commitment, a select team of pâtissiers and bakers conducted the cake mixing ceremony in our sanitised kitchens while maintaining the highest levels of hygiene, safety and physical distancing protocols,” says Rajesh Wadhwa, executive chef, Taj Palace, New Delhi. More than 150 kilos of rich candied fruits and nuts along with several litres of ambrosial spirits and a selection of freshly pounded aromatic spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and fennel were used for this ceremony. Wadhwa, who has been leading this tradition for over 17 years here, says, “The heady mixture will now be allowed to rest for around 45 days for the fruits and nuts to soak up the goodness of the spices and the spirit. The redolent, fruity mixture shall then be used to create some finest Christmas cakes, Plum Puddings, Dundee cakes, Stöllen breads, Mince Pies and other traditional festive indulgences.” Apron, gloves, chef hat and a maskThe cake mixing ceremony embarks the beginning of the year end. And this year, some places invited their guests for the first time, to participate and rejoice the festive spirit. Rishi Mehra, director, Food & Beverage – The Leela Palace New Delhi, says, “We are also incorporating the popular Indian sweet petha, for the soaking this time, along with other regular accompaniments such as seasonal fruits, berries, etc. The merriment will be observed while adhering to all safety measures, and our comprehensive safety program that underlines the safety and hygiene protocols we ensure for the well being of our guests and associates. Each guest will be provided with an apron, a pair of gloves, a chef hat and a mask. The ceremony will be followed by a special high tea for our patrons.” Qui-et a mixing Refraining from the traditional cake mixing ceremony, some hotels in Delhi-NCR are preferring to keep guests out of this ceremony, this time around. “Keeping in mind the prevailing Covid-19 situation, we will have a quiet and restrained cake mixing, without guests. But proper hygiene protocols will be maintained,” says Kush Kapoor, CEO, Roseate Hotels & Resorts.Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cake-mixing-ceremonies-2020-sanitised-kitchens-virtual-streaming-mask-on/story-TCbGOErgaAZd7073Th05PI.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Accused committed ‘crime against humanity’, police says in charge sheet||The accused persons in the recent Delhi riots allegedly committed a “crime against humanity” carried out in an “extremely brutal”, “grotesque” and “dastardly” manner, police has said in its supplementary charge sheet filed in a case in a court here.The charge sheet, which names former JNU student leader Umar Khalid and JNU student Sharjeel Imam as accused, said there was a “tacit understanding” between the accused persons to carry out an “illegal” act. It stated that by a “sustained and well-oiled” campaign, they created an acute sense of fear and insecurity in the minds of the minority community.“All the accused persons came together in pursuit of an unlawful object. The offences have been committed by the accused persons in an extremely brutal, grotesque and dastardly manner. Innocent victims and helpless were targeted of this ghastly, horrendous and horrifying crime. Precious lives were lost. Accused persons are charge sheeted for commission of grave, serious and heinous offences.“It is pertinent to mention here that their acts and commissions have shocked the collective conscience of the society. The accused persons’ conduct exhibits total disregard for human values and shows a totally depraved, brutal and scheming mind. The accused persons have committed a crime against humanity,” Police claimed in the charge sheet filed on Sunday.It further said that the criminal conspiracy was continuing and has suffered setbacks with the exposure and arrest of the accused persons but it was neither aborted nor abandoned.The charge sheet said the brunt of the conspiracy was suffered by those who reside in most densely populated district of India where day to day survival requires blood and sweat of the toiler and the breadwinner.“With the leaders choosing to either remain safely glued to their television sets in the comfort of their homes in upscale locations of Delhi-NCR using their communication devices as the weapon of the enlightened or leaving Delhi for outside destinations to create the most acceptable alibi, the brunt of the conspiracy was suffered by those who reside in most densely populated district of India where day to day survival requires blood and sweat of the toiler and the breadwinner. The crime committed by the key conspirators is not just legally but morally reprehensible,” it said.It alleged the charge sheeted accused had entered into a deep rooted and sinister conspiracy to do an illegal act with an objective to disturb societal harmony by their terrorist acts. “By a sustained and well oiled campaign, they created an acute sense of fear and insecurity in the minds of the minority community. Innocent people were killed as a result of this cold blooded, brutal, gruesome and diabolical conspiracy. Government and private properties were damaged, destroyed and destructed. “The law and order situation was paralysed, essential services became unavailable and rumours and disinformation became the order of the day as desired by the accused persons who were acting in a systematic, structured and organised manner,” the charge sheet said. Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-accused-committed-crime-against-humanity-police-says-in-charge-sheet/story-jnFkmqFKkO8vK8eUw1GR8M.html

25-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Capt Amarinder, Navjot Singh Sidhu break ice over lunch||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had a meeting at the former’s farmhouse in Siswan near Chandigarh, signalling a rapprochement between the two. The chief minister had invited Sidhu over for the personal luncheon meeting to break the ice and the two leaders were together for close to an hour. “It was a warm & cordial luncheon meeting that saw CM@capt_amarinder and Navjot Singh Sidhu discuss a host of important political matters of Punjab and national interest. The two leaders spent a pleasant over an hour sharing thoughts on vital issues. @sherryontopp @INCIndia,” the chief minister’s media adviser, Raveen Thurkral, tweeted after the meeting. The two leaders discussed several issues, including the stir against the Centre’s farm laws on a day the state farmers started their Delhi Chalo march, during the meeting, according to sources privy to details of their interaction. Sidhu, who has been keeping the media at arm’s length for the past many months, could not be contacted. FROM FROSTY TIES TO THE THAW Though Amarinder and Sidhu have been seen together on party platforms twice in the past two months, the meeting was their first in the past one-and-a-half years amid talk of the cricketer-turned-politician’s re-induction into the state cabinet. The relations between the two leaders were frosty for a long time but things went south when Amarinder stripped Sidhu of the local government portfolio and the latter quit the state cabinet. The CM had blamed his inept handling of the department for the poor performance of the party in urban pockets during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Sidhu maintained a low profile thereafter and kept taking an occasional dig at the state government’s functioning social media but without directly naming the chief minister. CROWD-PULLING POWER PLUS FOR CONGRESS The efforts to get the two to bury the hatchet started after former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat was appointed the All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of party affairs in Punjab three months ago. He ensured Sidhu’s presence at former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s tractor rally in Moga last month by going to his house in Amritsar and bringing him along. Rawat, who sees Sidhu’s crowd-pulling power as a huge plus for the Congress at both state and national levels, is pushing for an important role for him ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. Both Amarinder and Sidhu have also been making efforts to mend their relations. The CM had asked Sidhu to second the resolution in the state assembly against the Centre’s farm laws and then the latter also participated in a protest led by the chief minister in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-capt-amarinder-navjot-singh-sidhu-break-ice-over-lunch/story-vYxBr6Fr7bTdrRIvNUSeWN.html
25-11-2020||Pune||Lokkala 2020: Daily online performances to showcase folk artistes from Pune region||The Lalit Kala Kendra of the department of performing arts, Savitribai Phule Pune University(SPPU) has come up with a unique 20-day programme to help folk artistes get a platform for their performances. Through the online platform, Lokkala 2020, students and faculty members selected 20 troupes from villages near Pune and will begin showcasing folk dances, music and other styles online for 20 minutes from 8pm starting November 30. This will continue till December 19. The programme is being conducted under the National Centre for Folk Performing Arts Studies, Research and Welfare Centre, which has been set up by SPPU two-and-a-half years ago.“The folk artistes have not been able to perform due to the Covid-19 pandemic since the last eight months. Most of the artistes perform via invitations to village jatra, weddings, or any other auspicious events, but due to the pandemic, traditional folk artistes are struggling to survive,” said Praveen Bhole, head of department, Lalit Kala Kendra.“When the lockdown was implemented, Lalit Kala Kendra along with Tech Mahindra Foundation helped 350 folk artistes with groceries and a ration, but that could not sustain them for so long. Also, with a ban on large gatherings, it is difficult for many of these folk artistes to earn their livelihood,” Bhole added.The students spent a month and half scouting for such artistes in villages near Pune. “The emphasis was on providing a platform to endangered forms of performing folk art like Waru, Bharadi, songs of Lakhabai, among others. A five-member team of Bhushan Bhingarkar, Suraj Shinde, Bipin Ghobale, Pratik Halge and Unmesh Dhore scouted villages like Donde, Dhamni, Loni, Belhe and Narayangaon to meet these folk artistes personally.“Initially, it was difficult to convince these artistes as they thought that we were just making fun of their sustenance. However, after two to three personal meetings along with a letter from our department, we got the folk artistes to agree to the programme,” said Bhushan Bhingarkar, a student specialising in theatre at the Lalit Kala Kendra.The performers will be getting a royalty for their performances of Rs 5,000 from the Welfare Centre along with the online platform to showcase their talent.Nandarani Bhokate, a Lavani singer and Tamasha artiste from Sakurdi village, Khed Taluka, said, “I am so happy that we finally get to showcase our kala (talent). The last eight months have been difficult for us. I have been part of a Tamasha pati (group) since the age of 7. Performing artistes get work only through invitations and with the lockdown, there has been no work. To set up one pati of Tamasha for two months of shows, we need at least Rs 5 to 6 lakh. This year, we have not performed at all. These students and their professors have given us a ray of hope and also a platform to appeal to the government to also look after us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/lokkala-2020-daily-online-performances-to-showcase-folk-artistes-from-pune-region/story-xx3wsCAmfZOJNfevm3w6iK.html
25-11-2020||Pune||Vegetable prices down by 40 per cent in Pune||The vegetable prices which were skyrocketing during Diwali have now dropped by at least 40 per cent due to a surplus in stock arrival at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) managed market. The retail market price for essentials had seen a steep rise during the past week with citizens complaining of unaffordability and a pinch on the tight daily spending budget. According to traders, during the shortage period, there was a huge demand for onions, carrots, garlic tomatoes, leafy vegetables, red and green chillies, ginger and other vegetables which led to a price rise. According to Madhukant Garad, APMC chief more than 500 trucks of leafy vegetables arrived in the market on Monday which made up for the shortage. “Since there was a shortage of vegetables and rising demand for them, the prices increased. Now the prices have stabilised and citizens can buy them at affordable rates,” Garad said. The Gultekdi vegetable market also saw arrival of adequate vegetables and fruits during the past two days which led to the stabilisation of prices, commission agents involved in the business said. Anupreet Kaur, a resident of NIBM said, “We had to buy onions at the rate of Rs 80 per kilogram and cucumber was selling around Rs 60 per kilogram for the last three days. Today, I bought them at Rs 40 and Rs 20 respectively. The price rise is simply unaffordable and the APMC must keep a tab on the rising prices so that customers are not fleeced by the vegetable sellers when buying at retail prices.” Vegetable wholeseller Vilas Bhujbal said, “The prices of onions, potatoes and garlic are still high while all other vegetable prices have come down as the shortage is over. After Diwali, the prices usually go down due to long vacations. The current prices were high due to a shortage of vegetable supply.” Vegetable prices crash after festive seasonMethi Last month: ₹50 This week: ₹40 Now: ₹20 Spring Onion Last month: ₹50 This week: ₹40 Now: ₹20 Onions Last month: ₹ 90 This week: ₹60 Now: ₹40 Ladies finger Last month: ₹105 This week: ₹90 Now ₹50 Pumpkin Last month: Rs 50 This week: Rs 40 Now: Rs 20 Tomatoes Last month: ₹90 This week: ₹70 Now: ₹30 Potatoes Last month: ₹70 This week: ₹60 Now: ₹40 Cucumber Last month: ₹75 This week ₹60 Now: ₹25 Carrots Last month: ₹60 This week: ₹50 Now: ₹30 Coriander Last month: ₹35 This week: ₹30 Now: ₹15-20 Green Peas Last month: ₹75 This week: ₹60 Now: ₹40||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/vegetable-prices-down-by-40-per-cent-in-pune/story-5Tqwdv0WVmLNs2AYIKJk6O.html

According to Srinivas Bonala, PMC additional city engineer and officer-in-charge Pune city has 17 subways and three subways are for vehicles. “All of the subways were closed during lockdown but as everything is back on track and open citizens are facing trouble crossing the roads in the city. Therefore, the Pune Municipal Corporation has decided to open up the subways.” Bonala issued instructions to all the regional ward offices and instructed them to clean up the subways and begin the process of reopening them again. Since the subways were closed for over eight months, they are in need of cleaning before they can be opened up for pedestrians. BJP leader and spokesperson Sandeep Khardekar said he was following up with the Pune Municipal Corporation since the last many days demanding the opening up of the subways across the city. “After lockdown was lifted, citizens have begun going for walks and shopping but were facing problems crossing the roads since the subways were shut. I appealed to the Pune municipal administration to open up the subways for the convenience of the pedestrians,” Khardekar told HT. Khardekar believes the subways should be ready for use in the next two days. “As the administration has instructed to clean up the subways and open them up, I’m expecting that in the next two days, subways would be fully functional for the pedestrians. Already, the work of cleaning the subway on Karve road has begun,” Khardekar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-to-reopen-subways-in-the-city/story-xdZe0EYFR7673nFwKV17AN.html
25-11-2020||Chandigarh||Barred from entering Haryana, farmers from Punjab prepare for long haul at inter-state border||Barred from entering Haryana en route their Delhi Chalo march, leaders of farmer organisations of Punjab on Wednesday announced that they will sit on dharna at the inter-state border for a week. The decision was taken after the Haryana government placed barricades and sealed all main entry points from Punjab to prevent the farmers from marching to the national capital. Bharti Kisan Union (Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said, “We don’t want a confrontation. Our aim is to oppose the Centre’s farm laws. If we are not allowed to cross Haryana and head for Delhi on Thursday, our protest destination will be the border points for a week. If we get public support, the duration of the dharnas may be increased.” The Left-leaning union is considered the largest among the 31 farmer unions with a significant following in Sangrur, Mansa, Bathinda districts. “Haryana has restricted movement. One can come from Haryana into Punjab but cannot go from our state,” said Darshan Pal, the president of the Krantikari Kisan Union. Shambu, Ghanaur, Dera Bassi, Khanauri, Pehowa and Jakhal are the main entry points into Haryana from Patiala, Mohali and Bathinda districts and a large number of farmers reached these points on Wednesday. “Despite tough weather conditions, it is going to be a long protest by farmers. They are leaving home and readying to protest for two to three months. They are bringing along tents, ration, firewood, clothes, medicines and other articles of daily needs,” he added. KHANAURI, DABWALI KEY SPOTS Farm activists started reaching Dabwali border in Bathinda and Khanauri in Sangrur since Tuesday night. “Khanauri will be the key point where our activists will gather in the maximum number followed by Doomwali on the Bathinda-Sirsa border near Dabwali. Our supporters will start gathering from Wednesday evening at the designated spots,” Ugrahan said. Nearly 1,000 BKU activists had gathered at Doomwali border till Wednesday afternoon. Traffic from Bathinda in Punjab to Haryana was blocked after the Sirsa district administration sealed the Doomwali barrier. Commuters were allowed to enter Haryana from the Talwandi-Rori route and via Sardulgarh in Mansa district. Police sources said vehicles carrying flags of farmer associations were stopped by Haryana Police at the two border points. TRAFFIC JAM ON DELHI-SANGRUR HIGHWAY An estimated 1,000 BKU, Sidhupur, activists tried to enter Haryana with tractor-trolleys through Khanauri but the Haryana Police stopped them in their tracks. The BKU, Sidhupur, members had assembled at Mehlan Chowk, 10km from Sangrur, and headed towards Khanauri. The tractor-trolleys caused long jams on the Delhi-Sangrur highway. Members of the BKU, Ugrahan, camped near the Khanauri border but did not try to enter Haryana. They will attempt to march to Delhi on November 26. MONITORING SITUATION CLOSELY: BATHINDA IG Activists of 30 other farmer unions from south Malwa are to gather at Talwandi Sabo on Wednesday night and they are scheduled to head for Haryana early on Thursday. However, activists of Bharti Kisan Union, Sidhupur, from Bathinda and adjoining areas left for Delhi on Tuesday afternoon itself. Inspector general of police (IG), Bathinda range, Jaskaran Singh said the farmer organisations had sought permission to reach Delhi via Doomwali and Talwandi-Rori routes in Bathinda and via Sardulgarh in Mansa district. “We are monitoring the situation closely to ensure law and order,” the IGP said.

25-11-2020||Chandigarh||15-day window fine, but clearing backlog will take months: Punjab industry||At a time the industry in the state wants to literally fly out of its current situation towards recovery and normalcy, the resumption of goods trains, though a breather, only highlights that it will be a long, hard clawback for all stakeholders. The sheer quantity of backlog to be cleared and uncertainty over what happens after 15 days, if no permanent solution is found to end the farmers’ stir, are adding to the disquiet among owners.  Thousands of containers with export material are still stocked at dry ports in Ludhiana, while an even larger number of containers (around 8,000) with import material are stuck in transit. Officials at dry ports in the financial capital of the state have seen a steep fall in Exim (export-import) business for the past two months. Officials say it will take at least a month for the situation to stabilise.Dry Ports in Ludhiana’s Dhandari Kalan, Sahnewal, Focal Point and Kila Raipur account for 95% of logistics business in the region. The logistics business itself has shrunk by 50% over the past two months. At the Gateway Rail Freight Ltd (GRFL) in Sahnewal, which accounts for the maximum share of business, by volume, among the Exims, approximately 1,000 containers for exports continue to be stranded, while another 2,800 containers carrying import material are stuck in transit. “A larger number of containers have been transported by road after exporters lifted from dry ports, considering the uncertainty over resumption of train services. This added to their costs, while also leading to loss of clientele. This was another major setback for the local industry,” said Rajeev Sharma, terminal head, ICD Gateway Rail Freight Limited, Sahnewal. ICD stands for Inland Container Depot. “Manufacturers are ordering extra, fearing that trains will again be stopped after 15 days. The industry has suffered enough. The government should think of saving the industry and not just farmers,” said Rahul Verma, owner of a dyeing unit. Badish Jindal, president, All Industries and Trade Forum, said the industry had suffered losses in crores of rupees and the government should clarify its stand. “The government should clear the uncertainty. It will take months for the situation to return to normalcy as imports are stuck and it will take months for the already stocked containers to clear. The focus should be to clear the backlog and run a greater number of goods trains over passenger trains.” Onkar Singh Pahwa, CMD of Avon Cycles, said the resumption of goods trains, was great, but there was lot of fear and panic in industrialists. “I hope goods trains run smoothly now without any hurdle,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/15-day-window-fine-but-clearing-backlog-will-take-months-punjab-industry/story-BRzgyNAPWE597Dcv8280zI.html

But it is a dynamic exercise, conducted by district authorities on a need-based manner, they said.The Delhi Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulation, 2020, authorises district magistrates to seal off a geographical area, banning entry and exit of the population from the containment zone and to take any measures directed by the health department to prevent the spread of the disease.According to a senior Delhi government official, micro-containment zones have been formed in the southwest and northwest districts, while other districts were also using a flexible approach to ensure restricting virus transmission in the best possible way.Read more | Arvind Kejriwal asks experts to audit Covid-19 deaths, suggest measures to reduce fatalities in DelhiThe southwest district magistrate had on Sunday issued an order for setting up of micro-containment zones in view of “large scale outbreak” of the novel coronavirus in the district.“To contain the further spread of the disease, it is hereby ordered that micro-containment zone shall be formed upon detection of two or more Covid-19 positive cases in the same house/building/in the vicinity of each other,” stated the order.A senior district official said the step was taken for better enforcement of quarantine measures.According to the latest data, there are 4,980 containment zones in the city with the maximum 863 in the southwest district. In the northeast district too, authorities have been using two or more cases criterion to carve out more micro-containment zones.“The purpose of setting up a containment zone is to ensure prevention of the spread of Covid-19 and save people from infection. The change (in criteria) will help better monitoring of the situation,” said a senior district officer in northeast Delhi.Officials said micro-containment zones also means that while the infected people are quarantined, the residents of the neighbourhood are saved from inconveniences.By this, the number of containment zones has gone up but people covered have gone down, a government data showed.In July, the city had around 1,000 bigger containment zones with over four lakh people, however, by mid-November, there were 4,467 containment zones covering 1.61 lakh people, figures showed.In a containment zone, entry and exit are not permitted, with district and health officials providing necessary supplies and monitoring infected persons.For the past few weeks, Delhi has been witnessing a surge in coronavirus infection with the city reporting 6,224 fresh Covid-19 cases and 109 deaths on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/district-authorities-setting-up-micro-containment-zones-as-covid-19-cases-surge-in-delhi/story-1tebbIGoXhyZvn0Z7OypXK.html

Delhi Fire Services (DFS) teams which have been working to control the fire, said that they received a call to report the fire at 9.56pm on Tuesday and it was still raging on Wednesday afternoon. “Because the fire is on a landfill where several flammable items have been dumped, it has taken us some time to control it.

25-11-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand wildlife board clears proposal to de-notify elephant reserve||The Uttarakhand State Wildlife Advisory Board on Tuesday approved the de-notification of Shivalik Elephant Reserve as an elephant reserve to pave way for the expansion of the Dehradun airport project, said forest officials. Harak Singh Rawat, state forest minister, said, “The state wildlife board, during its 16th meeting, approved the de-notification of Shivalik Elephant Reserve as there is no law to define an elephant reserve. In the late 90s and early 2000, the state government had sent a proposal to the Centre seeking a clarification regarding the said area, after which it was notified as an elephant reserve in 2002. But as per the norms of the central government, there is no law or Act yet under which the legal status of an elephant reserve is defined.” He added that the state government will issue an official order within a few days in this regard. “In future, if the Centre makes a law governing elephant reserves, then Shivalik area will automatically fall under its purview. We have de-notified it as of now and when the central government brings any law, we will abide by it,” said Rawat. Also Read: Sri Lanka digs moat around Ampara landfill to keep out hungry elephantsIn September, the state government wrote to the union environment ministry for obtaining prior approval under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 for non-forestry use of 87.0815 hectares of forest land for “expansion of the Jolly Grant Airport.” This land is within the Shivalik Elephant Reserve. Officials estimate that about 10,000 trees will be cut for the expansion. State forest department to allow tourists in Gangotri National Park The wildlife board also approved a notification stating the state forest department will not stop tourists going to Gangotri National Park, near the Indo-China border, if the district magistrate gives a go-ahead after checking all security measures. “Till now, a limited number of tourists were allowed to visit the Gangotri National Park, as permission from forest department was also needed. To promote tourism, we have now decided that the forest department will not stop tourists from going to Gangotri National Park if they have the required permits from the district magistrate,” added the state forest minister. Probe ordered in death of radio-collared elephant Meanwhile, hours after a radio-collared elephant died in Haridwar forest division on Tuesday morning, the state government ordered a probe in the matter. Raising the issue in front of the members of the board, Rawat instructed them to investigate the cause behind the frequent deaths of elephants in the state. “In the past few days, elephant deaths have increased in the state, mostly due to electrocution. A radio-collared elephant died on Tuesday due to electrocution, which could have been avoided. The officials should investigate this matter and ensure that mitigation measures are put in place to prevent deaths because of electrocution,” added Rawat. State forest department to resend proposal to NBWL to modify height of underpass in Rajaji Tiger Reserve In October, the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) had declined the Uttarakhand forest department’s request to modify conditions imposed by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) for the road passing through the buffer area of Rajaji Tiger Reserve, an ecologically sensitive area in terms of the movement of wildlife. The state forest department requested modifications, such as reducing the length of underpass for wild animals and its height from 8m to 5m. During the 16th state wildlife board meeting it was decided that the state forest department will again send a proposal to NBWL, seeking a modification in the height of the underpass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-wildlife-board-clears-proposal-to-de-notify-elephant-reserve/story-1VQ6rUyr2t552JlTyLrmpL.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra:131 bird nests removed before tree transplantation for Metro Line 4, 4A||A bird nest survey prior to the commencement of tree transplantation for two Metro lines at Thane saw the removal of 131 nests from 107 trees between Friday and Monday.This is the second time such a survey is being done for Metro line 4 (Wadala to Kasarvadavali stretch that includes 11 stations in Thane), and for the first time for Metro line 4A (part of the Metro 4 extension Kasarvadavali-Gaimukh). In a joint survey conducted on foot of around 565 trees by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the Maharashtra forest department and animal rescue group Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW), 131 of 132 nests were found vacant (without eggs or abandoned by birds) and removed, while one nest with young ones in them was left untouched near Mogharpada in Thane (west) along the Metro 4A line. “It was decided that transplanting the tree with young ones on it would be put on hold until the birds grow older, and we will visit the site later again to check the status,” said Manoj Pardeshi, forester, wildlife, Thane, adding that the bird nest survey was conducted to ensure wildlife was not affected in any manner due to Metro construction projects.Also Read: Maharashtra: Panje tidal water blockade lifted, strengthens demand for bird sanctuaryMMRDA officials said the survey was carried out across two packages from Thane Teen Hath Naka to Gaimukh with 10 bird nests surveyed near the Mogharpada depot, 42 nests between Cadbury junction to Majiwada, and 80 nests between Kapurbawdi to Kasarvadavali.“The survey was undertaken with experts, engineers, forest officials, and using necessary equipment including a man lift machine (aerial work platform) to ensure birds are not harmed during the tree transplantation process, and majority of nests which were vacant carefully removed as per wildlife laws,” said Yamini Meshram, deputy engineer, MMRDA.BG Pawar, joint commissioner, MMRDA said, “This is being done to ensure that we do not disrupt the normal habitat of these birds due to the ongoing metro construction work, and we are also ensuring minimal number of tree loss during construction.”During the first survey during January and February, 160 bird nests were safely removed from 128 trees over three days along the Metro 4 route. “This was followed by 150 trees transplanted to Sape village, Bhiwandi, where 98% survival rate was recorded. Now, based on changes of design for a few stations, this survey was conducted. Following this, 345 trees will be transplanted under the Metro 4A route, and another 341 trees for the Metro 4 route at Sape village. There are plans to cut 13 trees for Metro 4A and 6 for Metro 4 in Thane jurisdiction, which have either larger girth while some are deceased. They cannot be transplanted as they will not survive. However, the final decision on cutting the trees is yet to be taken,” an MMRDA official said.Birds sighted during the survey included kites, parakeets, myna, pigeon, munia, kingfisher, sparrow among others but dominated by crows. “Less active nesting was observed due to ongoing Metro construction work and human activity after which the existing batches of birds may have changed their nesting location due to construction noise,” said Pawan Sharma, president, RAWW. He added that the team spotted maximum nests were made using binding metal wires showing unique crafting techniques and survival instincts of birds. “However, such nests are not as safe as young ones could get stuck between the metal wires, entangling their foot, and gradually dying a slow death,” said Sharma, adding, “Such studies are important to understand and improve how development projects can be balanced with environment, and how their impact can be minimised around surrounding wildlife.”Pardeshi added that the bird survey was yet to be conducted across one more stretch under the Metro 5 line (Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan). “We are studying whether this line falls under the Thane or Kalyan jurisdiction, and accordingly the local forest department would undertake the survey later this week,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-131-bird-nests-removed-before-tree-transplantation-for-metro-line-4-4a/story-xfoXpI9fTAKaTlpINfBHOK.html

25-11-2020||Noida||Leopard spotted near residences of district officials in Ghaziabad; teams pressed in for search ops||Residents of Raj Nagar were taken aback when a Leopard was spotted roaming around in the streets of Raj Kunj locality Tuesday morning, after it emerged from the official residence of the vice-chairperson of the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) located adjacent.The district magistrate on Tuesday evening confirmed that the animal was a leopard and that teams from Delhi and Meerut were called in to trace the feline at the earliest.The area where the leopard was spotted is dotted with official residences of the Ghaziabad district magistrate, the senior superintendent of police and those of other administrative officers. The area also has schools and the Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad.The animal emerged from the official residence of Kanchan Verma, the vice-chairperson of GDA, around 11am, and attacked a gardener, Hari Mohan, in the process. Mohan said that he suffered a minor injury to his hand.“It seemed like a leopard, given its height and length, and was probably hiding in the generator room. When the staff went there to turn on the generator, the animal jumped out and tried to attack the gardener. When other staff ran to save him, the animal jumped to the adjacent Raj Kunj locality,” Verma said.“From there, it is learnt that the animal jumped into a school, which is located at the back side. Its images were captured in the CCTV installed at my residence. There are also pug marks of the animal in the garden,” she added.Raj Kunj has 90 houses. The feline was spotted by residents while its images were taken in CCTV cameras while it roamed the streets.“Our neighbours spotted the animal roaming outside their houses and they raised an alert. Since Monday night, all stray dogs in the area have been barking continuously. When the leopard came, children playing in the park ran to their homes. After some time, the leopard jumped the boundary wall and went to the school area, which has large fields and has thick vegetation,” said Ajay Audhichya, a resident of Raj Kunj.“Teams of the forest department asked us about the weight and height of the animal but they could not spot it or capture it,” he added.Teams from the Kavi Nagar police and the forest department went to the school, Ingraham Institute, and alerted officials.“The teams searched the school campus but the animal could not be located. We also shut down the premises as a precautionary measure but nothing was found during the search. In the morning we heard loud noises from the house of the GDA V-C nearby. It was probably due to the spotting of the animal there,” said Rajiv Kumar, principal of Ingraham Institute, Hindi medium branch, Hapur Road.Search still onThe search for the animal continued till late Tuesday but to no avail.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that the forest department is carrying out a detailed search for the animal.“The forest department teams are on the job and have called rescue teams from Meerut and Delhi to capture the animal. They have confirmed that it was a leopard and not a fishing cat. I have directed officials to make announcements in nearby localities so that residents along with their children should stay indoors till the animal is safely captured,” said Pandey.The neighbouring localities are Raj Nagar, Kavi Nagar, Shashtri Nagar, among others.The last time an animal from the cat family, possibly a leopard, was spotted in the city was on August 1 when the feline had ventured into the locality’s Sector 3 area. Its images were captured in CCTVs. The forest department had conducted a recce of the area but could not conclusively tell whether it was a leopard or a fishing cat.In another sighting last year on December 17, a leopard had ventured into the Hindon airbase. The three and half year-old male leopard was trapped and later released safely in the Saharanpur forest range.Before this, April 2017 a male leopard was captured from Krishna Vihar Kuti area near Bhopra, which is close to the Hindon airbase. The leopard was captured after about five hours, during which it had to be tranquilised thrice. However, before it was captured, it injured a man, a child and cattle.According to officials, the leopard, Panthera pardus, is listed under the Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and included in Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wildlife Fauna and Flora). It is also listed as Near Threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.They said that a leopard is known to travel 50-100km in fields during night. Likewise, the fishing cat is also listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. It means that it faces a high threat of extinction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/leopard-spotted-near-residences-of-district-officials-in-ghaziabad-teams-pressed-in-for-search-ops/story-d4TYLsGqTecTSFqidKrVYM.html

The state government took this decision after there was a controversy over a kissing scene in a web series A Suitable Boy, based on Vikram Seth’s novel of the same name, which was filmed at Maheshwar Temple in Khargone district. An FIR has been registered at Rewa against two executives of streaming platform Netflix for allegedly insulting religious sentiments. Mishra said, “We have directed the district officers to record videos of the shooting of movies and series in heritage buildings and holy places of MP.” Also Read: UP makes ‘love jihad’ a punishable offence“Obscene pictures can’t be filmed at holy places. A team of officers will check scenes and content.

According to an officer of tourism department, “Strict guidelines will be formed to check the content and scenes. The entertainment company will have to adhere to the guidelines while shooting in MP.” However, people in the tourism industry say it will dissuade the entertainment industry from choosing MP for shooting. A tourism company owner Akshay Hunka said, “We are also not in a favour of such scenes which hurt any kind of sentiments, but such guidelines, producers and directors will not choose destinations in MP for shooting.” Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “The formulation of guidelines is a good step but it shouldn’t be against the freedom of expression and speech. In the name of keeping an eye on such things, the BJP-led state government will do moral policing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/govt-watchdog-to-check-content-and-filming-of-scenes-of-movies-and-series-in-madhya-pradesh/story-lB0X9NdO9ee6rHvnP7E2JJ.html

The other seven states included Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Kerala, Gujarat and Delhi.Testing ramped up in NCR districts, says CMKhattar said the Covid-19 situation in Haryana remained satisfactory in the first and second phase. However, in the third phase, there has been a spurt in number of cases in the past few days, especially in the districts abutting Delhi. He said that the state government has ramped up testing in NCR areas so that people found positive could be isolated to keep a check on the further spread of infection. Referring to the steps being taken by the state government to effectively combat the Covid-19 situation, he said that testing in Haryana has reached 1.24 lakh per million which is much more than the national average of 80,000 per million.

The Jat leader, who was addressing a rally at Jassia village on the birth anniversary of peasant leader Sir Chhotu Ram, also condemned the government for detaining farmer leaders ahead of the march. “It is painful to know that people who are fighting for their rights are being sent to police stations in these cold weather conditions. The Centre should amend the laws or else people would be forced to come out on streets,” he said.Malik also said that he would call a meeting soon to decide the future course of action regarding the agitation.He also urged the government to release Jat youths languishing in jails after the 2016 stir and provide reservation to the community under the other backward class (OBC) category.“The BJP-JJP coalition government should bring Jat reservation bill again in the Haryana Vidhan Sabha and accord reservation to Jats and five other communities,” he said. “The government had agreed to withdraw all cases, whether in the ambit of the state or the Centre, but it has so far failed to fulfill this promise,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/will-reach-delhi-to-support-farmers-says-jat-leader-yashpal-malik/story-x4CKtVR2Uztk0oyGcYTBvJ.html

All the leaders were taken into detention between Monday night and Tuesday morning.

25-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: NDMC privileges||You must have come across this signage: “NDMC Limit End”This board demarcates the limits of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) zone, which has some of India’s most expensive real estate, like in Amrita Shergil Marg. Some of the country’s most important people, including the President, Prime Minister, Cabinet ministers, senior bureaucrats and ambassadors of powerful nations, reside in the NDMC zone.This evening, a man is sleeping on the pavement, under one of the aforementioned signs near the New Delhi railway station. A few clothes are strung on a chord clamped on a side wall. It almost looks like a refugee stopped at a border. Of course, anyone can walk into the NDMC limits. But if the common man is here, it generally is on work. Soon he must exit, perhaps tossing a longing glance at the signboard as he goes.But what exactly is the NDMC state of mind?One afternoon, a young woman is walking her cocker spaniels on a tree-lined pavement in the NDMC zone. Waving towards the adjacent DDA (Delhi Development Authority) Officers Colony on Bhagwan Das Road, she says, “My father’s official house.” Identifying herself by her first name only, Divya explains: “We moved here from across the Yamuna. This part of the city is more organized, more quiet, and full of trees.”The rest of the smoggy metropolis—more than 90 percent of it—comes under the other municipal bodies—namely the Cantonment Board, and (primarily) the three bodies that have replaced the MCD—the South Delhi, North Delhi and East Delhi municipal corporations.NDMC describes itself on its website as “the territory that has been described as Lutyens’ Delhi”. Its origins go back to the days of our colonizers. It began as the Imperial Delhi Committee, shortly after the British moved the seat of power from Calcutta to Delhi. The name was changed to the New Delhi Municipal Committee in 1927.Despite teeming with VVIPs, patches of the NDMC also host a kind of populace that does not consist of politicians and bureaucrats. A stroll through its wide avenues takes you past the homeless, the minders of cheap food kiosks, and even some slum-dwellers.Indeed, sometimes two NDMC neighbourhoods, though physically close to each other, may give the impression of being on different planets. You’ll realise that while ambling through the adjoining localities of BK Dutt Colony and far more upscale Jor Bagh, separated by just a road. The former has narrower lanes and more density of people than Jor Bagh, with its broad avenues and gated mansions guarded by uniformed vigils.Even so, one knows when one is in an NDMC area. It feels far neater, and some of its parts are so idyllic that they don’t appear to be part of the city the rest of us experience daily.To deftly witness the city’s disparities, you ought to stroll along the border regions of NDMC someday. And don’t forget to click a keepsake selfie by the signage saying: NDMC Limit End.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-ndmc-privileges/story-1eTFYv7kj5XerlAxrCvfwJ.html

The matter came to such a head after the school distributed stale rice and wheat, infested with insects and worms, to parents of students at the school premises on Tuesday. Packets of 4kg of rice and wheat were distributed even as the MDM workers, ordered to distribute this ration alleging that the grain was not in an eatable condition. The school is already facing an inquiry from the district education department over its failure to disburse MDM to 800 students during the lockdown. HT has a copy of the complaint, which states, “No accurate information has been given to us by school principal Karamjeet Singh on the MDM. There are several irregularities. The principal has distributed ration only three times and that, too, not to all students.” Of 59 staffers, 45 are teachers, four class-4 employees, two members of non-teaching staff and eight MDM workers. Block primary education officer Prithi Singh, said, “We are already conducting an inquiry into it. The head office had sought the MDM record of school. We sent it to them.”Santosh, an MDM worker, who has been with the school for years said, “On Monday, they told us to open the drums (containers), of leftover ration. These drums had grain that had been kept over for over a year. That is why I can vouch for the inedible quality of the rice and wheat.”Principal Karamjeet said, “We are only supplying what we got from the department. We had received the rice in such a condition.” Deputy district education officer (secondary education), Sukhwinder Khosla, said, “Yes, the school has delayed ration distribution. As far as I know, the rice was already infested when the school got its supply. We are looking into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patiala-school-staff-accuse-principal-of-irregularities-in-mid-day-meal-scheme/story-5Jjl26m1UmSzZIBMmF5uzL.html
25-11-2020||Chandigarh||How HP lost control over Covid battle||Until October the Covid-19 situation in Himachal Pradesh seemed to be under control with the recovery rate well above 86% and new infections decreasing.By November, however, things changed and the third wave hit the state. More than 12,300 cases and 238 fatalities were recorded this month as compared to the previous highest tally of 8,938 cases in September since the outbreak.The recovery rate also slipped below 80%. HP now has the highest ratio of active cases in terms of population in the country and also the highest positivity rate.Four of its districts are among the top 10 in India with the highest infection rate. Safety norms disregarded The state government as well as the people are to be blamed for the problem, with the former taking decisions recklessly and the latter disregarding safety norms. “There was carelessness in following the Covid-19 protocol, which is why the Himsuraksha Abhiyan for information, education and communication has been launched,” said Amitabh Awasthi, secretary (health). However, there was no shortage of oxygen cylinders in the hospital, except for one day when the vehicle carrying cylinders had an accident, he added.Nearly eight months down the line since the outbreak, Awasthi says makeshift hospitals will now come up within 10 to 15 days. Sanjay Chauhan, former Shimla mayor and CPI(M) leader, however, blamed “lack of proper health services” for the Covid19 cases and deaths. “Now the situation is going beyond control and may create havoc if not controlled in time. Without wasting any time the government should chalk out a war like strategy and form a task force under capable leadership consisting of health and other experts.” Super spreader eventsFor the public, it was as if the virus did not exist as social gatherings, mainly marriages, turned into super spreader events with people refusing to follow social distancing norms, even as the ceiling on numbers of attendees was removed. “There is no coordination between the government and leaders. The government adopted double standards on social distancing when it came to marriages, where they restricted guests from attending. But there were no rules for BJP rallies,” said Kuldeep Singh Rathore, president of the Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee. Large crowds gathered at the political rallies, the recent one held in Bilaspur where BJP national president JP Nadda addressed party workers. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, instead of focusing on controlling the pandemic, remained busy with public meetings and tours across the state. No social distancing norms were followed by the political leaders and the party workers. The festive season too led to a spike as crowds thronged the markets, without following safety rules. Earlier, bazaars were being sanitised. This stopped. The government decision to open schools for regular classes also backfired. A large number of teachers and students were infected and educational institutions closed within a week of reopening. No check on touristsThere were no controls on tourist arrivals during festivals and weekends, which added to the spread, especially in Lahaul-Spiti district. “It opened the floodgates for the virus in Himachal. There is no check on tourists coming to the state and they were allowed to visit places that did not have infections,” added Rathore. The state government also allowed buses to ply with 100% occupancy and also resumed inter-state bus services . Registration and quarantining of people from coming from other states was also done away with, making detection and tracing difficult. Course correction Scrambling to contain the Covid-19 spread the state government has now imposed fresh curbs. School and educational institutions will remain closed till the year end. The buses will ply with 50% occupancy. All the political rallies have been cancelled till December 15. Cancelling the winter session of the state assembly is also being considered. It’s slated for December 7 to 12 at Dharamshala. But will this be too little too late?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/surrender-how-hp-lost-control-over-covid-battle/story-J4aF3ZpTfbEpNoa99sOMzH.html

25-11-2020||Chandigarh||High court raps Punjab govt for delay in giving revised pay scales to 4 forest officers||The high court has rapped the Punjab government for dilly-dallying on giving revised pay scales to four state forest corporation officers. The high court bench of justice Sudhir Mittal said that delay in amendment of the bylaws, which led to delay in granting benefits were due to corporation and the state government, the officers could not have been made to suffer on account of the inefficiency of the state apparatus. The bench remarked that the state is supposed to be a model employer. However, the facts of this case show that they can be more callous than a private employer. “A private employer may justify his actions citing profit but the state does not even have this excuse. It may try to impute callousness to the impersonal nature of the state machinery but such justification can never be acceptable. While considering issues concerning its employees, the state cannot remain impersonal. It must adopt a humane approach so that the employees remain motivated and serve to the best of their abilities,” it said. The officers had reached high court in 2014 as representations at various levels failed to get any results on giving them benefits of 5th pay commission. The four deputy forest officers are employees of Punjab State Forest Development Corporation. The corporation recruited them in 2000 to deal with increasing workload at the level of project officers. Two were recruited and two more corporation got from the forest department on deputation. While in 2010 all employees in the state got new pay scales with the implementation of 5th pay commission but these four got excluded. They approached at various levels but failed to get any relief, which prompted them to approach high court. The corporation had submitted that after creation of the posts, same was not included in its bye-laws and unless and until the amended bye-laws were approved by the government, revised pay scales could not be granted. Corporation had put entire blame upon the state for delaying approval to the new byelaws. However, court directed that revised pay scales be given to them from the date in others cases, besides benefits under Assured Career Progression Scheme, 2006. All dues have been directed to be cleared with 10% interest in four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/high-court-raps-punjab-govt-for-delay-in-giving-revised-pay-scales-to-4-forest-officers/story-pmwSllvEMHZWa8Z7vowU7O.html

In a recent letter addressed to the department, a Maharashtra-based school parents’ body named Indiawide Parents’ Association has also urged the state to mark students on the basis of internal assessments for the academic year 2020-21. “It is a huge risk for students to travel to school for exams. Even appearing for board exams, which are held at different centres, are risky owing to the rising cases of Covid-19. We request the state government and the education department to conduct all the exams online for this year. At this point, the health of the students is of utmost importance,” said Anubha Sahai, president of the association. Officials from the department said they would respond on the demands made by the parents after looking into the details.Early this month, the government had announced that Class 10 and Class 12 board exams will be held only after May. Class 12 exams are usually held in February, while Class 10 exams are conducted in March. However, due to online learning and the likely delay in finishing the syllabus, the government has decided to postpone the exams. While schools in some parts of the state reopened on Monday, teachers are now requesting the department to come up with an academic calendar for the coming days. “Uniform guidelines are needed to conduct the exams as in their absence, schools are making their own timetables, which is confusing for the students,” said the principal of a suburban school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/conduct-all-exams-online-parents-in-maharashtra-tell-state-education-department/story-zlFm3s4eBDUUvlfy1ia43M.html

However, earlier posts detailing the killing of Manohar Lal Arora and an open threat to ‘others’ were missing from the timeline. Sources said it was not a new page but the hate content was taken down from the original one. The administrator of the criminal’s page posted a message that previous posts related to Arora’s murder were deleted but he still stands by the reason behind the crime. “Sikh kom de dokhi bach ke chalan” (violators of Sikh traditions or religion) was a veiled threat message was found posted today on the same page. HT had reported that Bathinda police had approached the Facebook administration seeking cyber details of the social media page published in the name of a criminal was that was found fanning religious feelings and threatening violence. Within hours of Arora’s killing on November 20, the FB page in question had claimed that the foreign exchange trader was murdered by Rajinder and Aman to avenge the sacrilege incidents of 2015. A couple of posts in the last 24-hours from the gangster’s social media page also threatened to eliminate anyone involved in the sacrilege of the scriptures of Sikhs. Police had already clarified that the deceased was not found in any criminal activities and his name was never cropped up in any case of sacrilege. Sources said the page was deactivated by FB on Sunday evening and posts were deleted for talking and promoting violence. Bathinda senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk had confirmed of writing to FB in this regard. “It appears that the FB acted as per it policy of discouraging violence and hate content online. The cyber wing of the state police is closely monitoring activities of various people but most likely the controversial FB page is being handled by unidentified persons from overseas,” said a source. Meanwhile, dera followers continue to hold demonstration for the fourth consecutive day at sect’s state headquarters at Salabatpura village, about 50-kms from here. A number of protesters continues to increase as they refused to hold cremation until the preparators Arora’s murder are arrested. SSP Virk said the police have rounded a few acquaintances of the gangster Sukhpreet Singh. He said none of the persons being questioned is a suspect in Arora’s murder. “We working on certain leads and hope the main accused will be arrested soon,” said the SSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dera-follower-s-murder-in-bathinda-punjab-gangster-sukha-gill-s-fb-page-resurfaces/story-vZuVBH6YOzU8kaPXDUcc5J.html
25-11-2020||Chandigarh||J&K sees subdued campaign, candidates rely on social media||The district development council (DDC) polls, the first electoral exercise to be held in Jammu and Kashmir after the revocation the former state’s special status and bifurcation, are round the corner but the election fever is conspicuously absent as are buntings, banners and mega rallies. Amid the Covid crisis, most candidates in fray for the 280 seats, are opting for door-to-door campaigning or are using social media platforms, especially news portals to seek votes, especially in rural areas. Many candidates, especially young ones, have made short video messages seeking votes and highlighting their priorities.Advocate Irfan Hafeez Lone, who is contesting from Sangrama, says he prefers door-to-door campaigning. “I am not tech savvy myself but my friends are using social media to boost my campaign. My opponents have money and muscle power but I am confident of winning.Social media will certainly play an important role.”So far, only the BJP and Apni Party have held rallies and conventions in different parts of the Union Territory. Top BJP national leaders were seen campaigning in different parts of Kashmir. Apni Party president Altaf Bukhari, who presided over a party convention under tight security at Sherwani Hall in Baramulla, said these elections were being for development of areas in different assembly segments: “The people who will get elected will form development plans for their areas. This is the third tier of the Panchayat Raj system.”J&K Pradesh Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said the party had decided that local workers will play a major role in seeking votes for party candidates in DDC polls: “We are also planning some rallies in different parts of J&K.” On Tuesday, former J&K chief minister Farooq Abdullah, who is also president of the six-party alliance of regional parties, released a short video seeking votes for alliance candidates. The message was shared by all prominent leaders of the PAGD on social media.Peoples Conference spokesperson Adnan Ashraf, whose party is part of the alliance, said their candidates are relying both on door-to-door campaigning and social media. “We have many young educated candidates. Besides using social media they also travel from village-to-village seeking votes. Since these are grassroots elections local impact will have influence.” Adnan said campaigning has been mostly left to the local leadership. “Top leaders will go for limited campaigning.”Political analyst Ishfaq Ahmad says people in Kashmir were still shocked over the decisions announced on August 5, 2019. “Though all parties are in fray, enthusiasm is missing even among the top leaders of major regional political parties. Now, vote percentage is crucial, which will determine the future of politics in J&K.’ Different parties and independent candidates will contest the eight-phased election for 280 seats slated for November 28 to December 19. The counting will take place on December 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-sees-subdued-campaign-candidates-rely-on-social-media/story-FIm4TSnr3EsgrHMNHphlrK.html
25-11-2020||City||Another thalassaemia patient found HIV+ at Bathinda civil hospital||With another thalassaemia child patient found infected with HIV here on Tuesday, the state health department has decided to write to the state vigilance bureau to investigate the repeated incidents of wrong blood infusion. Since October, five persons, including four thalassaemia patients, between 8-13 years, who were treated at Shaheed Bhai Mani Civil Hospital, were found infected with HIV virus. Senior medical officer (SMO) of the civil hospital said an 11-year-old boy from Barnala district was found infected before infusion of blood today at the local blood bank. He said it is being probed from where the child may have caught the infection. “After the surfacing of several cases where patients were found infected with HIV, every thalassaemia patient visiting the blood bank at the hospital are medically screened. Today four children were tested for their health status of which one was tested positive for HIV and another with hepatitis-C. They will be given treatment as per the protocol,” he said. Since October, six MLTs and one doctor at the blood bank have been found guilty by the department of infusion of HIV+ blood. Of the six persons, all hired on a contract basis, have been dismissed. On October 16, an MLT Baldev Singh Romana was arrested in an attempt to murder case on the basis of a health department investigation for his alleged role leading to an intentional infusion of infected blood to a seven-year-old patient to settle scores with colleagues at the blood bank. State health secretary Hussan Lal said two departmental inquiries have suspected a mischievous role played by several department staff and there may have been a link. He said the SVB is better equipped and trained to find out possibilities of a nexus behind repeated cases of wrong blood infusion. “On Monday, four medical lab technologist (MLTs) were dismissed for their gross negligence and professional misconduct in discharging duties. It was found that the blood bank staffers in question violated protocol by issuing blood of an HIV positive person without checking it to a thalassemic patient early this month,” said Lal. He said Punjab State AIDS Control Society (PSACS) --- that works under the health department --- has been asked to examine the functioning of all blood banks of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/another-thalassaemia-patient-found-hiv-at-bathinda-civil-hospital/story-p4Gh66pTK67aRHtsLZ9NaL.html

With this, the total train sets ordered by MMRDA has gone up to 96. According to MMRDA, it has ordered an additional 12 train sets of six cars each for the Metro-2B (DN Nagar-Mankhurd), Metro-7A and Metro-9 (Andheri to Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and Dahisar to Mira Bhayander) from Bengaluru-based Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML). According to BEML’s letter dated November 22, the order is valued at ₹501 crore. With this, the total contract value has increased to ₹4,318 crore from the existing ₹3,817 crore for supplies before August 2023. A senior official from MMRDA said that with 72 more coaches, MMRDA will receive a total of 576 coaches from BEML. In a press conference held in September, MMRDA metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev had said that the authority will receive the first set of coaches in December, following which the trial runs are expected to start from January 14, 2021. The commercial operations are then expected to begin from May 2021. The two corridors were initially expected to be operational by December this year but the work was delayed owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and the ensuing lockdown. The first set of trains will be housed at the Charkop depot. Coaches will be light-weight/ energy efficient and fully air-conditioned. The features will also enable driverless options. The trains will also have seats for the specially-abled, space for a cycle and charging points for mobile and laptops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrda-orders-12-more-train-sets-for-mumbai-metro-2-and-7-extension/story-H9oGEASaiXS7c7xwPi3a3J.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||IITs welcome new BTech batch virtually this year||Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) welcomed first-year students registered for Bachelor of technology (BTech) virtually this year. The new academic year for BTech students at IIT commenced virtually on November 11.“Registration and orientation program for new UG entrants was conducted through [the] online mode this year with the help of the IIT-Bombay’s official channel,” said a spokesperson for the institute. Admissions to most professional UG courses remains delayed across the country. At IIT Madras, 938 BTech, 175 dual degree and 52 Masters students have been admitted for the 2020-21 academic year. The new batch started operating virtually on November 16. “We are starting the new academic year in a trimester pattern, instead of the usual two semesters annually. All classes will be held online and relevant information will be shared through the institute’s student email system,” said a spokesperson for IIT Madras. IIT Mandi’s new batch started from November 23, with a week long student induction program. Regular online classes for course work will commence from December 1. With regular classes already having shifted online during the lockdown, most IITs have initiated surveys among the new batches to find out if all students are equipped with laptops and adequate internet to attend online lectures. IIT Hyderabad has enabled a bank loan system for students who need to buy laptops by which the institute will pay the interest on the loan taken by the student.Professor Chitralekha Mahanta, dean academic affairs, IIT-Guwahati, said the institute is exploring options to see how it can support students from low income groups for whom remote learning may be a challenge. “On a case to case basis, needy students are being brought back to campus to facilitate them with the requisite environment for online learning,” said Mahanta.While working on facilitating virtual classes, IITs are also planning phased returns to campus. “Decisions on re-commencing physical in-person classes will be taken after evaluating the situation in Tamil Nadu and other states as well as in accordance with the central government,” said a spokesperson for IIT Madras. Professor Shantanu Roy, dean (academic) of IIT Delhi, said the institutes are planning phased openings and at present, only PhD students are returning to campus. At IIT Bombay, several Covid-19 task force committees have been formed and a sub-committee is currently working on rebooting the campus once the lockdown has been lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iits-welcome-new-btech-batch-virtually-this-year/story-NGxJG7EYZpENLuwxZENgdI.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||At Mumbai civic body, Sena, BJP join hands to pass proposal for acquiring land for garden||In a rare moment of cooperation, the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came together at the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) general body meeting to pass a proposal for the acquisition of a plot at Exsar, Borivali, which has been reserved to create a public garden as per the Development Plan. The meeting was organised via video-conferencing on Tuesday. The administration had pitched the proposal to acquire the plot using any of the three options: by availing BMC’s accommodation/reservation policy in which the developer has to hand over 70% of a reserved plot to the civic body at the time of redevelopment of the existing building on the plot; by offering transferred development rights (TDR) to the owner of the plot; or by paying the owner the cost of the land as per the present ready reckoner rate. Leader of the Opposition in the civic body, Ravi Raja from the Congress, and his party colleagues logged out of the meeting against the decision. “I moved an amendment to the administration’s proposal, opposing the transfer of money to the land owner, and instead availing the options of TDR or accommodation/reservation policy for acquiring this land. BMC cannot pay money to the land owner, as its financial health is poor currently. However, the BJP and the Shiv Sena rejected my motion. So Congress staged a walk-out,” said Raja. However, Bhalchandra Shirsat from BJP said that the municipal commissioner’s proposal already asks for permission to avail either of the three options. “Thus, Raja’s proposal duplicated that concept. The original proposal is already agreeing to Ravi Raja’s demand. The proposal that was passed allows BMC to make an agreement with the land owner, and mutually decide which of the tree options to avail to acquire this land.” The original nod to acquire the land was given by the general body in 2009, by paying money to the owner, as the accommodation reservation policy did not exist at the time. As per that original proposal, the owner of the 5,798 square metre plot wanted to develop it and submitted a purchase notice to BMC. The civic body was due to pay the owner Rs180.16 crore via the collector’s office as compensation for acquiring the land, of which Rs83.27 crore was paid in 2019 for one portion of the land. BMC is yet to pay Rs96.89 crore to the collector for the remaining portion. Borivli corporator Sheetal Mhatre from the Shiv Sena also opposed the move. “There are about 3,000 families living in the buildings on this land. BMC has no plans to relocate them. I demanded assurance that these families will be relocated in-situ. What is the point of acquiring land to develop a garden when there are residents living there, especially when BMC has no immediate plans to move them?” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/at-mumbai-civic-body-sena-bjp-join-hands-to-pass-proposal-for-acquiring-land-for-garden/story-7hz928mdbW9i0VQ9RU7cCJ.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||Road mishaps killed 447 people in Mumbai last year||Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety and its partners, including Mumbai traffic police, released a report on Tuesday analysing the death and injury data in Mumbai. After analysing 184 kilometres of roads in Mumbai, the crash analysis team found a consistent decrease in road traffic deaths between 2015 and 2019. With 447 people losing their lives in road crashes in Mumbai in 2019, there was a dip of 3% compared to 2018 statistics and a 47% dip compared to 2015 figures. The report found that 80% of victims of road deaths are males and 99% perpetrators of fatal crashes are also male. Most drivers involved in fatal accidents in 2019 were between the age group of 20-24 years.Dr Sara Whitehead, public health and preventive medicine consultant, Vital Strategies, said, “The continuous decrease in road traffic deaths from 2015 through 2019 is an impressive testament to the hard work of city officials and police in Mumbai. But too many Mumbaikars are still at risk of injury or death just by walking through the streets.”Most victims of fatal accidents fell in the age group of 30 to 59 years. In 2019, 90% of the city’s total road deaths were made up of pedestrians, cyclists and motorcycle riders. This group also made up 83% of the total injured in road crashes.Maximum fatalities were recorded on Ghatkopar Mahul Road and Balasaheb Thackeray flyover. The most vulnerable intersections with maximum road crash fatalities were Amar Mahal and Godrej junctions. Between 2017 and 2019, 25 people have died at Amar Mahal junction and 18 have died at Godrej junction. On weekdays, the peak hours of 7pm to 9pm saw the most injuries and deaths. During weekends, the riskiest time was between 10pm and 11pm.Mumbai Traffic Control Branch also released its report on road crash deaths in the city this year, from January to August. During this period, the city recorded a total of 172 fatalities, of which 47% were pedestrians. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) Yashasvi Yadav said, “We urge the people of Mumbai to drive at safe speeds, always wear helmets and seatbelts, and to never drink and drive.” Yadav said there are plans to implement intelligent traffic management systems to control traffic and reduce accidents in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/road-mishaps-killed-447-people-in-mumbai-last-year/story-tazdSuhgFRLuZ1TCQIQ5wK.html
25-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC proposes one-time regularisation scheme||A one-time regularisation policy for large-scale building violations in the rehabilitation colonies under the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) limits is on the cards. More than 4,300 allottees in the rehabilitation colonies in Vikas Nagar, Mauli Jagran and Sector 52-53 stand to gain from the regularisation scheme. As per the MC proposal, which is to be tabled before the general house meeting scheduled for November 27, all building violations will be regularised by the payment of one-time need-based charges to give relief to the residents. Also, the MC will stop issuing violation and resumption notices to the residents. The proposal is being brought after BJP councillors Anil Kumar Dubey and Chandrawati Shukla submitted a representation wherein they requested to make suitable changes in the policy and regularisation of building violations. Dubey and Shukla requested the MC to make suitable changes in the policy, regularise the building violations, and stop the issuance of notices. Questioning the timing of the proposal, Congress councillor and leader of opposition Devinder Singh Babla said, “For the last four years, the BJP didn’t care about the issue and now, with less than a year before MC election, they are introducing this selective agenda. Such a step should be for all rehabilitation colonies in the city. The agenda also doesn’t mention the rates for regularisation.” For the rehabilitation of economically weaker section (EWS) of society living in slums, scheme named “Licensing of Tenements and Sites and Services in Chandigarh” was introduced by the UT administration. In 1995, the work of rehabilitation of colonies was transferred to the MC. The number of transit sites at Vikas Nagar and Sector 52-53 are 4,300. Under this rehabilitation scheme, transit sites in Vikas Nagar, Mauli Jagran and Sector 52-53 were allotted in 1998by the UT estate office to residents of various slums during the year. As per survey conducted by the MC, it has been found that most of allottees have “violated the terms and conditions of allotment by constructing unauthorised structures, cantilevers, toilets, additional storeys in contravention of the approved plan”. Even though these sites were allotted for a period of five years, which was extendable for further five years each, the MC survey found that nearly 90% of the licensees have sold out the transit sites on general power of attorney in violation of the terms and conditions of the scheme. The MC has from time to time issued violation notices to the allottees of the rehabilitation colonies. “But it is difficult to root out all the illegal occupants and cancel or resume the transit sites,” states the MC report. As per allotment conditions, each licensee is liable to pay monthly rent. It has been fixed at ₹244 per month for the period from 2018to 2023. In 1998, UT had allowed that in case of licensee’s death, a fresh licence be created in favour of the spouse, and in case of his/her death, in favour of surviving heirs provided that such prospective new licensee is already actually residing in the premises. In 2010, the administration allowed use of ground floor of the premises allotted under different rehabilitation schemes in different parts of Chandigarh for opening commercial spaces – boutique, beauty parlour, mobile repair, barber, stationery or electric shops. Rampant violations90% of the licensees have sold out the transit sites on general power of attorney.Flouting of the terms and conditions of allotment by opening of illegal commercial establishments.

25-11-2020||City||Farmers in Delhi haven’t got stubble solution yet, alleges BJP||New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Delhi unit chief Adesh Gupta on Tuesday alleged none of Delhi’s farmers had received the Pusa bio-decomposer, which the Delhi government claims to have distributed free of cost to cultivators in the capital’s rural belt to convert stubble into manure. Gupta said the Kejriwal government was patting its back for spraying a bio-decomposer, developed by the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), in the farmlands of Delhi, which will convert stubble into manure without having to burn it, but it was just a delusion as farmers hadn’t received its benefit. The BJP leader made these allegations after visiting villages in the Narela and Bawana assembly constituencies along with the leader of opposition in Delhi Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and other party leaders. The BJP leaders visited Ghoga, Daryapur, Harevali, Nagal, Bazipur and Majra Dabas villages.It could not be determined, however, if the leaders had visited the spots where the government has used the compound on an experimental basis.The Delhi government did not respond to repeated calls and messages for a comment.“During our visit, farmers exposed the lies of the (Arvind) Kejriwal government and said they did not receive any bio-decomposer, which turns Parali into fertilisers. Kejriwal government has installed huge hoardings in other states to propagate that farmers in Delhi are getting medicine to make fertilisers from paddy stubble, which is reducing pollution, which is not the truth,” Gupta said.Gupta said that during the visit, he found fields full of paddy stubble, which is causing a delay in sowing of wheat.The Delhi government has said that scientists of the Pusa Institute have developed a bio-decomposer solution that can convert stubble into manure.Leader of opposition Bidhuri alleged he had raised the plight of farmers in Delhi in an all-party meeting with the chief minister but he “did not pay attention to it”. “The Delhi Government is doing politics in the name of farmers. It is not making fertilisers from paddy stubble anywhere in Delhi. Kejriwal government is registering a case against farmers and fining Rs 50,000 for Parali burning,” Bidhuri said.The Delhi government had last month tied up with researchers of IARI to spray this bio-decomposer free of cost in the farmlands of Delhi, so that farmers do not have to set their fields on fire to get rid of the stubble. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday said they have submitted a report to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), stating the effectiveness of this bio-decomposer. “We have asked the commission to extend the benefits of this product to other agrarian states where stubble burning is a major problem, because of which air pollution becomes a recurrent problem in Delhi,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-in-delhi-haven-t-got-stubble-solution-yet-alleges-bjp/story-71pP8CnJXUdcS6gtC0ugcK.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt asks Centre to use bio-decomoposer in Punjab, Haryana||Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday urged the Centre’s Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to consider the use of the bio-decomoposer technology developed by Pusa scientists to tackle the problem of continuing stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab. “A 15-member impact assessment committee has ascertained the effectiveness of the decomposer spray in turning stubble into compost and providing a solution to farmers in Delhi. The findings of the committee report have been submitted to the CAQM as well on Monday,” said Rai at a press conference. Rai said the bio-decomoposer used on 22,000 acres of land in Delhi turned 90% crop residue into manure within 15-20 days. Rai said that high pollution levels from stubble burning contributed to a spike in Covid-19 cases in the capital over the last 15 days. “The pollution situation has been critical in the city over the past many days. We need to find a permanent solution to this problem. We urge the CAQM to spray the bio-decomoposer solution in the states of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan considering its success in Delhi,” the minister said. He said the solution is cost-effective and has been provided to farmers free of cost. “The central government gives a subsidy to help farmers buy (stubble-cutting ) machines. But the farmers themselves are supposed to pay a major part. This is why the farmers avoid buying these machines and burn stubble. If all states follow the Delhi government’s model, then sprinkling of this stubble-burning solution can happen in half of what the central government spends in providing subsidies on the machines,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-asks-centre-to-use-bio-decomoposer-in-punjab-haryana/story-xoBJAXhIG16eLPrRVxhCgI.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||Diwali pollution this year higher than 2019: DPCC||Delhi’s overall pollution levels this Diwali were higher than last year, shows an analysis by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC).“All pollutants recorded much higher levels on Diwali (November 14) this year as compared to the same in 2019. Besides, a gradual rise in particulate matter (PM) concentrations were observed in the days preceding the festival,” the analysis stated. Delhi recorded an overall average AQI of 414 on Diwali day this year. Last year, it had recorded an average AQI of 337 on Diwali (October 27).Higher levels of PM 2.5 (the most harmful aerosols in Delhi’s air) and PM 10 (coarse dust particles) were reported this year at all 13 hot spots as compared to last year. Higher concentrations of pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (No2), all of which are harmful, were also seen this year compared to 2019, DPCC said.“Of all the hot spots, Jahangirpuri, Ashok Vihar and Rohini recorded the worst air quality. The PM 10 values here crossed 1000 µg/m3, 10 times above the permissible limit. Besides, these three stations recorded the highest PM 2.5 concentrations with levels as high as 900 µg/m3. The levels peaked for around three hours at all the three hot spots,” the report said.According to Indian standards, the 24-hour average permissible limits for PM 2.5 and PM 10 are 60µg/m3 and 100µg/m3, respectively. Among the hot spots, the lowest PM 2.5 concentrations were found at Punjabi Bagh, Dwarka and Wazirpur while the lowest PM 10 concentrations were seen at Dwarka, Narela and Okhla, it said.Delhi’s overall average PM 2.5 levels on Diwali this year were almost 20 times higher than the prescribed safe limit. The concentrations ranged from 274µg/m3 to 1131 µg/m3 as compared to last year’s 58 µg/m3 to 1070 µg/m3.The PM 10 levels shot up by more than 14 times with the average concentration ranging from 392 µg/m3 to 1408 µg/m3. In 2019, it ranged between 149µg/m3 and 1391µg/m3.“For both PM 10 and 2.5, the levels peaked at midnight for about three hours while the highest concentration for both was observed at Ashok Vihar. Here, the PM 2.5 levels spiked to 2939µg/m3 while PM 10 levels rose to 3320µg/m3,” the report said.There was also a rise in the levels of noise pollution. “The noise levels were monitored at 26 locations. The noise levels ranged from 51 dB at Najafgarh to 81.5 dB at Jahangirpuri. On a normal day, the levels here range from 45.5 dB to 68.6dB,” it said.But when compared to the past five years, the years 2017 and 2018 recorded worse air than in 2019 and 2020, the analysis says, without elaborating further. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) too in its Diwali pollution analysis earlier this month had said that the overall pollution levels this year were higher than last year. The apex pollution watchdog attributed the high levels this year to bursting of firecrackers and a higher share of stubble burning coinciding with unfavourable meteorological conditions during the festival season. According to CPCB’s analysis, the share of stubble burning in the city’s PM 2.5 levels this year was 32%, as compared to 19% last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/diwali-pollution-this-year-higher-than-2019-dpcc/story-PnfO5nvWr7CeRFqKqJiLgL.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||In Delhi riots charge sheet, police claim outsiders launched Shaheen Bagh||Delhi Police have alleged that JNU students had started the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest at Shaheen Bagh and that in the initial days of the sit-in demonstration, those who occupied the roads were not local residents. The police have claimed in a supplementary charge sheet filed in the conspiracy to trigger communal riots in Delhi in which the investigating agency has named Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam. While Khalid has passed out of JNU, Imam was a student of the university when he was arrested. In the charge sheet, filed on Sunday in the Karkardooma court, the special cell alleged that Imam and his accomplices had distributed pamplets, mobilised clerics from nearby mosques and made announcements. As evidence against Imam, who police have charged as one of the main conspirators, police have attached scanned copy of details of a meeting held on December 15, 2019 at an eatery inside JNU. This was the day when violence broke out near Jamia Millia Islamia campus. The scanned copy of what police claim were “minutes of the meeting” show how the core committee members of the Muslim Students of JNU spoke about roping in Bhim Army and visiting Deoband as part of the mobilising protesters. The chief of the Bhim Army Chandrashekhar has been named in the violence at Daryaganj on December 20 during an anti-CAA protest. The police, in their 1000-page charge sheet has termed Umar Khalid as the mentor of Imam. “Sharjeel Imam was an active participant in events and occasions observed within the JNU campus and was well received for his oratorical skills. Umar Khalid, his mentor, had a special interest in Sharjeel Imam. The religious fantacism of Sharjeel coupled with his academic legacy and sharp rhetorical skills was just the perfect combination that Umar Khalid was looking to exploit to execute the lessons that he learnt from his attempted seditious uprising in JNU in 2016,” the charge sheet read.The agency also said though he is “deeply communal”, Khalid pretends to be an atheist.The police also alleged in the charge sheet that on 27 December 2019, Imam held a meeting with conspirators at a private residence close to the Shaheen Bagh protest site.“The extremist and communal stance taken by Sharjeel Imam had yielded rich dividends and Shaheen Bagh chakka jaam was being projected nationally and internationally as a site of democratic resistance against the government of India which was being allegedly portrayed as anti-Muslim by the accused,” the charge sheet read.The police also said that Khalid “with his intellectual acumen, knew very well that a large majority of Indian Muslims will never subscribe to the perverted definition of Islam being espoused by his disciple Sharjeel Imam, and no amount of rhetoric and obfuscation of facts will be enough to brainwash the Indian Muslims into actually believing that CAA would question their nationality”.Quoting witness named as Helium in the charge sheet, the police claimed that the witness had said that he attended a protest called at Jantar Mantar on 10 February 2020, where he was introduced to Umar Khalid and his father SQR Ilyas. At the protest, Khalid told him that he should mobilise the Bangladeshi immigrants and the Rohingyas who live in Jahangirpuri and urge them to fight against the CAA. The police said that it was not a surprise that on 23 February 2020, while Khalid was away from Delhi, women from Jahangir Puri had travelled about 60 kms over the day to reach Jafrabad to be received by arrested accused Devangna Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Guifisha Fatima and who took on the deployed police forces by use of chilli powder, crushed glass bottles and stones which led to the riots.Umar Khalid’ counsel Trideep Pais had said that though his client was against the idea of the new Citizenship law; and that he(Khalid) was not ashamed of it, Khalid was not involved in any violence of the conspiracy of the riots.Sharjeel Imam’s lawyer has also denied all the allegations and charges as baseless.Delhi Police have been criticised by many student activists and civil society groups of targeting anti-government voices by arresting them for riot cases. Police have been accused of arresting prominent anti-CAA voices for the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-delhi-riots-charge-sheet-police-claim-outsiders-launched-shaheen-bagh/story-3TxDuzaN7Utl5kqLGquVYK.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||At 109, Delhi records over 100 Covid-19 deaths for fifth consecutive day||Delhi registered over 100 Covid-19 deaths a day for the fifth consecutive day on Tuesday, with the national capital recording 109 deaths, taking the toll to 8,621, as per the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government. Delhi also reported 6,224 new cases on Tuesday. On Monday, Delhi saw 4,454 cases and 121 deaths.Even so, the Delhi government claimed that the city’s death rate was “the lowest among major cities”. “Delhi has the least fatality ratio among all major cities in India. Rapid addition of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and other medical facilities have helped us achieve this. We are doing our best to save each and every life,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a tweet. Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe data attached in the tweet mentions that Delhi’s case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – stood at 1.6%, and comparing it to states with the highest CFR -- Ahmedabad with 4.2%, Ludhiana with 4%, and Mumbai with 3.9%. As per the data shared by the minister, Delhi was 15th on a list of cities with the highest mortality. Of the total number of deaths, 2,110 have been reported in November alone when Delhi saw its third surge in Covid-19 cases. So far, the highest number of deaths in a single day was 131, reported on November 18, and the highest number of cases in a day was 8,593, reported on November 11. On Monday, Jain had said the number of deaths is likely to go down over the next two weeks, as well as the number of cases and claimed that the positivity rate was already going down. “Death rate usually follows the curve of the number of cases and it should start coming down in the next two weeks,” he had said in the press briefing. On average, Delhi has reported 6,423 new cases a day during the last seven days, as compared to an average of 7,436 cases on average last week (if the number of cases on Diwali and the day after are not considered when fewer tests had been conducted.) The average positivity rate has dropped from 13.5% last week to 11.7 this week, as per the data. Experts say that the spread of infection is under control when a positivity rate of 5% or less and is maintained at that for at least two weeks. The number of hospitalisations has also started declining over the past two days. After reaching the peak of 9,522 patients being admitted to city hospitals on November 21, the number has reduced to 9,367 on Tuesday. The Delhi government has been working on increasing intensive care unit beds in its hospitals as well as private ones. The government had ordered its hospitals to add 663 ICU beds last week. On Tuesday, the government said that it had ordered 1,200 BiPap or Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure machines. “We are in the process of increasing the number of ICU beds that are either equipped with a ventilator – which can also be used in Bipap mode – or with high flow nasal cannula. The Bipap machines will help us in doing so,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital, Delhi’s biggest Covid treatment centre. Dr BL Sherwal, medical director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital, said, “Not only will these Bipap machines help us in increasing the current bed strength of 663, but will also prepare us for the future. Because of low temperatures and high levels of pollution, the cases may go up again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/at-109-delhi-records-over-100-covid-19-deaths-for-fifth-consecutive-day/story-JV5zsgLMDR43vzHBLK9ZgJ.html

If this is the Bharatiya Janata Party’s strategy to pressurise the Shiv Sena, then they need to change it. Today you are in power, tomorrow we will come, what will happen then,” he asked. He, however, maintained that he would cooperate with the Central agency, if summoned. According to Sarnaik, ED questioned his son Vihang over their connections with TOPSGRUP, a security service provider company owned by Rahul Nanda. Also read: ED raids Shiv Sena MLA’s properties, questions son in money-laundering probe against security firm“I spoke to Vihang over the phone. He was asked if the owners of TOPSGRUP and we have any financial relation. We are not connected. We know them as a security agency.

Vihang was also questioned about use of credit card for purchases in Macau or bank accounts in America for business purposes. He told them they are on record with the income tax department,” he said. The Sena legislator added that he expects such attacks on him after he took on BJP in the past few months. “The day I moved a privilege motion against Kangana Ranaut and Arnab Goswami, and spoke to reopen Anvay Naik case, I knew what would happen. I am a Shiv Sainik and a fighter who has reached this far. Uddhavsaheb has made me the spokesperson to put forward the party’s views. Today they told him [Vihang] your father speaks a lot on Kangana Ranaut and Arnab Goswami. I will continue to speak wherever Mumbai, Maharashtra or its police are maligned. I have done nothing wrong in my business,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-mla-sarnaik-after-ed-raid-have-done-no-wrong/story-XHY6fNJEUDsGmQZDqvtpnL.html
25-11-2020||Chandigarh||Housing scheme: Chandigarh employees reject admn’s proposals||Representatives of Chandigarh employees on Tuesday in a letter to the UT adviser rejected the two fresh proposals of the administration under the UT Employees Self-financing Housing Scheme. Two housing proposals — a seven-storey project and a mix of seven and eleven-storey projects — were discussed in a meeting chaired by UT adviser Manoj Parida with employees’ representatives Dharmender Shastri, Balwinder Singh and Brahmprakash Yadav on November 17. The letter stated, “Finding the rates not viable and acceptable the successful employees have shown their inability to accept the same being beyond their reach.” Addressing the adviser, the letter further stated, “You are requested to reconsider the rates of land and construction prices keeping in view the concerns and interest of the allottees who are employees of Chandigarh administration, and also considering the spirit of the scheme so that orders passed by the high court from time to time, are obeyed in letter and spirit. Around 4,000 flats were to be built in Sectors 52, 53 and 56 by the Chandigarh Housing Board for government employees as part of a scheme launched in 2008. The project comprised 252 3BHK flats with servant quarters, 168 2BHK with servant quarters, 3,066 1BHK and 444 single-room flats. A draw of lots was held in 2010, in which 3,930 employees among 7,827 applicants were selected. They had then deposited around ₹57 crore with the CHB under the scheme. Later, the scheme was shelved and then revived after the employees took up the matter with MP Kirron Kher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/housing-scheme-chandigarh-employees-reject-admn-s-proposals/story-N8J2m069RL1EG4gudyof4O.html

25-11-2020||Delhi||AAP accuses civic bodies of burdening public with taxes and giving waivers to contractors||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations in Delhi (MCDs) of corruption and causing stress to people by increasing the property tax, especially at a time when they were struggling to recover from the economic impact of the nationwide lockdown and the pandemic.The BJP dismissed the allegations and said no property tax was increased during the current fiscal and all decisions were taken in accordance with laws and policies.“On the one hand, the BJP-ruled MCDs have doubled commercial property tax and, on the other hand, they are bringing in schemes to give illegal favours to contractors. This is outright corruption. This has been done in south MCD. Now it is going to happen in North MCD also,” said the AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj in a press conference.He further said, “Now the BJP-ruled MCD is bringing in a proposal to increase residential property tax by 34% in all categories. They have already increased taxes on commercial properties several times. But the same MCDs are forgoing the fee charged on parking contractors and advertisement contractors. Such policies have contributed to the stress of the common people who are struggling to recover from the financial shock of the nationwide lockdown.”Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “None of the three MCDs has increased any property tax rates for the general public or even traders during the current financial year. Only commercial property tax was slightly increased, as directed by the municipal valuation committee. On Monday, Saurabh Bhardwaj had himself said why are MCDs not increasing tax and keeping a check on commercially rented properties and, surprisingly, today, he is objecting to his own demand.”“The waiver given to advertising agencies and parking contractors was done as per the central government policy to allow relief to government contractors for the four months of the lockdown period. Even the Delhi government has given similar relief to several categories of traders,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-accuses-civic-bodies-of-burdening-public-with-taxes-and-giving-waivers-to-contractors/story-90miYhPXfeHkOl9yDNdMTJ.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: West, north districts with crowded markets saw most mask-rule violation in festive season||The most number of mask rule violations this festive season was reported from west and north Delhi districts of the national capital, show police data, unlike the month before that, when the most number of such violations was reported from south and south-west Delhi. In light of the data review, Delhi Police officers said the two districts have a larger number of much-favoured markets, such as Sadar Bazaar and Kamla Nagar, and these marketplaces had seen huge crowds since Dussehra till Diwali.According to the data seen by HT, between October 23 (two days before Dussehra) and November 10 (four days before Diwali), police fined 5,018 persons in west Delhi for violating the mask rule, while they fined 4,991 persons in north Delhi. South and south-west Delhi reported 4741 and 2163 instances, respectively, during the same period.Overall, until November 24, police had fined 506, 272 persons across Delhi for not wearing masks. North district comprises marketplaces such as Kamla Nagar, Maurice Nagar and Sadar Bazaar and until two months ago, this district did not figure in the top three or four districts with the maximum number of violations as people were mostly avoiding crowded places, and also, the Covid-19 vigil was more heightened in public places. The same was the case with west Delhi that houses markets such as Tilak Nagar and Rajouri Garden, police said.But all that changed when the festive season approached. A senior police officer, who wished not to be named, said, “West and north topped the list during the recent review period as they have a number of bust markets. Markets such as Tilak Nagar and Rajouri Garden in west Delhi saw huge crowds in the days before Diwali. In north Delhi, too, Sadar Bazaar and Kamla Nagar were alarmingly crowded. At one point, our officers on the ground were outnumbered by the massive crowd.” As predicted by government agencies, the increase in Delhi’s Covid-19 deaths and daily positive cases has coincided with the festive season, when more people had stepped out of homes and were casual in their adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour. To ensure that people comply with the mask rule, the Delhi government last Friday increased the penalty for mask rule violations from ₹500 to ₹2,000. The district-wise police’s prosecution data shows that between June 15 (the day when police started issuing fines) and November 10, the west district has topped the list with 53,970 violations, followed by south district with 51,476. Between June 15 and July 3 -- when the data was reviewed for the first time by senior police officers to understand the pattern of violations -- it was the south-west district that had topped the list with 2,699 violations. North district was then ranked fifth, while west Delhi was 11th. Commenting on people not following rules in Sadar Bazaar Market -- the photographs of the crowded market had gone viral on social media -- Devraj Baweja, president, Confederation of Sadar Bazaar Trader Association, said, “There were encroachments on roads and lanes due to which there was little space available for shoppers. Even so, the crowds were excessive during the festival. The casual attitude of the public towards the pandemic also resulted in violations. We are now ensuring that such violations do not happen. The encroachments have been removed and shoppers are told to wear masks before entering the market.” While the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had on October 8 warned that Delhi could report 15,000 daily cases during the festive season, the cases reached a maximum of 8,593 on November 11. Delhi is currently reporting between 5,000 and 7,500 new cases daily. The state government had called the rise in cases as the third wave of the virus infection and asked people to wear masks and maintain social distancing. On Tuesday, Delhi saw 6,224 new Covid-19 cases, and 109 deaths. In west Delhi, Ramesh Khanna, president, Rajouri Garden Market Traders Association, said the association has been donating masks to shoppers. “We have deployed security guards in the market to conduct random inspections and urge people to wear their masks properly. We ensure that every shop has sanitisers and shopkeepers also keep extra masks handy. We have made all arrangements,” .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/west-north-districts-with-crowded-markets-saw-most-mask-rule-violation-in-festive-season/story-f1iiFiY5f6777xoG46QFaJ.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal asks Modi to reserve 1,000 ICU beds in central hospitals||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reserve 1,000 ICU beds in central government hospitals in Delhi for Covid-19 patients even as he expressed concerns over the rising mortality rate and pointed out air pollution caused by stubble burning in neighbouring states as a contributing factor to the severity of the “third wave” in the Capital.The Prime Minister held a high-level Covid-19 review meeting on Tuesday with chief ministers of all states on Tuesday, with special emphasis on eight high focus states, including Delhi. “CM Arvind Kejriwal said that there is a sufficient number of non-ICU Covid beds available in Delhi, but there is a shortage of ICU beds. He appealed to the PM to reserve 1,000 ICU beds in the central government hospitals located in the city for Delhiites. CM Arvind Kejriwal said that the third wave of Covid-19 in Delhi peaked on 10 November with 8,600 positive cases, but now the positivity rate is constantly declining. The pollution from stubble burning in the neighbouring states has been a significant contributor in making the third wave of corona [Covid-19] more dangerous,” the CM’s office said in a press statement.Also Read | States must start working on cold storage facilities for Covid-19 vaccine, says PM Modi at meeting with chief ministersKejriwal is learnt to have told the PM that out of the total ICU beds available across Delhi, around 3,500 ICU beds are occupied and 724 ICU beds are vacant. He appreciated Union home minister Amit Shah’s intervention in this regard as “supportive” and pointed out how Delhi had scaled up tests from around 20,000 per day to 60,000 per day between June and September – the period between the first two waves of Covid-19 in the Capital.“But the rising mortality rate is a matter of concern and we have to reduce the mortality rate. We hope that the mortality rate will also reduce along with the declining positivity ratio in the coming days,” the statement quoted Kejriwal saying in the meeting.“CM Arvind Kejriwal further said that several factors were instrumental in making the third wave of corona [Covid-19] in Delhi more dangerous, increased pollution levels in Delhi recently played a big role. The pollution from stubble burning in the neighbouring states has been one of the major reasons. The Delhi government has recently induced a solution to the issue of stubble burning with the help of the Pusa Agricultural Institute. The government has used the bio-decomposer technology developed by Pusa Institute across the farmlands in Delhi, which has converted the straw on the fields into manure,” according to the statement.The chief minister also sought the intervention of the Prime Minister to resolve the issue of stubble burning with the help of bio-decomposer technology. He said, “We want that under your leadership, the Chief Ministers of Delhi, Punjab, and Haryana should work together as a team to eliminate stubble burning,” the statement said.Later in the day, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain posted some data on Twitter, saying that Delhi has the lowest case fatality ratio (at 1.6%) compared to Chennai, Pune, Surat, Thane, Kolkata, Kanpur, Nagpur, Howrah, Patiala, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Mumbai, Ludhiana and Ahmedabad. Jain tweeted, “Delhi has least fatality ratio amongst all major cities in India. Rapid addition of ICU beds and other medical facilities have helped us achieve this. We are doing our best to save each and every life..”Delhi reported 121 Covid-19 deaths on Monday -- the fourth consecutive day that the fatalities remained over 100. The number of deaths has shot up over the fortnight, with 114 people dying on average each day during this week, as compared to 93 the week before and 65 the week before that. The seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) – number of deaths among those who test positive — is inching closer to 2%. It stood at 1.84% as per data shared in Monday’s health bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-asks-modi-to-reserve-1-000-icu-beds-in-central-hospitals/story-ZsX0Qm945flAbBQ4qlLAhM.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death case: NDPS court grants bail to two alleged drug peddlers||The special court under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on Tuesday granted bail to two alleged peddlers Ankush Arneja and Suryadeep Malhotra, booked in connection with a drug case linked to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.Arneja was arrested on September 14 in connection with the case. Malhotra was arrested the next day, based on the Arneja’s statement in which he had claimed to have supplied drugs to Malhotra. As per NCB’s case, Arneja had supplied drugs to several accused, including Kshitij Prasad. It is alleged that Arenja is “running a kitchen in a plush area of Mumbai and selling narcotics substances like weed, hash and mephedrone or MD to high profile individuals”. Malhotra, a close friend of Showik Chakraborty, was allegedly providing drugs to Rajput. The lawyer for the two accused, Taraq Sayyed, had argued that the case is based on the statement of a co-accused, and was therefore invalid. It was alleged that their names cropped up in the interrogation of other drug peddlers, and they were arrested, based on those statements. Sayyed relied on the recent verdict of the Supreme Court (SC), which held that the confession statement of a co-accused, given before the investigating officer, cannot be taken as substantial evidence against the other accused. Considering this, the court granted bail to the two accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-ndps-court-grants-bail-to-two-alleged-drug-peddlers/story-rwUoFSgI0YbBK0lzVkUwFI.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||If everything else is open, then why not spas, HC asks Delhi govt||The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought to know from the Delhi government as to “what was so special about spas that they are not being allowed to open its services in the city”, even though everything else -- markets, gyms, restaurants, Metro and buses -- was operational. The Centre,in a notification of November 18, had said it did not have problems with the opening of spas.Reiterating this, the Union government, through its advocate Anjana Gosain, told justice Navin Chawla that it has no objection if the spas are reopened, with the staff adhering to Covid-19 rules and norms. The Delhi government, however, informed the court that it was not going allow spas to reopen as Covid-19 cases were rising in the city.“Why only spas? What is so special about spas? You have opened everything else. Look at markets, restaurants, Metros, buses, all are open and running full time,” the judge said.On oral instructions, advocate Anjum Javed, additional standing counsel, Delhi government, said the services are not likely to reopen and sought time from the court to file an affidavit in this regard. The court was hearing a plea moved by various spa owners which have been shut since March 25, when the nationwide lockdown was first announced. In their plea, the owners contended they have been trained as professional therapists under the National Skills Development Mission launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.They said when most businesses, such as salons, gyms, restaurants and bars, have been granted permission to reopen and even the Delhi Metro has restarted, then spas too should be allowed to open.The petitioners have claimed that the spas in other states are running with safety measures, but are not permitted in Delhi. The matter would be now heard on December 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/if-everything-else-is-open-then-why-not-spas-hc-asks-delhi-govt/story-v3JvpADjfQnaIZZE4pcANO.html

25-11-2020||Delhi||Schools are unlikely to reopen until we have Covid-19 vaccine: Sisodia||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said schools in the national capital are unlikely to reopen until “we have the Covid-19 vaccine”. Schools have remained shut in Delhi since March in view of the pandemic situation and classes are being conducted online. The Delhi government last month announced that all schools in the city will remain closed till further notice. “Until there is some vaccine, schools are not likely to reopen in Delhi...Parents won’t send their kids to schools until they are assured that they will be safe,” he said. Sisodia, who is also the deputy chief minister of Delhi, said the government will consult all the stakeholders before taking any decision on reopening schools. “We are regularly consulting parents and they are concerned about the safety of their children.”Delhi has recorded a surge in Covid-19 cases and fatalities in November with both the maximum number of daily cases and deaths being reported this month. On October 28, Sisodia, during a press conference, had said, “Reports suggest that wherever schools were reopened, an increase in the number of cases was observed in those countries. The chief minister [Arvind Kejriwal] and I have thought this through even as parents and whether we would be willing to expose our kids to such a risk. This is why we have decided that all schools in the national capital will remain closed until further orders.”Principals said that parents are not in favour of reopening schools. “Although we are worried about the students who are not being able to attend online classes due to lack of devices and internet connectivity, we think that it’s still not the time to reopen schools. Parents are also worried about the safety of their students. Even teachers are scared of their safety. Let the situation normalise in Delhi before taking any decision on this,” said AK Jha, head of school at Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/schools-are-unlikely-to-reopen-until-we-have-covid-19-vaccine-sisodia/story-NMCwWDGsvb5w3eNTZFJOPL.html
25-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Five years on, CBI files chargesheet against four in forgery case||Nearly two years after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court refused to accept the closure report, the investigating agency has filed a chargesheet against four persons for allegedly forging documents to get a bank loan to purchase a property in Sector 9.The case dates back to 2015, when as per CBI, a case of forgery and cheating was registered by the Chandigarh Police on the complaint of city resident Deepa Duggal against GS Chawla (now deceased), his wife, Jagjeet Kaur, their son, HS Chawla, two relatives GS Bhatti and Sarabjit Singh at Sector 17 police station. There were allegations that all five forged documents to get a bank loan of Rs 6.25 crores for a property being sold by Deepa Duggal in Sector 9, Chandigarh.At the same time, a counter case was registered by Chawla against Deepa Duggal at Sector 3 police station, alleging that she concealed the facts of the property.Later, the cases were investigated by the CBI, which in 2018 submitted the closure reports in both the complaints.In December 2018, the court accepted the closure report filed in the case against Deepa Duggal, however, the CBI court refused to accept the closure report in the case against Chawlas.Pointing out discrepancies, the court had directed the CBI to conduct further investigation into the matter.On Tuesday, the investigating agency submitted the chargesheet filed against four persons including Jagjeet Kaur, her son HS Chawla, relatives Gurcharan Singh and Sarabjit Singh. GS Chawla had died this year, hence his name was not mentioned in the chargesheet.The chargesheet has been filed under Sections 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document as genuine), and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.The case is now listed for November 25.2015 graft caseIn 2015, GS Chawla’s daughter Guneet Kaur has filed another case alleging that the economic offences wing (EOW) officials were demanding Rs 40 lakh for settling the case.In the same year, CBI laid a trap and arrested former DSP EOW RC Meena, along with sub-inspector Surinder Kumar Bhardwaj, two businessmen, Aman Grover, owner of KLG Hotel and Sanjay Dahuja, owner of Berkeley Automobiles, for allegedly accepting the bribe on behalf of the police officials.The case is going on in the special court of CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/five-years-on-cbi-files-chargesheet-against-four-in-forgery-case/story-DpgHreFFuLL4ivfyvZ6eWN.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||After video goes viral, woman who shot at shuttered shop in north-east Delhi arrested||Delhi police on Monday arrested a 28-year-old woman for allegedly opening fire at a grocery shop last Wednesday. The video of the woman firing the shots in north-east Delhi’s Chauhan Bangar area and loudly abusing someone (the person is not seen in the video) was widely shared on social media after the incident. Investigation has revealed that she had bought the pistol from one of her contacts in Loni, Ghaziabad, to frighten the shop owner. Police have identified the arrested woman as Nusrat (only by her first name), who lives in Chauhan Bangar with her second husband. Police said the woman, a homemaker, does not have any previous criminal record. According to the police, on November 18, a call was received at Jafrabad police station reporting that multiple gunshots have been fired in lane number four of Chauhan Bangar area. A police team reached the spot, found that four rounds had been fired at the shutter of a closed grocery shop.During inquiry, police found that the shop belonged to one Fahim, who also lives in the same area. With the help of CCTV footage and local inquiries, it was found that the person who had fired the shots was a woman clad in a burqa.“Further inquiries helped us identify her and she was arrested following a search. She was booked for illegal possession of arms and under other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. During questioning, the woman told us that a man known to her, Shahrukh, 25, had mortgaged his cellphone with the grocery shop owner some time ago and the shop owner was not returning the phone. When she went to ask for Shahrukh’s phone, Fahim refused to hand it over and this sparked a heated argument between the woman and the shop owner,” said a senior police officer, adding that this happened a few days before the day of shooting (November 18). Nusrat returned home, but to take revenge, she arranged for a pistol from one Maksood, in Loni, Ghaziabad, with the help of a person named Irfan. “She said Irfan also took her to Fahim’s shop in Chauhan Bangar on November 18 on his motorcycle and she fired at the shuttered shop. Irfan also helped her flee the spot after the shooting. Nusrat said she later handed over the pistol to Irfan,” the officer quoted above said.Deputy commissioner of police (north-east) Ved Prakash Surya said while Nusrat has been arrested, information is being gathered about Irfan. “Multiple teams have been formed and searches are underway to arrest him and recover the pistol,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-video-goes-viral-woman-who-shot-at-shuttered-shop-in-north-east-delhi-arrested/story-jZPsTOmihXizbBKZZhyuEL.html

Akhtar and Haque were arrested following a raid in Gurugram. Their third associate Jabaar is absconding,” Arya said.The DCP said four mobiles phones and two laptops recovered from the two men were being checked by forensic experts to track other victims. The duo said they used to create intimate pictures of women and then sent these to their targets, demanding money for not uploading them on the internet.Arya said his team has managed to contact another woman based in Allahabad, who also works with an airline. She had also filed a similar complaint against the two men.“Akhtar told police he was terminated from his private job at an online loan-providing firm during the lockdown, after which he started misusing company data to reach out to its women customers. At least 45 men and women who were targeted by the duo have been traced. Their bank account from which Rs 12 lakh of extorted amount was recovered, has been frozen and further investigation is in progress,” Arya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-held-for-morphing-photos-of-women-blackmailing-them/story-D7eHthNXH9KBMrAKGHjMHJ.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray seeks PM’s intervention to halt ‘politicisation’ of Covid-19 by BJP in Maharashtra||During his meeting with Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray took a dig at the former’s party in the state for taking to the streets over opening up of temples and other issues. The CM said that the “politicisation” may jeopardise the efforts to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Thackeray participated in a video conference convened by the PM to take stock of the Covid-19 pandemic situation in the eight states with highest cases on Tuesday morning. Thackeray, without naming the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), requested the PM to “tame some of the political parties” who have been playing with the lives of people by resorting to the agitations on roads. He said that the PM should instruct these political parties not to play politics amid the global pandemic. “The Prime Minister or the Union home minister should convene a joint meeting of all political parties to deliberate with them about the seriousness of the pandemic. The parties should be asked to cooperate with the state government. Following the protocols set by the Centre, we have been appealing to people to follow Covid-19 protocol by maintaining distance and wear masks but a few political parties have been resorting to [gathering] on the streets with the intention of gaining political mileage out of the challenge. This could ruin our efforts and lead to the second wave of the infection,” Thackeray said.The CM was referring to the state unit of the BJP which had taken to the streets demanding for the reopening of religious places and other issues including inflated electricity bills.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan made a presentation on the current scenario of Covid-19 cases across the country, with a focus of the eight states with the highest case count. The meeting was also attended by Union home minister Amit Shah. Thackeray told the PM that the daily caseload in the state has reduced to 4,700-5,000 cases from 24,000 in September. “When the cases in some of the states like Delhi, Haryana, West Bengal have increased, the decline in the cases in Maharashtra is high (76%). Our case fatality rate is indeed as high as 2.44, but we are trying to reduce it. We aim to bring the positivity rate below 5%, for which we have been aggressively testing and tracing suspected contacts. We have increased daily testing to around 80,000,” he said.Thackeray also apprised the PM of the Maharashtra government’s outreach programme “My Family, My Responsibility”, and said that it helped in tracing suspected contacts and people with comorbidities. He also said that patients with post-Covid-19 symptoms are being closely monitored by the authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-uddhav-thackeray-seeks-pm-s-intervention-to-halt-politicisation-of-covid-19-by-bjp-in-maharashtra/story-n0vsjZ5LI0Ll69XjKOIoBL.html

He had gunshot injuries to his forehead, police said.Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said Singh was shot by two men who approached him on a bike as soon as he got out of his car near his house while returning from a gurdwara.“Witnesses and locals told us the two men were wearing helmets. The pillion rider took out a pistol and shot Singh. As he collapsed, the duo sped away before onlookers could react. Visibly, Singh had one bullet wound to his head. However, his post-mortem reports are awaited to confirm this,” Purohit said.The CCTV footage that captured the shooting shows people walking on the road when Singh was shot. The bikers, both wearing helmets, are seen firing at him just as Singh exits the car. Police suspect the two may have been trailing him and are scanning other cameras on the road. A crime and forensics team has picked up clues from the spot for inspection. The DCP said Singh dealt in real estate and it is possible some recent property deal may have sparked enmity.“His deals are being looked into. We are speaking to his family and friends to know more. CCTV footage are being checked to identify the suspects or track the vehicle used in crime. A case of murder has been registered. His phone call records are being checked to find who all were in touch with him recently,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/70-year-old-property-dealer-shot-dead-in-vikaspuri/story-5UTWfZ6kEF8wzKxdmPQ7lL.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||Several last-minute additions to CPWD’s makeover plan for central secretariat buildings||The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) has submitted a conceptual plan for redeveloping the common central secretariat buildings and central conference centre along with the Prime Minister office and residence, Special Protection Group building and Vice-President Enclave -- all part of the Central Vista redevelopment project -- to the union environment ministry for environmental clearance.The masterplan submitted by the HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited, the Ahmedabad-based architecture firm tasked with the redevelopment project, proposed to consolidate all ministries into 11 central secretariat buildings that would be built on either side of the Rajpath. At present, the ministries are housed in various buildings such as Vayu Bhawan, Nirman Bhawan, Shashtri Bhawan and Rail Bhawan among others.The masterplan also proposed a central conference centre, Prime Minister office and residence, Special Protection Group building and Vice-President Enclave.These buildings were not part of the initial plan submitted by CPWD to the environment ministry, official documents suggest.The ministry’s expert appraisal committee will consider CPWD’s application to amend the terms of reference (TOR) for redeveloping the common central secretariat buildings, on Wednesday.The amendment application was made only a day after the environment ministry granted the TOR based on CPWD’s initial proposal to redevelop only the common central secretariat and central conference centre.The application has angered citizens groups about the alleged piecemeal approach in which the entire Central Vista project is being implemented.The application for amending the TOR, available on the Parivesh website and seen by HT, suggests that the Prime Ministers’ Office, Prime Minister’s residence, Vice-President enclave and Special Protection Group building have been added to the proposal. This had led to an increase in the built-up area from 1,754,057.35 sqm to 1,837,057.35 sqm and an uptick in waste water generation, municipal waste generation, increase of investment cost from Rs 11,038 crore to Rs 11,794 crore and other features of the area development project.The TOR is essentially the scope of the project. The grant of TOR is the initial clearance needed for any development project.“We can’t apply for environment clearance without land use change. All the buildings are individual projects. Therefore, we have to independently seek environment approval for them. Now that plans for other buildings are ready, we are in the process of getting necessary approvals,” said a senior CPWD official, requesting anonymity.Several citizens have requested the Chairman of the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), T Haque, to reject the application on the grounds that it is only a part of the larger Central Vista Redevelopment project but is being pursued in a piecemeal manner, leading to improper assessment of environmental impacts.Lt Col Anuj Srivastava (retired) of Lokpath, a citizen’s movement, wrote in his submission to Haque on November 24 that the ministry of housing and urban affairs and CPWD are being encouraged to resubmit their proposals associated with the project because of the leniency shown by the EAC on infrastructure projects.The EAC had granted environmental clearance to the Parliament building on June 17. The MoHUA and CPWD were granted TOR by EAC on November 10 and the next day, they applied for amendment with addition of other buildings, all part of the Central Vista project.Haque did not respond to HT’s queries on the project on Tuesday.A senior official of the ministry of housing and urban affairs said this is a procedural matter.“The government is constantly changing the contours of the CV redevelopment project in its applications for approvals and the Expert Appraisal Committee has not bothered to ask them any questions. All the important questions are raised by people watching this show of regulatory abetment since the time this project was announced. The Environment Ministry has basically allowed the CPWD and the Urban development Ministry to decide for themselves how and which environmental laws should be applied to this project,” said Manju Menon, senior fellow at Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/several-last-minute-additions-to-cpwd-s-makeover-plan-for-central-secretariat-buildings/story-L9n6mEQHc9t3CjLUh6sZPP.html

25-11-2020||Mumbai||ED raids Shiv Sena MLA’s properties, questions son in money-laundering probe against security firm||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Tuesday questioned Shiv Sena member of legislative Assembly (MLA) Pratap Sarnaik’s son, Vihang, for nearly five hours after raiding over 10 places, including Sarnaik’s properties, in Mumbai and Thane in connection with a money-laundering case linked to TOPSGRUP, a security service provider company owned by Rahul Nanda. The Central agency suspects that the MLA illegally pumped money into Nanda’s businesses. Tuesday’s raids set off another political storm with Sena and its allies — NCP and Congress — saying BJP was using Central agencies to disrupt the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.Sarnaik, who was not at his residence when the raids happened, was later seen coming out of Sena mouthpiece Saamana’s office in Parel, where he held an hour-long meeting with Sena MP Sanjay Raut. Sarnaik refused to comment on the ED raid or Vihang’s case. “Let me find out what has happened. So far, we do not have any details,” he said. Meanwhile, Nanda, in his statement, said, “This is ridiculous! Pratap is a very old friend and has not invested a single penny into my business or company ever! He or Sena has nothing to do with TOPS! This is absolutely absurd and this is again the mischief done by the [company’s] management who have tried to mislead the ED by making these irresponsible and ridiculous allegations!”ED sources said that their probe was based on an MECR (FIR) registered by Mumbai’s Yellow Gate police station on October 28 on the direction of the 16th Metropolitan Magistrate Court, against TOPSGRUP, Nanda and family members. Also read: MLA Pratap Sarnaik’s properties raided: Sena, Cong, NCP term it vendetta; BJP says not ED action not politically motivatedThe company’s managing director, Ramesh Ramakrishna Iyer, is a complainant in the case and who approached the court alleging Nanda’s involvement in unlawful activities, massive irregularities in the company, misappropriation of funds amounting to ₹175 crore and cheating the company’s employees, its shareholders, other government and private organisations with forged documents. The case was transferred to the Mumbai Police economic offences wing (EOW) for further investigation.Iyer, who has been managing director since 2006, said that he discovered diversion and misappropriation of funds by Nanda in 2009. Iyer alleged in the complaint (a copy of which is with HT) that in 2008, Nanda bought 51% of London-based The Shield Guarding Company Limited’s shares, for around ₹130 crore. This amount was allegedly taken from ICICI Ventures Limited and private share investors of Everstone Capital. Nanda allegedly inflated the total worth of his net assets since funds worth four times the value of one’s net assets may be sent abroad legally. “The investment companies, despite knowing this, invested in TOPSGRUP,” stated Iyer’s complaint, adding that Nanda diverted funds from The Shield and bought properties in London.Iyer has also alleged Nanda took loans against subsidiary companies of TOPSGRUP — including Tops Securities UK Limited and Topsgrup Holding BV in the Netherlands — and used the money to buy property in London, which is in violation of loan statutory rules. Nanda did not show the income earned from these properties in his income tax filings in India, said Iyer in his complaint.Iyer and company’s chief finance officer Amar Panaghal alleged that Nanda made a bogus balance sheet for the financial year of 2018-19 to use overdraft and cash credit facilities from Allahabad Bank (Prabhadevi branch) and Corporate Bank (Kalina branch). For this, he allegedly changed the statutory auditors, without the approval of shareholders.Iyer also alleged that in 2017, Nanda and his family transferred 66% of their shares in TOPSGRUP to a Mauritius-based Nanda family trust, which is in violation of the Private Securities Agencies (Regulations) Act.Commenting on the ED’s action and the allegations levelled against him, Nanda, said, “The ED had questioned us about our UK acquisition in 2009, which we have explained and we gave them evidence that everything was done 100% legally. They also questioned me about our trust in Mauritius, which again we have answered and told them that this was created legally by lawyers and that there is zero money in the Mauritius trust. This was all a mischief played by Ramesh [Iyer], Amar [Panaghal] and the coterie who complained to the ED and have sent them on a wild goose chase. We have written and told them [authorities] that all fund transfers done in 2009 was done 100% legally with all requisite legal and RBI permissions.Also read: Raided by ED, TOPSGRUP denies link with Shiv Sena MLA Sarnaik, partyIyer has denied all allegations levelled against him by Nanda, saying his complaint was registered after due verification of facts. Nanda, too, has submitted a police complaint against Iyer at the Khar police station some months back.Early on Tuesday, ED officials from Delhi and Mumbai jointly carried out raids at Sarnaik’s residences and office in Thane amid tight security. The ED detained Vihang for questioning and reached ED office by 3pm. The raids on Sarnaik’s property, including his houses and offices, began around 7.30am. Sarnaik represents the Ovala-Majiwada constituency from Thane and is a popular leader in Thane and the Mira-Bhayander belt of the Sena. Apart from politics, he also owns construction and hospitality businesses under the Vihang Group of Companies. Sources from ED said, “The raid first started at his residence in Basilius building in Rodas Enclave in Hiranandani Estate. His house on the 28th and 29th floor of the building was raided. The search here went on for over four hours.” The team later moved on to his other residence at Vasant Lawns in Majiwada and then his office at Dev Corpora building along the Eastern Express Highway. “The search was conducted at over 10 of his properties in Thane. Sarnaik’s elder son Vihang was questioned for over three hours at the Vasant Lawns residence. His younger son Purvesh and his wife were present during the questioning. Vihang was later taken to ED office in Ballard Estate in south Mumbai.” The team raided the properties amid tight security, along with BSF jawans and local police officers. Sarnaik and Purvesh had both switched off their phones and were unavailable for comment. Sarnaik, who was out of the country, later reached Mumbai after hearing about the raid and met senior Sena leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ed-raids-shiv-sena-mla-s-properties-questions-son-in-money-laundering-probe-against-security-firm/story-9oPK56X8aZVDOWA9jiO09H.html
25-11-2020||Pune||Covid clouds TB with fewer ‘reported’ cases, say Pune doctors||With the city in the grip of Covid, tuberculosis (TB), another respiratory ailment, has missed the spotlight with fewer cases being reported. The city saw less than 1,000 TB cases reported his year as compared to the previous year, not due to an improved situation, but because of lack of healthcare facilities or Covid-19 scare. Although Covid has caused more deaths in absolute number as compared to TB, the case fatality rate (CFR) of TB is 5.63% which for Covid is 2%. TB is another respiratory ailment which is also infectious, which raises questions on whether there is an underreporting of the cases and whether the patients got access to medical facilities. PM Narendra Modi launched a TB free India campaign in 2018 in which he said that the country would be free of TB by 2025. Under this campaign various initiatives were launched, including door-to-door survey and target to local authorities to detect TB cases based on population. However, this year, due to the Covid pandemic most hospitals had to be converted into dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and due to the scare people did not step out for their regular treatment. PMC assistant health chief and TB programme head Dr Vaishali Jadhav said, “We have seen a drop in the notifications from private hospitals because of the lockdown. Every city is given a target which we could not meet this year due to multiple reasons mainly Covid and lockdowns. Although we do get all TB patients who visit government hospitals notified, we do not get them from private hospitals.” Dr Sanjay Darade, district tuberculosis officer with Pune zilla parisahd said, “We have seen a drop of almost 40% of TB cases being reported this year. Due to Covid, we had to convert our rural hospitals and primary healthcare centres into dedicated Covid flu clinics or hospitals. We have reported about 167 deaths due to Covid this year.” TB causes millions of deaths in the country and is also highly infective. Dr Abhijit More, public health expert, said, “The pandemic has certainly put a lot of pressure on the government machinery and so the non-Covid ailment programmes have been affected, including TB. It is also true that 50% of TB patients take treatment in private hospitals and so notifications from private hospitals were not reported properly mainly as half of them were shut for most time of this year, while the other half became dedicated Covid hospitals. TB although does not spread as fast at Covid-19, but the proportion of people who lose lives due to TB vis-à-vis Covid, then TB is definitely more fatal.” With over 4,600 deaths out of 1.67 lakh cases, Covid CFR is around 2.75% which means 2.75 people died due to Covid for every 100 infected people while TB reported a CFR of about 5.63% deaths for every 100 TB infected people. The district administration will now kick-start their annual campaign to detect the “hidden” TB cases through their door-to-door survey. Dr Darade said, “We will start the campaign by December 1 to December 16 during which we will cover 100% of the population in rural areas and 30% of the population in city areas and from December 17-31, we will focus on treatment and follow-up of patients.” A welcome sign Drop in TB cases reported by PMC from Pune city in 2020 2015: 4,465 2016: 5,074 2017: 5,401 2018: 6,171 2019: 6,632 In 2020, as of November 24, 5,074 TB cases have been notified from both private (36) and public (189) hospitals and 286 deaths recorded in Pune city which takes the case fatality rate due to TB to about 5.63% Deaths due to TB from January- November 24, 2020 Drug Sensitive TB: Public - 45 Private - 225 Total = 270 Drug Resistant TB Public- 13 Private - 3 Total = 16||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-clouds-tb-with-fewer-reported-cases/story-xXO8Ve5qyPnRHQgYtGWzBP.html
25-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt gives nod to transplant 400 trees for new Parliament||The Delhi government has approved the transplantation of 400 trees for the building of the new Parliament. The process is underway and uprooting of trees has already started, said officials of the Delhi government’s environment and forest department. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai’s office on Tuesday confirmed that permission for the project has been granted. “The permission has been given after due inspection of the area and in line with the state government’s transplantation policy. We understand that development work is important while ensuring the survival of maximum number of trees,” said the minister’s office in response to HT’s queries.As per the Delhi government’s transplantation policy, 80% of the transplanted trees must survive after a year. Besides, compensatory plantation has to be carried out by the agency undertaking the work.A senior official of the environment and forest department said permission has been given to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) to transplant a total of 400 trees for the new Parliament project. “The trees have already started being transplanted. Some of the trees are around 40 to 50 years old. The CPWD will have to carry out compensatory plantation for the same. Around 4,000 saplings will have to be planted to compensate for the uprooted trees,” said the official, who did not wish to be named.An inspection will be carried out by the department after the transplantation work is over, the official added.Meanwhile, officials of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), under whose jurisdiction the area falls, said some of the trees that will be uprooted for the project such as the ones on Raisina Road and Red Cross Road are around 100 years old. “There are around 20 jamun trees (a native species) on Raisina Road while 20-25 neem trees are there on Red Cross Road that are very old. It is difficult for old trees to survive, as they mostly have dead cells and are not able to regenerate on being translocated,” said a second senior official, who did not wish to be named.Experts say while transplantation could be a good solution for younger trees, it may not work in case of older trees and native species such as jamun, which are fragile.“An attempt to transplant trees may set a good precedent and is better than just felling them. However, in case of fragile species such as jamun, which are quite big and old like the ones in Lutyens’ Delhi are, may not be successful, as these species are not resilient enough to survive the shock of uprooting and human handling. In this exercise, there may be a loss of some old and big trees while the younger ones may survive,” said Vijay Dhasmana, curator, Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Gurugram.CR Babu, professor emeritus at the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystem, Delhi University, said only young and shallow-rooted species are known to survive transplantation. Trees aged around 10-15 years can survive transplantation and regrow well. However, with older trees and those with a deep-tap root systems such as jamun, transplantation would be a failure. “A younger jamun, if its roots are taken out intact, may survive. But in case of species as old as 50-100 years, the roots have penetrated too deep and they cannot be taken out without being damaged during transplantation. Hence, these trees, even if they survive, will not flourish or perform any ecological functions, which is equal to being dead,” he said. He added that some ficus species such as peepal, bargad and gular can also survive translocation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-gives-nod-to-transplant-400-trees-for-new-parliament/story-5Cuyimt7KYYyrS8sVaEnXM.html

25-11-2020||Pune||Four-state entry ban leaves Punekars to change home return travel plans||For Sagar Abnawe, a businessman from Pune, it was a shock to know that a “negative” Covid-19 test report was needed to return to Pune. To avoid this trouble, Sagar travelled to Karnataka and entered Maharashtra via Belgaum. Abnawe had gone to Goa for a holiday. Many holiday-makers are now altering travel plans to come back to Maharashtra from Goa, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Delhi NCR. On Monday, the state government issued a circular regarding persons returning to Maharashtra state from these four states. It is now compulsory to do a Covid test before entering Maharashtra– road, railways or airways. “I had come to Goa four days ago with four friends and we were about to return to Pune on Wednesday. We do not want to do Covid tests and so we are altering our travel plans. Now, we are going to Karnataka and via Belgaum we will cross into the state,” said Sagar. Similarly, Niraj Patel, who went to see his relatives in Ahmedabad is thinking on same lines of altering the travel plans. “I have come to Ahmedabad for a Diwali vacation. I was planning to come back to Pune next week, but now due to this sudden new circular I am a bit worried now. I don’t want to do Covid test, as I am completely fine and so I have decided to travel to Madhya Pradesh to a friend’s place. And then, at Indore I will catch a private tourist bus to Pune,” Patel said. Talking about this decision state health minister Rajesh Tope said, “The number of Covid positive patients is again on the rise in the state and so this decision has been taken for people coming from all these four states. Each and every person entering Maharashtra needs to undergo a Covid test and only when his/her report is negative they will be allowed to enter, or else, if positive, will be sent to a Covid care centre (CCC).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/four-state-entry-ban-leaves-punekars-to-change-home-return-travel-plans/story-H7c5VfUBLaq0nXm2rAHEGL.html

According to the itinerary released by the Ministry of External Affairs, the “familiarisation” visit of foreign ambassadors and high commissioners based in Delhi will be for one day and in two groups. The ambassadors will visit Serum Institute in the morning and spend around three hours visiting facilities at the company’s Hadapsar campus. By afternoon, they will arrive at Gennova Biopharmaceuticals Limited at its Hinjewadi campus before heading back to Delhi. “As per the earlier plan, the ambassadors were to visit Pune on November 27. However, their visit has been rescheduled for December 4. At Serum Institute, the ambassadors will see production of the Covid-19 vaccine and the distribution plan. A similar programme is planned at Gennova Biopharmaceuticals, which is also into vaccine production,” said Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao. Pune-based Serum institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine maker, has signed an agreement to manufacture the vaccine developed by the Jenner Institute of Oxford University in collaboration with British-Swedish pharma company AstraZeneca. Both University of Oxford and AstraZeneca on Monday said that their coronavirus vaccine was up to 90% effective in late-stage clinical trials, raising hopes for arrival of shots in India by the end of the year. Serum has enrolled 1,600 participants in India for late-stage trials of the Covishield vaccine. While the Pune firm plans to distribute vaccine shots globally, it has committed to reserving half of what it produces for India. Earlier this month, the ministry of external affairs had conducted a session with heads of missions and international organisations to brief them about India’s handling of the pandemic, the software development for vaccine delivery and international cooperation on the pandemic and research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ambassadors-to-visit-pune-on-dec-4-to-oversee-covid-19-vaccine-production-distribution-plan/story-zCjQpHsLwEeClW60KeyUCN.html
25-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra in safe zone compared to other states for Covid-19, says state health minister||The state government on Tuesday said Maharashtra was in a “safe zone” compared to other states for Covid-19 cases, even as talks of a potential lockdown and stricter curbs have gained ground over the past week. State health minister Rajesh Tope said there has been no decision taken on imposing another lockdown and the number of cases in Maharashtra has reduced over the past few weeks compared to other states. “The growth rate of cases and number of infections in state have reduced in comparison to Delhi, Goa and Kerala over the past few weeks. Our growth rate is 0.2% against the national rate of 0.4%,” said Tope. “Daily testing during Diwali did drop to 25,000 from 90,000, but we have again increased it over the past few days. As a result, cases have increased a bit. Honourable Prime Minister has asked us to increase per million testing rate, and to do that, we have, for the first time, given targets to district collectors,” said the minister.Also read: Formed task force for timely distribution of Covid-19 vaccine: Thackeray to ModiThe state’s per million testing rate is 74,207, with only six districts above the state average. While Mumbai and Pune test 1.31 lakh a million and Nagpur tests 1.25 lakh a million (as on November 19), Parbhani, Dhule, Hingoli, Buldhana and Nandurbar test less than 30,000 samples per million of population.After reporting an average of 4,200 cases daily in the first 17 days of November, Maharashtra reported more than 5,000 daily cases for five consecutive days till Sunday, before the number slightly dipped on Monday owing to reduced testing over the weekend. The trend continued on Tuesday as the state recorded 5,439 new cases, taking its tally to 1,789,800.Maharashtra on Tuesday reported 30 deaths, the same as on Monday, the lowest fatalities since May 3, pushing up the state’s death toll to 46,683. Officials from the health department, however, said deaths have been low for past two days as many districts have failed to update their records for fatalities.Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 939 new Covid-19 infections and 19 deaths, taking the city’s tally to 277,453 and toll to 10,708.Significantly, a state appointed task force of health experts has warned of a spike in Covid-19 cases in December-January. “Although there are differences, a majority of the 11-member task force of doctors feel another peak of cases would be between December 25 and January 26. They fear the period may see more cases than during the peak in the first two weeks of September, when the daily caseload was more than 20,000. We have asked district authorities to ramp up health infrastructure to manage 10% more cases than their highest active cases reported during the September peak,” said a senior health department official, on condition of anonymity.Also read: Screening of passengers from Covid hotspots begins Wednesday in Mumbai, details are hereDeputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Sunday had said the state government will take stock of the situation after 8-10 days before deciding about another lockdown. Tope on Monday hinted at stricter curbs on some activities to restrain people from crowding at the public places. The state government has also made RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests mandatory for air and train passengers coming from Delhi-NCR, Gujarat, Goa and Rajasthan. All road travellers from these areas will be screened at border check posts. Tope on Tuesday said potential super-spreaders such as vegetable vendors, those working in essential services and people with symptoms are being targeted for testing. “Around 75% of tests will be RT-PCR, which is the gold standard of Covid-19 detection, while remaining 25% will be rapid antigen tests. Although there is no discussion on a potential lockdown, the state government is all prepared to handle a surge in cases,” said Tope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-in-safe-zone-compared-to-other-states-for-covid-19-says-state-health-minister/story-1H31TnoXndL1dEtpnWbLgJ.html

Yogendra Yadav, convenor, Swaraj India, who has been touring different agricultural markets in south Haryana said on Tuesday that farmers in large numbers from Haryana and across the country were gearing to participate in the Dilli Chalo protest. He also said, while addressing a press conference in Gurugram, that the state government should not be wary of this protest and refrain from detaining farmer leaders in the state. Yadav said that protest by farmers will continue indefinitely if the Central government does not accede to their demands. “The main demands include a repeal of the three Central farm acts and as these are anti-farmer and anti-people. The government need not take repressive measures as this movement is peaceful. Wherever the police stops them at a barricade, they, insteading of opposing, will sit down on the road in protest,” said Yadav. The Swaraj India leader said that farmers will gather at Panchgaon, Sampla, Kundli, and Sector 12, Faridabad, on November 26 from where they will March towards Delhi. “Lakhs of farmers from Punjab are preparing to reach Delhi and they will join their counterparts in Haryana. We are apprehending that authorities will prevent the movement of peaceful protesters,” said Yadav, one of the organisers. The protest by farmers is being held under the aegis of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC). The AIKSCC in a separate statement issued on Tuesday said that the three farm acts and Electricity Bill, 2020 will ruin entire generations of Indian farmers by handing over control over farming, marketing and food supply chains to agri-business corporations.The Haryana government, meanwhile, has issued a travel advisory, stating that commuters may face traffic blockages on roads at entry points from Punjab into Haryana on November 25 and November 26 and on the entry points from Haryana into Delhi on November 26 and November 27.A spokesperson of the Haryana Police said that in view of the Dilli Chalo protest, arrangements have been made by the civil and police administrations to maintain law and order, ensure smooth traffic movement and security.The Union home ministry on Tuesday evening deputed three companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) in Haryana for handling the law and order situation. Following a video conference with the Union home secretary on Tuesday evening, an official said that the state government asked for five RAF companies from the ministry but got three initially. One RAF company will be deployed tonight with Ambala police range while two companies will be deployed with Hisar police range by Wednesday. If the Centre agrees to deployment of two additional RAF companies, one each will be deployed in Ambala police range and Sonepat district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/farmers-from-punjab-haryana-to-march-to-capital-against-farm-bills/story-3iuKnLGH9ouXigoACFGSyN.html

Vardhan said videography of farmer groups gathered at any place should also be done. He urged the common man to avoid travelling on November 25 and 26 so that they do not have to face any inconvenience.Virk said a large number of protesters are likely to enter Haryana from Punjab through border entry points for onward journey towards Delhi. Apart from this, the focus points of the protesters originating from within Haryana shall be the four major highways leading to Delhi.A call has been given by protesting organisations to gather at Shambhu border in Ambala, Mundhal Chowk in Bhiwani, Anaj Mandi at Gharaunda in Karnal, Tikri border in Jhajjar and Rajiv Gandhi Education City at Rai in Sonepat, where diversions and blockage will be set up, he said.The chief secretary said since more farmers from Punjab were expected to travel towards Delhi, special monitoring should be conducted on Shambhu Border. He also ordered that police patrolling be increased on the five national highways across the state connecting Delhi so as to maintain supplies of essential commodities without any obstruction. In the eventuality of protesters succeeding in blocking roads, traffic should be directed to alternative roads, thus minimising inconvenience to commuters, he added.Diverted routes As per the alternate routes, commuters going towards Chandigarh can take Naraingarh road from Ambala City and reach the destination via Handesra and Barwala.

25-11-2020||Mumbai||Starting today, outstation travellers to be screened by Mumbai civic body||After the Maharashtra government’s decision to mandatorily test passengers coming from Delhi, the National Capital Region (NCR), Rajasthan, Gujarat and Goa, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which handles the city’s public health, will start screening outstation train passengers by spot testing for Covid-19 symptoms at major railway stations from Wednesday.Those showing symptoms will be tested using rapid antigen kits.Passengers travelling on trains from these destinations by trains will have to produce a negative report, obtained 96 hours prior to journey on arrival. In case a passengers does not have a test report, they will be screened and tested using antigen kits, if found to be symptomatic.If found positive, the travellers will be admitted to a Covid Care Centre but will have to bear the cost of treatment themselves.BMC officials have informed all the wards to be on alert at major stations such as Borivli, Andheri, Bandra Terminus, Dadar, Mumbai Central, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT and Kurla where inbound outstation trains arrive.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We already have screening camps at the airport and the train stations. We will also arrange for antigen kits testing at railway stations. However, passengers will also be referred to laboratories, in case of crowding at railway stations.”Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based general physician, said, “Screening all passengers will be a difficult task at railway stations, but I feel instead of going ahead with the antigen kits, we should aim for RT-PCR testing. As the chances of positivity are higher for RT-PCR, we will be able to detect maximum cases.”In view of the rising Covid-19 cases, the Maharashtra government on Monday also announced certain restrictions and guidelines for all the citizens to follow. As per the guidelines, passengers travelling on flights from Delhi, Rajasthan, Goa and Gujarat will have to produce a negative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) report on landing at airports in Maharashtra. The test should have been done 72 hours prior to the scheduled journey.Meanwhile, BMC on Monday also wrote to Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) requesting it to follow the protocols issued by the state government. The guidelines issued by state government on air travel include a person having a negative RT-PCR test result in the last 72 hours. If travellers do not have report, they can also opt for spot testing.Further, people travelling by road to Maharashtra will have to undergo screening at the check posts on borders.

25-11-2020||World||UK’s $648 billion debt-sale plan more than double last record||The UK government plans to issue a record 485.5 billion pounds ($648 billion) of bonds this fiscal year to help fight the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.The Debt Management Office on Wednesday announced an additional 92 billion pounds of borrowing from December through March. The annual figure is more than twice the amount raised during the peak of the global financial crisis and compares with analyst estimates of 482.8 billion pounds, according to a Bloomberg survey of 12 primary dealers.The surge in borrowing reflects the mounting cost of widespread lockdowns, which have shuttered businesses, kept workers at home and tipped the economy into its deepest recession in three centuries. It will also add to the government’s two-trillion-pound debt load and risks weighing on the market.“The UK economy is on a large amount of life support right now,” said Liam O’Donnell, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, before the announcement. “A modest rise in yield is fine, anything else is effectively a short circuit to activity while the economy still reels from the crisis.”For now, the surge in debt sales hasn’t pushed government borrowing costs higher, thanks largely to the Bank of England’s bond-buying program. The yield on 10-year gilts fell one basis point to 0.32%, having more than halved this year as the central bank soaked up the issuance.The BOE expanded its so-called quantitative easing program this month by 150 billion pounds to 895 billion pounds.With a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc found to be highly effective -- along with those from Pfizer Inc, and Moderna Inc. -- and a Brexit trade deal getting closer, economic prospects for 2021 could be in for a boost. The nation’s deficit grew less than expected in October, data showed last week.The DM0 is set to sell 393.6 billion pounds of bonds in the fiscal year through November, 8.6 billion pounds more than initially planned, it said. It raised 228 billion pounds during peak of the financial the crisis in 2009-2010.The Office for Budget Responsibility, meanwhile, said that the UK would bring the methods of maligned Retail Price Index gauge of inflation in line with the CPIH measure in February 2030.The switch to the new benchmark, which has shown consistently slower price increases since 2010, threatened to erode future returns on the inflation-linked bonds. The government said it wouldn’t offer compensation to holders of the securities.The 10-year breakeven rate jumped as much as 9 basis points to 3.09%, set of its biggest increase since 2017.Still, “long linkers should gradually start to feel the benefit of renewed demand,” said Adam Dent, UK rates strategist at Banco Santander SA. There is now “certainty around what ‘RPI’ will mean in any given year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-648-billion-debt-sale-plan-more-than-double-last-record/story-93zsVNxW8JVgsHvRLiMU1K.html
25-11-2020||World||Hungarian, Polish PMs to discuss EU budget veto||Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki will hold talks in Budapest Thursday on their recent EU budget veto over the planned link of funding to rule of law criteria.The EU’s 1.8-trillion-euro ($2.1 trillion) budget and coronavirus rescue package were vetoed last week by the two countries, both accused by Brussels of rolling back democratic freedoms.The talks between the two leaders were confirmed to the Hungarian state newswire MTI by Orban’s press officer Wednesday.“The meeting’s agenda is expected to include the MFF as Poland and Hungary intend to coordinate EU Budget negotiating positions,” said a message by the Permanent Representation of Poland to the EU on Twitter, referring to the bloc’s multi-annual financial framework (MFF) or long-term budget.Morawiecki said after the veto that a “European oligarchy” was trying to bully weaker EU members, while Orban called the conditionality plan a politically motivated “weapon” and a form of “blackmail” against member states opposed to immigration.EU leaders have since intensified efforts to convince Orban and Morawiecki to drop their veto, which has plunged the bloc into a new crisis threatening joint efforts to fight the epidemic.While the veto was not a complete surprise, the stand-off angered EU partners, with many keenly awaiting payouts from the stimulus to help fix economies shattered by the pandemic with worse feared yet to come.But the rule-of law issue is hugely sensitive for both Warsaw and Budapest. Poland is already subject to an EU investigative procedure over its efforts to trim the independence of the judiciary, as is Hungary for an erosion of democratic norms, such as press freedom, under Orban’s rule.“Many types of solutions are possible, it’s just a question of political will,” Orban said on Friday. Acceptable solutions for Hungary and Poland “would be those reached on the basis of legal standpoints rather than the political majority,” he told Hungarian public media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungarian-polish-pms-to-discuss-eu-budget-veto/story-5ZFUdvN4TZPZC0RBdybN0L.html
25-11-2020||World||Japan, China agree on economic ties, split over islands||China’s top diplomat told Japan’s leader on Wednesday that Beijing wants the two Asian powers to have good relations and cooperate in fighting the coronavirus and reviving their pandemic-hit economies, but the two sides remained at odds over an island dispute.Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a message from Chinese President Xi Jinping expressing his hope of developing positive relations with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and “strengthen cooperation with Japan in pandemic measures and for the economic recovery,” Wang told reporters after meeting with Suga.Wang told Suga that ties between the two countries have improved through high-level dialogue and mutual efforts and that China wants to cooperate further in a range of areas.“A stable relationship between the two countries is important not only for Japan and China but also for the region and the international community, and I would like to fulfill our responsibilities together,” Suga said during his talks with Wang.Wang’s visit came as Japan is actively promoting military and economic partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China’s rise, which Japan considers a security threat. Beijing has criticized the move as an attempt to create an “Asian NATO.”Often-thorny relations between the two countries have improved in recent years as China’s trade dispute with the U.S. has escalated, but territorial disputes continue to strain ties.Suga reminded Wang of Japan’s claim over Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands and raised concern about China’s growing activity in the area. Chinese coast guard ships have stepped up activity around the islands despite protests and warnings by Japan.Japan says the islands belong to it historically and under international law and that China started claiming them only after undersea oil reserves were found in the area in the 1970s.Earlier Wednesday, Japan protested the increased Chinese activity and what it called infiltration around the islands.Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said the government protested after Chinese ships entered Japan’s contiguous zone, just outside its territorial waters, for the 306th time this year, including 20 cases of territorial violations.“The situation is extremely serious,” Kato told reporters after meeting with Wang.The Chinese ships entered the zone only a day after both sides agreed to avoid provocative actions in the contested area, he said.On Tuesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi and Wang agreed to try not to escalate tensions over the islands.Wang was firm about China’s right to defend its sovereignty, and accused Japanese authorities of sending “fake” fishing boats into the area to interfere with the Chinese side. Japan has said Chinese ships threatened the safety of the Japanese fishing boats.“We hope that both sides can calmly deal with it so that it will not affect the current hard-won improvement of Sino-Japanese relations and the future development of bilateral relations,” Wang said.The two foreign ministers agreed to resume business travel between the world’s second and third largest economies through a “business track” program that will allow visitors to engage in limited activities during their 14-day quarantine periods. They also agreed to work together on climate change, energy conservation, health care and digital commerce as part of their economic cooperation.It was the first trip to Japan by a top Chinese official since the February visit of Chinese foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi. Officials said the two sides did not discuss a rescheduling of Xi’s state visit to Japan, postponed from the spring due to the pandemic.After his visit to Japan, Wang heads for meetings in South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-china-agree-on-economic-ties-split-over-islands/story-Z5RC1upkEGIr7og52CVmuM.html
25-11-2020||World||UAE halts visas to citizens of 13 mostly Muslim states including Pakistan||The United Arab Emirates has stopped issuing new visas to citizens of 13 mostly Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to a document issued by a state-owned business park.A source briefed on the matter told Reuters the visas had temporarily stopped being issued to Afghans, Pakistanis and citizens of several other countries over security concerns, but did not provide details of those concerns. The document, sent to companies operating in the park and seen by Reuters, cited an immigration circular that came into effect on November 18.The document said applications for new employment and visit visas had been suspended for nationals - those outside the UAE - of 13 countries that also included Somalia, Libya and Yemen until further notice.The ban also applies to citizens of Algeria, Kenya, Iraq, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey, it says.It was not clear if there were any exceptions to the ban.The UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.The circular took effect a week after the French Embassy in the UAE urged its citizens to maintain vigilance after a bomb attack in Saudi Arabia on diplomats claimed by Islamic State.The explosion, which occurred during a World War One commemoration ceremony in Jeddah, was the first attack in years where explosives were used in an attempt to hit foreigners in the conservative kingdom.The visa ban also comes two months after the Gulf state established formal ties with Israel, a move that broke with decades of Arab policy and angered some Muslim states and communities. Others welcomed it. Still, the source familiar with the matter said the ban was unrelated to the UAE’s relationship with Israel and was expected to last only for a brief period. A diplomat commented that the UAE had strained relations with some of the states listed, such as Turkey.Last week, Pakistan’s foreign ministry said the UAE had stopped processing new visas for its citizens and those of some other countries, but that those already holding valid visas were not affected and could still enter the UAE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-halts-new-visas-to-citizens-of-13-mostly-muslim-states-document/story-Twea3dbGsLu2mguLtX0HtO.html
25-11-2020||World||Germany, Bhutan establish full-fledged diplomatic ties||Bhutan and Germany established full-fledged diplomatic relations on Wednesday during a ceremony held in the Bhutanese mission in New Delhi. The two sides have had consular relations since July 2000, and Germany’s envoy to India, Walter Lindner, and Bhutanese ambassador, V Namgyel, exchanged notes verbale on the establishment of diplomatic relations. Bhutan now has diplomatic relations with 53 countries and the European Union. However, there are no immediate plans for Bhutan and Germany to open embassies in each other’s capitals. Bhutan’s capital Thimphu hosts only three foreign missions – those of India, Bangladesh and Kuwait. The Indian side welcomed the development, and people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the proposal on full-fledged diplomatic ties had been in the pipeline for some time. “We have noted that Bhutan and Germany have established formal diplomatic relations through their embassies in New Delhi. Germany is an important development partner of Bhutan. This is a further step on that path,” one of the people cited above said. The German foreign ministry said the country’s ambassador in New Delhi will be accredited for Bhutan too, and maintain relations from across the border. Bhutan’s embassy in New Delhi is a “connection [that] has been used for dialogue with Germany in the past”, it said. “With the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two countries will now be able to collaborate more closely than ever before,” the German foreign ministry added. During Wednesday’s ceremony, Lindner and Namgyal exchanged views on mutual cooperation and expressed the desire of their governments to work closely in areas of mutual benefit, Bhutan’s foreign ministry said. The two ambassadors also “expressed the desire to further deepen the friendship and cooperation between the two countries”, it said. Petra Sigmund, director general for Asia and Pacific in the German foreign ministry, said Bhutan and Germany share democratic values, support a rules-based international order and are already cooperating in areas such as climate change and environment. “Establishing full-fledged diplomatic relations between our two countries is a logical step which will help us to intensify our cooperation across the board,” she said. Even in absence of full-fledged diplomatic ties, Germany has supported Bhutan’s socio-economic development since the 1970s. Bhutan also receives support from the European Union (EU), with Germany being the largest contributor to the grouping’s budget. As part of domestic reforms introduced by late King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, who ruled from 1952 to 1972, Bhutan gradually established relations with a small number of countries and joined the UN in 1971. Official bilateral contacts between Berlin and Thimphu were maintained through the German embassy in New Delhi and the Bhutanese mission in Brussels. Both countries also have honorary consuls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-bhutan-establish-full-fledged-diplomatic-ties/story-nLCkhTm0c7hNDrANhI3VyO.html
25-11-2020||World||Scotland to make period products freely available to all||Scottish lawmakers have unanimously passed legislation that will make period products freely available to anyone who needs them - a move that leader Nicole Sturgeon says makes Scotland the first country in the world to do so.Lawmakers in the Scottish Parliament unanimously approved a bill late Tuesday that will require local authorities to provide free access to items such as tampons and sanitary pads.Monica Lennon, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, had campaigned against “period poverty” — when someone who needs sanitary products can’t afford them — since 2016. She described the legislation as “practical and progressive,” especially during the coronavirus pandemic.“Periods don’t stop for pandemics and the work to improve access to essential tampons, pads and reusables has never been more important,” she said. “On the issue of period dignity, I am beyond proud that Scotland is leading the way and we have moved at a fast pace in a short space of time.”Her bill was passed in a 121-0 vote after winning the support of the Scottish government and the other opposition parties in the legislature in Edinburgh.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that she was proud to vote for the “groundbreaking” legislation and described it as “an important policy for women and girls.”Under the bill, the Scottish government must set up measures to allow anyone who needs period products to get them free of charge. Schools and universities must make the products available for free in their bathrooms.The Scottish government already funds free period products in schools and universities, but the bill makes it a legal requirement.Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell from the Scottish National Party hailed the passing of the legislation as a “significant moment for gender equality.”And Rose Caldwell, chief executive of the girls’ rights charity Plan International U.K., said Scotland could soon become the first country to eliminate period poverty once and for all.A 2017 survey by the charity estimated that 10% of girls aged 14 to 21 in the U.K. have been unable to afford period products, and 15% of girls have struggled to afford them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scotland-to-make-period-products-freely-available-to-all/story-1lijfhueHyQygsmVyRRdJO.html
25-11-2020||World||Explained: When and how will Covid-19 vaccines become available around the world?||Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc have released trial data showing their Covid-19 vaccines to be about 95% effective at preventing the illness, while AstraZeneca Plc this week said its vaccine could be up to 90% effective. If regulators approve any of the vaccines in coming weeks, the companies have said distribution could begin almost immediately with governments around the world to decide who gets them and in what order. The following is an outline of the process:WHEN WILL COMPANIES ROLL OUT A VACCINE?Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have already started manufacturing their vaccines. This year, Pfizer said it will have enough to inoculate 25 million people, Moderna will have enough for 10 million people and AstraZeneca will have enough for more than 100 million people.The U.S. Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will manage distribution in the United States, likely starting in mid-December with an initial release of 6.4 million doses nationwide.UK health authorities plan to roll out an approved vaccine as quickly as possible, also expected in December. In the European Union, it is up to each country in the 27-member bloc to start distributing vaccines to their populations.WHO WOULD GET AN APPROVED VACCINE AND WHEN IN THE UNITED STATES?Upon authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the CDC has said first in line for vaccinations would be about 21 million healthcare workers and 3 million residents in long-term care facilities.Essential workers, a group of 87 million people who do crucial work in jobs that cannot be done from home, are the likely next group. This includes firefighters, police, school employees, transportation workers, food and agriculture workers and food service employees.Around 100 million adults with high-risk medical conditions and 53 million adults over the age of 65, also considered at higher risk of severe disease, are the next priority.U.S. public health officials said vaccines will be generally available to most Americans in pharmacies, clinics and doctors offices starting in April so that anyone who wants a shot can have one by the end of June.It is unclear when a vaccine will be available for children. Pfizer and BioNTech have started testing their vaccine in volunteers as young as 12. WHEN WILL A VACCINE BE AVAILABLE IN OTHER COUNTRIES? The European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada and Australia are all running rapid vaccine regulatory processes.Many of AstraZeneca’s doses this year are expected to go to the United Kingdom, where health officials have said that if approved they could begin vaccinating people in December. At the top of their list is people living and working in care homes.In Europe, the E.U. drugs regulator has said it could rule on the safety of a Covid-19 vaccine in December. Most countries have said the first vaccines will go to the elderly and vulnerable and frontline workers like doctors. Countries say they are buying vaccines via the European Commission’s joint procurement scheme, which has deals for six different vaccines and nearly 2 billion doses. Delivery timelines vary and most countries are still drawing up plans for distributing and administering shots.Italy expects to receive the first deliveries of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and AstraZeneca’s shot early next year. Spain plans to give vaccines in January.In Bulgaria, the country’s chief health inspector expects the first shipments in March-April. Hungary’s foreign minister said doses will land in the spring at the earliest. Germany, home to BioNTech, expects to roll out shots in early 2021 with mass vaccination centers in exhibition halls, airport terminals and concert venues. It will also use mobile teams for care homes. Front-line healthcare workers and people at risk for serious Covid-19 are expected to get inoculated first.WHEN WILL DEVELOPING COUNTRIES HAVE ACCESS TO VACCINES?COVAX, a program led by the World Health Organization and the GAVI vaccine group to pool funds from wealthier countries and nonprofits to buy and distribute vaccines to dozens of poorer countries, has raised $2 billion. Its first goal is to vaccinate 3% of the people in these countries with a final goal of reaching 20%. It has signed a provisional agreement to buy AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which does not require storage in specialized ultra cold equipment like the Pfizer vaccine. It is expected but not certain that less wealthy countries in Africa and South East Asia, such as India, will receive vaccines at low or no cost under this program in 2021. Other countries such as those in Latin America may buy vaccines through COVAX. Several are also striking supply deals with drugmakers.HOW MUCH WILL IT COST?Vaccine makers and governments have negotiated varying prices, not all of which are public. Governments have paid from a few dollars per AstraZeneca shot to up to $50 for the two-dose Pfizer regimen. Many countries have said they will cover the cost of inoculating their residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/when-and-how-will-covid-19-vaccines-become-available-around-the-world-explained/story-5HadyrN52eiLUbE1reMSyO.html
25-11-2020||World||Biden to discuss coronavirus response as Thanksgiving holiday nears||US President-elect Joe Biden will give a speech on Wednesday highlighting the challenges facing Americans as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches and the nation faces a surge in coronavirus infections and a wave of unpopular health restrictions.The address is meant to encourage Americans and focus on the sacrifices they are making during the holiday season, his office said, as officials across the country plead with Americans to stay at home and avoid large gatherings that can spread Covid-19.Biden, who introduced his foreign policy and national security team on Tuesday as he begins a formal transition to the White House after defeating Republican President Donald Trump, has promised to make fighting the pandemic his top priority in office.The number of patients being treated for coronavirus infections in US hospitals surpassed 86,000, an all-time high, on Tuesday. The death toll has passed 257,000.Read more | Thanksgiving could make or break US coronavirus responseThe soaring caseload has taxed healthcare providers and further strained medical resources as 171,000 Americans test positive and another 1,500 or more perish from Covid-19 every day, on average.Not everyone appears to be heeding the warnings against travel. Millions of Americans have flocked to airports and highways in the days leading to Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday, leading to the busiest US travel period since the early days of the pandemic in March, though well below pre-pandemic holiday levels.Biden, who plans to spend Thanksgiving at home in Delaware with a few family members, said on Tuesday his team has been able to coordinate with the Trump administration on the pandemic, vaccine distribution plans and national security since getting the green light on Monday for formal transition efforts.The White House also gave the go-ahead for Biden to start receiving the president’s daily intelligence briefing.“It’s been offered,” Biden told reporters on Tuesday. “I did not have it today. We’re going to do it on a regular basis.”Trump has waged a failing legal battle to overturn the election results, falsely claiming it was stolen through widespread voting fraud. Critics have said Trump’s refusal to accept the results undercut Biden’s ability to combat the coronavirus pandemic and deal with national security threats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-discuss-coronavirus-response-as-thanksgiving-holiday-nears/story-BjqNlF2GrOBDf6sEy4yzsM.html

Devastating to watch,” Prowell said on Twitter.With caseloads soaring, more than half the nation’s governors imposed or reimposed statewide measures this month. But despite more stringent face-mask requirements, curfews and limits on bars and restaurants, the metrics of the virus have only worsened.US President-elect Joe Biden has promised to make fighting the pandemic his top priority upon taking office on Jan. 20 and will give a speech on Wednesday that is meant to encourage Americans and focus on the sacrifices they are making, his office said.Outgoing President Donald Trump has remained largely silent on the subject, making a one-minute appearance the White House briefing room on Tuesday to talk about the stock market.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicMeanwhile school districts across the United States face pressure from all sides as they grapple with how to educate children during the pandemic, a Reuters survey of 217 districts showed.Many parents are balking at online instruction, seeing it as inferior to classroom learning and disruptive to life at home and work. Other parents worry about sending kids back into classrooms prematurely amid a raging pandemic. Teachers say they are not comfortable teaching in person, fearing infection.“Every school district across the nation is in the position in which no matter what decision they make and how well thought out it is, it will leave some in the community thinking it’s the wrong decision,” said Larry Rother, senior executive director of pre-kindergarten through 12th grade educational services in Chandler, Arizona.Help may be coming with vaccines showing promise.Officials from the US government’s Operation Warp Speed program told reporters Tuesday they plan to release 6.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses nationwide in an initial distribution after the first one is cleared by regulators for emergency use, which could happen as soon as Dec. 10.If all goes well 40 million doses will be distributed by the end of the year, they said.A Food and Drug Administration ruling on emergency use for Pfizer Inc’s vaccine is expected on Dec. 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-surpasses-2-000-coronavirus-deaths-in-a-day-with-hospitals-already-full/story-3t74u8RAeAvmoEwREpuZqJ.html

25-11-2020||World||Drones, micro-chillers may be needed for last-mile delivery of Covid vaccines||The ‘last mile’ of Covid-19 vaccine delivery will be crucial to re-start global economy and will depend on cargo drones, mobile cold rooms, micro-chillers and other innovative means in low-income countries for delivery, a new research report said on Wednesday.Successfully overcoming logistical challenges will be crucial to halt the spread of the virus and reconnect countries to international trade, said the report compiled by experts from the University of Birmingham, Heriot-Watt University, BRAC University (Bangladesh) and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.Vaccines are expected to be produced on a mass scale, including in the Serum Institute of India, following recent successful trials.High-income countries getting vaccines first would avoid 33% of preventable deaths, but equitable global distribution would stop 66% of such deaths, said the report titled ‘Understanding the cold-chain challenge for Covid-19 vaccination’.“Universal vaccine access is already a major challenge in low-income countries, due to the lack of robust refrigerated cooling networks especially to remote communities. Mass vaccination for Covid-19 will need to deliver vaccines globally at scale and speed never before considered,” the report added.The experts drew up a blueprint for in-country Covid-19 vaccination cold chain design for low and middle-income countries, using Bangladesh as a case study.The report identified several issues, including an urgent need to strengthen vaccine cold chains in low-income countries, particularly into rural and remote areas. It is estimated that nearly 3 billion of the world’s 7.8 billion people live in areas that lack temperature-controlled storage to deliver the vaccines.Existing vaccination, the report recommended, must continue alongside Covid-19 programmes, because nearly 80 million children may already have missed vaccinations against preventable diseases due to the pandemic.“Strengthening cold chains must not come at an environmental cost; this is a major opportunity to address gaps in the wider cold economy and use sustainable technology. A lack of qualified engineers will lead to long response times to equipment malfunctions and broken cold-chains”, the report said.It added that waste management will be a major challenge; alongside vaccines, disposable syringes, Personal Protective Equipment and other vaccination supplies will require disposal.Project developer Toby Peters, professor of Cold Economy at the University of Birmingham, said: “We can’t ‘build back better’ if lack of access to vaccination has condemned some countries to isolation because they remain Covid-19 hubs. We must reach everyone who needs a vaccine and the real challenge lies in overcoming that ‘last mile’.”“Cold-chains are energy intensive and rely on planet-warming refrigerants. Rapid expansion must not be based on environmentally harmful technologies and we are leading a fast-track research programme to design novel methods and instruments to support the cold-chain for Covid-19, but also to provide a lasting logistics legacy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drones-micro-chillers-may-be-needed-for-last-mile-delivery-of-covid-vaccines/story-jg4b2NBGnjJw9rdU5AQ0GP.html
25-11-2020||World||UK to relax Covid-19 rules over Christmas to allow indoor mixing||Coronavirus restrictions in the UK will be eased over Christmas to allow as many as three households to meet indoors.Households will be able to meet in a “Christmas bubble” in homes, places of worship and outdoor spaces between Dec. 23-27, the leaders of the four UK nations agreed Tuesday.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Prime Minister Boris Johnson is trying to balance demands to bolster the economy and allow people more freedoms with the need to keep the coronavirus in check before a potential vaccine can be rolled out. England has been under a four-week lockdown that’s set to end Dec. 2, to be replaced with a regional three-tier system of restrictions.Other European leaders are fighting their own battles: French President Emmanuel Macron will gradually lift a nationwide lockdown from Saturday following weeks of criticism from shopkeepers, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to extend the country’s partial lockdown as Covid-19 cases remain high.UK ministers will announce Thursday which regions in England will be placed into each tier. London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan has been lobbying the government to put the city into tier 2, which would allow pubs, bars and restaurants to stay open.Christmas BubbleUnder the new Christmas plans, people will be able to travel between tiers and across the whole of the UK, as long as they only meet with those in their “exclusive” bubble of three households. Those travelling to and from Northern Ireland will be allowed an extra day to travel either side of the five-day period.The move was agreed after days of talks between Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and the leaders of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In a joint statement, they said: “Even where it is within the rules, meeting with friends and family over Christmas will be a personal judgment for individuals to take, mindful of the risks to themselves and others, particularly those who are vulnerable.”In a video message on Twitter, Johnson urged people not to “throw caution to the wind,” adding: “The virus doesn’t know it’s Christmas, and we must all be careful.”But doctors from the British Medical Association immediately raised concerns. In an emailed statement, BMA council chair Chaand Nagpaul said the move “will almost certainly carry the risk of a rise in infection rate and possibly more hospitalization and deaths.”Balancing DemandsAs the virus continues to rage across Europe, leaders are grappling with how to get infection rates down while keeping their economies afloat. In France, small stores will be permitted to open from Nov. 28 but restaurants will remain closed until at least Jan. 20, depriving the sector of the income from one of the busiest periods of the year.Meanwhile, Germany is heading for an extension and further tightening of its partial lockdown, with Chancellor Merkel expected to agree with regional state premiers Wednesday on closing restaurants, gyms and cinemas until at least Dec. 20.A number of UK lawmakers have expressed concern about Johnson’s new tougher regional restrictions, coming into force next week. Some have publicly aired their opposition to London going into tier 3, which they warn would hit already struggling businesses hard.Health Minister Nadine Dorries spoke with London lawmakers on a video call Tuesday to hear their views ahead of the decision on the categorization of regions, two people familiar with the matter said.Keeping London in tier 2 -- where it was before lockdown -- would be the “right and sensible decision,” given that cases are lower than “most other parts of the country,” Khan said in a statement Tuesday.“London’s unique ecosystem of bars, restaurants, clubs and cultural venues have been through an extremely tough year,” he said. “If they had to close throughout the Christmas period and beyond in tier 3 it would be a hammer blow that many might not recover from.”Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday that no decision had yet been made. “London will come out at the tier that is necessary and appropriate based on the public health evidence,” he told MPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-relax-covid-19-rules-over-christmas-to-allow-indoor-mixing/story-NFqgsaGyWoV9KaItHVjf4O.html
25-11-2020||World||Row over England flu shots prompts fear of Covid-19 vaccine ‘chaos’||Communication failures risk derailing the mass roll-out of a potential Covid-19 vaccine in England, family doctors warned after they were blindsided by a government announcement on free flu shots for the over-50s.Ministers announced last week that people aged 50-64 will be able to get a flu vaccination from Dec. 1, but doctors complained they were not told in advance and were deluged with calls from patients demanding appointments. Some practices are still not able to get hold of enough flu vaccine for the over-65s, let alone younger patients.“There’s always this underlying feeling of chaos,” said Lizzie Toberty, a spokeswoman for the Doctors’ Association campaign group. “Our worry is that if we’re having problems delivering flu vaccines which we deliver to a limited number of people every year, then how can we be confident if we organize a Covid-19 program that the supply chain is definitely going to be there?”The row raises serious questions about the government’s handling of immunization programs as the National Health Service prepares for the roll out of a coronavirus vaccine, if approved by regulators, to tens of millions of people across the country.The NHS Confederation, which represents health care organizations, said family doctors are under “phenomenal strain” -- carrying out around 1.25 million appointments a day while preparing to deliver a Covid-19 vaccination program “at very short notice.”‘Poorly Executed’In a letter to health minister Jo Churchill, it said “poorly executed communications from the department on important matters such as this simply does not help in these trying times.”Richard Vautrey, a spokesman for the British Medical Association doctors’ union, said while it was always intended the flu campaign would eventually be extended to 50-64 year-olds, doctors have a right to be given “adequate notice” ahead of any public announcement.The Department of Health said in a statement there have been “regular communications” with doctors on the flu vaccine, and further deliveries will be arriving throughout November, December and into the new year.There is “a real disconnect” between central government and health workers on the ground, Toberty said. “We need to urgently improve the level of communication.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/row-over-england-flu-shots-prompts-fear-of-covid-19-vaccine-chaos/story-lXTz46zhe0iMU3VJj7aBHP.html

New Zealand’s Department of Conservation (DOC) said in total 97 pilot whales and three dolphins died in the stranding, adding that they were notified of the incident on Sunday.“Only 26 of the whales were still alive at this point, the majority of them appearing very weak, and were euthanised due to the rough sea conditions and almost certainty of there being great white sharks in the water which are brought in by a stranding like this,” said DOC Biodiversity Ranger Jemma Welch.Mass strandings are reasonably common on the Chatham Islands with up to 1,000 animals dying in a single stranding in 1918.Mass whale strandings have occurred throughout recorded modern history, and why it happens is a question that has puzzled marine biologists for years.In late September, several hundred whales died in shallow waters off the Australian coast in one of the world’s biggest mass whale strandings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-100-whales-die-after-mass-stranding-in-new-zealand/story-DiLg8egTABIDEB4MnKz9bJ.html

Companies often seek court help to determine whether certain technology patents are valid and how much should be paid for licensing technology seen as essential for an industry. The EU has often been asked to weigh in on how much is fair for key technology.Read more | First EU citizens may be vaccinated against Covid-19 by December end“There’s quite a lot of litigation back and forth and in the short-term we would want to push for industry to figure out how to set up foras to enable discussions and mediation so that maybe to a bigger degree it can be solved out of court, Vestager said.The current system to set up so-called standard essential patents deemed key to certain technology “is not very transparent,” she said. “This is why we will consider a very close consultation with anyone involved whether we should set up a third-party essential ‘reality check’ so someone outside of your business” can rule on whether a parent is really important or not.It’s important that there be broad agreement in an industry on the right patents for an essential patent instead of many, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-seeks-overhaul-of-key-patents-to-ease-technology-court-fights/story-FROeu9T5ov45fRX3f504LJ.html
25-11-2020||World||Top Chinese vaccine maker seeks govt nod to market Covid-19 shots||China’s leading vaccine producer China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) said on Wednesday it has applied with the country’s regulators to market its Covid-19 vaccine.The announcement was made by Sinopharm general manager, Shi Shengyi, state media reported.The company, which is carrying out clinical trials of the candidate vaccine abroad said it had collected data from host countries such as UAE.Results are expected to be good, but it is up to Chinese authorities to make the decision as the authorities have strict review standards, the company was quoted as saying.Earlier, the company said it had submitted the vaccine’s phase-3 clinical data to China’s State Food and Drug Administration and was in the process of giving more detailed data.The company said it is in the final stage before launching it in markets and is now making approval of the vaccine its top priority.If approved, Sinopharm will likely become the first vaccine developer outside of Russia to see its shots being made available for general public, underscoring China’s push to be a major player in supplying inoculations to countries around the world.Western drugmakers like Pfizer Inc. are only at the stage of seeking authorisation for emergency use of their shots, a status China granted to its developers in July.Five Chinese vaccine candidates are under clinical trials in countries including the UAE, Brazil, Pakistan and Peru, and phase-I and II clinical trials of other candidates have been accelerated, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said last week at a regular briefing.At least one million people have taken an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by Sinopharm through the country’s emergency use programme, the firm had said last week.China launched the emergency use programme in July, which so far includes three vaccine candidates for essential workers and other limited groups of people.Experts have questioned the move as clinical studies have yet to be completed to prove their safety and efficacy.Earlier this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China is ready to step up global Covid-19 vaccine cooperation, calling for better international coordination on policies to facilitate movement of people.“China is willing to strengthen cooperation with other countries in the research and development, production and distribution of vaccines,” Xi told the G-20 Riyadh Summit via video link on Saturday. “We will fulfil our commitments, offer help and support to other developing countries, and work hard to make vaccines a public good that citizens of all countries can use and can afford.”Xi urged stronger international policy coordination to establish travel “fast tracks”, facilitating orderly global movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-chinese-vaccine-maker-seeks-govt-nod-to-market-covid-19-shots/story-LCV2OBAU8Hf1qhudMyWphL.html
25-11-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson offers days off from lockdown to form ‘Christmas bubble’||Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed a time-limited one-off dispensation from Covid-19 lockdown rules agreed by all parts of the United Kingdom for families to get together to form a Christmas bubble between December 23 and 27.In a video message on Tuesday evening from Downing Street, where he continues to self-isolate after being in contact with a Covid-positive politician, Johnson said a family can get together with two other households to form such a bubble in order to spend the festive period together.“All four nations of the UK (England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales) have agreed that from the 23rd of December to the 27th of December, you will be able to form a Christmas bubble with up to two other households,” Johnson said.It would mean that up to three households will be able to come together from any part of the UK over the brief four-day period and also attend church and communal services.“We can’t afford to throw caution to the wind. The virus doesn’t know it’s Christmas and we must all be careful,” he said, urging people “think carefully” about the festive plans.“I know this doesn’t equate to a normal Christmas and it won’t work for everyone. And it is up to each of us to think carefully about how we use this time-limited special dispensation. The virus has not gone away and families will need to make a personal judgement about the risk of forming a bubble with or visiting elderly relatives and the vulnerable,” he said.“‘Tis the season to be jolly but ‘tis also the season to be jolly careful,” he added.Making a reference to some good news from at least three Covid-19 vaccines in the last few weeks, Johnson expressed hope for a better period by early next year at the end of a tough 2020.“I have to level with you and say we face some tough weeks and months ahead. But if we follow the rules, remembering to wash our hands, wear a face covering and keep our distance from anyone we don’t live with, then after this tough winter, we can look forward to a much, much brighter spring,” he said.A joint statement issued by the four UK governments said they had been working closely together to find a way for family and friends to see each other, recognising it must be “limited and cautious”. They also urged people to “think carefully” about their Christmas plans and to consider meeting outside or getting together virtually, instead of mixing indoors.England remains under a strict stay-at-home lockdown, set to expire next Wednesday when it will move into a tougher three-tier system. The different regions will find out on Thursday which tier they fall under, a decision based on a number of factors including case numbers, the infection reproduction rate – or R number – and pressure on local National Health Service (NHS) capacity.Some scientists have warned that the relaxation of Covid restrictions over Christmas could spark another wave of infections and further deaths.On Tuesday, the UK government recorded another 608 deaths, pushing the country’s death toll to 55,838.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-offers-days-off-from-lockdown-to-form-christmas-bubble/story-3D8ncmxOzdP7WkmGmGI8CL.html

25-11-2020||World||Angela Merkel set to extend Germany’s partial shutdown well into December||German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors are expected Wednesday to extend a partial shutdown well into December, and discuss tightening some restrictions while allowing somewhat more generous rules for the Christmas period.Germany embarked on a so-called “wave-breaker” shutdown on Nov. 2, shutting restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities but leaving schools, shops and hair salons open. It was initially slated to last four weeks.Proposals drawn up ahead of Wednesday’s videoconference by state governors, who are responsible for imposing and lifting restrictions, call for extending the shutdown until Dec. 20.So far, the measures have succeeded in halting an upward surge in new coronavirus infections — but they have stabilized at a high level, rather than sinking back to levels at which authorities feel contact-tracing efforts can be successful.On Wednesday, the national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, reported 18,633 new cases over the past 24 hours — compared with 17,561 a week earlier. The number of deaths linked to COVID-19 climbed by 410, the highest single-day total yet.Proposals for Wednesday’s gathering envision tightening contact restrictions and mask-wearing rules. The federal government reportedly plans around 17 billion euros ($20 billion) more in aid to compensate businesses hit by the shutdown, following more than 10 billion euros this month.Over the Christmas period, plans so far call for somewhat looser contact restrictions.Germany, which has 83 million people, was credited with a relatively good performance in the first phase of the pandemic. It still has a lower death rate than several other European countries, and its current shutdown has been relatively mild.Germany has reported a total of 961,320 virus cases since the pandemic began, including 14,771 deaths.___Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-set-to-extend-partial-shutdown-well-into-december/story-9PFrNQwt2Q8bO67GU9iPmL.html
25-11-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic could be stopped if at least 70% public wore face masks consistently: Study||The Covid-19 pandemic could be stopped if at least 70 per cent of the public wore face masks consistently, according to a review of studies which suggests that the type of material used and the duration of mask use play key roles in their effectiveness. The research, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, assessed studies on face masks and reviewed epidemiological reports on whether they reduce the number of people an infected person spreads the pathogen to -- the reproduction number of the virus. “The highly efficacious facemask, such as surgical masks with an estimated efficacy of around 70 per cent, could lead to the eradication of the pandemic if at least 70 per cent of the residents use such masks in public consistently,” the scientists, including Sanjay Kumar from the National University of Singapore, wrote in the study. “Even less efficient cloth masks could also slow the spread if worn consistently,” Kumar added. According to the scientists, one key aspect of face mask function involves the size of fluid droplets expelled from the nose and mouth when a person talks, sings, sneezes, coughs, or even simply breathes. They said larger droplets, with sizes around 5-10 microns, are the most common, adding that smaller droplets below 5 microns are possibly more dangerous. In comparison, the scientists said the human hair is about 70 microns in diameter. Among the many types of facemasks in use, such as cloth masks, surgical masks, and N95 masks, they said only the latter can filter out aerosol-sized droplets. The performance of face masks worn for many hours, such as by health care or other essential workers, impact how effective overall mask wearing can be, the researchers added. They found that face masks made of hybrid polymer materials could filter particles at high efficiency while simultaneously cooling the face since the fibres used in these allow heat to escape from beneath the mask. “There could be some relation between breathing resistance and the flow resistance of the face mask which will need to be studied for a face mask-wearing interval,” said Heow Pueh Lee, another co-author of the study. “Also, the environmental condition in the compartmental space within the face mask will need to be more accurately quantified using miniaturised sensors and the development of human replicas for such studies,” Lee said. Based on the analysis, the researchers underscored the importance of consistent use of efficient facemasks, such as surgical masks.

25-11-2020||World||China weighs legal steps against ‘diehard’ supporters of Taiwan independence||China is considering drawing up a blacklist of “diehard” supporters of Taiwan’s independence, the government said on Wednesday, which may see Beijing try to take legal steps against democratically-elected President Tsai Ing-wen.Taiwan condemned the plan after the pro-Beijing Hong Kong-based newspaper Ta Kung Pao first reported on it this month. China’s widely-read Global Times tabloid has said the list could include senior Taiwanese government officials.China claims self-governing Taiwan as its own territory. Taiwan’s government says the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, although China rejects this position.Zhu Fenglian, a spokeswoman for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said the “list of diehard Taiwan secessionists” now under consideration was only aimed at a very small number of independence supporters and those who fund them.“It is absolutely not aimed at the vast majority of Taiwan compatriots,” she told a regular news briefing in Beijing.Zhu did not give details or a timeframe, saying only that Beijing would take “targeted steps to severely punish in accordance with the law” those it viewed as hard-core backers of independence. Chinese media have said the 2005 Anti-Secession Law, which mandates the use of force if China judges Taiwan to have declared independence, as well as national security legislation, could be used to charge those on the list.It is unclear how that would play out, as Chinese courts have no jurisdiction in Taiwan, and Taiwan’s government leaders do not visit China.The moves follows Beijing’s July unveiling of new national security laws for Chinese-run Hong Kong that prescribe sentences ranging up to life terms for crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.Separately, Zhu said a Chinese court this week sentenced a Taiwanese citizen to four years in prison for espionage.Last month, Chinese state television ran a series of programmes featuring “confessions” by Taiwanese spies, which Taiwan described as entrapment and another reason for people to fear visiting China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-weighs-legal-steps-against-diehard-supporters-of-taiwan-independence/story-7a9ugPphWh1lZHGPiFYIgO.html
25-11-2020||World||Chinese vaccine maker seeks approval for public use of Covid-19 shot||A leading Chinese vaccine developer has applied for authorization to bring its Covid-19 vaccine to the market, seeking to get a jump on Western rivals as the race for a working shot against the pandemic enters the final stretch.China National Biotec Group Co. has submitted an application to Chinese regulators, reported state media Xinhua Finance on Wednesday, citing parent company Sinopharm’s vice general manager Shi Shengyi. The application likely includes data from the company’s Phase III human testing conducted in the Middle East and South America.Stocks related to Sinopharm Group, including its Hong Kong unit, surged on Wednesday after the news.A CNBG spokeswoman said she had no further information when contacted by Bloomberg. Calls to Sinopharm Group went unanswered.With the application, CNBG will likely become the first developer outside of Russia to see its shots made available for general public use, underscoring China’s determination to be a major player in supplying inoculations to countries around the world. Western drugmakers like Pfizer Inc. are only at the stage of seeking authorization for emergency use of their shots, a status China granted to its developers months ago.The race has taken on vital importance as countries look to more definitively re-open their economies and stem a pandemic that has sickened more than 59 million. Working vaccines are seen as the best hope as a fresh wave of infections is forcing nations to reintroduce lockdowns and other restrictions.A state-owned drugmaker that has a dominant share of China’s vaccine market, CNBG in April was among the world’s first to push experimental shots to the crucial final stage of human testing. The company’s research institutes developed two shots using an inactivated version of the virus to stimulate immune response, an approach widely adopted by many of the existing vaccines used around the world.Despite the fact that the vaccines haven’t yet received regulatory approval for widespread use, they have already been given to hundreds of thousands of people in China under an emergency-use program. That has raised concern among scientists of potential risks in using shots whose safety has yet to be thoroughly studied.CNBG has said that its phase III trials -- involving more than 50,000 people in countries from Argentina to Egypt -- have been progressing smoothly, and it has not received any reports of serious adverse events.Safety has become a major concern as drugmakers compress the vaccine development process from years to a matter of months. AstraZeneca Plc and Johnson & Johnson paused their trials after a participant developed an unexplained illness. Another Chinese frontrunner, Sinovac Biotech Ltd., also saw its trial briefly halted in Brazil after a participant died. All three trials resumed after investigators found no evidence that the events were caused by the vaccines.Pfizer said this month that the shot it co-developed with BioNTech has a protection rate of more than 90%. Russia later declared that its Sputnik V vaccine has achieved a protection rate of 92%. CNBG has not released any public data on the efficacy of its shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-vaccine-maker-seeks-approval-for-public-use-of-covid-19-shot/story-zOvDlbFrcK794sfAldbmSP.html

I will detail the press later on its contents pic.twitter.com/CO71Qz3PIEResponding to Pakistan’s move at the UN, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador, TS Tirumurti, took to Twitter and said, “The ‘dossier of lies’ presented by Pakistan enjoys zero credibility. Concocting documents and peddling false narratives is not new to Pakistan. The top Indian envoy further added that “Pakistan is a host to the world’s largest number of UN proscribed terrorists and entities. Remember Abbottabad!”The "dossier of lies" presented by Pakistan enjoys zero credibility. Concocting documents and peddling false narratives is not new to Pakistan, host to worlds largest number of UN proscribed terrorists and entities. Remember Abbottabad!@MEAIndia @DrSJaishankar @PMOIndiaOsama Bin Laden, the founder of the militant terrorist organisation al-Qaeda, was killed by US security forces in Abbottabad on May 2, 2011. He was shot in the head, during the firefight in the compound in Pakistan, where he was taking shelter.Pakistan had long denied his presence in the country.The presentation of the dossiers comes ahead of India joining the 15-member council for a two-year term starting January 1, 2021.On November 19, four terrorists were killed and two policemen were injured in a gun battle in Jammu and Kashmir’s Nagrota. The encounter broke out after a truck was intercepted in the morning during a routine check. Inspector-General of Police, Jammu Zone had said that it was possible that they were planning a big attack and targeting the upcoming District Development Council (DDC) elections in the Union territory. The terrorists were infiltrated in India using a 150-metre long tunnel.Meanwhile, Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla briefed a select group of head of missions in New Delhi about Pakistan’s direct role in planning the terror attack which was foiled by Indian security forces.ANI learned that heads of missions were provided a detailed information docket giving details of the incident as it transpired as well as list of items and ammunition that was recovered from terrorists clearly indicating their Pakistani origins.Sources said they were also briefed on how terrorists got into India, which is now clear as an underground tunnel has been found in the Samba sector.They said envoys were told how preliminary investigations by police and intelligence authorities and markings on the recovered AK-47 rifles and other items brought it out that terrorists belonged to JeM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remember-abbottabad-india-slams-pak-for-presenting-dossier-of-lies-at-un/story-LCnL8zJlbN3HKXfUbRFwkO.html
25-11-2020||World||Russia says vaccine 95% effective, roll-out in Jan||Russia on Tuesday said its Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine was 95% effective and would be cheaper and easier to store than some alternatives, as the global race heats up to develop a shot, even as some experts raised questions over the low number of cases reviewed.The vaccine will cost less than $10 a dose and be available in international markets from February 2021, said its developer Gamaleya Center and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the latest in a flurry of breakthroughs as several vaccine makers worldwide published preliminary data showing high efficacy rates in the last three weeks.Countries are hoping to begin inoculating their populations by year’s end or in early 2021 to stop a pandemic that has claimed the lives of nearly 1.4 million people. In statement on Tuesday, the vaccine’s developers said preliminary data after trials involving thousands of volunteers showed “an efficacy of the vaccine above 95%” after a second dose.“We are ready to start deliveries of Sputnik V to foreign markets, thanks to partnerships with manufacturers in India, Brazil, South Korea, China and four other countries,” Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) that has invested in production and promotion of the vaccine, told a virtual news conference.. Russia was one of the first to announce the development of a vaccine in August -- dubbed Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite -- but before the start of final clinical trials.The interim clinical trial data – Tuesday’s was the second when the trial hit 39 infections -- has found no unexpected adverse events during the trials and the monitoring of the participants is ongoing. The interim data will be published in a peer-reviewed international medical journal following the completion of Phase 3 trials. Russian citizens will be vaccinated free. “Sputnik V is now available for civil use in Russia, specifically for high-risk groups. Following the completion of the current Phase III trial, the ultimate goal is to voluntarily vaccinate approximately 70% of the population to end the pandemic in Russia. To this end, Russia is launching mass production of Gam-COVID-Vac using multiple production sites within the country,” said Dr Alexander Gintsburg, director general of the Gamaleya Scientific Research Institute, Moscow, in an email interview. India is set to begin adaptive Phase 2/3 clinical trials this week following a partnership between Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and RDIF in September. As part of the partnership, RDIF is supplying 100 million doses of the vaccine to Dr Reddy’s upon regulatory approval in India. Experts said the initial data appeared promising. “All the vaccines - whether mRNA or adenoviral - are looking promising from initial data. The most important part will be ability to prevent severe cases, deaths and ability to block asymptomatic infections to prevent transmission. This will be known better as we look deeper and wait longer to see how long the protection lasts,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi. The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vector platform – similar to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine -- that has proven safe and effective with no long-term side effects in more than 250 clinical trials globally during the past two decades. It uses two different human adenoviral vectors that allows for a stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to the vaccines using one or the same vector for two doses, the Gamaleya Institute said. “Sputnik V is a human adenovirus-based vaccine candidate and the only late-stage adenovirus-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate to use two different vectors for different injections, human adenovirus types Ad5 and Ad26. In vaccines that use the same vector in both injections, the immune system may launch defense mechanisms against the second one making the vaccine less effective,” said Gintsburg. The vaccine can be stored at between two and eight degrees Celsius, they develop said, referring to a freeze-dried formulation that will also be rolled out. Pharma giants Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their virus vaccine is 95% effective, while US company Moderna said last week early results showed its candidate was 94.5 percent effective. On Monday, Oxford-AstraZeneca announced their candidate too was up to 90% effective.Western experts have in the past expressed concern over Russia’s vaccine, fearing that its development could be rushed.“Over 50 countries have expressed interest in obtaining Sputnik V based on its currently known safety and efficacy profile, with preliminary applications already received for over 1.2 billion doses. RDIF has already announced several agreements with partners from India, Mexico, Brazil, Nepal, and Uzbekistan,” said Dr Gintsburg. Under current agreements, Sputnik V vaccine to be produced in India, Brazil, China, South Korea and other countries, for 500 million people per year, starting from 2021.The first international deliveries of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will be made in January 2021 based on the existing partnerships with foreign manufacturers, said RDIF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-vaccine-95-effective-roll-out-in-jan/story-19gSOFRPzoCRq88a6Dc5pM.html

The United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany do.Trudeau said it is understandable that an American pharmaceutical company will distribute first in the US before they distribute internationally.“Shortly afterwards they will start honoring and delivering the contracts that they signed with other countries including Canada,” Trudeau said. “We’re expecting to start receiving those doses in the first few months of 2021.”Trudeau said Canadians won’t have to wait for everyone in the US to be vaccinated before Canada gets doses.The issue was discussed at the G-20 this past weekend and Trudeau said he’s working with allies to make sure there is a free flow of contracts. He said countries recognize that “no one place gets through Covid-19 until all places are through Covid-19.”Trudeau said having pre-bought an array of vaccine candidates from foreign manufacturers will help get Canadians effective doses as soon as possible and noted Canada pre-bought millions of doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadians-won-t-be-among-the-first-to-get-vaccine-pm-justin-trudeau/story-zvVi3J5t95VEOTtsOWsioJ.html

It includes a 2.9 billion-pound, three-year program to help one million unemployed people find new roles, and 1.4 billion pounds to increase the capacity of job centers, it said in a statement.Sunak Sets Public Services at the Heart of UK Economic RevivalMeasures to slow the spread of the virus have shuttered businesses and caused a spike in unemployment in the UK, where the jobless rate surged to 4.8% in September -- the highest level in four years. The number of employees on payrolls in October was down 782,000 compared to March.“My number one priority is to protect jobs and livelihoods,” Sunak said Tuesday in a statement. The spending review will “ensure that no one is left without hope or opportunity,” he said.There will also be 138 million pounds of new funding for the lifetime skills guarantee announced in September by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. That’s part of a wider package for skills totaling 375 million pounds and including previously announced funding.The measures follow 13.7 billion pounds of job support announced in July, though Sunak later scrapped the biggest portion of that -- a job retention bonus program planned for January costing as much as 9.4 billion pounds -- after he instead extended the UK’s furlough program.The July plan also included a 2.1 billion-pound “Kickstart Scheme” to create job placements for 16 to 24-year-olds. On Wednesday, Sunak will allocate 1.6 billion pounds of that promised expenditure.The chancellor also plans to extend a program giving employers as much as 2,000 pounds for every new apprentice they hire. The program had been due to end on January 31, but will now run until March 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-to-pledge-5-7-billion-to-help-uk-unemployed-find-work/story-hiH8LV9aZ0Uyb7bRo2Y60M.html

While most of the mutations didn’t make much of a difference, one of them, however, turned out to be crucial, helping Covid-19 spread faster, the report says. “The mutation, known as 614G, was first spotted in eastern China in January and then spread quickly throughout Europe and New York City,” the report says. “Within months, the variant took over much of the world, displacing other variants.”Meanwhile, Michael Ryan, the head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that it’s “extremely important” for its international team to visit China to look into the origins of the coronavirus, confirming that the UN health agency has been reassured such a trip will happen “as soon as possible”.In China, hundreds of flights at Pudong airport were cancelled on Tuesday as Shanghai raced to bring a local Covid-19 outbreak under control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-mutation-made-covid-19-harder-to-stop-report/story-lukOMIlHk9ObKwskeXl7GL.html
25-11-2020||World||Biden welcomes national security team, says ‘America is back’||Joe Biden on Tuesday introduced the team of foreign policy experts he plans to nominate to his administration, led by Antony Blinken as secretary of state, as the president-elect seeks to calm international relations after a tumultuous four years under President Donald Trump.The appointees, all experienced in their fields, will work with Biden on his goal of restoring US relations with international organizations that Trump spurned in his “America First” approach to foreign policy. Biden has promised to seek multilateral approaches to common problems like climate change, the coronavirus pandemic and arms control.“It’s a team that reflects the fact that America is back,” Biden said. “Ready to lead the world, not retreat from it. Ready to confront our adversaries, not reject our allies. And ready to stand up for our values.”“This team meets this moment,” he said.A former deputy secretary of state in Barack Obama’s administration, Blinken will be tasked with rebuilding an agency hollowed out by a loss of top diplomats under Trump while reassuring longtime allies of the US commitment to international relationships.Blinken spoke movingly about his family’s journey to America, including his stepfather who escaped the Nazis as a child in Poland and greeted a US soldier with the only words he knew in English, “God Bless America.”Biden also named former Hillary Clinton aide Jake Sullivan as national security adviser and veteran foreign service officer Linda Thomas-Greenfield as ambassador to the United Nations, who would be the highest-ranking Black official named so far.Thomas-Greenfield, a career diplomat and a native of Louisiana, promised “Gumbo diplomacy” as a way to make politics personal.“Wherever I was posted around the world, I’d invite people of different backgrounds and beliefs to make a roux, chop onions for the holy trinity, and make homemade gumbo — my way to break down barriers, connect with people, and start to see each other on a human level: a bit of lagniappe as we say in Louisiana,” she said to nods from her fellow appointees.For his director of national intelligence, Biden has selected Avril Haines, a former top CIA official with years of experience in the espionage community who would fill a job that Trump had largely reserved for people better known for their loyalty to him.And as homeland security secretary, the president-elect has picked Alejandro Mayorkas, a former head of Citizenship and Immigration Services who would become the first Latino and immigrant to lead an agency that has played a central role in Trump’s widely criticized border crackdown. Mayorkas also served as deputy secretary of the department.Mayorkas, who came to the US from Cuba as a child, also spoke of his family’s American dream.“My father and mother brought me to this country to escape communism,” he said. “They cherished our democracy and were intensely proud to become United States citizens. As was I. I have carried that pride throughout my nearly twenty years of government service and throughout my life.”Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who served under Obama, was named climate envoy, a move to highlight Biden’s commitment to the issue.Biden has close relationships with Blinken, who is 58, and Sullivan, 43, who served stints as advisers on national security when he was vice president and worked with his campaign.Secretary of state is regarded as one of the most prestigious cabinet posts and is fourth in line for the presidency. Serving as the nation’s top diplomat, Blinken will meet directly with foreign leaders around the world and will fill an especially important job for Biden, the former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.National security adviser is a key post in the White House, serving as the gatekeeper of information from dozens of experts in military, diplomatic and intelligence agencies. UN ambassador is also an important post, serving as the voice of the administration on major global issues.Notably absent from the list is a nominee for defense secretary. Former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy had been the favorite for the job but Biden has not yet finalized his choice. Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is another contender for the job.Asked later why he had not named a leader for the Defense Department on Tuesday, Biden said he was creating his cabinet, “a piece at a time here.”In an essay in Foreign Affairs magazine earlier this year, Biden laid out a blueprint for “diplomacy as the United States’ principal tool of foreign policy,” laying out a process-oriented approach that would lean on “experienced and empowered professionals.”A graduate of Harvard and Columbia Law School, Blinken worked for Biden on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and his 2008 presidential campaign. After advising Biden as vice president, he served as deputy secretary of state and later co-founded WestExec Advisors, a political strategy firm.​As secretary of state, Blinken will lead Biden administration efforts to rejoin international agreements like the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal and is expected to oversee a tougher posture toward China.Biden’s spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said Biden would name an economics team next week. Bloomberg News reported that will be helmed by former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-welcomes-national-security-team-says-america-is-back/story-tSAEy5ozUSKrtZLp3EjkJM.html

25-11-2020||World||Will being vaccinated be must for air travel?||International travellers will need to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to fly with Australia’s Qantas, the company has said, the first major airline to suggest that such rules could become common across the industry.Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said late Monday the Australian flag carrier would implement the measure once a coronavirus vaccine was made available to the public.“We are looking at changing our terms and conditions to say for international travellers that we will ask people to have a vaccination before they can get on the aircraft,” he told Channel Nine television.“Whether you need that domestically, we will have to see what happens with Covid-19 in the market but certainly, for international visitors coming out (to Australia) and people leaving the country, we think that is a necessity.”Joyce predicted the rule would likely become standard practice around the world as governments and airlines currently consider the introduction of electronic vaccination passports.Other major regional airlines, however, said that it was too early to comment on what travel requirements might be when a vaccine becomes widely available. “We don’t have any concrete plans to announce at this point on the vaccine as it is still in development and will take time to distribute,” a Korean Air representative told AFP.Japan Airlines similarly said it had “no plans to require international travellers to have a vaccination” and is for now asking “passengers to follow rules of their destinations, such as taking tests”.Vaccination entry requirements are already widely used around the world, with many countries demanding travellers show they have been inoculated against yellow fever if they are coming from regions where the disease is endemic.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced late Monday it was in the “final stages” of developing a digital health pass that it says can be used to record Covid-19 tests or vaccinations and will “support the safe reopening of borders”.“We are bringing this to market in the coming months to also meet the needs of the various travel bubbles and public health corridors that are starting operation,” IATA director general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac said.Up in the airAustralia’s borders have effectively been closed since March to curb the spread of novel coronavirus, which has already claimed more than a million lives worldwide.The country has even limited the numbers of its own citizens allowed to return each week, leaving tens of thousands of Australians stranded overseas.The global airline industry has come under huge pressure from restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus.Qantas has grounded more than 200 planes and laid off 8,500 staff as it attempts to offset a US$1.9 billion loss caused by the collapse in demand for air travel.A slew of other carriers have collapsed because of the pandemic, including Virgin Australia, Chilean-Brazilian airline LATAM and Britain’s Flybe.IATA said in October that after a predicted 66-percent drop in global air traffic this year, airlines’ revenues are expected to be down by 46 percent in 2021 compared to 2019.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said Australia is seeking to create “travel bubbles” with other countries that have curbed the spread of the virus.But the country is unlikely to fully reopen to international travellers until a vaccine is widely available.The government also signalled in its recently released Covid-19 vaccination policy that Australia and other nations may introduce proof of inoculation as a condition of entry.Australia has been relatively successful in containing the coronavirus, recording just over 27,800 cases and 907 deaths since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-being-vaccinated-be-must-for-air-travel/story-Bf8L3FYYpltmSA5DUL5UNP.html
25-11-2020||World||Dow hits 30,000 points for first time as US stocks boom||The Dow surged past 30,000 points for the first time Tuesday as receding US political uncertainty and hopes for coronavirus vaccines offset worries over spiking Covid-19 cases.After crossing the threshold in mid-day trading, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated a few times throughout the afternoon before closing at 30,046.24, up 1.5 percent.The broad-based S&P 500 gained 1.6 percent to 3,635.41, also a record, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 1.3 percent to 12,036.79.Investors now feel more reassured that the United States can avoid a constitutional crisis over the transition of power following presidential elections earlier this month in which Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump.Trump still has not conceded his election defeat, but on Monday night, his administration officially authorized a transition, clearing the way for Biden to have access to funds, office space and the ability to meet with federal officials. Trump himself called the 30,000-point benchmark a “sacred” figure, touting it as a product of his administration’s efforts to advance vaccines, the progress of which he said was “absolutely incredible.”  ‘Another excuse’ Investors have already been cheered by an upbeat coronavirus vaccine announcement by British drugs group AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford as well as news that Biden will tap former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as treasury secretary.Yellen “is a known and respected face on the international scene,” said a note from High Frequency Economics, adding that the former Fed chair is not known as a hardline critic of Wall Street.Briefing.com analyst Patrick O’Hare recognized the latest Washington developments as “another excuse” for the market to rally in a holiday-shortened week when positive momentum is driving a “fear of missing out” trend.That outlook is based on expectations that the US economy will pick up speed in 2021 as vaccines become further available and hard-hit sectors such as travel and energy begin to recover.Markets are looking past near-term weakness tied to surging coronavirus cases.The Conference Board, a New York-based business research organization, reported consumer confidence fell slightly more than expected in November to 96.1 from its upwardly revised 101.4 in October, driven mostly by worsening forecasts for the months ahead.“Heading into 2021, consumers do not foresee the economy, nor the labor market, gaining strength,” senior director of economic indicators Lynn Franco said.“In addition, the resurgence of Covid-19 is further increasing uncertainty and exacerbating concerns about the outlook.”Within the Dow, industrials and financial companies were the biggest gainers in Tuesday’s session, with Boeing winning 3.3 percent, Chevron 5.0 percent, Goldman Sachs 3.8 percent and JPMorgan Chase 4.6 percent. Other big gainers included Disney, American Express and IBM.Among individual companies, Best Buy dropped 7.0 percent as it reported higher profits on strong sales but declined to offer financial forecasts due to the uncertainty of the pandemic.Dick’s Sporting Goods added 0.3 percent as it announced third-quarter profits more than tripled compared with the year-ago level to $177.2 million behind a 23.2 percent surge in same store sales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dow-hits-30-000-points-for-first-time-as-us-stocks-boom/story-tbLT816g7DiJoztbje2gJK.html

Officials said she is passionate about sharing her experience and knowledge of mindfulness, meditation and personal development with colleagues.“The workshops she has set up help and advise officers and staff – with more than 1,500 benefitting over the last year alone – on how to cope with life’s challenges. SHINE is run by a team of seven officers and the project is continuing to grow due to a huge demand for its services,” Scotland Yard said.Shortly after she launched the project, Deol had brain surgery and later highlighted SHINE’s importance by using the practices and techniques she learnt through the project to cope with the ordeal. The doctors were amazed how quickly she healed, from not being able to talk after surgery to returning to work within three months.Commissioner Cressida Dick said, “The awards celebrate the extraordinary work of our people, who day in, day out, work incredibly hard, protecting and serving the people of London. They include real acts of bravery, but also the complete determination it can take to bring offenders to justice.”She added, “It’s about people pushing themselves to be the best in their field; and about those who have gone above and beyond to protect a victim and get the justice they deserve. I am sure, like me, you will be humbled and inspired by their stories.”The awardees included Baljit Singh Badesha, a special police sergeant in Harrow, Barnet and Brent, who was given the Special Constabulary Award.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scotland-yard-award-for-brinder-deol-a-punjab-origin-constable/story-T80OfYizQXdtAI9QgebnyN.html
25-11-2020||World||Cambridge launches appeal for missing Darwin notebooks||The University of Cambridge’s library on Tuesday launched a public appeal to help locate two notebooks of the iconic naturalist and alumnus, Charles Darwin, one of which contains his landmark 1837 ‘Tree of Life’ sketch, missing since 2001.Following an exhaustive search, the library curators concluded that the priceless notebooks, first listed as missing in January 2001, have likely been stolen, the university said in the appeal on its websiteThe local police have been informed and the missing notebooks added to Interpol’s database of stolen artworks.The appeal launch on November 24 coincides with what is commonly known each year as Evolution Day – recognising the anniversary of Darwin’s publication of On the Origin of Species on November 24, 1859. Darwin (1809-1882) was a student at Christ’s College.Jessica Gardner, university librarian, said: “I am heartbroken that the location of these Darwin notebooks…is currently unknown, but we’re determined to do everything possible to discover what happened and will leave no stone unturned during this process”.“This public appeal could be critical in seeing the notebooks safely return, for the benefit of all, and I would ask anyone who thinks they may be able to help to get in touch. Someone, somewhere, may have knowledge or insight that can help us return these notebooks to their proper place at the heart of the UK’s cultural and scientific heritage.”The library said the notebooks were removed from the Special Collections Strong Rooms– where the rarest and most valuable items are kept – for photography to take place in September 2000, but a subsequent routine check found that the small box containing the two notebooks had not been returned to its proper place.For many years, previous librarians believed that the notebooks had been misplaced in the vast storerooms and collections of the library, which is home to around 10 million books, maps, manuscripts and other objects. Despite a number of searches over the years, they remained undiscovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cambridge-launches-appeal-for-missing-darwin-notebooks/story-z1lexKsvkV7lcSEITZuZ4N.html
25-11-2020||India||BJP’s victory run will stop in Bengal, says CM Mamata; promises more time for party||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) victory run will end in West Bengal next year, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said at a rally in Bankura district on Wednesday and accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) of helping the saffron camp. “The BJP will suffer a blow in national politics in 2021,” she said. “The BJP is a curse for the country. It has to be stopped. It did not win the Bihar assembly elections. It defeated others through manipulation,” said Banerjee. She announced that she was starting her assembly poll campaign from Bankura because the BJP won both the Lok Sabha seats in the district in 2019. Incidentally, while on a tour of Bankura on November 5, Union home minister Amit Shah had set the tone for the Bengal elections by asking BJP leaders to win more than 200 of the 294 seats. “I will take complete responsibility from now on. I was too involved in administrative duties and could not give so much time (to the party). That’s why I am starting with Bankura,” Banerjee said on Wednesday. She once again alleged that the lunch Shah and other BJP leaders had at the home of Bibhishan Hansda, a member of the tribal community at Chaturdihi village in Bankura, was cooked by a Brahmin brought from outside. The assembly polls in Bengal are due in about five months. The BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats. “I promise you (BJP) will not win a single assembly seat in Bankura next year,” said the chief minister at the rally held at Sanukpahari. “Some people think that if by chance you come to power they may make a fortune. Let me clarify that you stand no chance in the Bengal polls,” she added. “You are using Central probe agencies to scare some TMC leaders. I dare you to arrest me and put me in jail. I will ensure Bengal’s victory even from inside a jail,” said Banerjee. In her 45-minute speech, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief sent out a strong message to her own party leaders and workers and asked youth and student front leaders to work hard for the next six months and keep an eye on suspicious activities such as secret meetings at odd hours. “People are being lured with money and provoked to switch camps. I am keeping track of everything. I know who is contacting whom. Bengal does not surrender to the lure of money… Money was given to a lot of people before the Lok Sabha polls. We were not aware of that. But now we are on the alert and each and every person accepting money will be caught,” said Banerjee who was on a three-day tour of Bankura district. Banerjee sent a strong message to rebel leaders in the TMC without dropping names. “A lot of people are curious to know who will be the party’s election observers in Bankura, Midnapore, Jalpaiguri or other districts. Let me tell you I am the observer everywhere as a party worker, not as leader.” “CPI (M) leaders are greedy. BJP leaders are exploiters. TMC should be identified for its sacrifice,” she said. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh held a rally at Suri town in adjoining Birbhum district around the same time. “The TMC cannot win the polls through manipulation and intimidation. Central forces will be deployed near polling booths and local policemen will be posted far away. The nation cannot be safe as long as the BJP does not win Bengal because the TMC is turning it into a haven for terror outfits,” Ghosh said at the rally. Birbhum has a Muslim population of 37.06 % according to the 2011 census. Ghosh addressed the minority community in his speech. “Muslims have suffered the most in non-BJP-ruled states, including West Bengal. They will be safe once the BJP is in power. Nobody will touch the minority community members,” he said. Incidentally, while addressing a tea session at Suri town in the morning, Ghosh alleged that Bengal has witnessed more terror activities than Kashmir. “Ghosh should leave Bengal as he has no idea about this state,” said TMC MP and party spokesperson Saugata Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-victory-run-will-stop-in-bengal-says-cm-mamata-promises-more-time-for-party/story-H6Wcmm57dVjhiDDEQ1IshM.html

The twins, who were then 27-months-old, were first operated on August 28, 2017 by a team of 20 specialists and their heads were finally separated in another operation in October. While there was considerable improvement in the health condition of Jaga, Kalia’s recovery was comparatively slower as doctors said it would take him six more months to recover fully.After the post-operative rehabilitation and care in AIIMS New Delhi for almost 2 years, the twins returned to Odisha in September last year, but did not go back to their home in Kandhamal and remained at SCB Medical College under the supervision of a team of doctors. The parents of the kids were, however, apprehensive of lack of proper care in Odisha, but were convinced by the AIIMS doctors that there would be no issues. Their treatment was being done under a protocol developed by AIIMS Delhi.SCB doctors said Kalia had no issues till his condition deteriorated last week. “Five days ago, Kalia’s condition suddenly turned critical. Today, he developed septicemia and passed away,” said Dr Bhubanananda Maharana, emergency officer of the SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack.The conjoined twins born to auto rickshaw driver Bhuyan Kanhar and his wife Pushpanjali Kanhar in Milipada in Kandhamal district came to notice in July 2017 after the parents with the help of an NGO tried to seek treatment. The news caught the attention of the media and the Odisha government took full responsibility of the treatment and sanctioned Rs 1 crore. After due consultation, the twins were sent to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Craniopagus twins happen once in 3 million births, and 50% of those affected die within 24 hours. Half of such kids die either at birth or within 24 hours. They shared blood vessels and brain tissues, a very rare condition. In India, no twins fused at the head had been separated till Jaga and Kalia were separated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-of-conjoined-twins-separated-in-india-s-first-craniopagus-surgery-dies/story-rcaQjPBJgsbNUjYPmNuF2M.html

The chief minister, who held an emergency meeting with top police officials to review the law and order situation in the state, said he had got definite information about the plan of some forces to create communal tension in the state. He instructed the police officials to take stern action against such anarchic forces and said a free hand would be given to them to defeat such forces. KCR said during the ongoing electioneering for GHMC, certain leaders were trying to get political mileage through several conspiracies. First, they used social media to spread fake news and tried to divert people with morphed photos. Later they started making provocative statements, but the people did not fall into their trap, he said. “Now, they are trying to instigate communal clashes in Karimnagar, Warangal, Khammam and other places and campaign about them in Hyderabad. They want to create some trouble in Hyderabad at places of worship, so that there is communal violence in the city, as a result of which the GHMC polls are not held and postponed,” the chief minister said. Stating that maintenance of law and order in the state was top priority of the government, KCR said any attempt by any element to disturb peace and harmony would be dealt with firmly and anti-social elements, whoever they might be and even if they belonged to the ruling party, would be crushed with an iron hand. The chief minister also urged the people to be alert and cautious against those trying to spread communal hatred and clashes. He wanted people especially the youth to be cautious and warned they should not fall prey for those elements, who would try to stir up communal feelings. He also appealed to political parties to wage a democratic fight in the polls in a transparent manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-alerts-top-cops-about-possible-communal-violence-in-telangana-aimed-at-stalling-civic-polls/story-Bxlt68ziK11GN16Ga254iN.html
25-11-2020||India||Assam bracing up for final journey of beloved former CM Tarun Gogoi||The Assam government is making preparations for around 1,000 people to attend the last rites of former chief minister Tarun Gogoi, to be performed with full state honours at the Nabagraha cremation ground here on Thursday, Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.Sarma told reporters all arrangements will be ready by late tonight and the three-time former chief minister will be given a befitting farewell by the people of the state.“I have directed the authorities to prepare the venue in a manner fit for the occasion,” the minister said.Gogoi died on Monday after a four-month battle with Covid-19 and related complications.The cremation ground is being spruced up with a fresh coat of paint and workers of the Guwahati Municipal Corporation are also at the venue.Gogoi’s final journey will begin from Srimanta Sankardeva Kalakshetra, where his mortal remains have been kept for people to pay their last respects, at 9 am on Thursday.Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, his cabinet colleagues, family members of Gogoi, leaders of opposition parties, senior officials and Congress party workers would be present on the occasion.Traffic would be restricted in the area for a few hours till his body reaches the venue around 11 am.Regarding the choice of the venue, Sarma said it was “decided by the family and conveyed to us by the state Congress leadership.

25-11-2020||India||Meet 25-year-old Syed Areej Safvi, first Ladishah girl from Kashmir||For hundreds of years, Kashmir’s Ladishah, a form of folk genre, was dominated by men till modernity and militancy in the valley triggered its decline. Now a woman has emerged on the scene and caught the imagination of youth.Syed Areej Safvi, 25, has apparently become the first woman in Kashmir to write and perform Ladishah – a form of satire in verse, making commentaries on social and political conditions in the society. It is a type of folk ballad with humour forming an essential part of its presentation.Areej was introduced to this cultural form when she saw Ladishah being broadcast every Sunday on an Urdu TV news channel. It was penned by Kashmiri journalist Rajesh Raina and performed by Rajendra Tikoo. Apart from her love for Kashmir culture and language, the immediate trigger to write and perform Ladishah herself was brought after the constitutional changes which nullified the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year.“I always wanted to do something for Kashmir and its culture and language. I love listening to Ladishah personally. Mostly I would follow Rajendra Tikoo ji performing Ladishah every Sunday. And I wrote my first Ladishah in December 2019 on PSA (Public Safety Act) being used against Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti,” Areej said.“Ladishah has social messaging. It is an alternative opinion about issues in the society and I am very passionate about this and want to do more on public speaking and social activism,” she said.Ladishah is traditionally performed on stage, in street plays wearing traditional dress like a turban and playing an instrument with hands – a small thin iron rod with iron rings which would make a ringing sound. The person would sing critical commentaries using a comical tone and tenor to bring home the point while taking on the establishment or the people. Areej has adopted the content along with the tone and tenor but does not use the instrument so far. While the traditional Ladishah used the platforms of open stage, theatre and then TV and radio, Areej uploaded her videos on her YouTube channel, occasionally wearing a traditional Karakuli cap over her headgear. The videos are becoming popular among the youth.“After I uploaded the videos, I realised that I am the first female to do this. Iwas expecting a huge backlash but on the contrary I got huge support. There have been hate messages, people who try to pull me down but usually I ignore them,” she said.Areej, a resident of Old City’s Alamgari Bazar, graduated in humanities and is pursuing post graduation in psychology. From the very beginning she says that she has been interested in writing, particularly Urdu language and poetry. She has been commenting on issues and writing Gazals before dwelling into the genre of Ladishah.Her themes are not only social but even political, criticising not only society but even the establishment. She has performed Ladishah on arrest of journalists, 4G internet ban, VPN, women’s issues, extravagance in marriages, among others. The only child of her parents, she said that her father and mother have been supportive but there are people in the extended joint family who are not comfortable with her choice.“It needs huge courage and patience to do anything in our society. I love this so nothing can stop me. There are people who are not okay with what I am doing but I am trying to convince them about my choice,” she said.She said that she was getting messages from youngsters particularly women. “There are people who now say that if she can do this we can also pursue our choices. There have been women who texted me and said: ‘Thank you very much, now our parents also think that we can do whatever we like’,” she said.ZareefAhmad Zareef, a 77-year-old satirical poet of Kashmir who retired as cultural officer of J&K government, said that he had only witnessed men performing Ladishah.“I had not seen any woman in Ladishah till now. It is a forward movement. Ladishah has been a traditional character of Kashmir culture and if Areej really wants to turn her interest into an art, if a new chapter of this art form has to begin, she has to wholeheartedly adopt this, including its instrument,” he said.Those associated with writing Ladishah say that it had gone into oblivion due to the situation in Kashmir valley. Zareef, who has been writing Ladishah for Doordarshan and theatre before the militancy erupted in the valley in 1989, said that the art form has been in decline.“Before militancy, we used to have drama as well as Ladishah regularly at Tagore Halland also at drama clubs in old city,” he said.He said that Ladishah has been part of Band Pather – folk theatre of Kashmir performed in open spaces even during the time when Kashmir was ruled by Maharajas. “Band Pather with its live performance and special costumes used to be a form of entertainment for the kings and commons from old times. And when there was a need for a break during the performance, a Ladishah would come out to present its solo performance,” he said.He said that Ladishahs were critical but full of humour. “If people wanted to convey their problems to the king, Ladishah would present it humorously so that it makes him aware of the issue but does not annoy him at the same time,” he said.He said that Ladishahs would go from village to village and visit the city to perform.“In villages, he would be given rice while in cities he would get some bucks for his performance,” he said.Some cultural experts say that Ladishah was hundreds of years old and was impromptu.Dr Rafiq Masoodi, former secretary cultural academy and former additional director general Doordarshan, said that Ladishah is the purest form of Kashmiri folklore.“As per experts like MY Taing, Ladishah is over 1500 years old. It is all unscripted like Wanwun (Kashmiri women singing rhythmically on special occasions like Eid),” he said.He said that it was part of Bhand Pather but later progressed as it developed its own costume.“Ladishah would visit from door to door and compose his creation on the spot depending on the surroundings and then collect offerings. That has been the beauty of Ladishah,” he said. However, he believes that it should not be modified to make it modern. “Acting should not be mixed in it. Things get lost after mixing,” he said. “I saw Areej performing and gave her my blessings. I also gave her some suggestions which she accepted,” he said.Some feel that the reach of new technology is helping these types of traditional practices to reach youth.RajeshRaina, 49, a senior journalist who has been writing Ladishah weekly for a newschannel for the past eight years, said that this art form was dying, particularly after the introduction of TV, radio and cinema.“Ladishah is close to my heart from the beginning but broadcast media like TV and radio gave it a blow. Now there was some interest among the new generation with the percolation of digital media,” he said.He said that his interest in Ladishah was triggered by his fascination for this form since childhood. “I used to watch Ladishah on stage in Akingam which was my maternal home. From childhood it was in my mind and when I joined a TV channel as an editor I decided to introduce it. I have been writing Ladishah for the past 8-9 years mostly on current issues but unfortunately we are not able to incorporate much humour as every other day sad things happen in Kashmir,” he said.He said that Areej performing Ladishah was an encouraging sign.“Ladishah was a male dominated genre but now a girl from Kashmir is coming forward which is a big thing. People are also appreciating that girls are now coming forward to even adopt Ladishah. We should encourage her,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meet-25-year-old-syed-areej-safvi-first-ladishah-girl-from-kashmir/story-56D9ImzAaz7o278IViK8BP.html

The BJP-aligned Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) will not participate in the strike. “The platform of Central Trade Union organisations namely INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC and independent sectoral federations and associations are organising nationwide strike on 26th November 2020,” the statement said. The united front of farmer organisations -- AIKSCC -- has also extended its support to the general strike and would be mobilising their members in rural areas to express solidarity with the striking workers. The strike is to protest against the new farm and labour laws, among others, as well as to raise various demands. Scheme workers, domestic workers, construction workers, beedi workers, hawkers, vendors, agricultural workers, self-employed in rural and urban areas have also decided to come on to the streets for ‘chakka jam’. In many states, auto and taxi drivers have also decided to keep off the roads. The federations of railway and defence employees have decided to have large mobilisation on the day to express their solidarity with the strike and the demands of the unions. “As part of the activities, our Delhi units are organising industrial strikes in the industrial areas of Delhi and also making humble gathering at Jantar Mantar near crossing of Parliament Street and Tolstoy Marg (at) 12 noon,” the statement said. National leaders of central trade unions would be present and would also address the gathering. The demands of the joint platform include cash transfer of Rs 7,500 per month tor all non-income tax paying families and 10 kilograms free ration per person per month to all needy people. The unions have also demanded expansion of MGNREGA, the rural employment guarantee scheme, to provide 200 days’ work in a year in rural areas at enhanced wages and also extension of the employment guarantee to urban areas. They have also asked the government to withdraw all “anti-farmer laws and anti-worker labour codes and stop privatisation of public sector, including the financial sector and stop corporatisation of government-run manufacturing and service entities like railways, ordinance factories, ports etc”. Among other demands, the unions have sought withdrawal of the “draconian circular on forced premature retirement of government and PSU employees”. Other demands of the unions include ‘pension to all’, scrapping NPS (National Pension System) and restoration of earlier pension with improvement in EPS-95 (Employees’ Pension Scheme-1995 run by retirement fund body EPFO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trade-unions-to-go-on-nationwide-strike-on-thursday/story-ra1cS9mNx7MNoycI9QbhVO.html
25-11-2020||India||Citing delays, Maharashtra exempts airlines’ crew from mandatory Covid test||The Maharashtra government has granted special exemption to cabin and cockpit crew of all airlines at all airports in the state from undergoing the mandatory reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.The decision comes after national carrier Air India had written to the state government to exempt them from the tests as they operate daily passenger and cargo flights to and from the state.Air India spokesperson confirmed that the airline had requested Maharashtra government to exempt their crew members from RT-PCR tests. The notice issued to all the municipal collectors by the state government on Wednesday read, “The state government has received requests from Air India stating that it is operating Vande Bharat flights and various cargo flights in and out of Maharashtra on a daily basis. The national carrier is currently operating around 42 daily flights to and from Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA). The state government observed that the Covid RT-PCR test, that has been made compulsory for all persons arriving at the airports, leads to delay in scheduling of flights. The government hence decided to exempt all the crew from this test.“All on duty cockpit and cabin crew of all the airlines carrying valid identity cards be exempted from RT-PCR test at all airports in Maharashtra subject to following of all necessary Covid related protocols by the respective airlines in the said regard.”Passengers arriving in Mumbai and other cities in the state however were seen to be confused on the new state norms on RT-PCR tests. Twitter was flooded with passengers’ doubts directed at Mumbai airport officials and also to the airlines. While some enquired if the test could be done on arrival at Mumbai, others asked if passengers booked on connecting flights from Mumbai also needed to undergo the Covid test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/citing-delays-maharashtra-exempts-airlines-crew-from-mandatory-covid-test/story-3NrWL3PI98dmxdxMIjBkFL.html
25-11-2020||India||Pandemic has redefined storytelling: Manoj Joshi||Actor Manoj Joshi says with the pandemic-enforced new normal, cinema too is redefining itself. “The thought process of writers and view-point of the audience both has changed. In coronakaal, I feel the focus will be more on rustic and real stories. Superstars ruling the roost, this won’t happen anymore!”Best known for his role of Chanakya in serial ‘…Ashoka’ and a string of films, Joshi is currently shooting for ‘Dehati Disco’ in Lucknow.“Realistic cinema, that we saw in the 80s and 90s, is back. ‘Aajkal mitti ki kahani banne lagi hai’ and substance-oriented stories are being made. With character-driven cinema being made, actors like us have started getting good roles. From better it has become best for us,” said the ‘Ready’ actor.Talking about his new project he said, “This film (with Ganesh Acharya) is also a rooted story where we are showing that we have so much in our culture that we don’t need to get carried away with Western influences. In UP alone, we have Bundelkhand, Purvanchal, Western UP or Awadh and there is so much to be told.”Joshi has been acting for the last 30 years, though his first commercial film was ‘Sarfrosh’ in 1997. “Today nepotism and groupism is a hot topic but it always existed in the film industry and everywhere. But I did not care about it and kept working as ‘kaam se hi kaam milta hai!’ God is kind enough that I am working in all media in three languages.”Talking about his UP connection, he said, “I have shot a film with Raghuvir Yadav, ‘Kashi In Search of Ganga’ and ‘Ram Ki Janmbhoomi’. My play ‘Chanakya’ has been staged in not just in most major cities of UP but in villages too.“From achar (pickle) to ‘itr’ or my favourite Chikankari clothes, I always pick something or the other from Lucknow. Though I am a vegetarian yet I relish a lot of delicacies at this place which is a delight for non-vegetarians,” he said.Joshi was also invited to the chief minister’s office for suggestions related to the upcoming film city in Noida. “I was here with my friend and producer Nitin Desai and gave my input to the government,” he said, expressing a desire to work in a film on Pt Deendayal Upadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pandemic-has-redefined-storytelling-manoj-joshi/story-Tjxdk0VFq36aEYCLh8Ch3K.html
25-11-2020||India||LU days helped Jalota musically!||‘Bhajan Samraat’ and Padma Shri recipient Anup Jalota says learning of Hindi literature from Lucknow University helped him a lot in his career. “I got knowledge about writers and poets from LU which came in useful since I sing bhajan. My understanding of the language and ‘bhaav’ (expression) has helped me in my musical presentations,” said the singer. He performed on the campus from where he passed out in 1973 and dedicated composition ‘Sabse sunder vishwavidyalay’ during the centennial celebrations. During his LU days, his subjects were political science, sociology, Hindi literature and English. “Talk about LU and its faculty and the beautiful-sprawling campus comes to mind. Another highlight was IT College in close vicinity which was a big attraction for boys. I was a brilliant student but I did not have any interest in studies,” he says with a hearty laugh. The singer recalled an anecdote, “English mujhe zyada samajh nahi aati thi so I just attended only one class. Theatre legend Raj Bisaria saheb was our professor. He knew that I used to sing but bunk classes, so when he saw me in class he said, ‘Aapne takleef kyon ki…jaiye kahi gana-wana gaiye.’ And, I walked out!” His hobbies were music and drama. “In the same period, I was leaning classical music at Bhatkhande Music Institute and was doing small stage performances as well. Then I used to sing film songs ‘Musafir hoon yaron’ and ‘Main shayar to nahi’ on stage. I was participating in all inter-university cultural functions and used to win so people used to love me a lot. I used to compose as well.” Acting too was his hobby. “I used to do lot of drama and that is why I like acting too and people recently saw me recently in OTT series ‘Pataal Lok’ and audience will see me lot more on screen.” At the age of 16, he gave audition at All India Radio in Lucknow but failed. “Then I gave audition in Allahabad and today I have been awarded special top grade by AIR,” he recalls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lu-days-helped-jalota-musically/story-4A0SGTQoePAfi1fnGZ7jxH.html
25-11-2020||India||India, Bahrain to strengthen Covid-related cooperation||India and Bahrain said on Wednesday they will strengthen their Covid-19-related cooperation and enhance their ties in key areas such as defence, maritime security, space technology and trade and investment. These matters figured in visiting external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s meetings with Bahrain’s top leadership. The minister is currently on a three-nation trip to the extended neighbourhood that will also take him to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Seychelles. “Both sides affirmed to further strengthen their Covid-related cooperation. They also expressed satisfaction on operationalisation of [an] air bubble arrangement between the two countries,” said a statement from the external affairs ministry. Jaishankar and his Bahrain counterpart Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani discussed bilateral, regional and global issues, including cooperation in dealing with post-Covid-19 challenges. “They agreed to further strengthen the historic India-Bahrain ties, including in areas of defence and maritime security, space technology, trade and investment, infrastructure, IT, fintech, health, hydrocarbon and renewable energy,” the statement said. Jaishankar thanked the leadership of Bahrain for hosting more than 300,000 Indians and “taking exceptional care of the community during the Covid-19 pandemic”. Bahrain’s leadership appreciated the Indian community’s contribution to development and the aid provided by India during the pandemic, including medicines, medical equipment and medical professionals. Besides the foreign minister, Jaishankar met Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa and deputy prime minister Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa Al Khalifa. He conveyed the Indian government’s condolences on the death of Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the former prime minister, and recalled his contributions in strengthening bilateral relations and for the welfare of the Indian community in Bahrain. Jaishankar also interacted with leaders of the Indian community in virtual mode. He visited the 200-year-old Shreenathji temple in Manama. The temple and the “Little India” around it stand testimony to the friendship between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bahrain-to-strengthen-covid-related-cooperation/story-pQ8i6PDZXLKJAtOc3p1iVL.html
25-11-2020||India||Kashmir not on agenda of OIC foreign ministers’ meet||The Kashmir issue is not on the agenda of a meeting of foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to be held in Niger during November 27-28, resulting in consternation in Pakistan, which has sought to repeatedly raise the matter at international forums. A statement issued by Pakistan’s Foreign Office on Wednesday to announce foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s participation in the meeting of the OIC’s council of foreign ministers claimed the two-day session will discuss a range of issues facing the Muslim world, including the “Jammu and Kashmir dispute”. However, official statements issued by OIC in English and Arabic make no mention of the Kashmir issue being on the agenda for the meeting. The Pakistani foreign ministry’s statement further said Qureshi intended to highlight the “aggravating human rights and humanitarian situation” in Jammu and Kashmir in the aftermath of India’s decision to scrap the erstwhile state’s special status in August 2019. OIC’s official statements quoted the organisation’s secretary general Yousef Al-Othaimeen as saying that the meeting of the foreign ministers, being held with the theme of “United against terrorism for peace and development”, has an agenda that includes “topics and issues of concern to the Muslim world”. “In addition to the Palestinian cause, the fight against violence, extremism and terrorism, Islamophobia and defamation of religious, the Council will discuss the situation of Muslim minorities and communities in non-member states, fundraising for the Rohingya cause at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), as well as the promotion of dialogue among civilisations, cultures and religions, and other emerging matters,” the English statement said, without making any reference to the Kashmir issue. The statement in Arabic too was silent on the Kashmir issue. The development comes at a time when Pakistan’s relations with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), both key players in the 56-member OIC, are strained. Saudi Arabia has sought the early repayment of a $3-billion loan provided to the Imran Khan government in 2018 after it was irked by Islamabad’s criticism of Riyadh’s position on the Kashmir issue. After being rebuffed by the Saudi leadership on the Kashmir issue, Prime Minister Imran Khan had made an unsuccessful attempt to forge a new grouping of Islamic countries with Turkey and Malaysia. On Wednesday, UAE temporarily suspended issuing visas to citizens of Pakistan, Afghanistan and some other countries over security concerns. The UAE too has been cool to Pakistan’s overtures on the Kashmir issue. The Indian government has worked to strengthen ties with countries in West Asia, a major source of energy and home to some nine million expatriates, in the past few years. In 2019, Pakistan had been irked when former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj was invited as a guest of honour to address the plenary session of the meeting of foreign ministers of OIC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-not-on-agenda-of-oic-foreign-ministers-meet/story-JxV8Naq7fpy83HPV8fM8cL.html

25-11-2020||India||Maha govt exempts on-duty cockpit and cabin crew from mandatory Covid-19 tests||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday exempted on-duty cockpit and cabin crew members of all airlines from the mandatory RT-PCR test across airports in the state. The exemption, however, will be subjected to following all necessary Covid-related protocols by the respective airlines, Maharashtra Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar said in an order. The exemption was granted after the state government received a request from the national carrier Air India in this regard, the order stated. In its revised standard operating procedures on preventive measures to check the spread of Covid-19 in the state, issued on November 23, the state government made it mandatory for all persons seeking to enter the state from Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Goa to carry RT-PCR negative reports amid the rising number of cases in these states. “The state government has received a request from Air India stating that it is operating Vande Bharat flights and multiple cargo flights in and out of Maharashtra on a regular basis. “This involves a large number of flight and cockpit crew (pilots and cabin crew) to travel into Maharashtra from various states to either operate or be positioned for flight duties on a daily basis,” the order said. However, as per the guidelines of the state, Covid RT-PCR (Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction) has been made compulsory for all persons arriving at the airport, which leads to delay in scheduling in flights, it said. “In the light of the above state, it is stated that henceforth all on duty cabin crew and cockpit crew of all airlines carrying valid identity cards be exempted from RT-PCR test at all airports in Maharashtra subject to following of necessary Covid-related protocols by the respective airlines in the said regard,” the order stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-govt-exempts-on-duty-cockpit-and-cabin-crew-from-mandatory-covid-19-tests/story-n6q0vkLrkx3r317kmntW0J.html

Gogoi’s last rites are scheduled to be performed on Thursday afternoon at Nabagraha crematorium in Guwahati and the half-holiday coincides with it. Earlier, the government had announced a three-day state mourning. “The state government of Assam expresses profound sorrow at the sad demise of Shri Tarun Gogoi, former chief minister of Assam. As a mark of respect to the departed soul, the government of Assam has declared half-holiday at 1 pm on the day of cremation on November 26,” said an order issued by the general administration department. “During this period, all state government offices, semi government offices, public sector undertakings, corporations, boards, educational institutions etc. will remain closed,” the order added. Gogoi’s body is at present kept at Srimanta Sankardeva Kalakshetra in Guwahati for the public to pay last respects. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi along with two party general secretaries KC Venugopal and Jitendra Singh arrived in Guwahati on Wednesday morning to pay last respects to Gogoi. Gandhi landed at Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport on a chartered flight from Goa and went straight to Srimanta Sankardeva Kalakshetra. From there he went to Gogoi’s official residence in Guwahati to meet the former leader’s family members including wife Dolly and son Gaurav, a Lok Sabha MP from Assam. “Gogoiji was not just a leader of Assam. He was a formidable chief minister and a national leader. He inspired us by bringing the people of Assam together and by bringing peace to the state,” said Gandhi. “I spent many hours with him and he was my teacher, my guru and he explained to me like nobody can on what Assam is, what its people are and the complexities and beauties of the state,” he added. Gandhi along with Venugopal left for Delhi on Wednesday itself whereas Singh, who is also the party in-charge for Assam, stayed back to attend the cremation. “On Thursday, Gogoi’s body will be taken to his official residence early in the morning for some rituals. From there it will be taken in a procession to a church, a mosque, two temples and a ‘naam-ghar’ (prayer house) before being taken to the cremation site,” informed state Congress president Ripun Bora.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-declares-half-day-holiday-tomorrow-as-mark-of-respect-for-former-cm-tarun-gogoi/story-32mNDOCXdveicnJXwV09KL.html

25-11-2020||India||Jagan Reddy launches interest-free loans scheme for Andhra street vendors||The YSR Congress Party government in Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday launched yet another welfare scheme - Jagananna Thodu (Brother Jagan’s support) - aimed at providing interest-free loans to small traders and street vendors in the state. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy inaugurated the scheme in a virtual mode from his camp office at Tadepalli in Amaravati. He deposited Rs 905 crore in the account of 9.05 lakh small traders towards reimbursement of interests on bank loans. Interacting with beneficiaries through video conferencing mode, the chief minister said small and petty vendors and artisans won’t have to go for private borrowing at high interest rates hereafter and could obtain hassle-free loans from the banks under Jagananna Thodu scheme to cater to their working capital. “Hitherto, banks were not providing loans to these roadside vendors as they come under unorganised sector. But now, they can get the bank loans under the new scheme. The government themselves will arrange loans to these vendors through village volunteers and welfare assistants of village and ward secretariats who would identify the beneficiaries and submit the lists to the banks,” he said. Through this scheme, the banks would provide loans to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore to nearly 10 lakh people and the government would bear the interest of Rs 60 crore to Rs 100 crore annually. Assuming that the loan repayment period is 10 years, the government will be spending Rs 1,000 crore towards reimbursement of interest, the chief minister said. He said the banks shall credit the loan amount of Rs 10,000 to the beneficiaries’ accounts within a week or 10 days. The beneficiaries will also be provided with QR-based smart ID cards and if they repay the loan amount in the given timeline, the state government shall reimburse the interest once in every three months directly to the beneficiaries’ accounts, making them eligible to take the next loan. The beneficiaries eligible for loans under Jagananna Thodu scheme include vegetable vendors, fruit vendors, small shopkeepers, pushcart vendors, and traditional artisans. “If any eligible person was not covered in this scheme, they can still apply through volunteers, and upon verification, they will be provided with the scheme benefits in a month or two. Also, they can call on the 1902 toll-free number to get enrolled,” Jagan said. Opposition Telugu Desam Party described the scheme as a mere publicity stunt by the Jagan government. “The scheme is actually a Centrally sponsored scheme launched by the NDA government in May as part of Atma Nirbhar Bharat package in the name of “Pradhan Mantri Swanidhi,” TDP official spokesman K Pattabhi said. He said as per the Central scheme, small loans to the extent of Rs 10,000 would be provided to 50 lakh petty traders and roadside vendors towards working capital. The scheme had already been under implementation in other states including Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, he pointed out. “Now, the YSRCP government is giving a big build up as if it is a new scheme and issuing full-page advertisements in the media causing huge burden on the state exchequer,” the TDP leader alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-launches-interest-free-loans-scheme-for-andhra-street-vendors/story-PVlclKEmsTSqdJYog38FWO.html

25-11-2020||India||Flood relief kits given by Rahul Gandhi found abandoned in his constituency Wayanad||Thousands of flood-relief food kits provided by Congress MP from Wayanad (north Kerala) Rahul Gandhi were found abandoned in a vacant shop in Nilambur in Malappuram district. The “criminal waste” triggered widespread criticism from many quarters including local residents and Left leaders. Embarrassed district Congress president V V Prakash has ordered an inquiry into the incident. Rotten food kits carrying the photo of Gandhi and printed MP in bold were found when a vacant shop which was closed for many months was opened. “We have no idea how it happened. It is really unfortunate. But those responsible won’t be spared,” the DCC president said adding he also informed the state leadership about this. Wayanad had witnessed numerous landslides after heavy rains during the last monsoon. The Congress leader who emerged victorious from the seat in 2019 elections had promptly responded and rushed enough food kits to his constituency. A truck-load of such food kits were found abandoned on Wednesday. Later, CPI (M) workers carried out a protest rally in the area alleging Congress leaders did it deliberately. “Many such consignments were lying and rotting in many places. It is criminal negligence. These kits were meant for flood-affected poor people. It exposes local Congress leaders’ callous attitude. Hope Rahul Gandhi will notice this,” said Nilambur MLA PV Anwar. A local resident said most of the kits were rotten and some had maggots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flood-relief-kits-given-by-rahul-gandhi-found-abandoned-in-his-constituency-wayanad/story-7y5UdUKzTfdWahPmK2klON.html
25-11-2020||India||‘Why is BJP talking about Bin Laden, Pakistan in Hyderabad polls’: KTR||Telangana Rashtra Samithi working president and state minister for municipal administration KT Rama Rao on Wednesday accused Bharatiya Janata Party of whipping up religious passions and stoking communal fire in Hyderabad to gain a few seats in the elections to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation to be held on December 1. “How can a leader of a responsible national party like BJP talk about conducting surgical strikes on the old city of Hyderabad? Why do they have such an utter hatred toward Muslims? Why do they talk about Babur, Bin Laden and Pakistan in local elections like GHMC, as if there are no other issues concerning the people of the city?” the TRS leader asked in an interaction with the media. He sought to know what the NDA government was doing when Rohingyas were allegedly entering the country illegally. “International borders are monitored by the Centre, not the TRS. What was it doing in the last six years? Why have they allowed the so-called illegal migrants? Who gave them Aadhaar cards?” he asked. Telangana BJP president and parliamentarian Bandi Sanjay on Tuesday kicked up a controversy stating that if his party captured power in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation in the December 1 elections, it would carry out “surgical strikes” on the Muslim-dominated old city of Hyderabad to drive away Rohingyas and pro-Pakistani people living illegally.KTR, as chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s son is popularly known, lashed out at Union minister Prakash Javadekar for releasing a “charge sheet” against the state government, calling it as a “MIM-TRS Sarkar,” and using the picture of Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi along with the chief minister. “Does Javadekar have any shame? Is MIM a part of the TRS cabinet? It clearly shows the BJP’s utter contempt towards Muslims,” he said. He pointed out that it was the BJP which had forged an alliance with the PDP to form the government in Kashmir. “That shows its political opportunism. But in Hyderabad, we never had an alliance with the MIM, but fought against it in the elections. In the last GHMC elections, the TRS had won five seats in the MIM-dominated old city. This time, we are going to win at least 10 seats defeating MIM,” KTR said. The TRS working president said the reason why the BJP should not win the GHMC elections was that it would create communal disturbances in the city. “Though the law and order will still be under the control of the TRS government, the BJP will foment trouble in the otherwise peaceful Hyderabad and that will disturb the tranquillity in the entire Telangana. Was it not the BJP which triggered communal violence in Delhi recently?” he asked. KTR said the BJP was banking on communal divide to garner votes in the GHMC elections, as it had no other achievement to talk about. “The BJP-led NDA government had meted out step-motherly treatment to Telangana. When there were floods in Karnataka, the Modi government released Rs 669 crore immediately and in Gujarat floods, Modi toured personally and announced Rs 500 crore relief. But when Hyderabad suffered worst-ever floods, not a single rupee has been released till date,” he alleged. He described as “idiotic” the argument of the BJP leaders that the state had got sufficient funds under disaster relief funds. “It is a statutory allocation due to the state and would have come even if there were no floods. How much additional money did the Centre release to the state?” he asked. The TRS leader further said the BJP had no right to seek votes from the youth, as it had cancelled the prestigious Information Technology Investment Region project sanctioned to Hyderabad by the previous UPA government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-bjp-talking-about-bin-laden-pakistan-in-hyderabad-polls-ktr/story-NoBV3jt5cMDniyVmPKAKwM.html
25-11-2020||India||Niti releases compendium on Covid practices by states/UTs||Government think tank Niti Aayog on Wednesday released a compendium of practices that states and union territories have adopted for containing and managing the outbreak of coronavirus.The compendium was released by Niti Aayog member V K Paul and Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant.“While there is much to be gained by learning from global practices for tackling the pandemic, it is equally important to take note of practices that are grounded in our realities. “Instead of expecting every state to reinvent the wheel, dissemination of such practices allows them to learn from each other and help find solutions to common problems,” Kant said in the foreword.          The government think tank in a statement said it reached out to all states and union territories by email and telephonically, requesting them to share any practices that they believe had been useful for Covid-19 mitigation and management.         The statement further said the practices in the compendium have been arranged under six sections - public health and clinical response, governance mechanisms, digital health, integrated model,  welfare of migrants and other vulnerable groups, and other practices.According to the statement, practices adopted by states/UTs in the fight against Covid-19 range from preparation of comprehensive route maps for contact tracing to operationalization of mobile vans for testing and providing essential health services to the doorsteps of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/niti-releases-compendium-on-covid-practices-by-states-uts/story-bCxOcQB0xediGf58jMpycJ.html

25-11-2020||India||“I had to learn and unlearn a lot to carve a niche for myself”||With a career spanning over two decades, actor Amar Upadhyay feels things have changed completely over the years and competition has grown manifold. “I have been a part of it all. I have not just seen but also been part of the boom with the iconic show ‘Kyunki Saas Bhi...’ that was a trendsetter. It’s not that there was no competition then but on a very small scale as there were only a few channels. But today the competition has gone up so we have to raise the bar too,” said the ‘LOC Kargil’ actor. Remembering his earlier days, the suave actor said, “My acting journey started much before ‘Kyunki.... I started by doing ads then the comedy ‘Dekh Bhai Dekh’ happened when I was just 17. This show gave me first taste of success. Later, I tried my hands in reality show and enjoyed my stint there too. So it has been a fulfilling journey. I had to learn and unlearn a lot to carve a niche for myself as a performer.” Amar is absolutely thrilled to be back on television in a new avatar. Talking about his new show, he said, “It’s a wish come true for me because I’m doing a show with Ekta (Kapoor) again so it’s like home coming for me. Also the show has given me a character that I always wanted to play. I have to learn the Haryanvi accent. I hope my character of Virendra Pratap Singh in the show ‘Molkki’ will be appreciated by all.” On his upcoming projects, Amar said currently other than TV he was busy with three films, including ‘Kagaz’, where he plays an antagonist, a cameo in ‘Bob Bishwas’ and Bhool Bhulaiyaa-2. It was being shot in Lucknow suburbs when the lockdown happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/i-had-to-learn-and-unlearn-a-lot-to-carve-a-niche-for-myself/story-B6okPUm3NFj2nAW4B7XnKK.html
25-11-2020||India||Shiv Sena is not Maharashtra: Fadnavis||Senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday said the Shiv Sena is not Maharashtra, and asserted that it was his party which worked towards protecting the identity of the state when it was in power for five years.He also accused the Sena of labelling those who levelled charges of corruption against it as being “Maharashtra-drohi” (anti-Maharashtra).“Nobody becomes Maharashtra-drohi just because someone calls that person so. When allegations of corruption are levelled against them, they call that person a Maharashtra- drohi,” Fadnavis said in a press conference.He was replying to a query whether the Shiv Sena was painting the BJP as Maharashtra-drohi in matters pertaining to actor Kangana Ranaut, Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and Shiv Sena leader Pratap Sarnaik.“It was the BJP which worked towards keeping the identity of Maharashtra intact when it was in power for five years...We made Maharashtra number one state, surpassing Gujarat in terms of investments and I am proud that I was the chief minister (at that time),” he added.“The Shiv Sena should understand one thing that they are not Maharashtra,” he added.When asked about NCP’s state unit chief Jayant Patil’s allegations about bogus voters registration ahead of the upcoming graduate and teachers’ constituencies elections, Fadnavis said it means that the NCP leader has accepted the defeat.“There is no EVM, so he knows that if they face defeat, they would not be able to blame on it. Which is why he is making such claims,” he said.On being asked about his support to Uttar Pradesh’s ordinance on ‘love jihad and whether he thinks it was possible in a progressive state like Maharashtra, he said, “How can be the law on love jihad called regressive? The terms progressive and regressive are individuals perspective. I am surprised about Shiv Sena, which had once taken a strong position against ‘love jihad’.” “They wrote big editorials, sought legislation against love jihad, but now they have taken a U-turn,” he added.Replying to a question about Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray telling Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the ‘politicisation’ of COVID-19 situation in the state by the BJP, Fadanvis said, “It is a welcome sign that the state government has taken cognisance of BJP’s agitations in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-is-not-maharashtra-fadnavis/story-3acJKxxDI51OXWN2PmazHK.html

25-11-2020||India||Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik writes to PM Modi, seeks clarity on timeline of board exams||Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday urged PM Narendra Modi to bring about clarity on the timeframe for carrying out the Board and Higher Secondary Examinations and also the duration of the academic session 2020-21.In a letter to PM Modi, Patnaik said in the absence of clarity on the academic session and both the Standard-X and Standard-XII Board examinations, all enrolled students and their parents/teachers are in a state of uncertainty. “It is leading to anxiety among all,” Patnaik wrote.“As all competitive entrance examinations and admission to institutions of higher education are interlinked, national guidelines with tentative timelines will help the states in framing appropriate strategy. It will also help students who are anxious about the examination dates to plan and prepare accordingly. We have been trying to reach out to the maximum number of students digitally through different modes, but it is not possible to cover all students and prepare them to face Boards and different competitive examinations,” he said. Patnaik also informed Modi that the state government has decided to keep educational institutions closed till December 31, for the safety of students after due consultation with different stakeholders and experts.Last week, Odisha School and mass education minister Sameer Dash had said metric and higher secondary examinations in the state are likely to be delayed in the current academic session asserting that the exams would not be held without offline classes for at least 3 months.“We’re bound to conduct exams for the sake of the career of our students. But we will definitely see that the students are not deprived of the teaching facility meant for taking the mandatory exams. Facility of classroom teaching for our students for a minimum of three months has to be ensured before the exams this time,” he said.The Central Board of Secondary Education has recently announced holding of practical examination for Std-12 students in January this year, a move that has drawn flak from several people who asked how could the Board hold the exam without schools conducting a single practical class due to Covid-19. The CBSE, which is yet to arrive at a decision on the Std 10 and 12 examination schedules, is likely to do so in a week’s time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cm-naveen-patnaik-writes-to-pm-modi-seeks-clarity-on-timeline-of-board-exams/story-fWa2qJdgQc8lA0JeZdlApO.html

The FIR was filed under charges including domestic violence in March, at the time when the couple had been working for 18 hours a day, she said.Although the court wanted to interview the husband, the woman, a resident of Pune, said her husband was on duty at a government-run hospital.“In March and April, when the coronavirus-related work had increased in hospitals, there was too much stress. We were working for 18 hours every day and this led to a lot of misunderstandings,” the woman informed the court.Following counselling though, the couple with two children, had decided to continue living together, she told the bench during a virtual hearing. Quashing the FIR, the bench said it was “very happy” to note that the couple had decided to resolve its differences and live together.The court also said it had a “high regard” for doctors working day and night across the country to combat the pandemic, at the cost of their personal and family lives.“We have tremendous respect for doctors and the work that they have done in such times,” the bench said.The court decided to quash the case, even as one of the lawyers interjected. To this, the court said it had heard his client in serial and did not want to hear the case any further.“Haven’t you heard, jab miyan biwi raazi...,” the bench told the lawyer in a lighter vein.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-quashes-woman-s-fir-against-doctor-husband-over-covid-19-duty/story-zeTFPbzGuI7yrmfRKeYaaI.html

25-11-2020||India||AP CM launches PM SVANidhi scheme, names it after himself||Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday launched the PM Street Vendors AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme, meant for extending collateral-free loans up to Rs 10,000 each to street vendors, but named it after himself, drawing flak from the BJP.The Chief Minister renamed the Central Sector Scheme, fully-funded by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, after himself as ‘Jagananna Todu’, claiming that the state government would bear the full interest on the loans. Slamming the Chief Minister over this, the state BJP pointed out that Jagan has usurped one more Central scheme and affixed his own name to it.“PM SVANidhi has been brought in as part of the Atma Nirbhar Bharat package post-Covid-19.It is shameful that the Chief Minister has changed the schemes name,” BJP state general secretary S Vishnuvardhan Reddy said in a statement.Under PM SVANidhi, the vendors availing of loans are eligible to get an interest subsidy of seven per cent.The AP government, however, made it a zero interest scheme, saying the interest amount would be reimbursed every quarter and credited into the borrowers account.The Centre introduced the PM SVANidhi as a special micro-credit facility for street vendors to help them resume their businesses after the Covid-19 Unlock. Launching the scheme through a video conference with some of the beneficiaries, the Chief Minister said street vendors had a crucial share in the economy, but were so far forced to depend on private moneylenders for working capital needs.“The street vendors are in the unorganised sector and have no access to institutional credit. The private lenders charged 3, 4 or even 10 per cent interest. We wanted to usher in a change in their lives by offering them institutional credit,” Jagan said.In the first phase 9.05 lakh street vendors in the state would be given Rs 905 crore as interest-free loan, he said.“If you repay the loan promptly, the banks will extend fresh credit, even higher amounts, the Chief Minister added.He assured that no eligible vendor would be left out of the scheme and the application process would continue for one or two more months. Ministers P R C Reddy, Botsa Satyanarayana, A Suresh, M Sankara Narayana and officials took part in the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ap-cm-launches-pm-svanidhi-scheme-names-it-after-himself/story-J3IEnNRrqzGOMRITQK0t7O.html
25-11-2020||India||Foreign secretary Shringla to arrive in Nepal on maiden visit on Thursday||Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will arrive in Kathmandu on Thursday on his maiden official visit to Nepal during which he will hold talks with his Nepalese counterpart and other top leaders and discuss wide ranging areas of bilateral cooperation.Shringla is visiting Nepal at the invitation of foreign secretary Bharat Raj Paudyal, amid a strain in bilateral ties following a bitter border row between the two countries.This will be a continuation of the regular exchange of high level visits between the two friendly neighbours, the Nepalese foreign ministry said in a statement this week.“During the visit, Shringla will hold bilateral meeting with his Nepali counterpart and discuss wide ranging areas of cooperation between Nepal and India,” it said.“The Indian foreign secretary will also call on the high-level dignitaries of Nepal,” the statement said, without identifying them.He will also hand over Covid-19 related support to the Government of Nepal before wrapping up his two-day visit on Friday.Earlier this month, Indian Army chief Gen. M M Naravane travelled to Nepal on a three-day visit during which he held talks with Nepal’s top leadership and discussed bilateral relations.During the visit, he called on Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, who is also the defence minister of Nepal. Oli told him that problems between Nepal and India would be resolved through dialogue.Gen Naravane’s three-day visit to Nepal was largely aimed at resetting bilateral ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row between the two countries.The ties between the two countries came under strain after defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory.Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a “unilateral act” and cautioning Kathmandu that such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.In its reaction, after Nepal’s lower house of parliament approved the bill, India had also termed as untenable the “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims by the neighbouring country.India had said Nepal’s action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks. Meanwhile, Chinese defence minister Gen. Wei Fenghe is scheduled to visit Nepal shortly after Shringla returns home, according to Foreign Ministry sources here.Wei is likely to arrive here on Sunday on a four-day official visit, though the date of the trip is yet to be officially announced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-secretary-shringla-to-arrive-in-nepal-on-maiden-visit-on-thursday/story-7NQz8vMuKjVv2TEiYT5YXM.html
25-11-2020||India||Centre asks states to take steps to reopen medical colleges from or before Dec 1||The Union Health Ministry Wednesday asked state governments to initiate steps for reopening of medical colleges from December 1 or before it, but with strict adherence to all Covid-19 related guidelines. Educational institutions in the country have been closed since March in view of the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter to the chief secretaries and the administrators of all states and Union Territories, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan also suggested making non-Covid beds available in sufficient numbers in affiliated medical college-hospitals to facilitate undergraduate training.The Health Ministry has obtained concurrence from the Ministry of Home Affairs for re-opening of medical colleges, the letter mentioned. “Accordingly, the states and UTs may take necessary steps to open the medical colleges on or before December 1, 2020,” the health secretary said in his letter dated November 25. “Needless to say, all SOPs/guidelines with respect to social distancing and prevention of spread of epidemic issued by Central/states and UT governments will be followed scrupulously by all the colleges,” he said.The Centre’s directive comes in the wake of the National Medical Commission recommending reopening of medical colleges from December 1 or before it for the MBBS students already pursuing their courses.The NMC, which has received representations from students and medical colleges, noted that the current batch of interns (2020) have not completed their required clinical training and unless they do it, they would not be eligible for appearing for the PG-NEET exam. It also noted that the PG-NEET exam for the academic year 2021-22 has been delayed as the eligible candidates will be completing their training late. Their training is required to be completed at the earliest so that the PG -NEET exam for the academic year 2021-22 can be held accordingly, it said.“Delay in resuming the training would have a cascading effect on training of next PG and super-speciality courses in the coming years,” the NMC noted.“The delayed new academic session for 2020-21 should commence from February 1, 2021. The new PG session for the academic year 2020-21 should begin from at least July 1, 2021 and therefore the PG-NEET exam for AY 2020-21 would need to be scheduled around March-April 2021,” the NMC said in a communique to the Health Ministry on November 12.With opening of medical colleges and to facilitate UG training, all medical colleges affiliated hospitals would need to have sufficient number of beds for non-COVID patients and hence facilities for both outpatient and inpatient management for non-COVID patients must be re-started, if not already done, the NMC stated.Further, it noted that the students today (and would-be doctors tomorrow) should also be familiar with the inherent threats and opportunities in healthcare systems which they would eventually handle themselves. It should not become a missed opportunity for medical students to learn the skills of epidemic management as public health professional, the NMC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-to-take-steps-to-reopen-medical-colleges-from-or-before-dec-1/story-3AnVU4eU1WEab0b4lJe1lI.html

25-11-2020||India||Malegaon blast: Bombay HC to pass orders on implead plea on Friday||The Bombay High Court will pass orders on November 27 whether Nisar Ahmed Bilal, whose son was killed in the 2008 Malegaon blast, can be permitted to intervene in the plea filed by accused Lt Colonel Prasad Shrikant Purohit seeking that charges against him be quashed.A bench of Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik on Wednesday heard Bilal’s counsel senior advocate BA Desai and Purohit’s counsel Neela Gokhale before closing the arguments for order.Six people were killed and 100 others injured when a bomb strapped to a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon in Nashik district of Maharashtra on September 29, 2008.Advocate Desai urged the bench to implead his client as a party to the case and admit the intervention application since the victim had a right to be heard.He said Bilal was also an intervening party in the trial in the case pending hearing before a special NIA court in Mumbai.In his plea, Bilal said that he had lost his son in the blast, and therefore, he was an “aggrieved party” in the case, who deserved to be heard.Gokhale, however, opposed Bilal’s application arguing that Purohit had sought that charges against him be quashed since the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had failed to get a prior sanction under section 197 of the CrPC to prosecute him.“Since the plea was on the limited procedural ground of the sanction, it did not warrant any intervention by the victims,” Gokhale told the bench.In September this year, Purohit had filed a pleain the HC seeking quashing of all charges.During the first hearing of Purohit’s plea, his counsel and former attorney general, Mukul Rohtagi, had told the bench that Purohit had been working for the Indian Army’s military intelligence unit.He said Purohit had attended conspiracy meetings before the 2008 Malegaon blast as part of “discharging his duties” as a military intelligence officer. Therefore, the NIA should have sought a prior sanction under section 197 of the CrPC to prosecute him, Rohtagi had said.Section 197 of the CrPC lays down the procedure for prosecution of public servants and mandates that a prior sanction be sought from the government.Rohtagi had further said that the Army had reinstated Purohit in 2017 after the Supreme Court granted him bail.He said the supreme court had recorded in its bail order that Purohit had been attending the meetings as part of discharging his duties.The NIA, however, had opposed Purohit’s plea.In an affidavit filed in court in September, the agency said that in attending the conspiracy meetings, Purohit was not working for the Army, and therefore, no sanction under 197 of the Crpc was required for his prosecution.Purohit was arrested in the case in 2009.As per the NIA, the bike to which the bomb was strapped belonged to Purohit’s co-accused and BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur.On Wednesday, NIA’s counsel Sandesh Patil told the bench that the trial in the case had been suspended due to COVID-19 pandemic, but it would resume on a day-to-day basis from the next month. Of the 400 witnesses in the case, 140 had been examined so far, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/malegaon-blast-bombay-hc-to-pass-orders-on-implead-plea-on-friday/story-LsKYRM5ys4QBvhyCBiKmuK.html
25-11-2020||India||Uttarakhand emerges as hideout for criminals from NCR, Punjab and Haryana||The arrests of wanted gangsters of Delhi-NCR, Punjab and Haryana hiding in the state seems to be a new challenge for the Uttarakhand Police, who want to do away with this emerging trend. The recent arrest of three shooters in US Nagar district who were wanted in Haryana and had a bounty of Rs 50,000-1 lakh is the latest development among criminals from the aforementioned states hiding in Uttarakhand to escape the police in their respective states. Earlier, in February this year, a wanted gangster by Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan police, Anil Pehelwan was arrested by Uttarakhand police while he was hiding in Dehradun. He had a bounty of Rs 1 lakh on him. Before that in January 2018, another dreaded gangster from Punjab, Harsimrandeep Singh alias Simma with a Rs 2 lakh reward was arrested from the state. Similarly, in one of the major arrests, two close aides of the infamous 2016 Nabha jailbreaker, Parminder Singh, were nabbed from Dehradun in the same year. The police had then said that the accused planned the daring jailbreak in Punjab’s Nabha in their hideout in Dehradun only. Amid the arrests of the wanted gangsters from state, especially its capital city, senior superintendent of police Dehradun, Arun Mohan Joshi said, “It is not at all becoming a safe haven or hideout for the gangsters or northern states. Police have been keeping a tight vigil and meticulously examining people coming to stay here from outside.”He said that in some cases it happens that criminals after committing a crime in their state or are wanted there, come here to hide but, “that doesn’t mean that it is becoming a safe haven.” “Police here regularly carry out campaigns for tenant verification and act on any inputs about any suspected elements. Also, if you compare the number of wanted gangsters nabbed in other major cities in North, to ours, the number is very less,” said Joshi. He, however, termed the arrest of gangsters in the city as a result of “tight vigil” of capital police. “The gangsters hiding here from other states, were arrested by our police only which shows that we are working actively on the ground with efficiency,” said Joshi. With low crime rate, gangsters think that police in Uttarakhand is inactive: Expert On the arrest of wanted gangsters of other states hiding in Uttarakhand, former state director general of police, Aloke B Lal said in crime world usually the criminals hide in other states after committing a crime in their own state. “They usually hide where they have their relatives or known persons. However, saying that, Uttarakhand also has a very low crime rate in comparison to its neighbouring states. This makes an impression in the criminals that the police might be less active or efficient which make them think that they can hide here,” said Lal. “However, it is not at all true as our state police is as efficient as neighbouring states and UTs like UP, Delhi or Punjab. If it was not true then the gangsters hiding wouldn’t have been nabbed here,” he said. Sharing database of criminals is importantThe retired DGP added that to prevent the state from being a safe haven for the wanted gangsters of other states, sharing of criminals’ database is the key. “In US, the authorities have an extensive database of the criminals which is shared by their state police departments. In India, it is under development at present. Once it’s done, it would be vital for one state police to nab criminals wanted in other states,” said Lal. Arresting gangsters proves police’s efficiency: DG (law & order) Director general (law & order), Uttarakhand police, Ashok Kumar however, termed the arresting of criminals and gangsters of other states in Uttarakhand as “proof of state police’s efficiency.” “These arrests don’t prove that our state is becoming a safe haven for gangsters of states like Punjab, Haryana and Delhi UT. In fact, it proves that our police is fully alert and on vigil which resulted in these arrests,” said Kumar. He added, “We are keeping extra vigil in our border districts including Haridwar, US Nagar and Dehradun.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-emerges-as-hideout-for-criminals-from-ncr-punjab-and-haryana/story-LCleAymXAScfjxnJ66O2eJ.html

Parra was being interrogated at the agency’s New Delhi headquarters for the past two days after his name surfaced in connection with the probe into suspended deputy superintendent of police Davinder Singh’s case. He is the first politician to be arrested in this case.PTI quoted NIA spokesperson as saying, “Today, NIA arrested Waheed Ur Rehman Parra, the youth wing leader of People’s Democratic Party, in connection with the Naveed Babu-Davinder Singh case for supporting Hizbul Mujahideen in conspiracy with the other accused persons.”Meanwhile, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti termed the arrest as blackmail and said youth president was falsely charged.“BJP milks illegal scrapping of Article 370 in every nook and corner of the country. But when it comes to Kashmiris questioning its abrogation they are locked up & punished. Everyone knows at whose behest Davinder Singh worked for. Ironic that they have the gall to blame others,” she tweeted.”Waheed has no connection whatsoever with this man & is being falsely charged. All just to blackmail & intimidate PDP & other mainstream political parties in J&K,” she added.Also read | NIA raids in Kashmir in case involving ex-cop Davinder SinghShe went on to say that Parra was illegally arrested in 2019 as well. “Yet his belief in democracy didn’t waver & he chose to contest DDC elections.

Its upto the judiciary now to dispense justice & ensure @parawahid is released at the earliest,” she tweeted.Parra was set to contest the district development council polls from South Kashmir. He has a strong base among the youth in south Kashmir and was pivotal in organising many public programmes of the party.Suspended deputy superintendent of police Davinder Singh was arrested in January 11 while allegedly ferrying Hizbul commander Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Naveed Babu, advocate Mohammad Shafi Mir and another militant, Rafi Ahmad Rather, to Jammu in his car. The case was later handed over to NIA which conducted several raids in different parts of Kashmir.

25-11-2020||India||Night curfews allowed, lockdown needs Centre’s nod in new Covid protocol||Due to the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in various states, the Centre on Wednesday allowed states and union territories to impose local restrictions, such as night curfew, based on their assessment of the situation. However, they cannot impose any local lockdown outside the containment zones without prior consultation with the Centre, according to an order issued by the ministry of home affairs on Wednesday. The MHA also said that state governments can consider implementing staggered office timings and other suitable measures in cities where the weekly case positivity rate is more than 10 percent so that the number of employees attending offices at the same time can be reduced. The new guidelines – termed ‘Guidelines for Surveillance, Containment and Caution’- will remain in force from December 1 to December 31. They have been issued a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a meeting with the chief ministers of several states during which the severity of the third wave of infection was flagged by several leaders present. The order said that “the main focus of the latest guidelines is to consolidate the substantial gains that have been achieved against the spread of Covid-19 which is visible in the steady decline in the number of active cases in the country”. Also Watch l Covid, vaccine race & what we don’t know yet | Dr Guleria & Dr Jha #HTLS2020 “Further, keeping in view the recent spike in new cases in few states/UTs, ongoing festival season and onset of winter, it is emphasised that to fully overcome the pandemic, there is need to maintain caution and to strictly follow the prescribed containment strategy, focussed on surveillance, containment and strict observance of the guidelines/SOPs (standard operating procedures) issued by MHA and ministry of health and family welfare,” the order said. It said that local district, police and municipal authorities shall be responsible to ensure that the prescribed containment measures are strictly followed. “States and UTs, based on their assessment of the situation, may impose local restrictions, with a view to contain the spread of Covid-19 such as night curfew. However, state/UTs shall not impose any local lockdown (State/ District/ sub-division/City level), outside the containment zones, without prior consultation with the central Government,” it said. The MHA also gave freedom to the state governments to take administrative action against people not following the basic Covid safety measures. It said, “State/UT governments shall take all necessary measures to promote Covid-19 appropriate behavior and to ensure strict enforcement of wearing of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing.” In order to enforce the core requirement of wearing face masks, states and UTs may consider administrative actions, including “imposition of appropriate fines, on persons not wearing face masks in public and work spaces”, the MHA said. For observance of social distancing in crowded places, especially in markets, weekly bazars and public transport, it said that the health ministry will issue a SOP soon. The ministry said that there shall be no restriction on inter-State and intra-state movement of persons and goods, including those for cross land-border trade under treaties with neighbouring countries. No separate permission/approval/e-permit will be required for such movements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-can-order-night-curfews-but-no-lockdown-in-new-covid-guidelines/story-jbVfE70qQJiC6ufgr6nQUK.html
25-11-2020||India||White House considers lifting European travel restrictions||The White House is considering rescinding entry bans for most non-US citizens who recently were in Brazil, Britain, Ireland and 26 other European countries, five US and airline officials told Reuters.The Trump administration imposed the bans in a bid to contain the novel coronavirus pandemic. It is not considering lifting separate entry bans on most non-US citizens who have recently been in China or Iran, the officials said.The plan has won the backing of White House coronavirus task-force members, public health and other federal agencies, the people briefed on the matter said, but President Donald Trump has not made a final decision and the timing remains uncertain.The White House, Department of Homeland Security and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not comment.Many administration officials argue the restrictions no longer make sense given that most countries around the world are not subject to the entry ban. They contend lifting the restrictions would be a boost to struggling US airlines, which have seen international travel fall by 70%, according to airline industry data.Trump may still opt not to lift the restrictions, given the high number of coronavirus infections in Europe. One potential hurdle is the fact that European countries are not likely to immediately allow most Americans to resume visits, officials said.The European countries that are subject to the US entry restrictions include the 26 members of the Schengen area that allow travel across open borders.The US restrictions barring most visitors from Europe have been in place since mid-March, while the Brazilian entry ban was imposed in May. Trump implemented the first ban on most non-US visitors from China on Jan. 31 and then added Iran in February.The restrictions bar entry of most non-US residents who have been in those countries in the previous 14 days, but the U.S. State Department has been granting some “national interest exceptions” to allow travelers from Europe related to “humanitarian travel, public health response, and national security.”The United States has also approved exceptions for some European business travelers, investors, academics, students and journalists.Nearly all of Europe still bans most US travelers from visiting, while Britain and Ireland allow American visits but require two-weeks quarantine upon arrival. Brazil allows US travelers.On Saturday, the CDC issued new travel and testing recommendations for international air travelers recommending they “get tested with a viral test 1-3 days before their flight to reduce spread during travel. Travelers should get tested 3-5 days after travel and stay home for 7 days.”Airlines for America, a group representing American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines Holdings and others, on Tuesday noted it has “been advocating for the federal government to set a national standard on testing in order to lift travel restrictions.”In a statement to Reuters, the group called the CDC guidance a step in the right direction, adding that they hoped it would be “followed by a recognition that testing can be used to safely reopen borders without quarantines.”Some airlines and officials think testing could be the key to widely resuming international travel. The United States has held talks with several countries about the possibility of passenger testing programs between pairs of major cities.Asked about the prospects of travel restrictions being lifted, a US Transportation Department spokesman said “the department stands ready to support the safe resumption of international flights to and from the U.S.” “Conversations are ongoing between the federal government, international partners, and industry stakeholders on these matters.” In September, the CDC ended enhanced screening of some international passengers for the coronavirus and dropped requirements that travelers coming from those countries arrive at 15 designated U.S. airports that had been imposed at the start of the beginning of the outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/white-house-considers-lifting-european-travel-restrictions/story-3mqZ2gjjmJFkcuEAmTYMXJ.html

Thousands of farmers, led by BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charuni, started their journey on tractor trailers, cars and bikes to reach Delhi from Mohra grain market in Ambala district.Upon being stopped by police and district administration in Ambala, the farmers removed the barricades forcibly and moved forward.As they entered Kurukshetra district, the farmers from the area also joined them. However, district administration of Kurukshetra and Kaithal districts have also blocked the state border to prevent farmers from Punjab from entering Haryana.“Yes, the police have been deployed at the state border in Cheeka of Kaithal district and the farmers from Punjab will not be allowed to enter Haryana,” said Kaithal SP Shahank Kumar Sawan.Leaders associated with the BKU (Charuni) urged their supporters to reach Mohra grain market in Ambala by Wednesday morning.The messages were being circulated on social media the BKU leaders making repeated appeals to farmers to reach the grain market to ensure a huge gathering, a day before the scheduled Delhi-Koonch (Delhi March) call given by several farmer unions of the country for a national level protest against farm laws on November 26 and 27.

The apex vigilance body has expressed concern over prolonged delay in filing of such details by government officials. “Timely filing of property return by officials of ministries/departments/organisations is one of the mandatory requirements under Conduct Rules. Property returns are also a good tool for CVOs (chief vigilance officers) to detect the source of funding of the assets of the officials and to find out whether these have been acquired through legal means,” CVC said in a communication to all Central government departments, chairman and managing directors of public sector banks and insurance companies among others. “Non-filing of property returns constitutes good and sufficient reasons for instituting disciplinary action against the delinquent officials,” the CVC added. It had found, while examining the reports submitted by some of the CVOs, that in most of the organisations, many of the officials are yet to file their annual immovable or movable property return for the previous year i.e., 2019. The last date for filing of return in most of the organisations is January 31. “Almost nine months have lapsed since and the organisations are yet to secure 100% compliance in this regard,” CVC said. Meanwhile, the ministry of home affairs has also shot off a similar letter to all Indian Police Service (IPS) officers across the country to file their immovable property return for 2020 by January 31 next year. In case the officers failed to file returns by then, concerned officer’s vigilance clearance will be denied, MHA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/file-your-property-returns-or-face-disciplinary-action-cvc-tells-government-officials/story-tYsGgUORGqfkGJNqDjsRMJ.html

From 21 days, the duration of the lockdown kept increasing when the infection was at its peak.The first set of relaxations (called Unlock 1.0) was announced in June, which led to the opening of restaurants, shopping malls etc. Since then, the government has been opening the economy in phases.But with the recent surge in the number of new Covid-19 cases in various cities, there are fears of the resurgence of the disease. Experts have also warned that the situation could worsen in winters.

The fresh norms will be effective from December 1, 2020 and will remain in place till December 31. In line with home minister Amit Shah’s call for “dynamic containment zones” during the chief ministers’ meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the Covid-19 situation in the country, his ministry has asked states and Union Territories to ensure demarcation of containment zones by the district authorities at the micro level.Covid-19 rules and containment measures prescribed by the health ministry strictly need to be followed in demarcated containment zones. There shall be strict perimeter control to ensure that there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and for maintaining supply of essential goods and services, the MHA said in statement. Surveillance teams will conduct intensive house-to-house surveillance and quick isolation of Covid-19 patients shall be ensured in treatment facilities or home, it added. Also Watch l How long to control Covid-19 pandemic? Top doctors respond on #HTLS2020 The Centre has also allowed states to impose local restrictions, including night curfews to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease. The states, however, cannot impose any local lockdown, outside the containment zones, without prior consultation with the central government. It has also told states to ensure social distancing in workplaces and said that they may consider staggered timings. “In cities, where the weekly Case Positivity Rate is in more than 10 percent, States and UTs concerned shall consider implementing staggered office timings and other suitable measures, with a view to reduce the number of employees attending office at the same time, thereby ensuring social distancing,” it said in a statement. The home ministry said that the main focus of the guidelines is to consolidate the substantial gains that have been achieved against the spread of Covid-19, which it said is visible in the steady decline in the number of active cases in the country. The fresh guidelines come at a time when India’s Covid-19 tally has surpassed 9.22 million with 444,746 active cases. While the virus has claimed 134,699 lives, as many as 8,642,771 have recovered from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-issues-fresh-covid-19-guidelines-effective-from-dec-1-for-surveillance-containment-and-caution/story-1R8dBEqtmEEmXUdBUkQjfP.html

Why is the Majlis leader worrying about this? His statements were an attempt to give false colours to ‘love jihad’. This practice bringing religious issues to the fore in electioneering is very usual. Using this strategy, his party won five seats in the Bihar elections,” Subhash said.Read more | ‘BJP intends to create hatred’: AIMIM’s Owaisi responds to Tejasvi Surya’s attackHe further said, “Owaisi should remember that the nation effectively faced the Covid-19 situation with a minimum death rate and under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stimulus packages worth Rs 1.19 crore had been rolled out as part of Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan 3.0.”Subhash further dubbed his threats against UAPA Bill and proposed laws against ‘love jihad’ as a poll gimmick to garner votes in the upcoming GHMC elections.“In a bid to score majority seats in the GHMC elections, the Majlis leader will play some other minority card to divert the attention of the people.

In anticipation, sluice gates of the Chembarambakkam reservoir, one of the key drinking water sources to Chennai, were opened on Wednesday noon to release 1,000 cusecs of water into the Adyar river. Hundreds of people living along the river are being moved to relief camps. Chennai’s arterial roads and neighbourhoods were severely inundated with heavy rain continuing on Wednesday. Commuters waded through knee deep water and water entered several homes in low lying areas. Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami extended the public holiday to Thursday in 13 districts, including Chennai, after he inspected the Chembarambakkam reservoir which is about 30 km from Chennai in the adjoining Kancheepuram district. Sudden release of huge quantities of water from Chembarambakkam into the Adyar river had resulted in the deviating floods in 2015 in Chennai and adjoining districts.“People need not panic or be in fear, Palaniswami said after his inspection. “Chembaramakkam’s capacity is 24 feet and as of now water level is at 21.5 feet. We will release water in a controlled manner. Adyar river has the capacity to carry 60,000 cusecs. Government is taking all precautions. There is water-logging in 30 localities in Chennai and the city corporation is draining it,” said Palaniswami. The ministry of Jal Shakti on Wednesday informed the state that Chembarambakkam reservoir in Adyar basin will receive 150-200 mm from 6am Wednesday for the next 24 hours with an average inflow of 200 cumecs, warning of a “flood type situation in the river”.Cyclone Nivar is gaining in strength and approaching the state, it is roughly 190 km east-southeast of Puducherry and 250 km south-southeast of Chennai. At the time of the cyclone crossing, wind speeds will be 130-145 kmph gusting to 155 in Puducherry, Cuddalore, Mayiladudurai, Karaikal, Villupuram and Chengalpet, said S Balachandran, director, regional meteorological centre (RMC), Chennai. In Chennai and adjoining districts, wind speed is forecast to be 80-90 kmph gusting to 100 kmph, he added. The NDRF teams and first responders are involved in intense relief operations in other districts, including Cuddalore, Villupuram, Mayiladurai, Chengalpattu which are severely inundated. Some 24,166 people have been evacuated from 13 districts across Tamil Nadu, including 3,948 children, and shifted to 315 relief camps. Both the AIADMK and DMK leaders and workers hit the ground in rescue work. Stalin, wearing rain gear, provided relief materials to families living in inundated areas such as Kolathur, Choolai and Villivakkam. The BJP temporarily cancelled its vetrivel yatra (victorious spear march) due to the cyclone. Puducherry has imposed section 144. “We are already seeing waves as high as 6-feet” said the union territory’s chief minister V Narayanasamy after inspecting coastal areas. “We are working in coordination with all departments to ensure people remain safe.”Several flights to and from Chennai have been cancelled and train services remain suspended in the cyclone-affected districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nivar-landfall-near-puducherry-after-midnight-evacuation-underway/story-5yuycMx8plFA0uMfOLUuHK.html
25-11-2020||India||Ban on firecrackers an example of judicial overreach: Venkaiah Naidu||Labelling the recent ban on firecrackers an example of judicial overreach, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday set the tone of the 80th All India Presiding Officers’ Conference that will discuss “harmonious coordination between legislature, executive and judiciary”. Naidu reminded the conference that the Constitution has “demarcated clear domains for each of these three organs on the lines of separation of powers” and said “harmony lies in each organ doing its job without interfering with that of the others”.President of India Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the two-day session—marking his first physical participation at a public event after over eight months—here in Gujarat. Under the chairmanship of Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, the event will see a series of working sessions before Prime Minister of India addresses it on Thursday. Also Read: Oppn has an important role: President Kovind at All India Presiding Officers’ ConferenceNaidu acknowledged that the Supreme Court and high courts have delivered several “far-reaching verdicts in furtherance of socio-economic objectives” apart from their correctional interventions. “But occasionally, concerns have been raised as to whether they were entering the domains of the legislative and the executive wings,” he said.“There have been debates as to whether some issues should have been more legitimately left to the other organs of the government. For example, Deepavali fireworks; cess on registration and movement of vehicles from the National Capital Region through Delhi; banning use of vehicles of certain make after 10 or 15 years; monitoring police investigations; denying the executive any role in the appointment of judges by instituting collegium which is said to be an extra-constitutional body; invalidating the National Judicial Accountability Commission Act seeking to ensure transparency and accountability are being cited as instances of judicial over reach,” he said, implying that the legislative should have been given space to act on these issues. The National Green Tribunal—the Supreme Court’s environment arm—clamped a blanket ban on firecrackers in Delhi, its surrounding areas and cities with poor air quality. The court, however, allowed the sale and use of green crackers.Naidu argued that to be in its best state, India should have its the three organs of the ‘State’ performing “to the best of its potential in the domain specified for each of them, in pursuit of the mandate defined in the Constitution”.To be sure, Naidu also spoke about legislative and executive excesses such as rules under subordinate legislation violating provisions of original legislation and how violation of people’s rights and liberties by the executive is. at times, “too visible for comfort.”He also mentioned 39th amendment to the Constitution placing the election of President, Vice-President and Prime Minister beyond the scope of judicial scrutiny as legislative over activism.A harmonious relationship between three wings of the Indian state “warrants a spirit of mutual respect, responsibility and restraint. Unfortunately, there have been several instances of crossing the boundaries,” Naidu added.Senior advocate Raj Panjwani told HT, “Legislature has the entire space to correct all wrongs or actions detrimental to society. The role of the judiciary is limited to testing the legality and competence of legislative and executive actions. The problem begins when the legislature fails to correct the wrongs that are a threat to the society at large and also to an individual’s fundamental rights. It is in this scenario, due to failure of the legislature as well as executive to take prompt and appropriate action, in particular with issues concerning the environment, the Constitution empowers the judiciary to step in and fill the vacuum caused by this inaction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ban-on-firecrackers-an-example-of-judicial-overreach-venkaiah-naidu/story-NqbZ6s4IXG0rwRNTZKaABJ.html

One is expected to get an identity card within 30 days of the district authorities reviewing the application. Following the passage of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019, the law allows for self-perceived identification by an applicant for an identity certificate.

It is unfortunate that it rolls back non-medicalised self-identification granted by NALSA, and that once one is declared as transgender, one becomes a citizen governed by discriminatory criminal and civil laws.”The ministry will also open shelter homes for trans people in each state.

Mufti Rauf Asghar sent the message to Jaish operatives in Kashmir soon after the gunbattle at Ban toll plaza in Jammu’s Nagrota that led to the elimination of four Pakistani terrorists within hours of crossing the border, people familiar with the matter said.Mufti Asghar is the younger brother of JeM chief and UN designated global terrorist Masood Azhar who is reported to have been under treatment for a life-threatening spine aliment. Asghar is considered the terror group’s de facto chief in his elder brother’s absence and had overseen the infiltration of the four terrorists from Bahawalpur in Pakistan’s Punjab province.Also Read: Pak’s million mutinies, ghosts and Doval’s doctrine of ‘defensive offence’The 19 November encounter was a huge setback for the terror group, given how heavily Asghar had invested in their training and infiltration. Border Security Force officials who have seen the 200-metre tunnel dug under the border fence said the engineering detail that had gone into digging the tunnel in Pakistan’s Shakargarh area was a surprise. They were well-armed too.11 AK-47 rifles, 3 pistols, 29 hand grenades and 6 grenades to be fired from an under barrel grenade launcher were seized.Also Read: Tunnels, drones part of Pakistan’s strategy to keep Jammu sector activeAccording to intelligence reports, the infiltration of the four terrorists was part of an effort by Pakistan-based terrorist groups to prepare for a major drive in Jammu and Kashmir. They have become especially active after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.The reports said terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) is also mobilising cadres from its Chelabandi camp in Muzaffarabad to fresh locations in Neelum Valley across the Line of Control (LoC) between India and Pakistan. And the Hizbul Mujahideen training nearly 400 cadres at a newly constructed facility in the forest area of Oghi in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).The Jaish, intelligence reports indicate, is not the only one feeling the heat. According to one input, the Al Badr group is exploring ways to infiltrate into India from Bangladesh after security forces tightened the security grid across the LoC in Kashmir.Indian intelligence officials suspect the attempt to carry out terror strikes at high-value targets could be a diversionary tactic by the Pakistani army and ISI chiefs, under pressure from Opposition parties in the country, to bring the focus back on Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/getting-difficult-to-supply-items-jaish-s-no-2-tells-terrorists-in-kashmir/story-rWRl5GItMu6UUrSJXhpC1I.html

The council has 12 seats of teachers’ and graduates’ constituencies each of which eight were vacant which were filled earlier this month through election. Four seats went to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), two to the Left parties and one each to the Congress and an independent candidate. “After the assembly session, the government may try to fill the vacancies at the earliest. As far as election is concerned, three of the four seats are of urban local bodies, while less than six months of late Sunil Kumar’s tenure remain,” said council chairman Avadhesh Narayan Singh.“As a result, the election will only be held for the seat of Vinod Narayan Jha who was elected unopposed to the council from the Vidhan Sabha quota in 2016. The urban local bodies’ elections will be held as per schedule,” he added. Twenty four seats are filled through election from the urban local bodies. At present, JD(U) remains the biggest party in the council with 21 seats, followed by the BJP (18). However, the composition may change if all the vacancies are filled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-4-mlcs-elected-to-assembly-bihar-upper-house-has-17-vacancies-to-fill/story-PyGrICfongiTFKqxGFZ5hN.html

Patel died earlier in the day at the age of 71.Patel, who was critical since the last few days, was admitted to the Medanta Hospital in Gurugram on November 15 after he developed complications. His son Faisal said he died at 3.30am. The parliamentarian had tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on October 1 and was hospitalised weeks later on November 15.“I am saddened to hear the shocking news of the untimely death of Ahmed Patel. Ahmed Patel ji was one of the most trusted leaders of the Congress Party and a great friend of mine. His passing away is an irreparable loss to the Congress Party. My heartfelt condolences to the members of the bereaved family,” Singh, a former prime minister, said in a statement.Ahmed Patel was among Congress’ key-strategists and held several important roles within the party. Patel was also an eight-time parliamentarian - he was a Rajya Sabha member from Gujarat five times and served as Lok Sabha MP thrice.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also shared his condolences and, in a tweet, highlighted Patel’s role in strengthening the Congress party. Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi called him ‘an irreplaceable friend and colleague’ in her statement.Several Congress leaders paid their tributes to the parliamentarian. Congress’ Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi, who is currently in Guwahati to attend the final rites of another Congress veteran politician and former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, called Patel a “pillar of the Congress party”. Congress leader Kapil Sibal penned a small poem in memory of Ahmed Patel while Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said that his death “leaves an immense void.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmed-patel-s-demise-irreparable-loss-to-party-ex-pm-manmohan-singh/story-hljzqKeUoo7830jnX6zmlJ.html
25-11-2020||India||Bihar govt to begin paddy procurement next week, targets 30 lakh MT||In a major relief to despondent farmers, the Bihar government’s cooperative department has decided to launch paddy procurement through the primary agricultural credit societies (PACS) and Vyapar Mandal outlets across the state next week, officials said. The department aims to procure around 30 lakh metric tonne of paddy from the farmers at the minimum support price of ₹1,868 per quintal, up ₹53 from the last year. It has already released a bank guarantee of Rs 2,200 crore to the cooperative banks concerned to shell out necessary credits to the PACS. Secretary, state cooperative department, Vandana Preyashi said that a joint order of the cooperative and the food and consumer protection departments had been issued on Monday in this regard. The task force set up in all the districts for procurement of paddy had been asked to meet and finalise the strategy for procurement in their respective districts at the earliest. “So far, the task force in 18 districts already met and started the ground work for procurement. Rest of the districts would follow suit soon. The department has already got a bank guarantee of ₹5,500 crore for paddy procurement this year,” said the secretary. A sense of despondency had started creeping in among the farmers as the state government did not issue any clarification regarding delay in paddy procurement. Last year, the PACS had launched the procurement from November 15. Procurement of foodgrains on the MSP was one of the main poll agenda of the opposition parties, particularly the Congress, during the recent assembly election. Last year, the cooperative department had procured about 25 lakh metric tonnes of paddy from the farmers at the MSP of ₹1,815 per quintal. Officials said that it was the heaviest quantity of paddy procurement by the state government so far. “Custom milled rice - the rate on which millers deliver back rice to the state food corporation - was also very encouraging. It’s almost 99%,” said Preyashi. The Congress party is, however, not content with the rate of paddy being offered to the farmers of Bihar. “We had promised to offer ₹2,500 per quintal paddy on the pattern of Chattisgarh. Even the Jharkhand government is paying a bonus of Rs 132 in addition to the MSP to farmers on every quintal of paddy procured,” said Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra. A section of farmers, however, apprehended that PACS and Vyapar Mandal might further delay the procurement process citing excess moisture or absence of capacity to store them. “Some of PACS have godowns with capacities of 1,000 tonnes while others have capacities of 500 tonnes, 200 tonnes and 100 tonnes. The total capacity of all the godowns owned by PACS across the state is about 11 lakh tonnes,” said Nawalesh Sharma, a farmer of Bikramganj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-govt-to-begin-paddy-procurement-next-week-targets-30-lakh-mt/story-dA2FrkyJNwafJQpoT9eCvO.html

25-11-2020||India||UP to develop Tulsidas and Valmiki ashrams into tourist spots||The Uttar Pradesh (UP) government has directed the tourism and culture departments to develop Rajapur and Lalapur, the two places in Chitrakoot district of Bundelkhand associated with great poet Tulsidas and famous sage Valmiki, officials said Tuesday. Rajapur, a town and tehsil of Chitrakoot, is associated with Tulsidas who authored the Ramcharit Manas while Lalapur located on the Chitrakoot-Prayagraj highway is associated with Maharishi Valmiki who penned the Ramayana in Sanskrit. During a review of Chitrakoot division on September 5, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had directed officials to ready a plan for road linkage to Rajapur and Lalapur. On October 31, on the occasion of the anniversary of sage Valmiki, Adityanath had visited Valmiki ashram in Lalapur, some 30 kilometers from Prayagraj. “The chief minister then had ordered that the area around the ashram be developed into a tourist spot. So now, we intend to develop it with roads and ropeways, light and sound systems. The sage’s ashram is located atop a hill and to reach there one has to climb at least 480 stairs,” an official said. Principal secretary, tourism and culture Mukesh Meshramsaid in the first phase the forest department had been given the task of preparing the approach route till the ashram. These aren’t the only areas that are being developed. In fact, the state government has drawn up an ambitious plan to develop places associated with saints and sages or those known for their temples. In eastern UP’s Vindhyachal region of Mirzapur, for instance, the government has decided to develop a Vindhyavasini Mandir Corridor, modelled on the lines of Kashi Vishwanath Corridor. The corridor would have a 50-feet wide parikrama path (circumambulation route) around the temple of Goddess Vindhyavasini. The project was approved by the UP cabinet on October 30. Even in Amethi, a Congress bastion that the BJP breached in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the government has planned to develop lesser known but locally important temples and sites. The Nand Mahar, named after ‘Nand Baba’ who is believed to have nurtured Lord Krishna when he was enacting ‘Baal leela’, the Kalikan Dhaam, the Kadu Nala forest area as well as the Bijli Pasi fort in adjacent Rae Bareli are some of the spots that the BJP government plans to develop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-to-develop-tulsidas-and-valmiki-ashrams-into-tourist-spots/story-vz1GPFCSfc27zNaqQiHP0O.html
25-11-2020||India||BJP’s Vijay Kumar Sinha elected Bihar Speaker amid opposition ruckus||Vijay Kumar Sinha was on Wednesday elected the Speaker of the 17th Vidhan Sabha in Bihar, becoming the first BJP leader to achieve the feat in the state. Sinha was elected amid ruckus by RJD members who questioned the presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar in the House. CM Kumar is a member of the Legislative Council.While 126 votes went in favour of the motion for Sinha’s election, 114 were against him. After that, Pro-tem Speaker Jitan Ram Manjhi urged chief minister Nitish Kumar and leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav to escort Vijay Sinha to the chair of the Speaker. It is the first time in Bihar since 2005 that the BJP has fielded its candidate for the Speaker’s post, on earlier occasions it was bagged by ally JD(U). The JD(U) managed just 43 seats in the recently concluded elections, while the BJP emerged the second biggest party with 74 seats. As soon as the House assembled, and Manjhi started the procedure for election, the opposition created ruckus demanding a secret ballot. However, Manjhi rejected the demand, saying there was no provision of secret ballot on Constitutional matters. The RJD had fielded Awadh Bihari Choudhary as the Grand Alliance (GA) candidate for the Speaker’s post. Manjhi called for a voice vote on the motion for election of Speaker and announced the verdict in favour of the NDA candidate, but with the numbers of the Opposition and the treasury benches quite close, the difference was not distinct. The Opposition objected and Manjhi, accepting the objection, called for division. The opposition, however, again created ruckus, questioning the presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar in the House, as he was not the member of the Vidhan Sabha. Manjhi said that only the members of the House would participate in voting, but the presence of the chief minister was in the capacity of the leader of the House and there was nothing wrong with it. “I have been a member of the House for the last 40 years and there is nothing wrong with it,” he said, asking the parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary to clarify the rules. Choudhary, who was the Speaker in the 16th Vidhan Sabha, said that it had been an established tradition of the House that the CM remained present in the House even during voting without participation. “He will not participate in voting, but there is nothing wrong in his presence. This is an unnecessary issue and the opposition also knows it. Many a time in the past the CM has remained present in the House during voting, but did not vote,” he added. In the past, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been seen sitting in the Lok Sabha during voting even though he was a member of the Rajya Sabha. The Opposition was, however, unrelenting, as it continued shouting slogans, demanding that the CM as well as other two ministers - Ashok Choudhary and Mukesh Sahni - be moved out of the House during voting despite Manjhi’s continued insistence that Kumar was present in the capacity of the leader of the House only. Choudhary and Sahni are not members of any House at present. The Leader of Opposition, however, said that the rules were being violated right in the presence of the Pro-tem Speaker. “They stole the mandate in 2015 and have again done it. Now, it is happening before the chair. It is a mockery of democracy,” he added, while the opposition members sat in the well. In the midst of the din, with the opposition unmoved, Manjhi again read out the motion for election of Sinha as the Speaker once again and asked those in favour to stand up for counting. “Your disruption is meaningless and clearly shows that you have some weakness and are trying to stall proceedings. If you have the numbers, go back to your seats and be counted. If you have the numbers, that will show. I have clearly said that those not members of the House would not vote, but they could remain present,” he added. Despite counting those in favour of the motion for Sinha’s election, the Opposition remained unmoved, disregarding the Chair’s repeated requests to get back to their seats. Later, Manjhi adjourned the House for five minutes. As soon as the House reassembled, Ajit Sharma urged the Chair for an attendance register, as some outside members were also present, but Manjhi rejected it and ordered those in favour of the motion to stand up once again for counting. Tejashwi Yadav tried to question the presence of the CM, but Manjhi reiterated that he was there as leader of the House. Later, the Speaker asked those against the motion to stand up for counting. After the counting, the Opposition was again in the well, shouting slogans. Manjhi urged the opposition members to get back to their seats for announcement of results. Constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap, too, later said that there was nothing wrong in the presence of the CM in the House and the ruling of the Speaker was paramount. “Such things have happened in the past also, but this is the first time such a demand has been raised. The leader of the House can remain present in the House. It appears clearly a political move,” Kashyap added. The NDA commands 125 members plus it has the support of an independent and the lone member of the LJP. The RJD, with 110 members, was hoping that ‘conscience voting’ will tilt the scale in its favour. The AIMIM’s stand that the Speaker should be a unanimous choice also dampened the opposition alliance’s prospects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-vijay-kumar-sinha-elected-bihar-speaker-amid-opposition-ruckus/story-DKJTdxtYEyWJXyzk1kvPVJ.html
25-11-2020||India||The centrality of Ahmed Patel in Indian politics||In a parliamentary democracy, power is diffused. The legislature is where the sovereignty of citizens is expressed through representatives; the executive is where real authority is exercised, shaping lives of citizens and steering the nation through everyday crises. The political coalition or party which enjoys a majority drives the political outlook and vision governing decisions; the bureaucracy influences both policy formulation and acts as a policy executor; the judiciary keeps an eye on whether the exercise of this authority is being done within the framework of the Constitution; big business has its priorities, and through political funding, often wields an invisible influence on policy; the media plays the role of a watchdog; and civil society represents, often, the views of organised citizens with specific interests which need to be heard and accommodated for deeper legitimacy.If there was one Congress leader who had an almost instinctive understanding of how to manage these various sources and sites of power, it was Ahmed Patel. And that is why his loss is the most significant setback to India’s Grand Old Party in recent times. The setback is even deeper because the Congress—after losing two consecutive Lok Sabha elections and multiple state elections, being perceived as directionless, in the midst of uncertainty over leadership and a cold war between diverse interest groups—is now left bereft of perhaps the one man who had the ability to bridge stakeholders within the power apparatus of the party, and between the party and its possible constituents of support outside.Also Read: Great friend, irreplaceable comrade: Congress leaders remember Ahmed PatelAhmed Patel entered Parliament when the Congress was in Opposition for the first time in Indian history—after the Emergency. Like many others who cut their teeth in those difficult times when the Congress was being attacked by those in government and facing an internal churn, Patel made his choice early on. He would stay loyal to Indira Gandhi and the family.But it was during Rajiv Gandhi’s time that Patel began understanding the dynamics of power—forming a part of the troika of parliamentary secretaries the PM appointed. It was here that Patel understood the power and constraints within which the prime minister, even one with 400-plus seats, operated; he saw the power of the Parliament, even where the Opposition was at its weakest; he saw the importance of keeping the party organisation together, in the midst of emerging mutinies against the young PM; he saw how handling contradictions that emerge from religion and caste was central to managing politics (an area of familiarity since his home state, Gujarat, too, was often the site of both communal and caste clashes). It was here that he began forming lifelong networks within the party, and his loyalty to the Nehru-Gandhi family deepened.But if he cut his teeth with Rajiv Gandhi, it was with Sonia Gandhi that Patel truly came into his own. Once again, like at the beginning of his political career, the Congress was in crisis in the late 1990s and early 2000s—Sonia Gandhi had just entered formal politics and had not yet attained the respect of all within her own party; Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in power and being rated as the most popular prime minister of recent times; Patel’s home state of Gujarat was now firmly in the grip of the Bharatiya Janata Party, with an unprecedented degree of Hindu-Muslim polarisation and with Patel himself being made acutely conscious of his Muslim identity. Few thought the Congress could return to power.But it did, pulling off a surprise in the 2004 polls. And that is when Patel began harnessing all the skills that he had developed in the preceding two-and-a-half decades. India had the most unusual experiment of the party president (Sonia Gandhi) constituting one element of the power matrix and the prime minister (Manmohan Singh) constituting another. There may be diverse views on whether this experiment was healthy or even appropriate for democracy—but if it lasted for a decade, the man who played a central role in navigating the relationship, determining the messages that went from the party to the government, and playing the messenger at the highest levels of power was Ahmed Patel.Also Read: Ahmed Patel: Congress’ indispensable man, an emissary and an archetypal party personBetween 2004 and 2014, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that no major political or policy decision happened without either Ahmed Patel’s consent or his knowledge. The man who developed a legendary reputation for operating largely at night became the key gatekeeper to Sonia Gandhi—in terms of who she would meet, what she would prioritise, and which way she would veer—and the most formidable, but largely invisible, power centre in India in recent decades.If a Congress leader had a grievance, he went to Patel. If a state was headed for elections, it was left to Patel to determine the candidates and tone of the campaign. If a Cabinet reshuffle had to take place, it was Patel who deliberated on the names with Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. If an ally had to be managed, it was Patel who worked his phones. If resources had to be mobilised, it was Patel who tapped his corporate network, often leveraging his Gujarati roots with the country’s biggest business houses. If a top bureaucratic appointment was in the offing, officials lined up, quietly—and yes, again in the middle of the night—to make their case to Patel. If the Opposition had to be countered—either by political management or using the instruments of the State (including in violation of the spirit of democratic norms)—it was Patel who gave the green signal. If the media strategy was to be decided, Patel gave the talking points to the party’s spokespersons or briefed journalists, almost always off the record. If a party unit in a state was in the grip of a factional divide, it was left to Patel to read the riot act and reconcile interests. This, indeed, was the hard mechanics of politics that Patel thrived in—away from the public glare on the more orchestrated elements of political theatre.In the last six years, Patel had to deal with two distinct transitions. One was the change in the national political climate, with a dominant BJP, led by his old acquaintance, and some suggest, friend, from his Gujarat days — Narendra Modi—changing the vocabulary and rules of Indian politics. But it was not as much Modi, with whom Patel did share cordial ties, but Amit Shah, who saw Patel as among those responsible for the cases against him in Gujarat, who decided to challenge Patel’s power—including in the thriller of a contest for his Rajya Sabha seat from Gujarat in 2017. Patel won that battle, and this was testament to how, even at his weakest, he had the instruments to secure his interests.The second was the more immediate internal generational transition within his own party, with Sonia Gandhi stepping back and Rahul Gandhi emerging as the next leader. Rahul Gandhi was understood to have deep scepticism of the party’s “Old Guard”, which he blamed for the weaknesses of the United Progressive Alliance government and for the larger political culture within the Congress. Rahul Gandhi appeared to think that the presence of well-entrenched political leaders around his father and mother had led them to make political mistakes. Never confirmed by either side, and often the subject of Delhi’s political grapevine, Patel—in this viewpoint—represented the Old.But over the past few years, even Rahul Gandhi appeared to recognise the indispensability of Ahmed Patel. He played a key, but behind-the-scenes role, along with his old friend who too had cut his teeth in the late 1970s and early ’80s, Ashok Gehlot, in helping Rahul Gandhi mount an aggressive campaign in the Gujarat elections of 2017; he played his part in managing the Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh elections in 2018, with success; as treasurer, he ensured that the Congress—despite being out of power—had the resources to put up a fight in 2019; with Sonia Gandhi‘s return as the party chief, he helped rehabilitate Bhupinder Hooda in Haryana, posing a challenge to the BJP in state polls; and he was a behind-the-scenes architect of the Maharashtra alliance with another of his older, former colleagues, Sharad Pawar.For a man who entered the national political theatre when the Congress was in Opposition 43 years ago, and has left the theatre of life when the Congress is in Opposition now, Ahmed Patel’s life was marked by his relationship with power, even though he wore that power very lightly, with a smile, often understating his own authority and being tentative about any evolving political situation. Or perhaps it was because he had seen power so up close that there was also this tentativeness about Patel; certitudes, he knew, did not work in democratic politics.There can be a strong critique of his importance—for should a man who largely operated invisibly have exercised such power without the commensurate public accountability? Was he so immersed in just navigating the corridors of power in central Delhi that he failed to read the political currents on the ground and prepare his party leadership accordingly? But irrespective of one’s views on Patel, there is little doubt that he remained a true, loyal, indispensable pillar of the Congress—and, by extension, of Indian politics. The party will feel his loss deeply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-centrality-of-ahmed-patel-in-indian-politics/story-zZpBEDzhUqDqFeNCVeZfdN.html
25-11-2020||India||NDA likely to name BJP nominee for Rajya Sabha bypoll, LJP gets cold shoulder||NDA partners in Bihar have started backroom talks to put up a joint candidate, preferably from the BJP, to fill up a Rajya Sabha seat that fell vacant following the death of LJP founder and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan.The reason why the BJP likely to get the seat despite the LJP led by Chirag Paswan having a natural claim is said to be the objections raised by the Janata Dal (United) which is extremely upset with the 38-year-old Paswan scion who put up candidates against its nominees in the recent assembly election. The LJP played the role of a spoilsport to reduce the JD(U)’s tally to just 43 seats.Paswan’s term in the Rajya Sabha was till April 2, 2024. This means, the new incumbent to the seat would have a term for almost four years. Sources said the JD(U) leadership has already intimated the BJP about its reservations about the LJP’s nominee amid speculations that Chirag was initially keen on making his mother Reena Paswan the candidate for the seat arguing it would be a right tribute to the deceased former union minister who had shared a close bond with the BJP till his end. “The JD(U) at no cost would support a LJP candidate. There are certain reservations on it and we stand by it,” said a senior JD(U) functionary who did not want to be named.The BJP, knowing well how important the JD (U) is for the NDA that has a small majority in the 243-member house is not in any mood to annoy chief minister Nitish Kumar and has almost made up its mind to put its candidate for the seat. A candidate from the JD(U) cannot be ruled out at the moment though the JD(U) bagged two seats out of three NDA got in its kitty against five vacant seats from Bihar in the Rajya Sabha polls last March. The BJP, is also in no mood to give LJP the seat which was in the saffron party’s kitty till Ravishankar Prasad was elected to the Lok Sabha. “This is our seat. Late Ramvilas ji was adjusted on our seat because of the formula worked out during the Lok Sabha polls as the late leader enjoyed respect of all NDA leaders,” clarified a BJP state functionary. Even the LJP camp, aware of its limitations to push for its own nominee has apparently sent feelers to the BJP that any candidate from its side would be acceptable to the party. “We have left it to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to decide on the candidate. The LJP has been reiterating that the party is with the BJP at the Centre,” said party’s state spokesperson Asraf Ansari. Significantly, the names of many candidates from the BJP are doing the rounds for the seat including former Union minister Shahnawaz Hussain and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, whose candidature for the RS berth is based on the perception that the senior BJP leader was not given the post of deputy CM this time and he could be accommodated suitably at the Union cabinet. Shahnawaj too is a strong candidate having waited for a long time to get a RS berth. “I am not aware of any move about my candidature for RS berth. I cannot comment on speculations,” Modi said, when asked about the likelihood of him being the BJP’s nominee to the vacant seat for the upper house of Parliament. However, BJP sources say that one cannot rule out a surprise element as far as Rajya Sabha polls are concerned just as it was in the case of the deputy CM’s post. As things stand, there are chances the nominee for the RS seat from the NDA – which could win the seat easily having 126 MLAs as against 122 required for sailing through in the election- would be decided in the next few days after the first session of the 17th assembly concludes on Friday. The chances of the opposition RJD-led Grand Alliance putting up a candidate cannot be ruled out given how it cornered the state government in the Speaker’s election by fielding its own nominee. In case, the GA puts a candidate for the RS seat, the election would be no less a close finish as chances of cross voting cannot be ruled out, which could put the ruling NDA in trouble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nda-likely-to-name-bjp-nominee-for-rajya-sabha-bypoll-ljp-gets-cold-shoulder/story-VOBowuiEgazFQeUrQJJANO.html
25-11-2020||India||BJP’s Vijay Sinha elected Speaker of Bihar assembly||BJP MLA Vijay Kumar Sinha was on Wednesday elected as Speaker of the Bihar assembly by a majority vote.Sinha, who was the candidate of the ruling NDA, got 126 votes as against 114 polled in favour of RJD’s Awadh Bihari Chaudhary who was fielded by the opposition Grand Alliance.The voting was marred by rumpus caused by opposition members who protested presence of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on the floor of the House on the ground that he was a member of the legislative council.The chair,however, overruled the objection saying being leader of the house the chief minister’s presence is legitimate.The opposition also demanded voting by secret ballot which was turned down by pro tem Speaker Jitan Ram Manjhi who went ahead with headcount after dissatisfaction was raised by the opposition over voice vote.Later, the chief minister, Deputy Chief Ministers- Tar Kishor Prasad and Renu Devi- and opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav escorted Sinha to the Speaker’s chair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-vijay-sinha-elected-speaker-of-bihar-assembly/story-x5l9sMSf2R4KvLUO8NYdAL.html

This statue of him is the tallest statue in the world. It is a matter of pride for all of us countrymen,” President Kovind said at the 80th All India Presiding Officers’ Conference.“Mavalankar believed that Parliament and the state ‍Legislature should operate in a way that is best for the public interest,” he said, adding that the all members must forget their political differences and arrive at a consensus focused at achieving the objective of public interest.The Lok Sabha has organised the two-day conference at the banks of the Narmada River to celebrate the Constitution Day. The theme of the event is “Harmonious Coordination Between Legislature, Executive and Judiciary - Key to a Vibrant Democracy.”The 80th meeting of presiding officers of the Indian legislative assemblies and Parliament marked the return of the outdoor appearance of President Kovind in public programmes after almost seven months. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Kovind had cut down on visitors, attended events virtually and avoided travelling outside Rashtrapati Bhavan.Vice president and Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat, the state’s chief minister Vijay Rupani were among those who attended the programme. Speaker Birla is also the chairperson of the conference.The All India Presiding Officers Conference began in 1921 and the Gujarat event marks its centenary year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oppn-has-an-important-role-president-kovind-at-all-india-presiding-officers-conference/story-Ly1wNZ5xv4NqQxh6sDuREP.html
25-11-2020||India||‘At times, the legislature too has tended to cross the line’: Vice President Naidu||Underlining that none of the three organs of the State can claim to be supreme as only the Constitution is paramount, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Wednesday said some court verdicts gave a distinct impression of the judiciary’s overreach.He said the legislature, the executive and the judiciary are bound to work within their respective domains as defined in the Constitution.Addressing the 80th All India Presiding Officers’ Conference on “Harmonious Coordination between Legislature, Executive and Judiciary - Key to Vibrant Democracy”, Naidu said harmony lies in each organ doing its job without interfering with that of the others.This warrants a spirit of mutual respect, responsibility and restraint. Unfortunately, there have been several instances of crossing the boundaries, he said.Naidu said there have been quite a few judicial pronouncements that gave a distinct impression of an overreach.Citing some instances, he said it is not desirable for the judiciary to be perceived as acting as the “super executive” or the “super legislature”. “Since independence, the Supreme Court and the high courts have delivered several far-reaching verdicts in furtherance of socio-economic objectives, besides making correctional interventions. But occasionally, concerns have been raised as to whether they were entering the domains of the legislative and executive wings.“There have been debates as to whether some issues should have been more legitimately left to the other organs of the government,” the vice president said.The higher judiciary deciding on Diwali fireworks, denying the executive any role in the appointment of judges through collegiums, invalidating the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act seeking to enforce accountability and transparency were some of the instances cited by Naidu.“At times, the legislature too has tended to cross the line. The 39th Constitution amendment placing the election of president, vice president and prime minister beyond the scope of judicial scrutiny in the circumstances in 1975 is one such instance,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-times-the-legislature-too-has-tended-to-cross-the-line-vice-president-naidu/story-DgGOy7ZrdCBhEKPdovSgFL.html
25-11-2020||India||Ahmed Patel: Congress’ indispensable man, an emissary and an archetypal party person||The Congress has lost Ahmed Patel when it needed him the most. Forever understated and low profile, he was fiercely loyal to the party and its top leadership, especially Sonia Gandhi, whom he served as political secretary even before the formation of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime in 2004.Patel was to Sonia Gandhi what RK Dhawan was to her mother-in-law, Indira Gandhi. Always a man of few words, he kept out of the media glare, carrying out her edicts without standing up to be seen. The power he drew from his proximity to the party president was discreetly used in her name. At times he was an emissary, at times a plenipotentiary.Having the leader’s ear and her confidence lent Patel the aura and the gravitas to interface with party colleagues and alliance partners. He was at once a Gandhi confidant, point person, and troubleshooter. But for his backroom stratagem, the Manmohan Singh regime wouldn’t have survived the Opposition’s no-trust motion after the Left parties withdrew support over the Indo-US nuclear deal in 2008. That, perhaps, was the only time when Patel seemed to take credit for a job well done, fleetingly letting his guard down to show this writer a congratulatory SMS he received from Gandhi.Also Read: Great friend, irreplaceable comrade: Congress leaders remember Ahmed PatelA three-term Lok Sabha and five-time Rajya Sabha member, Patel never held a ministerial office, be it under Rajiv Gandhi, whom he served as parliamentary secretary in the early 1980s, or in the UPA regime. He was an archetypal party person, an apparatchik whose membership of the Congress’s core group fetched him a slot on the high table with the PM, Gandhi, and a select group of top ministers: AK Antony, Arjun Singh and Pranab Mukherjee.Not surprising then that he was the repository of all information in the Congress. As the one who knew the leadership’s mind, he spoke, when required, in monosyllables, using innuendoes to drop hints. He advised Gandhi but never transgressed his brief. As the media’s go-to man in the Congress, his word was as good as that of the high command. The position fetched him as many friends across parties as he had rivals within the Congress.There was no dearth of senior colleagues who envied him deeply; who conspired and ran whisper campaigns against him, incessantly attributing to him their personal comeuppance and the party’s organisational woes. He often was the whipping boy who kept his counsel to weather personal storms that were aplenty. His success lay in the fact that even his worst detractors ran to him for help on finding themselves in a spot.The one time Patel seemed to go wrong was when he hinted at the then telecom minister A Raja’s ejection from the Cabinet at the height of the 2G scam that hit UPA-2. But there, too, he hadn’t misread the leadership’s inclination to drop the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader. The PM had made up his mind. His prerogative was negated by the “compulsions of coalition” that saw the DMK patriarch, M Karunanidhi, insisting on Raja’s continuation.Crisis in fact hit the UPA-2 in the early phases of the Congress-led coalition’s return to power in 2009. At the heart of it was Sharm El Sheikh. It was left to Patel to convey to the PM the party’s strong disapproval of his joint statement (drawing its name from the Egyptian resort) with the then Pakistan prime minister, Yusuf Raza Gilani.The Congress brass was startled by the agreement delinking action against terrorism from the bilateral composite dialogue process. Not just that, the first ever reference to Balochistan (where Pakistan accuses India of fomenting trouble) in an India-Pak communiqué gave the Bharatiya Janata Party the ammunition to go all guns booming for the government.On his way to Egypt, Singh visited France to attend its national day function. The Congress was as much in the dark about the participation of an Indian contingent at the Bastille Day parade. From all available accounts, Patel was at his deferential best during his call on the PM, with whom he had cordial relations. The polite message he had for him was: there’s a party that runs the government and is accountable for all its actions.“Whence do we find another one like him,” bemoaned P Chidambaram in a condolence tweet. The tribute was as apt as it was telling about Patel’s indispensability to the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmed-patel-congress-indispensable-man-an-emissary-and-an-archetypal-party-person/story-Nsua8N5up0zwBHZZ6YWRqK.html
25-11-2020||India||Murder suspect in Chhattisgarh allegedly dies after police torture||A junior engineer of Electricity Department, who was one of the suspects in a murder case died due to police torture in Surajpur district 330 km north of Raipur, the family alleged on Wednesday. The police refuted the allegations as baseless and said he engineer died in hospital due to a heart attack. The junior engineer, Punam Katlam, was posted in Surajpur’s Latori sub-station of electricity department and was one of the three suspects in a murder which took place on November 22. Police said that the engineer along with three others killed one Harish Chand Rajwada (24) on November 22 after a fight over some issue. “On November 23, when we started investigation, we learnt that Katlam and four others including Rajwada had been drinking at the murder spot. When we started quizzing Katlam he said that he was feeling uneasy and hence he was immediately shifted to hospital in the evening. In the morning of November 24, Katlam had a heart attack when he went to toilet along with another person,” said Superintendent of Police, Surajpur, Rajesh Kukreja. However, the family alleged that Katlam was detained by the Surajpur police and was badly beaten. “There are injury marks on my brother’s body, which suggest torture after he was detained by the police,” said Deepak Katlam, who is a policeman himself.Deepak demanded a high-level enquiry into the death of his brother. Kukreja refuted the allegations said that the injury marks were because of the scuffle which took place during the murder of Harish Chand. “They had huge fight with wooden sticks during the scuffle with Harish Chand,” SP said. The SP further said that police have requested the district judge to initiate a judicial enquiry into the matter after the allegations of the family. “We want transparency into the issue hence we requested a judicial enquiry,” SP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/murder-accused-in-chhattisgarh-allegedly-dies-after-police-torture/story-JQX5aZ0qiVFBni86R8B7MN.html

Bihar CM & Minister Ashok Choudhary present in Assembly are MLCs. https://t.co/SPDgsurypf pic.twitter.com/ttj2J5bMXKThe RJD-led Grand Alliance (GA) has fielded Awadh Bihari Choudhary as their candidate against the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) nominee Vijay Kumar Sinha for the post of the Speaker in the Bihar assembly. The Opposition’s move is the first test of strength for chief minister Nitish Kumar-led NDA government which has a slender majority in the 243-member House.“The RJD, and GA allies, Congress and three Left parties, felt the need to field our own candidate as Choudhary is a senior legislator with wide experience and has the ability to run the House impartially by striking a balance between Opposition and ruling parties. His election as Speaker would help members raise people’s issues and get them addressed,” Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, leader of the GA and Leader of the Opposition leader in the assembly, had said.After filing their nominations on Tuesday afternoon, both Choudhary, who is a six-time RJD MLA and Sinha, a senior BJP MLA, expressed confidence about having the required number of MLAs to win the election. Both of them have served as ministers in previous governments.The decision to field Choudhary is a breakaway from the traditional practice of election of the Speaker unanimously. It points to how the Opposition, with its 110 MLAs, is in no mood to give the NDA, with 126 MLAs, much leeway inside the assembly. More so, because the NDA banks heavily on the support of smaller allies like Vikasheel Inssan Party (VIP) and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM)(S).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-mlas-create-ruckus-in-bihar-assembly-oppose-voice-vote-in-speaker-election/story-ZdttG9lBfQFmp9ypBVlF2N.html

After the daily Covid cases in the city have drastically reduced since September, we are ensuring that reverse migration should not lead to a surge in cases.”The BMC which was expecting a surge in Covid-19 cases after Diwali, has stocked required medicines and oxygen supply to the same level as it was needed during peak of the pandemic in September. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have seen a steady growth of daily Covid cases after Diwali which is a good sign. Having said that, we have made arrangements to the highest level. Oxygen supply has been scaled up to what it was needed during the Covid peak.”Even though the active cases at present are around 10, 000, the BMC says that it is equipped to handle more than 38, 000 active patients in the city. “Nearly 10 per cent of the total oxygen supply is being used since the active cases are low. We have kept the staff of vacant beds on standby in case there is a rise in cases. The city is equipped to handle a Covid surge,” Kakani added.Last week, the BMC had prepared a list of 20, 000 homes that were found locked during the ‘My Family My Responsibility’ survey and had decided to revisit these homes and conduct Covid tests if needed. The majority of these homes are believed to be of those who left Mumbai after the lockdown was announced in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bmc-gets-proactive-to-check-spread-of-covid-19-as-migrants-return-to-mumbai/story-TYSa3X0UgkodjYDfQPGy5M.html

On Tuesday, India imposed a fresh ban on Chinese-origin apps, the fourth time it has done so since the border standoff in Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) emerged in the open in May. With this, the total number of Chinese-origin apps banned by India has gone up to 267. “We firmly oppose the Indian side’s repeated use of ‘national security’ as an excuse to prohibit some mobile apps with Chinese background,” said Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong. Also Read: India’s ban on 43 Chinese apps is the 4th strike since Ladakh stand offJi called on India to withdraw the ban on the ground that it went against the WTO’s rules. “We hope the Indian side provides a fair, impartial and non-discriminatory business environment for all market players from various countries, including China, and rectify the discriminatory practices violating WTO rules,” she said. Also Watch l India bans more Chinese apps: AliExpress, SnackVideo, CamCard in list of 43 The Chinese government, Ji said, has always required that overseas Chinese companies “abide by international rules, operate in compliance with laws and regulations and conform to public order and good morals”. China and India represent “opportunities of development to each other rather than threats”, Ji said, reiterating a line taken by Beijing since the border standoff began. “Both sides should bring bilateral economic and trade relations back to the right path for mutual benefit and win-win results on the basis of dialogue and negotiation,” she added. The border standoff involving tens of thousands of troops from both sides is currently in its seventh month, and several rounds of diplomatic and military talks have failed to lead to a breakthrough in disengagement and de-escalation at key friction points such as Pangong Lake, Hot Spring and Depsang. Troops from both sides have now dug in for the harsh winter, and India has been rushing equipment such as winter clothing and shelters to soldiers in forward areas. Since the standoff emerged in the open, India has tightened rules related to Chinese investments in the country and cracked down on Chinese-origin apps under provisions of the Information Technology Act, saying they “engaging in activities which are prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order”. India initially banned 59 Chinese-origin apps on June 29, before banning 47 more on July 28, 118 more on September 2 and 43 more on November 24. Among the apps banned on Tuesday was the one of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba’s AliExpress app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-says-india-s-latest-app-ban-order-violates-wto-rules/story-xgktTlRi1Jyg06C3rmC6xJ.html

The department of telecommunications accepted the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) recommendations because the move would allow creating numbering space for fixed-line and mobile services.The circular dated November 20 also said that it may inform landline customers about this change. “Fixed-to-mobile calls shall be dialled with prefix ‘0’. Suitable announcement may be fed in the fixed line switches to apprise the fixed line subscribers about the requirement of dialling the prefix ‘0’ for all fixed-to-mobile calls,” it said. “All the fixed line subscribers should be provided with `0’ dialling facility, that is, STD dialling facility,” the circular posted on DoT’s website said.DoT has given telecom service providers till January 1 to implement the newly-recommended changes. This change was recommended by TRAI to DoT earlier this year in May. According to PTI, TRAI had said that adding a 0 to a mobile number while dialling from a fixed-line number. TRAI also said that introducing this new pattern will add 2,544 million additional numbering resources for mobile service providers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-january-1-add-0-before-dialling-a-mobile-number-from-your-landline/story-LmhDYWuGQmDn8kQmuwaK9K.html

But I stay here, not just during Chhath Puja, but also during Durga Puja, Christsman and Eid. This is my parampara,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee had said earlier this week, while adding that people need not be afraid of outsiders. The BJP has hit back, saying that Banerjee’s statements indicate that she has taken it for granted that West Bengal has turned into West Bangladesh, where people need to produce documents to enter the state. Also read | Bihar battle won, BJP turns focus to Bengal, vows to transform it into GujaratThe TMC has upped its ante against the BJP on this front, more so after the latter sent five of its Central leaders, hailing from other states, to take stock of the party’s preparedness in the state. “What happened to their district presidents? Why did they need to parachute leaders from outside the state?” questioned veteran TMC leader and minister Partha Chatterjee. “Have things come to such a low that Bengal and Bengalis will bow down to them? Should Bengalis accept leaders from other states thrust upon them?” said state minister Bratya Basu. Basu also said that outsiders who do not know Rabindranath Tagore are dictating terms to the people of the state. “We had seen how violence perpetrated by them led to desecration of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar’s bust (during May 2019 Lok Sabha polls campaign),” Basu added. Leaders of BJP’s state unit said that the CM was doing more harm to Bengalis by trying to project some people as outsiders. “More than four million Bengalis are working in other states. What if they are tagged as outsiders and asked to return to Bengal? Will Mamata Banerjee be able to provide them jobs? Has she taken for granted that the state of West Bengal has become West Bangladesh? Do we need to produce documents to enter Bengal just the way it was in Kashmir?” Dilip Ghosh, chief of the BJP’s state unit had said to reporters on Saturday. Meanwhile, in a bid to build its own connect with the people, the state administration has announced a programme, Duare Duare Paschim Banga Sarkar (West Bengal government at every doorstep) to address the grievances of the people. “Party leaders have been asked to increase their connection with the local people living in towns and villages. Every Saturday, leaders will be visiting villages and towns. They would be taking along the local administration. This would not just build local connect but will also help address grievances on the spot,” said a senior TMC minister. Ridiculing the programme, the BJP said TMC leaders should also take the local police with them as people were peeved with them. Buoyed by its impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections where the BJP won 40% of the vote share in Bengal and bagged 18 out of the 42 seats in the state, the party is now eyeing the state assembly. “The BJP had sent its Central leaders to the state. They have done their work and have returned while the state unit continues to work on ground. But the TMC is so terrified that they are still talking about the Central leaders,” said Ghosh. The party is aiming for at least 200 of 294 seats in the House and is putting together its biggest election machinery ever in the state. Top state office-bearers of the BJP said party leaders will be arriving in Bengal from Delhi and other states to work with the local unit for polls. They would be part of a 45-member team to be set up for each constituency which will be helped by the existing district committees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-assembly-elections-around-corner-tmc-desperate-to-brand-bjp-as-outsider/story-NmMnfWKGTRizRtXJZ5taTK.html

25-11-2020||India||PM Modi likely to lay foundation stone for new Parliament building in Dec: Report||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to lay the foundation stone for a new Parliament building in the first half of December, sources said. The sources further said that around five statues, including that of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhim Rao Ambedkar, in the Parliament complex are also likely to be relocated temporarily due to the construction work and they will be reinstalled at prominent places within the new complex once the project is completed. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project and it is expected to be completed in 21 months from the start of construction work.The redevelopment project of Central Vista -- the nation’s power corridor -- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate. Although the proposed date of laying the foundation stone of the new Parliament building is around December 10, the final date would depend on the availability of the prime minister, the sources said. According to the plan, the new Parliament building, which will have separate offices for all MPs, will be equipped with the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating “paperless offices”. The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India’s democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space. The sources said that five statues, including that of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhim Rao Ambedkar, at the existing Parliament complex are likely to be relocated temporarily and they would be reinstalled once the construction work of the new Parliament building is completed. The iconic 16-feet high statue of Mahatma Gandhi is located opposite Gate Number 1 of Parliament House. The statue greets visitors entering Parliament House and has also been the location of gatherings, protests and press interactions by MPs. According to Rajya Sabha’s website, the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in a meditating posture sculpted by Ram Sutar, was unveiled by the then President of India Dr Shankar Dayal Sharma on October 2, 1993. It also said that the statue was donated by the Ministry of Urban Development. In September, Tata Projects Limited had won the bid to construct a new parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore. The existing building is a British-era building, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi. The foundation stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on February 12, 1921 and the construction took six years and cost Rs 83 lakh at that time. The opening ceremony was performed on January 18, 1927 by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin. According to the CPWD, the existing Parliament building will continue to function during the entire period of execution of the project. Once the new building is built, the existing Parliament building will be used for other purposes. The CPWD had said, “The plinth of the new building shall match that of the existing one, which is approximately 1.8 metres above the ground level.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-likely-to-lay-foundation-stone-for-new-parliament-building-in-december-report/story-pzGY7rHW0Bk4Ch4W4wSDKI.html

Adhikari was not available for comment. “I met Adhikari. I will brief the party’s top leadership. Some misunderstanding has happened,” said Roy after meeting Adhikari in Kolkata on Monday. He, however, refused to divulge any details.In north Bengal, another minister Rabindranath Ghosh was sent to meet Mihir Goswami, a rebel TMC MLA from Cooch Behar. Goswami has recently said that TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee was no more in control of the party.“Adhikari has never said that he is coming to BJP. But they (TMC) are hell bent on pushing him towards BJP. We don’t need any leaders. But if anyone wants to put up a fight against the ongoing injustice he is welcome,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of BJP’s Bengal unit. While the TMC’s top leadership were trying to fix the rift with Adhikari, another TMC MP Kalyan Banerjee launched a veiled attack against the transport minister.“Leave the party if you have guts. I have seen many rebels. Why are you still a minister even after being a rebel? Are you yet to receive the assurance (from another political party)? Kalyan Banerjee.Though infighting is not new in the TMC, the current spate has its roots in the induction of younger faces in district committees during a reshuffle in July this year. Done on the recommendations of poll strategist Prashant Kishor, the structural changes have made many old-timers insecure.Meanwhile in Kolkata, another minister Sadhan Pande and TMC MLA Paresh Paul sniped at each other. This is, however, not the first time that the minister has voiced his protest against a section of the party leaders. After cyclone Amphan, the minister had attacked the TMC government over the manner in which the aftermath of the cyclone was handled. The BJP which has emerged as the principal opposition in the state has upped its ante saying that the TMC is a sinking ship.“TMC is a sinking ship. Just like Mamata Banerjee has killed democracy within the state, the same is being practiced in their party. Discontent is brewing among the entire TMC cadre. Everyone is sure about the end of the long run of violence and appeasement politics of Mamata Banerjee,” tweeted Arvind Menon, national secretary of BJP who has been made co-incharge of the party in West Bengal for the upcoming election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-desperately-trying-to-fix-chinks-in-armour-but-new-ones-continue-to-show-up/story-xXcvx1FRQvIoG9KN4sb18L.html

Chiranjeevi’s appreciation for KCR comes within three days of days his younger brother Pawan Kalyan, also a popular actor and president of Jana Sena Party, extending support to Bharatiya Janata Party in the GHMC elections. Both the TRS and BJP are involved in a bitter fight for capturing power in the GHMC. Chiranjeevi, along with other functionaries of the Telugu film industry, met the chief minister on Sunday and discussed the problems faced by the industry, including producers and distributors, due to Coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, KCR announced in the party manifesto that the TRS government would reimburse the State GST for small budget films (up to Rs 10 crore), allow theatres to increase the number of shows per day and make ticket pricing flexible following the losses incurred by the industry that has been having a dry run in the past eight months. Appreciating KCR’s gesture, Chiranjeevi tweeted: “Heartfelt thanks to Hon’ble CM Shri #KCR garu for the relief measures to the film industry. Trust that these compassionate measures surely will go a long way in reviving the industry badly hit by the pandemic and put it back on the path to progress. #TelanganaCMO.” Chiranjeevi’s son Ram Charan who is also a popular actor joined his father in thanking the Telangana government for the relief measures which will go a long way towards restoration of normalcy in Telugu film industry. Chiranjeevi’s appreciation for KCR drew flak from fans of his younger brother Pawan Kalyan and the BJP ranks. “This is not the time to support KCR when elections are being held, brother. If possible, you have to support your brother or keep silent. But please don’t indulge in cheap politics,” a supporter of Pawan Kalyan commented on Chiranjeevi’s tweet. Another fan of Pawan commented that it was enough if Chiranjeevi felt happy with the sops for film industry. “Please think about common man, who suffered most. You should bother about the problems being faced by common people, not just film industry,” he said. “It is okay if the government showers sops on people of film industry. But what about the lives of the people who watch the movies? It is because of their hard-earned money the film industry is surviving. But you forget your role in the once-in-five years elections,” another fan of Pawan Kalyan observed. Chiranjeevi made an unsuccessful attempt in politics by floating Praja Rajyam Party in 2008 but was forced to merge it with the Congress in 2012. He became Rajya Sabha member and Union minister of state for tourism in Manmohan Singh cabinet. After the Congress party’s debacle in 2014 polls, Chiranjeevi quietly distanced himself from politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chiranjeevi-praises-kcr-for-trs-manifesto-in-ghmc-polls-draws-flak-from-bjp-supporters/story-J5DX0Cf2Q3cynRKwEEo9VM.html

Also read | Russia says vaccine 95% effective, roll-out in Jan“A crucial part of the strategy is to get the exact list of people who need to be vaccinated on priority. States were asked to draw up a list of the population groups which will be given the vaccine in the first phase. To begin with, we are looking at vaccinating about 30 million frontline workers. That’s our topmost priority as they are at maximum risk of exposure to the virus,” said a senior health ministry official.Also Watch l SII’s Adar Poonawalla on Covid vaccine, pricing and rollout at #HTLS2020 Different categories have been made for vaccine administration on priority by the Centre’s national vaccine committee on Covid-19.Corona warriors, including health care and frontline workers, people above 65 years of age, those between 50 and 65 years of age, and those below 50 years of age with chronic diseases are on the list that is to be given the vaccine on priority.Union health ministry has asked states to set up committees to oversee and coordinate the vaccination process at the ground level while making sure that there are minimal disruptions in other routine healthcare services.In a letter written to states earlier, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan suggested constitution of committees at state and district levels to review preparatory activities. “In all likelihood, the Covid-19 vaccine introduction will span over a year with multiple groups being included sequentially, starting from healthcare workers. Therefore, it is important to create a strong advisory and coordination mechanism at the state and district level to guide the process of Covid-19 vaccine introduction while ensuring minimal disruption of other routine healthcare services, including immunisation,” according to the terms of references shared with the states. The committees will also coordinate cold chain augmentation, capacity building activities of vaccinators and field staff, wherever needed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-preparations-on-to-vaccinate-250-300-million-indians-on-priority/story-vwvouYhBhGq8eEOaUH0aMM.html

25-11-2020||India||‘Khichdification’ of medical education, practice: IMA on surgery nod for Ayurveda||The IMA on Tuesday demanded withdrawal of a Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) notification authorising post-graduate Ayurveda practitioners to be trained to perform general surgical procedures, saying the move was a “khichadification”, or a confused mix, of medical education and practice. The November 20 notification by the CCIM, a statutory body under the AYUSH Ministry to regulate the Indian systems of medicine, listed 39 general surgery procedures and around 19 procedures involving the eye, ear, nose and throat by amending the Indian Medicine Central Council (Post Graduate Ayurveda Education) Regulations, 2016. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on November 22 had condemned the move, describing it as a “retrograde step of mixing the systems”.    In a statement issued on Tuesday, the IMA said the long list of modern medicine surgeries that have been enlisted under Shalya Tantra and Shalakya Tantra squarely fall under the ambit, authority and jurisdiction of the modern medicine practice. While the AYUSH Ministry issued a clarification claiming that the technical terms and modern developments are a common heritage of mankind, the IMA rejected their clarification as being “deceptive camouflage of mixing the systems of medicine”.  “The entire modern medical profession of the nation feels betrayed by the level of violation and encroachment by the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM). It is nothing but a blatant attempt at mixopathy and khichadification of medical education and practice. The CCIM amendments cannot be seen in isolation. The National Education Policy 2020 speaks of medical pluralism and lateral entry laying the foundation legitimising mixopathy,” it said. “India remains at the frontier of modern medicine today with medical care of international standards and well-reputed Indian doctors serving the globe. What is the point in losing such a legacy and leadership,” asked IMA national president Rajan Sharma. Seeking an emergency session, the Central Working Committee of IMA has directed all the 28 state branches to hold their State Working Committees. The quantum and timing of the first all-India response to the situation is being determined which, IMA said, it ensures will not be later than December 2. “This is not the issue of the profession alone, but also entails serious inroads into the healthcare delivery system of the country. This involves calibration of patient care for years to come and people of India have a right to understand these manoeuvres. The patient’s choice to choose the system of medicine is being taken away in the naked attempt to mix all systems of medicine,” said IMA secretary general RV Asokan. “The empty words of the AYUSH Ministry of deep commitment to maintain the authenticity of Indian systems of medicine and that it is against any mixing of systems sound hollow in their pregnant silence to the medical pluralism advocated by the National Education Policy, 2020 and the infamous attempts of NITI Aayog to mix all systems of medicine into a single integrative system. They remain culpable and cannot be absolved of the crime,” he said. The IMA further stated that there are a plethora of issues arising out of such indiligent decisions which will directly impact patientcare and safety and it also questioned about the use of terminologies by Ayurveda practitioners. Questioning if AYUSH have their own anesthesia drugs and procedures, IMA asked whether the pre-anesthetic medication would be named as AYUSH drug, and the AYUSH doctors would be termed as AYUSH anesthetists. “It is very obvious that AYUSH is dependent on modern medicine doctors, anaesthesia, antibiotics and equipment to perform modern medicine surgical procedures. It fails the test of logic behind such irresponsible initiative placing thousands of gullible patients at risk,” the doctors’ body said in the statement. It questioned what about postoperative care and infection control and how will a system not subscribing to microbial theory find a way to control sepsis. It asked how the government will find adequate resources to create new infrastructure from nowhere to fend for this modern medicine B team. “The object and purpose of mixing the systems is perhaps borne out of a false claim on heritage. The medical colleges in Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai were established in 19th century and remain heritage of man.” “Some of the sensational discoveries like the malarial parasite and its treatment were formulated in India. Modern medicine is as much Indian... Rapid strides in modern medicine like vaccination and chemotherapy of tuberculosis took their baby steps in India,” Sharma added. It said the IMA is prepared for the ensuing long-drawn struggle for existence and identity. All associations of the fraternity including the specialities and students are determined to resist this ill-advised adventure in national life, the IMA said, adding the health of generations of Indians is at stake. According to the November 20 gazette notification the procedures listed include removal of metallic and non-metallic foreign bodies from non-vital organs, excision of simple cyst or benign tumours (lipoma, fibroma, schwanoma etc) of non-vital organs, amputation of gangrene, traumatic wound management,  foreign body removal from stomach, squint surgery, cataract surgery and functional endoscopic sinus surgery.

25-11-2020||India||NSCN says counter-insurgency ops will have ‘disastrous consequences’||The Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-IM) – the largest Naga rebel group which is currently in the final stages of peace talks with the Central government - has criticised the counter-insurgency operations against its cadres in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh and warned of “disastrous consequences” for both sides.It said the intensified operations against it has come as a rude shock. In a statement on Tuesday, it asserted that the Central government should handle the situation with great sensitivity and not prod its security forces to run amok against the NSCN.“In such a situation NSCN members cannot allow themselves to be sitting ducks. Our patience should not be translated as weak and helpless,” the NSCN (IM) said in a statement on Tuesday. “The consequences would be disastrous for both the parties.”The ceasefire with the NSCN (IM) does not apply to Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. The NSCN (IM)’s statement came on a day when chief of army staff General Manoj Mukund Naravane arrived in Kohima as part of his three-day visit to various formations under the army’s Eastern Command to review security and operational preparedness.The rebel group is of the view that the 1997 Indo-Naga ceasefire was signed with high hope for both the negotiating parties but ironically, when it came to jurisdiction of ceasefire, the government of India continues to speak in “ambivalent terms” even after 23 years of political talks.“Naga political issue cannot be undermined in such a manner that contradict the well-established historical and political rights of the Naga people spread across Nagaland, Manipur, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Myanmar,” it said.It maintained that the political rights of the Naga people is no longer an issue that needed any review as the signing of the Framework Agreement on the August 3, 2015 is a “living document” to take the government of India and NSCN (IM) through for the final solution.The group alleged that the Centre continued to waver when it only needed to exercise is its political will for a final deal. “This is a sign of weakness and insincerity,” it said.Maintaining that the framework agreement was symbolic of the Naga people’s desire to co-exist peacefully with India, the NSCN-IM claimed it has not been reciprocated with the correct political steps.“The Naga people’s sincere approach and search for permanent peace has been touted time and again to suit India’s colonial divide and rule policy. This is evidently seen in the ongoing Indo-Naga political talks,” it stated.It also said that the Naga people believed in a solution based on mutual respect of one another’s position, not in forced union bereft of political wisdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nscn-says-counter-insurgency-ops-will-have-disastrous-consequences/story-tT1GqRcOcFsc2FmukgHgBI.html

Pakistan is the source||The Indian Coast Guard has seized drugs, including 100kg of heroin, from a Sri Lankan boat in the high seas south of Thoothukudi during a nine-day operation that started on November 17, officials familiar with the development said on Wednesday. Six crew members, who identified themselves as Sri Lankan nationals, have been detained and are being interrogated.During their initial questioning, the crew members told Coast Guard officials that the drugs were transferred onto the Sri Lankan vessel “Shenaya Duwa” on the high seas by a Pakistani dhow from Karachi. The drugs were meant to be sent to western countries and Australia.Coast Guard officials had found 99 packets of heroin, 20 small boxes of synthetic drugs, five 9mm pistols and a Thuraya satellite phone set,” a second official associated with the operation said. The drugs had been hidden in an empty fuel tank on board.According to the crew members, the boat is allegedly owned by Alensu Kuttige Sinha Deeptha Sani Fernando from Negombo, a city on the west coast of Sri Lanka.The six were taken to the port of Thoothukudi, earlier known as Tuticorin, where they are being interrogated by a multi-agency team of officials.“Pakistan not only exports jihad but also drugs, which is used to fund terrorism,” one of the officials associated with the operation said.Besides investigating the potential recipients of the drugs in Tamil Nadu, Narcotics Control Bureau officials will also try to identify the source of the drugs in Pakistan. Officials said a Pakistan-based high valued drug trafficker with possible backup from the Pakistani deep state spearheads the multinational operation of trafficking of Afghan heroin.Investigation of huge seizures in the past have indicated connections of drug traffickers from across the borders with terrorist organisations such as Lashkar-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen.Officials said the NCB is working to dismantle the international supply chains used by drug traffickers but India’s geographic location does make this an arduous task. India is sandwiched between Golden Crescent on the northwestern frontier and Golden Triangle on the northeastern frontier. New Delhi has been working closely with Colombo and Male, sharing and receiving information about drug trafficking. The NCB has helped Sri Lanka, and Maldives to effect big seizures totaling 1,500 kgs of heroin in 2019-20 alone.Officials said they had received a message from the Sri Lankan coast guard about the boat when they were questioning the six crew members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coast-guard-intercepts-sri-lankan-boat-seizes-more-than-100kg-of-drugs/story-dmSOMuxvmBJY1oLKhykPvL.html
25-11-2020||India||As temperature drops, Patna’s air quality also deteriorates||With a dip in temperature, the air quality in Patna is approaching an alarming level as the city recorded poor air quality on both Monday and Tuesday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, the overall air quality index (AQI) of Patna, based on six monitoring stations across the city, stood at 292 which was classified as poor.Of the six monitoring stations, Danapur recorded the worst air quality with an AQI of 412 which fell under the severe category, followed by IGSC Planetarium Complex which recorded very poor air quality with an AQI of 331. While Muradpur,. Rajbanshi Nagar, Samanpura and Shikarpur air monitoring stations recorded an AQI between 240 and 280, all falling under the poor category.Muzaffarpur also recorded poor air quality with an index of 261 while Gaya recorded moderate air quality with AQI of 152.Also read | Stubble fires spiked in Punjab this year, dropped in Haryana, shows CPCB dataOn Monday, air quality of Patna remained poor with an AQI of 252 which was moderate till Sunday.For regulating air pollution during winters, the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has taken several initiatives which will yield desirable result in coming years.Officials of the control board said that deterioration of air quality is linked with dip in mercury. Patna logged a maximum temperature of 27.2 degrees Celsius and a minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celsius on Tuesday.BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said, “When the temperature falls, dust particles rise along with winds, turning the air quality comparatively poorer. Air quality starts worsening from rainy season and peaks during winter every year. Besides, geographical factors are also responsible for worsening air quality as Patna is situated near the Gangetic plain where alluvial soil is in abundance. During winters, soil particles rise, contributing to air pollution.” “We have introduced green technology at 60% brick kilns to reduce emission of hazardous gas. In the next two years, we expect to achieve 100% target. Besides, we are also working to concretise kuchcha pavements”, Ghosh added. Meanwhile, environmentalist in the city appealed the residents not to burst crackers in the on-going wedding season to prevent further deterioration of air quality. Ramapati Kumar, chief executive officer of the Centre of Environment and Energy Development (CEED), said, “Poor air quality causes respiratory illnesses on prolonged exposure. With the wedding season on, people burst crackers, which leads to air and noise pollution. Vehicular movement and construction work have also gained momentum with the lift of lockdown. Environmental pollution cannot be reduced without active involvement of the public. Wearing face mask is the only way to avoid inhaling toxic pollutants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-temperature-drops-patna-s-air-quality-also-deteriorates/story-pnuN2ZtN9yZ0fPqqli3KSN.html
25-11-2020||India||Supreme Court dismisses plea challenging PM Modi’s election from Varanasi||The Supreme Court on Tuesday “nipped in the bud” a petition challenging the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a member of Parliament (MP) from the Varanasi constituency in Uttar Pradesh during the general election held last year.The petition was moved by sacked constable of the Border Security Force (BSF) Tej Bahadur whose nomination as a candidate from the Varanasi seat was rejected by the returning officer. On December 6 last year, the Allahabad high court had knocked down Bahadur’s appeal on the ground that he was neither an elector nor a candidate under section 83 of the Representation of Peoples Act to challenge the winning candidate’s election. On Tuesday, a three-judge bench of the apex court headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde confirmed this view and dismissed the petition without issuing a notice to PM Modi.“Section 83 of the Act allows only an elector or candidate to maintain an election petition…In this sense, the election petition can also be set to be barred by section 81 read with section 86(1) of the Act. We are, therefore, of the view that the present election petition has been rightly nipped in the bud. The civil appeal is therefore dismissed,” said the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.The short order of 13 pages was authored by the CJI who examined the lone argument put forth by the sacked soldier that the officer who rejected his nomination failed to grant him additional time. Bahadur’s nomination was rejected as he failed to furnish a certificate from the Election Commission of India stating that his dismissal from service was on grounds other than corruption or disloyalty.This document is essential under section 33(3) of the Representation of Peoples Act. Any candidate who has been sacked on the above ground is barred from contesting polls for five years. Bahadur was sacked in April 2017 for circulating a video on the poor quality of food supplied to BSF jawans serving for the country and hence, the production of this certificate for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls was essential. Bahadur failed two nominations – one on April 24, 2019, as an independent candidate and later on April 29 as the candidate of the Samajwadi Party. In one form, he mentioned he was dismissed on grounds of disloyalty while in the other form he denied it. This led the returning officer to seek a certificate from EC, the absence of which led to rejection of his nomination.Senior advocate Harish Salve, who appeared for the Prime Minister, informed the court that granting additional time is left to the discretion of the returning officer and the appellant (Bahadur) cannot claim it as a matter of right. Since there was no proof forthcoming that he demanded more time, the court rejected this argument and said, “The appeal does not raise any arguable question of fact or law and admitting the appeal would amount to an exercise in futility for the court to do so.”Even on the maintainability of the petition, the apex court was of the view that Bahadur could not challenge the election of PM Modi as a voter of Varanasi since he was enrolled as an elector of Bhiwani, Mahendragarh parliamentary constituency in Haryana. And as his nomination stood rejected before polls, he was not a “duly nominated candidate” to maintain his present appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-dismisses-plea-challenging-pm-modi-s-election-from-varanasi/story-hA7yCLVlViVtbNpuyUKDqO.html
25-11-2020||India||UP’s new bio-fuel policy to reduce pollution due to stubble burning||The Uttar Pradesh government is ready with a new bio-fuel policy which is being seen as a significant move to deal effectively with the environmental crisis arising out of stubble burning by farmers in the state.The proposed policy seeks to promote and incentivise setting up of power generation plants based on paddy straws and also makes it mandatory for state-owned thermal stations to use agricultural residue as raw material with coal to fire the power plants. “The draft policy titled Uttar Pradesh Bio-Fuel Policy-2020 is ready and will soon be put before the cabinet for approval before the final policy is rolled out to effectively manage crop residues/stubble, among other things, in the state,” said a senior official dealing with the issue. According to the draft policy accessed by Hindustan Times, the state government will provide various incentives to private developers to set up paddy straw-based biomass power plants of 100 mw each through competitive biddings in the first phase, and depending on the experience, 300 mw plants can be set up in the next phase.To assure developers of remunerable returns on their investment, it will be binding on the UP Power Corporation Ltd (UPPCL) to enter into long-term power purchase agreements with them to buy power from such plants for 20 years at the tariff to be fixed by the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC). The state government will provide an annual grant of more than Rs 250 crore to the UPPCL to buy power that might be a little costlier than what it procures from other sources. “Setting up such power plants will stop 10 million tonnes (MT) of paddy straw from being burnt by farmers in their fields every year,” the draft policy points out. It is estimated that that around 16 MT paddy straw is produced in the state, of which 4 MT is used by farmers themselves while the 12 MT paddy straw is burnt in the fields. Another significant feature of the proposed policy is that it seeks to make it mandatory for the UP Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd (Uprvunl) to use agricultural residue in ‘pellet’ form as a raw material along with coal in its power plants to generate electricity. The NTPC, according to sources, is already using agricultural residue along with coal to fire its thermal plants at various places across the country after it found the experiment at the Dadri thermal plant to be successful. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had floated the idea three years ago. Under the new policy, local urban bodies will make the solid waste available to the biomass energy plants at their premises free of cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-s-new-bio-fuel-policy-to-reduce-pollution-due-to-stubble-burning/story-9T1Chsfa19IHKJ4asX3S1I.html

25-11-2020||India||UGC forms panel to probe irregularities in Jamia Hamdard||The University Grants Commission (UGC) has formed a four-member fact-finding team to examine allegations of financial and administrative irregularities in the functioning of the Jamia Hamdard deemed university, including whether its governance structure is in accordance with the prescribed norms, according to a person aware of the development. This assumes significance since governance issues have emerged in an educational body designated as one of the Institutions of Eminence (IoE), a tag UGC has conferred on 10 public and 10 private universities to encourage them become world class teaching and research bodies as per a 2016 budget decision. UGC formed the committee after a complaint by Hamid Ahmed, the chancellor of the university, against vice-chancellor Seyed Ehtesham Hasnain, according to the person cited above who did not want to be named. “There have been charges and counter-charges from both sides — which are of serious nature. Considering the importance of an institution that has been included among those selected for the IoE process, and also since it (the deemed university) receives UGC grants, the commission has formed an expert panel that will look into a range of areas regarding the functioning,” said this person. While Ahmed has alleged irregularities related to financial and administrative matters, Hasnain has submitted a point-by-point rebuttal, he said. The four-member committee, which will conduct the probe, comprises Rama Shanker Dubey, vice chancellor, Central University of Gujarat; Avinash C Pandey, former vice chancellor, Bundelkhand University; RD Sahay, a former senior official in the human resource development (now renamed education) ministry; and Mohammed Shabbir of Aligarh Muslim University’s law department. A UGC official has also been made the coordinating officer of the panel.The panel will not just submit its report to UGC on alleged financial and administrative irregularities and Hasnain’s response but also on whether the governance structure of the institute is in line with norms. It will also look into processes of appointments and whether top functionaries such as the chancellor and vice chancellor were appointed as per norms, according to the person cited above.Another area being looked into is whether the institute is maintaining its academic, administrative and financial records properly and whether all courses offered have got requisite approvals, according to a UGC order.Hasnain, when contacted, said that he was aware of the UGC move, but asserted that he followed all norms during his stint. He emphasised that he has had a long and distinguished career as an academic and held several top positions. He raised questions regarding the decisions taken by Ahmed and added that he had apprised the UGC about them.HT tried to reach out to Ahmed through officials of the university but there was no response till the filing of this report. When asked whether the developments will have a bearing on Jamia Hamdard’s IoE tag — announced in September 2019 — a senior government official, who requested anonymity, said that the findings of the reports of the four-member committee were crucial in this regard. “The IoE programme does expect high standards of governance,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ugc-forms-panel-to-probe-irregularities-in-jamia-hamdard/story-PV1GUx2rP4GetkojRIBCnN.html

25-11-2020||India||Nivar to cross Tamil Nadu coast as ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ tonight||Cyclone Nivar, (pronounced Nivaar, meaning atmosphere), is likely to cross the coasts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Wednesday night as a “very severe cyclonic storm” with a wind speed of 120 to 130kmph gusting to 145 kmph.Nivar has already intensified into a severe cyclonic storm over the southwest Bay of Bengal and moved west-northwestwards with a speed of 6kmph in the past six hours and lay centred over southwest Bay of Bengal about 300km east-southeast of Cuddalore, about 310km east southeast of Puducherry and 370km south southeast of Chennai. It is very likely to intensify further into a very severe cyclonic storm during the next 12 hours.Nivar is then likely to move west-northwestwards for next 6 hours and northwestwards thereafter. It is very likely to cross Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts between Karaikal and Mamallapuram around Puducherry on Wednesday night as a very severe cyclonic storm, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in its 6am bulletin.Till Tuesday, IMD had said Nivar was likely to make landfall during the late evening hours but that has been upgraded to night in the Wednesday morning bulletin. Very heavy rainfall of 12 mm has been recorded in Chennai from 8.30 am on Tuesday to 5.30am of Wednesday.Also Read: At 401, Delhi’s air quality slips into severe categoryUntil Tuesday afternoon, the forecast was that Nivar would cross the Tamil Nadu coast as a severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 100 to 110kmph gusting to 120 kmph. But the cyclone intensified rapidly, according to independent scientists.Widespread rain with thunderstorm activity is very likely over coastal and north interior Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal during November 24 to 25, and over south coastal Andhra Pradesh, Rayalaseema during November 25 to 26, and southeast Telangana on November 26. Extremely heavy rainfall (over 20 cm) activity is likely over coastal and north interior Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (Pudukottai, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Karaikal, Nagapattinam, Cuddalore, Ariyalur and Perabalu districts during November 24 and Kadalur, Kallakurchi, Puducherry, Villupuram, Tiruvannamalai, Chengalpattu to Ariyalur, Perambalur and Karaikal districts during November 25) and over Nellore and Chittoor districts of Andhra Pradesh on November 25 and over Rayalseema and southeast Telangana on November 26.IMD scientists said that it was not possible to confirm the exact time and location of landfall until Wednesday afternoon when models will have a clearer picture.Gale wind speed reaching 75-85kmph gusting to 95kmph is prevailing over Southwest Bay of Bengal. It would further increase, becoming 110-120kmph gusting to 135kmph over the southwest Bay of Bengal from November 25 morning, increasing to 120-130kmph gusting to 145kmph during noon to night of November 25. Sea condition is high over Southwest Bay of Bengal and rough to very rough along and off Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, south Andhra Pradesh coasts and over Gulf of Mannar. It would gradually become very high (9 to 14 metres wave height) over the southwest Bay of Bengal from November 24 night and phenomenal (over 14 metres wave height) over the same area from noon to night of November 25.Tidal waves of about 1-1.5m height above the astronomical tide are very likely to inundate the low-lying areas of north coastal districts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry near the place of landfall according to the IMD bulletin. Total destruction of thatched houses, extensive damage to kutcha houses is likely, apart from bending or uprooting of communication lines, flooding of escape routes, disruption of railways, etc.There is red category warning for extremely heavy rain in coastal and north interior Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal on November 25 and for Rayalseema on November 26. “The cyclone has gradually intensified and wind speed has increased so the warnings have changed,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre on Tuesday evening.“In November 2017, cyclone Okchi intensified very rapidly from a moderate cyclone to a very severe cyclone in 24 hours resulting in the death of 844 people in India and Sri Lanka. The environmental conditions are similar for cyclone Nivar, with warmer waters and winds favouring rapid intensification to a very severe cyclone in 24 hours…” wrote Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune on his social media post. “The area from where the cyclone is passing is 1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than normal as per National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s real time data.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nivar-to-cross-tamil-nadu-coast-as-very-severe-cyclonic-storm-tonight/story-L6Bu8CNVRHVvdbdrzpcmWJ.html

The well-known Shia cleric is survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter. Chief minister Adityanath expressed grief over the death of Sadiq, a Uttar Pradesh government statement said. The maulana’s well-wishers said his death was a great loss to mankind. Some called him a messiah of the destitute while others termed him as an embodiment of ‘Ganga Jamuni’ tehzeeb (culture). “My father, who was suffering from pneumonia, breathed his last at around 10 pm on Tuesday,” said Kalbe Sibtain, his son. Kalbe Sadiq had been under treatment at the Era Medical College where he was admitted on November 17. Doctors said he was suffering from colorectal cancer with severe pneumonia and urinary tract infection.Nawab Jafar Mir Abdullah, a descendant of the royal family of Awadh, said, “Kalbe Sadiq was the most secular person of Lucknow.” Maulana Yasoob Abbas, general secretary of All India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB), said: “We haven’t seen any personality like him. Indeed he was a harbinger of change and he changed the life of many by facilitating their education through his trust. He would be missed a lot.” He also said that Sadiq was the first to organise a Shia-Sunni namaz in the history of Lucknow. S Mohammed Haider, mutwalli of Sibtainabad Imambara, called him a disciplinarian who would always adhere to timelines. Sadiq was born in Lucknow and was known for his lectures, mostly during Muharram. His father Kalbe Hussain was an Islamic scholar and orator and his brother Kalbe Abid was also an Islamic scholar. He was the uncle of Shia Scholar Kalbe Jawad. He received his early education from madrasa Sultan ul Madaris. He then moved to Aligarh Muslim University where he obtained a bachelor of arts degree. He later went on to pursue his master’s degree in Arabic literature from the same University. He then secured a doctoral degree from Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prominent-islamic-scholar-kalbe-sadiq-dies-at-83/story-vU3pBGsEu3kXbTVjBArEFL.html

25-11-2020||India||Ahmed Patel: Congress’ chief trouble shooter and master strategist is no more||Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel died in early hours of Wednesday due to multiple organ failures after having tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) last month, his son Faisal Patel announced in a tweet. He was 71. Popularly known as ‘Babu bhai’, ‘Ahmed Bhai’ and ‘AP’ in political circles, Patel had been the chief crisis manager, the key trouble shooter, the go-to man in emergency situations and a master strategist for the Congress for decades. Born on August 21, 1949, at Piraman village near Bharuch in Gujarat, the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, he represented the state eight times in Parliament – three times as a Lok Sabha member from Bharuch and five times as a Rajya Sabha member. ‘Lost an irreplaceable comrade, faithful colleague’: Congress president Sonia Gandhi condoles Ahmed Patel’s deathA Gandhi family loyalist, Patel was one of the most powerful leaders in the Congress and is said to have repeatedly turned down the offers to join the central government when the party was in power. Watch l Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel passes away, tributes pour in Having served as political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi from 2001 to 2017 when she handed over the reins of the organisation to her son Rahul Gandhi, Patel remained a vital link between the party high command and leaders and workers, and also between the party and the government besides the allies. Patel played an important role during the 10 years of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government but always maintained a low profile. ‘Pillar of Congress party’: Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra condole Ahmed Patel’s deathIt was an unwritten rule those days that the crew of news channels would switch off their cameras whenever Patel spoke to the media. Journalists would often look for hints from him to confirm their leads. It was due to his crisis management skills that the Congress-led government managed to win the trust vote in 2008 after the Left parties had withdrawn their support to the UPA over the Indo-US nuclear deal. In August 2018, the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi appointed Patel as the party treasurer, a post he had held from October 1996 to July 2000. His role in strengthening Congress will be remembered: PM Modi condoles Ahmed Patel’s deathThe appointment came at a time when the Congress was grappling with its worst financial crisis. Several Congress leaders had admitted to “severe funds crunch” during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The crisis, blamed on corporate houses moving away from the Congress, continued through subsequent elections. Patel had obviously been brought back as the treasurer to use his contacts with the industrialists to mobilise the resources for the party to fight the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. A member of the powerful Congress Working Committee (CWC) since April 1992, Patel also served as the parliamentary secretary to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1985-86. Apart from being Gujarat Congress president from January 1986 to October 1988, he was party general secretary twice from September 1985 to January 1986 and then from May 1992 to October 1996. Patel won his fifth term from Gujarat in 2017 after a nail-biting finish in the bitterly fought Rajya Sabha elections, which had become a prestige battle between the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Patel was known for settling internal dissensions in the party but his death came at a time when the Congress is battling crisis over the leadership issue. A group of 23 leaders wrote to the Congress president last month seeking complete overhaul of the party and a full-time leadership to stem the steady decline of the 135-year-old organisation. They renewed their call after the drubbing in Bihar assembly elections and by-polls in several states. With its chief trouble shooter gone, a battered Congress stares at tough times and a hard road ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmed-patel-congress-chief-trouble-shooter-and-master-strategist-is-no-more/story-bocAP6Glg1RdRthmewGffN.html
25-11-2020||India||Cyclone Nivar: Tamil Nadu govt pulling out all stops to ensure no repeat of 2015 floods||The Tamil Nadu government is pulling out all stops to ensure no repeat of the 2015 floods in the city,as they mounted a vigil on four reservoirs,anticipating a rapid rise in water levels in view of heavy rains forecast due to cyclone Nivar,likely to cross the state coast on Wednesday.The administration has taken necessary precautions to release the water in phases and avert flooding, as in 2015, in the event of upsurge in the storage levels, a senior Public Works Department (PWD) official said.The combined storage level in the reservoirs at Poondi, Cholavaram, Red Hills and Chembarambakkam stood at 64.15 per cent or 8.156 TMC ft against the full capacity of 12.713 TMC ft, which is slightly higher compared to the quantum two days ago. Chembarambakkam which has nearly 80 per cent water (21.22 feet against its full level capacity of 24 feet) has become a cause for concern for residents, reminding them of the 2015 deluge.“Even if rains were to lash the metro, owing to the approaching cyclone, causing the water to rise sharply, there should not be any threat,” a senior PWD official claimed. When the issue was taken up with Commissioner of Revenue Administration, K Phanindra Reddy, he said the inflow into Chembarambakkam lake would be around 6,500 cusecs only when there are heavy rains and this can be easily diverted to Adyar river, which has a capacity to carry 60,000 cusecs water.“People need not harbour fears about flooding,” he said.Further, necessary precautions have been taken to release the water in phases and not cause flooding,as in 2015, he told reporters here. Reddy said people would be intimated in advance about the release of water from Chembarambakkam lake, if the government decides to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nivar-tamil-nadu-govt-pulling-out-all-stops-to-ensure-no-repeat-of-2015-floods/story-1EnmPVmzn2az5EKX97iaGI.html
25-11-2020||India||Pak’s million mutinies, ghosts and Doval’s doctrine of ‘defensive offence’||For decades, India has been on the receiving end of Pakistan’s relentless export of terrorism, the commodity in which it has enjoyed both a comparative as well as a competitive advantage. Faced with Pakistan’s use of terrorism as an instrument of state policy, India struggled to devise an adequate response. After every big terror attack, there was a standard response in India: the government threatened to retaliate and talking heads on TV nudged government strategists to pay back Pakistan in the same coin. The standard response to this unsolicited advice was that India couldn’t stoop to Pakistan’s level. But many security experts have reasoned that the real reason was that India just never bothered to build the leverages, capacities and capabilities that would have allowed New Delhi to hit Pakistan where it hurt.Since 2014, however, things started to change, or so we are being told by the Pakistanis.For some time now, the Pakistanis have been trying to implicate India in problems that are really the result of blowback of their own flirtation with terrorism and using it as an instrument of the security and foreign policy of the state. There is, however, no solid evidence to back up Pakistan’s allegations against India, unless of course, someone is ready to subscribe to the pulp-fiction dossier, or if you will, shoddy ‘literature’, that Pakistan recently publicised with much fanfare.If the Pakistani ‘dossier’ were to be taken at its face value, it would seem that India has more than paid back to Pakistan. That Indian spooks have succeeded spectacularly in Pakistan by not only engineering the greatest intelligence coup of the century – turning Pakistan’s strategic assets into its deadliest enemies – but also boxed in Pakistan so hard by exploiting its fault-lines that it now fears its very survival.The accusations and ‘achievements’ being attributed to India, however, aren’t true.Also Watch l How Pakistan is hoodwinking FATF and the world on terror funding Because if these were, then Pakistan would certainly have a smoking gun that was more convincing than a ‘dummy dossier’ or a kidnapped former naval officer who has been presented as some kind of an Indian James Bond.Even so, the fact that the Pakistanis are petrified of India doing to them what they have been doing for decades to India is something that at least gives India a major psychological advantage over her arch enemy. At one level, it puts the Pakistanis on the defensive; at another level, it makes them chase ghosts and prevents them or distracts them from fixing the things that are actually responsible for the ‘million mutinies’ erupting in several parts of the country or are on the verge of exploding in Pakistan. As is their wont, Pakistan always looks for exogenous actors and factors to explain their problems.National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has been their favourite bugbear for some years.Pakistanis have latched on to a speech Doval had given at a university long before he was appointed NSA. In that speech, he had spoken about the need for India to craft a strategic response to Pakistani export of terrorism. After he was appointed NSA by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, Pakistan’s strategists presumed that the Doval doctrine of ‘defensive offence’ – “go and attack the place from where an offence is coming from” – had been operationalised.According to Pakistan, this doctrine is all about paying Pakistan back in the same coin. In other words, Pakistan’s security analysts believed that India would use terrorism to respond to Pakistan’s terrorism. In fact, Doval appears to have instilled such trepidation in the Pakistanis that from the moment he became NSA, some retired personnel of the Pakistani military cleared to appear on and write in Pakistani media have been trying to paint him as some kind of a one-man army who can disrupt, disorder and dismantle Pakistan.The Doval doctrine soon became part of Pakistan’s strategic folklore.By and by, the ‘doctrine’ has been elevated to the status of being an embodiment of the ‘5th generation’ war that every Pakistani military person loves to mouth incessantly that India is supposed to be waging on Pakistan.The reality is, however, nowhere close to what the Pakistanis imagine it to be.If at all there is a Doval doctrine, then it has manifested itself not in any covert action that Pakistan keeps accusing India of but in the overt action – the 2016 surgical strikes and 2019 Balakot airstrikes. While there is no denying that India’s posture and approach to tackling terrorism emanating from Pakistan has changed in style and substance since 2014, India continues to remain loath to using proxies or non-state actors against Pakistan.In other words, India doesn’t still subscribe to using terrorism as an instrument of state policy; rather India is now using state power as a legitimate instrument for the protection of the state and furthering its objectives. The Balakot air strike in 2019 and the surgical strike in 2016 are prime examples.This is very different from what Pakistan accuses India of.Pakistan has often raised the issue of alleged Indian sponsored terrorism with its interlocutors from other countries, only to be rebuffed. On any number of occasions, Americans at the most senior levels of successive administrations have refuted Pakistan’s allegations against India. And yet Pakistan continues to peddle the same old version in the hope that one day, perhaps, someone will buy their story.The fact, however, is that virtually every terror attack that Pakistan tries to place at India’s door has its roots and links inside Pakistan and is the result of the deep state’s affair with jihadism going horribly wrong. Other militant attacks – by Baloch or Sindhi freedom fighters, or even by disgruntled elements in Pakistan-occupied Gilgit Baltistan and the Pashtun areas in Pakistan – are also the outcome of the neo-colonial model followed by the Pakistan army against people who it calls its own.Take for example the heavy-handed treatment meted out to the entirely peaceful Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) which is fighting for constitutionalism but is accused of being a catspaw of India. That the struggle for constitutionalism is seen as treason is something that can only happen in a Praetorian state like Pakistan. Ditto for the jailed civil rights activists in Gilgit Baltistan.If peaceful, political and civil society movements are going to be crushed by the Pakistan military and the ‘deep state’, and the disaffected people pick up the gun, how is it India’s doing?The sudden spate of accusations being hurled against India is essentially nothing more than the perpetrator playing the victim even as it ratchets up violence in Jammu and Kashmir.On its part, Pakistan doesn’t even admit to the involvement of its terrorists and spy agency ISI to the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks though security agencies worldwide concur on Pakistan’s role in the terror attacks. In the “most wanted” list released earlier this month, Pakistan was careful to skip the names of the mastermind and key conspirators of the Mumbai terror attacks. The Federal Investigation Agency did name 20-odd people accused of a role in the attacks but these were mostly members of the crew of two boats used by the attackers to travel to Mumbai and those who helped finance the attacks through money transfers.But Pakistan’s denials don’t mean its hands are clean.As far as India is concerned, the ‘D’ doctrine isn’t so much the Doval Doctrine as it is the Deterrence doctrine. But if the Pakistanis prefer to name it after the Indian NSA, there is no reason for India to deny them their dread of Doval. Quite to the contrary, India needs to press ahead filling Pakistan’s deep state with fear about India’s response and let Pakistan chase ghosts and shadows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-s-million-mutinies-ghosts-and-doval-s-doctrine-of-defensive-offence/story-PWGAPIeG3xu21s7z7D4NaN.html

25-11-2020||India||Nagrota terrorists’ gadgets prove Pak hand in earlier infiltration bid||Communication devices recovered from four killed Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists at Ban toll plaza on November 19 have provided a vital key to establish that Pakistan was also behind a similar infiltration by the same proscribed group on January 31.Pakistan-based terrorist groups have become especially active after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and have been preparing for a major drive in Jammu and Kashmir, according to intelligence reports. The reports add that terrorist group Lashar-e-Tayyeba (LeT) is mobilizing cadre from its Chelabandi camp in Muzaffarabad to fresh locations in Neelum Valley across the Line of Control (LoC) between India and Pakistan. The Hizbul Mujahideen is training nearly 400 cadre at a newly constructed facility in forest area of Oghi in Khyber-Paktunkhwa (KPK). The Al Badr group is exploring ways to infiltrate into India from Bangladesh after security forces have turned the heat on infiltration across LoC in Kashmir.Also Read | India briefs select group of envoys on attempted attack in Nagrota by JeMBut interestingly, the reports say that Jaish operational commander Mufti Rauf Asghar has told his cadre after the November 19 Nagrota encounter that it is becoming difficult to supply “items” to them in Kashmir. On January 31, Indian security forces gunned down three Jaish terrorists near the same toll plaza and arrested three overground workers after an early morning encounter. Among those arrested was the driver of the truck Sameer Ahmed Dar, first cousin of Adil Dar, the suicide bomber who rammed his explosive laden Maruti Eeco car into a CRPF bus at Pulwama on February 14, 2019, killing all the 40 CRPF personnel on board.Investigations into November 19 Nagrota encounter have revealed similarities beyond communication devices and firmly established that the Pakistani deep state uses Jaish to infiltrate into India from terror camps at Shakargarh across the Samba border, intelligence officials said. What has shocked the Indian investigators is the engineering detail that went into construction of the tunnel used by the Nagrota attackers to reach the pick-up point at Jatwal, 12 km from the international border. The tunnel, obviously constructed with the help of Pakistani Rangers, is 200 metres long with enough space for terrorists to walk upright and cross the border. The tunnel is 40 metres long on the Pakistani side. “The Shakargarh Jaish camp is a place where Jaish jihadists trained as far away as Peshawar and Bhawalpur assemble to launch into India for terror attacks. The Shakargarh bulge is on the sensitive chicken neck area of India and vital to national security,” said a senior counter terrorism official who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nagrota-terrorists-gadgets-prove-pak-hand-in-earlier-infiltration-bid/story-HHSlbDZV4H20eluVojZooO.html

The national working group of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said the move highlighted the “repression unleashed by the BJP government in Haryana”, and alleged that 31 farm leaders have been arrested, so far.Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, said: “Legitimate demands of farmers cannot be suppressed. Arresting leaders from their homes at night cannot be justified and the government should release the arrested leaders at the earliest.”Meanwhile, the Centre has invited representatives of over 30 protesting farmers’ organisations from Punjab for talks on December 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-govt-to-seal-borders-with-punjab-ahead-of-farmers-stir/story-zxmavRlac2DDwFPbQ1EPaP.html

25-11-2020||India||States share plan on Covid-19 vaccine distribution||States informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday that they are getting ready for the distribution of Covid-19 vaccine with a proper cold chain infrastructure while some of them said that they have started the process of the identification of front line health workers, who will get the shot first. Ensuring that the vaccine against the coronavirus disease reaches everyone in the country dominated the discussion during Modi’s review meeting with chief ministers on Tuesday. At the meeting, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan told states that the Centre was looking at providing vaccination to front line health workers in the first stage, police personnel and sanitation workers in the second stage, those above 50 years of age in the third, and those with comorbidity in the fourth stage. He asked states to provide database of people in these four categories to create a vaccination road map. After the meeting, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai confirmed this and said that the Centre has asked each state to set up a committee under the chairmanship of the CM, which would prepare a road map to provide vaccines in every district and village. “Vaccine delivery will be linked to a digital id,” he said. Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa told reporters at the Mysuru airport that the PM asked them to make preparations for vaccination. “He also said to be on the alert to ensure Covid doesn’t spread.” Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath informed the PM that his government was engaged in creating a robust cold chain maintenance infrastructure. He also said that considering the vast population of the state, the government will have Covid vaccinators, and that the state health department will train them. On Monday, he directed bureaucrats to put in place all arrangements for a cold chain infrastructure by December 15.Also Read | Kejriwal asks Modi to reserve 1,000 ICU beds in central hospitalsRajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that his state was doing 100% testing by the gold standard RT-PCR, that testing has increased from 18,000 samples per day to over 30,000, and that hospital infrastructure has been strengthened with the increase in intensive care unit (ICU) beds. He informed that the state was ready with the database of health workers to be administered the Covid vaccine.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray informed the PM that a task force had been set up for vaccination. “We have been in touch with Adar Poonawala of Serum Institute, which is producing the shot for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. However, there needs to be clarity about the vaccination programme in terms of availability, quantum, side effects, cost and the distribution of the vaccine. Our task force will deliberate on all these aspects in the state,” he said. Tamil Nadu chief minister Edapaddi K Palaniswami said that the state set up three committees to ensure smooth implementation of vaccination, and that a digital database of Covid front line workers was also being prepared. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said that his government would submit a detailed plan to the Centre on cold chain management and vaccination schedule. Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat sought priority vaccination during the upcoming Haridwar Mahakhumbh.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said that West Bengal was fully prepared for a Covid-19 vaccination programme and asserted that her state tackled the pandemic situation well, even as she urged the PM to release Goods and Services Tax (GST) dues immediately.She rued that the Union government was yet to release adequate funds required to fight the pandemic. “The dues on account of GST compensation stand at Rs 8500 crore. The state has spent around Rs 4000 crore for Covid-19 management. But till date the centre has released only Rs 193 crore,” she added. “West Bengal is fully prepared with trained man power and required infrastructure, including cold chains for the vaccination programme. We are ready to work with the Centre and other stake holders to ensure speedy vaccination drive for every one as soon as the vaccine is available,” Banerjee said, according to a statement released by the state government.

25-11-2020||India||HTLS 2020: The Covid-19 pandemic and the shift in domestic politics||Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, a considerable commentary has ensued on its impact on geopolitics, on economics and the role of technology. But these impacts are intertwined with how nations and societies are coping with the pandemic. It will soon be a year since the pandemic erupted. The record of countries and different political systems in dealing with its aftermath is now reasonably clear. We can make certain broad assessments on how the pandemic is changing and will change politics in countries around the world, and the Indian case is of special interest.All across the world, the pandemic has significantly enhanced the power of the state vis-a-vis its citizens. Big government is back with a vengeance and this is unlikely to change even as the pandemic recedes. More state intervention will be required, for instance, in the distribution of vaccines. The phase of economic recovery, too, will demand greater state intervention and this is apparent already in economic stimulus packages unveiled in many states including India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pledge of “minimum government and maximum governance” has had a short shelf life. But while expanding government is a reality, governance is still far from “maximum”. The record in this respect remains patchy.The pandemic has altered the relationship between the Centre and states and other constituent units, greatly enhancing the authority of the Centre at the expense of the latter even in federal dispensations. In India, the pandemic enabled the central government to take several steps beyond its strictly constitutional limits. The crisis nature of the pandemic muted resistance even from states ruled by non-BJP parties. The huge impact on revenue streams available to states and the reluctance of the Centre to deliver on its commitments to make up for losses incurred in GST collections have altered the power balance between the Centre and the states, greatly increasing the latter’s dependence on the Centre for sustaining financial viability. The Union government has utilised its enhanced authority to push through some major reforms in agriculture, education and health, which are normally state subjects and encountered only limited and sporadic opposition. Post-pandemic India will likely remain a more unitary state in practice irrespective of constitutional proprieties. But this also sows the seeds of future Centre-state tensions and incipient “fissiparous tendencies”, a term that one used to hear in the early days of our republic.There has been a weakening of democratic polities across the world even before the pandemic, driven by rising inequalities, technological change and the spread of nationalist and populist sentiments. Globalisation led to a significant rise in wealth and incomes across the world, but in the absence of appropriate public policies to ensure equitable distribution created a small band of winners and a much larger number of those left behind. This undermined popular stake in democracy and left the door open for populist leaders to preach de-globalisation and populist policies. The success of authoritarian dispensations, in particular China, to deliver rapid growth and higher standards of living, posited another model for socio-economic development. The ability of China to stamp out the pandemic and ensure early economic recovery has further boosted the authoritarian brand. This weakening of democracy as we have known it, the preference for strong and decisive authoritarian leadership figures, despite their failings, is likely to linger. Liberal democracy has lost its brand value with Donald Trump in the US damaging it perhaps irrevocably. Joe Biden will have a tough time restoring its sheen. There is pessimism about democracy and more so in democratic countries. In India, too, there is impatience with the more measured and relatively gentle ways of a constitutional democracy and consensus politics. There is greater acceptance of coercive politics as a means of overcoming resistance to change. But I believe that India’s immense diversity and ingrained individuality of spirit will ultimately frustrate the politics of centralisation and enforced uniformity. This is a country which cannot be governed through a monochromatic frame.The peculiar nature of the pandemic which puts a premium on social distancing and remote work has greatly accelerated the adoption of digital technologies. This is impacting the way in which economies of the future will be structured and change the ways of living and working but in what manner and to what degree remains uncertain and unpredictable. This will change politics as well. It is clear that states are already adopting these new technologies for more intrusive surveillance of their citizens’ lives while resisting scrutiny of their own conduct. But theoretically, I see the same technologies giving citizens the tools for compelling transparency and accountability in state action, though this may happen with a time lag or perhaps never at all. The state will resist this and citation of national security has already become a convenient argument to stay opaque. In India, too, security trumps almost every attempt at scrutiny of state action and ensuring democratic accountability.Enhanced state authority can create a caring state, which is more responsive to the interests of its citizens. It can deploy its augmented powers to undertake long pending economic and social reforms, treating crisis as an opportunity. Perhaps, we will succeed in creating a more congenial setting for sustainable democracy eventually. One must remain hopeful.

A team of NDRF comprises of about 40 personnel.The NCMC was also informed that about 15 districts of the three states are expected to hit by the cyclone and several thousand people living along the coastline have been shifted to shelter houses, the spokesperson said. The cabinet secretary assured the chief secretaries all necessary assistance, and Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla conveyed that the required financial assistance from the National Disaster Relief Fund will be released on Wednesday. The cabinet secretary also asked everyone to circulate the Do’s and Don’ts to the people living along the coastal areas asking them to stay calm, ignore rumours, keep mobile phones charged, listen to radio, not to enter damaged buildings, leave home for safer places if current house is not secured and switch off the main power connection, among others. The meeting was informed about the coordination between the NDRF and other agencies to meet this challenge.

25-11-2020||India||Covid vaccine must meet all scientific criteria, says PM Narendra Modi||With three manufacturers claiming success in mass testing of their vaccine candidates, raising hope that the world is closer to finding protection against Covid-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday that his government’s priority would be to ensure a vaccine reaches everyone after it meets scientific criteria. Modi told state chief ministers in an interaction by video link to be cautious of rumours about the vaccines and said he can’t help it if people do politics over it. Modi described the people’s reaction to the pandemic-- from absolute fear to a false notion of security -- and emphasized the need for more Reverse Transcriptase -Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, better monitoring of Covid-19 patients, especially those in home isolation, better-equipped health centres in rural areas and continuing awareness campaigns. Modi also asked chief ministers to set up cold storages and other infrastructure for a smooth roll-out of the vaccine when one becomes available, assuring them that the states would be taken on board in the vaccine delivery drive, just as the Centre and the states are fighting the pandemic together. The Prime Minister said the Centre was closely following the developments of vaccines and in contact with both domestic and foreign manufacturers.“The media might be abuzz with reports on vaccines. But we have to ensure that the vaccine for citizens meets all necessary scientific criteria. Just as the focus in the fight against COVID has been on saving each and every life, the priority will be to ensure that the vaccine reaches everyone,” Modi said.Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and Oxford-AstraZeneca Plc.-- have declared the findings of their Phase 3 trials this month, claiming that their vaccine candidates had shown a high degree of efficacy. The VK Paul-led expert panel on vaccines is closely monitoring developments and awaiting regulatory clearance for emergency use of these vaccines.Talking to chief ministers, Modi said governments at all levels “will have to work together to ensure that the vaccination drive is smooth, systematic and sustained”, adding that the priority list of recipients was being decided in consultation with the states. At the same time, Modi also emphasized the need for ongoing measures such as social distancing and wearing of masks, expansion of the testing and treatment network, and the need to create more oxygen plants. He said the PM CARES Fund that had earlier funded procurement of ventilators would be used to make available more oxygen supplies.Even as the PM maintained that India was better-placed than most other countries, he stressed the importance of understanding public behaviour. “The first stage of people’s response to Covid was of fear, when people reacted in panic. The second stage saw cropping up of doubts about the virus, when several people tried to hide that they had been afflicted by it. The third stage was of acceptance, when people became more serious about the virus and displayed greater alertness. In the fourth stage, with an increasing recovery rate, people have developed a false notion of security from the virus, thus leading to rise in instances of negligence,” he said.Union home minister Amit Shah asked the states to ensure that the mortality rate goes below 1% and also control the surge of new cases. He told CMs that containment zones should be dynamic. Shah said the periphery of a containment zone must change from time to time depending on the prevalence of cases.  Modi said some people were doing politics on the coronavirus vaccine and nothing could stop them, according to a person present in the meeting who requested anonymity. “It was just a passing remark as the general mood of the meeting was cooperation and not confrontation,” the person added. The remarks were widely interpreted as an indirect reference to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s tweet on Monday in which he posed a series of questions to the Prime Minister on the Covid-19 vaccine. Gandhi asked: “The PM must tell the nation: 1. Of all the Covid vaccine candidates, which will GOI (Government of India) choose & why? 2. Who will get the vaccine first & what will be the distribution strategy? 3. Will PMCares fund be used to ensure free vaccination? 4. By when will all Indians be vaccinated?”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-must-meet-all-scientific-criteria-says-pm-narendra-modi/story-jxvO95EAg2Slco51vro8KK.html
25-11-2020||India||PM criticizes those ‘doing politics over the corona vaccine’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday during his interaction with chief ministers that some people were engaging in politics on the coronavirus vaccine, people familiar with the development said. A person present in the meeting quoted Modi as having said that some people were doing politics over the corona vaccine and nothing could stop them. “It was just a passing remark as the general mood of the meeting was cooperation and not confrontation,” the person added. But the remarks were widely interpreted as an indirect reference to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s tweet on Monday in which he posed a series of questions to the Prime Minister on the preparedness of distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine as and when it becomes available in India. Gandhi asked: “The PM must tell the nation: 1. Of all the Covid vaccine candidates, which will GOI (Government of India) choose & why? 2. Who will get the vaccine first & what will be the distribution strategy? 3. Will PMCares fund be used to ensure free vaccination? 4. By when will all Indians be vaccinated?” . Gandhi’s questions came ahead of the Prime Minister’s virtual meeting with chief ministers of states where the Covid-19 pandemic situation has deteriorated in the past several weeks. Among those who attended the review meeting were the chief ministers of Delhi (Arvind Kejriwal), Haryana (Manohar Lal Khattar) Rajasthan (Ashok Gehlot), West Bengal (Mamata Banerjee), Maharashtra (Uddhav Thackeray), Chhattisgarh (Bhupesh Baghel) and Gujarat (Vijay Rupani). Home minister Amit Shah and union health minister Harsh Vardhan were also present. The modalities of Covid-19 vaccine delivery, distribution and administration were also discussed during the meeting. The coronavirus vaccine became the talking point in the Bihar elections after the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in its manifesto promised free distribution of vaccine against the Covid-19 once approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research. The announcement triggered strong reactions from the Congress and other rival parties, which accused the BJP of playing politics over the Covid-19 pandemic and insisted that the vaccine belonged to all Indians and not to the ruling party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-criticizes-those-doing-politics-over-the-corona-vaccine/story-daZ8HxvG4ff0GSaWULEsCN.html
25-11-2020||India||India successfully test-fires land-attack version of BrahMos supersonic cruise missile||India on Tuesday “successfully” test fired the surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile BrahMos as part of a series of planned trials of the weapon, known for its precision strike capabilities, official sources said.The range of the new land-attack version of the missile has been extended to 400 km from the original 290 km but its speed has been maintained at 2.8 Mach or almost three times the speed of sound, they said.“The land-attack version of the missile was test-fired in the Andaman and Nicobar at around 10 am and it was a successful trial”, an official source said.According to official sources, in the next few days, the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy are scheduled to carry out separate test-firing of the new version of the air-launched and naval versions of the supersonic cruise missile respectively.BrahMos Aerospace, an India-Russian joint venture, produces the lethal weapon that can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or from land platforms.India has already deployed a sizeable number of the original BrahMos missiles and other key assets in several strategic locations along the Line of Actual Control with China in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.In the last two-and-half months, India has test fired a number of missiles including an anti-radiation missile named Rudram-1 which is planned to be inducted into service by 2022.On October 18, a naval version of the BrahMos missile was successfully test fired from an indigenously-built stealth destroyer of the Indian Navy in the Arabian sea.The Indian Air Force on October 30 test-fired the air launched version of the weapon from a Sukhoi fighter aircraft in the Bay of Bengal.The BrahMos missile provides the IAF a much-desired capability to strike from large stand-off ranges on any target at sea or on land with pinpoint accuracy by day or night and in all weather conditions.The IAF is also integrating the Brahmos supersonic cruise missile on over 40 Sukhoi fighter jets which is aimed at bolstering overall combat capability of the force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-successfully-test-fires-land-attack-version-of-brahmos-supersonic-cruise-missile/story-1GEEVGhNRI9QjJ3N8TUUuJ.html
25-11-2020||India||Abdullahs named in J&K land encroachment list||The Jammu & Kashmir administration on Tuesday made public a voluminous list of beneficiaries of a two-decade-old law under which they allegedly gained proprietary rights to land they had illegally occupied, as well as encroachers on vast swathes of state land, naming former chief minister and Lok Sabha member Farooq Abdullah among the latter.A total of 1787 beneficiaries including nine encroachers of state land from Jammu district alone have so far been put up on the government website http://divcomjammu.gov.in/# in line with a high court directive , showing Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah as having encroached on seven kanals and seven marlas of state land (once forest land), in Bahu tehsil, village Sunjwan, in Jammu city. The names of people, including other politicians, businessmen and civil servants figured on the lists. They included former People’s Democratic Party (PDP) minister Haseeb Drabu and family, prominent hotelier Mushtaq Chaya, former bureaucrat Mohammad Shafi Pandit and his wife Nighat Pandit, and former legislator Satpal Lakhotra. Abdullah, 83, hit back with allegations of political vendetta ahead of elections to district development councils in Jammu & Kashmir. In a clear reference to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre, the National Conference (NC) chief said: “Since elections are around the corner, I think they will dig the graves of others.” “Kamal hai in logon ka (The wonder of these people). They want us to give in, but why should we?. Don’t people in Sunjwan have a right to live . Isn’t the army brigade in Sunjwan on forest land?. It is nothing but purely political vendetta,” he said. Abdullah said he had not purchased either the land in Jammu or house in Srinagar under the Jammu & Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants), popularly known as the Roshni Act, which the high court has ruled was unconstitutional and unsustainable.He said: “It is only propaganda against us. I just can’t understand what they want to do? Sunjwan colony was not raised by me.. it was raised long back. Don’t we have the right to live?”Abdullah did concede that NC’s party headquarters in Raipur village in Jammu south, measuring three kanals and 16 marlas, had been regularised under the Roshni Act at a price of Rs 53,66,501. “We purchased the land under Roshni scheme and we didn’t get any concession like others announced after us. No favours were done to us,” he said.In New Delhi, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad lashed out at political leaders including Abdullah.“There was conscious land loot by powerful people of J&K who were getting benefits under the Roshni Act, which was declared unconstitutional by the J&K high court,” Prasad told reporters. “It is very unfortunate that key leaders of Jammu & Kashmir including Farooq Abdullah used their influence and power for land grabbing and appropriated government land.”The law, popularly referred to as Roshni Act, was passed in 2001 to provide ownership of state land to people who were occupying it after the law was introduced in the budget speech of the previous year by then finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather of the NC. The proceeds of the sales were meant to help in the electrification of the state. In 2005, the PDP government-led by Mufti Mohammed Syed relaxed the cut-off year for the occupants to have the land regularised to 2004. T he Congress government led by Ghulam Nabi Azad in 2007 relaxed the cut-off year to 2007. The original cut-off year had been 1990.A 2014 Comptroller and Auditor General report found that only ₹76 crore had been realised from the transfer of encroached lands between 2007 and 2013 against the ₹25,000 crore target. In November 2018, then governor Satya Pal Malik cancelled the Act, saying people in positions of power and those with financial resources including bureaucrats, government officials, ministers, legislators, police personnel and businesspersons have “influenced the completely illegal vesting of state land”.A senior official in the Jammu and Kashmir administration said on condition of anonymity:”The working of the Roshni Act was effected arbitrarily, dishonestly and illegally. There exist glaring instances of state lands being usurped.”The Central Bureau of Investigation registered cases after the high court last month ordered the federal agency to probe the allocation of land under the law it ruled was unconstitutional and unsustainable. The court also sought a list of beneficiaries. Revenue department officials have been cancelling mutation orders under the Act in line with a high court order. “Consequently, a list of 15,000 beneficiaries is being uploaded on the official and the National Informatics Centre website after due step-by-step vetting,” said an official in the Jammu and Kashmir administration. Drabu, a former finance minister, rubbished the allegation of wrongdoing, saying his grandfather had bought the land in question in 1956 in the name of his mother, who divided it among her children after extending its lease. “...the land was regularised purely as per the government’s Roshni Act. Where is the scam and what rubbish is this?” asked Drabu, adding that the government should at least make a distinction between a leaseholder and a land grabber. Former director general of police SP Vaid defended the government’s action, noting it was in line with the high court order. “Some irregularities must have been committed and that’s why LG’s {lieutenant-general’s) government is implementing the high court order. It is perfectly a legal process and it should be taken to its logical conclusion,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/abdullahs-named-in-j-k-land-encroachment-list/story-xaCjdUTZhaHqFfp0XKKMSJ.html
25-11-2020||India||Delhi air quality may hit severe zone again||The stubble burning season is almost over, and Diwali has come and gone, but Delhi’s air quality took a sharp turn for the worse on Tuesday, highlighting the role played by weather and local sources of pollution that ensure the Capital’s air remains unhealthy through large parts of the year, with farm fires, especially from Punjab, and fireworks during Diwali, causing temporary spikes. The city’s air quality index (AQI) on Tuesday settled at 379, in “very poor” zone, according to the 24-hour rolling average of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings at 4pm. On Monday, the AQI was in the same range but with a lower reading of 302. Government agencies forecast that the air quality could enter “severe” zone on Wednesday. While an AQI of 201-300 is considered “poor”, a reading of 301-400 is in “very poor” zone, and associated with respiratory illnesses, especially in children and those exposed to the bad air. An AQI of 400-500 is considered “severe”, posing serious health risks. Government data on farm fires and experts indicated that the current deterioration in Delhi’s air was largely due to weather conditions adverse to the dispersal of pollutants, and local pollution sources (such as road dust and construction dust, vehicular emissions and local garbage burning), reaffirming the argument that the root of the city’s annual ordeal goes beyond firecracker bursting on Diwali and the burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states — two of the factors widely cited behind grim AQI readings in October-November. To be sure, the fires tip it over the edge into hazardous territory.CPCB data showed that Delhi’s AQI has been on a decline over the past week. It was 274 on Sunday, 251 on Saturday, 296 on Friday, 283 on Thursday, and 211 on Wednesday. VK Soni, head of the environment monitoring research centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), said that the fresh drop in air quality was mainly due to low wind speed (not conducive for the dispersal of pollutants) and high moisture content (conducive for the accumulation of pollutants).“A western disturbance affecting the Western Himalayan region (from Monday) has had its impact on Delhi as well. Winds were easterly till (Tuesday) afternoon; they carried moisture. So increase in air pollution levels is due to local factors and a reduction in wind speed. The air quality may touch severe levels tomorrow (Wednesday). However, we expect an improvement from November 26, when the wind speed is likely to pick up after the passing of the western disturbance,” Soni said. Radha Goyal, deputy director of the Indian Pollution Control Association (a non-governmental organisation), said that while stubble burning is indeed a contributor to Delhi’s pollution level, the city’s local sources cannot be ignored and need proper attention. “The main local sources of air pollution in Delhi during winters are vehicular emissions, construction activities and waste burning. In this critical period, when weather is not favourable, we have to strictly enforce measures to control these local sources so that Delhi’s local sources are controlled,” Goyal said.From November 5 -10, the Capital saw a spell of “severe” air days for six consecutive days. But the dispersal of pollution after Diwali was the fastest this year, compared to the last five years. The AQI went from “severe” to moderate within two days because of high wind speeds and rain in many parts of the city.According to CPCB data, 189 farm fires were reported on Monday and they contributed to 5% of Delhi’s pollution. This share was around 32% during the six-day spell of “severe” air earlier this month. Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said that the burning of paddy stubble has ended in Punjab. “On most of the agriculture area in the state, wheat crop of the rabi season has been sown,” he said.Krunesh Garg, member-secretary of the Punjab pollution control board, said only a “negligible number” of farm fires were being reported nowadays.“ Total fire cases (in the state) touching 76,000 is a cause of concern for us because it’s substantially more than last season’s (57,000) number. I want to highlight that number of cases when verified on ground were much less against that reported by the satellite,” he said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy) of think-tank Centre for Science and Environment, said that while Delhi, to some extent, has been successful in bending this season’s pollution curve, the levels are still around “60% higher” than the acceptable limits. “There is no doubt that Delhi cannot solve its pollution problem alone because it shares a common airshed with states such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh etc., where pollution sources are unchecked compared to the Capital. But that being said, enforcement needs to improve a lot more. The enforcement agencies know exactly what they need to do when the air quality reaches a certain level; it is listed clearly under Grap (Graded Response Action Plan). All they need to do is ensure that the measures are enforced strictly,” Roychowdhury said.In a significant move, the Union environment ministry brought in the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas through an ordinance on October 29. Its objective is to implement a consolidated approach to monitoring, tackling and eliminating causes of air pollution in Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas. While doing so the Centre dissolved all ad-hoc committees and bodies created under court orders, including the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), which had been tasked with overseeing air pollution control in NCR since 1998.M Kutty, chairperson of the new panel, and Arvind Nautiyal, joint secretary, environment ministry, and a full-time member of the commission, did not respond to answer HT’s calls on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adverse-weather-conditions-and-local-sources-of-pollution-push-delhi-further-into-very-poor-zone/story-tFI7SBbHq5GpyI7iB8cWCK.html
25-11-2020||India||In-laws burn Hyderabad techie over ‘black magic’ suspicion||A 38-year old software engineer who travelled from Hyderabad to Balwanthapur, around 180 km from the Telangana capital, to call on the widow of his wife’s recently deceased brother was tied to a chair and burnt to death — presumably on the suspicion that he had used black magic to kill the brother. The police believe that more than one person may have been responsible for the killing, and the needle of suspicion is on the brother’s family and relatives. The incident happened at a house within the premises of Manjunatha temple located on the outskirts of Balwanthapur village in Malyala block. The deceased was identified as Pagilla Pavan Kumar, a resident of Alwal on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Kumar was employed with a software company based in Bengaluru but had been staying in his hometown Hyderabad for some time now.According to the police, Kumar, along with wife Krishnaveni, came to Balwanthapur to call on the family of his brother-in-law Jagan (38) who died of heart attack 12 days ago. The couple paid floral tributes to the portrait of Jagan and consoled his wife Sumalatha. “At around 7.30 pm, we received a call from the local people that a person was in flames in a room locked from outside and was screaming for help. We rushed to the spot and broke open the door of the room. We found Kumar tied to a chair and completely burnt. He died instantaneously,” Mallyal sub-inspector of police Nagaraju told Hindustan Times. Krishnaveni complained to the police that Sumalatha sent her to fetch a bottle of water. “By the time I returned, my husband was locked up inside the room and was screaming while being burnt alive.” Nagaraju said it was a clear case of murder, as Kumar was tied to a chair, doused with petrol and burnt to death. “Moreover, the room was locked from outside. So, we booked a case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and are investigating.”  “We are questioning all the suspects and will crack the case soon,” he added. No arrests had been made till Tuesday evening. Krishnaveni told the police that there were some differences between her brother and husband and that Sumalatha suspected that Kumar might have performed black magic, resulting in Jagan’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-laws-burn-hyderabad-techie-over-black-magic-suspicion/story-TZCmlLgEp4KS0ckO3ed6PK.html
25-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||There is now a growing consensus that India is seeing the emergence of a second wave of Covid-19, something that Dispatch 206 on November 18 first pointed out.The numbers pretty much speak for themselves. Seven of the 11 states that accounted for 76% of cases (on the basis of a trailing seven-day average as on November 23), have seen a resurgence of cases over the past month-and-half (since October 15). I have excluded Bihar and Uttar Pradesh from the analysis because of their continued insistence on using rapid antigen tests (RATs), which are unreliable.The three states that have actually seen a decline in this period are Maharashtra, which, with 1.78 million cases and 46,653 deaths to date, has been ravaged by the virus; Kerala; and Tamil Nadu. Among them, Kerala is now the second-highest contributor to the country’s daily total, after Delhi.The others have seen an increase either from lows seen over the past month-and-a-half, or even above levels seen on October 15. For instance, Delhi’s seven-day average of cases on October 15 was 2,885. The corresponding number on November 23 was 6,445. Other states that have seen an increase from their October 15 seven-day averages are: Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan.Chhattisgarh’s daily case numbers dipped in early November but have risen again, although they are still lower than the October 15 average. So have Madhya Pradesh’s. And West Bengal’s seven-day average of cases has remained pretty much the same. It was 3,627 on October 15, rose to the 4,000s in late October, but is now back at 3,622.India’s overall seven-day average of daily cases has also inched up from the 39,000-levels seen last week, and was 43,379 on Monday. That’s still lower than the 66,396 it was on October 15. Still, with winter setting in north and north-west India, and threatening to be more severe this year than it has been in recent years, there’s growing concern about the rising numbers.Worryingly, the seven-day average of daily deaths has also increased — from a low of 491 on November 17 to 525 on Monday. Much of this, though, is propelled by a surge of deaths in Delhi — from a seven-day average of 39 on October 15 to 114 on November 23. Together, these 11 states accounted for 76.3% of daily deaths (seven-day average) on Monday.The really good news at the national level is that the overall positivity rate (seven-day average) is still below 5%. It was 3.95% on November 23, though this number is skewed by the low positivity rates of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh that conduct a lot of tests, all rapid antigen ones. Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan ended November 23 with a higher average positivity rate than they had on October 15.Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have seen their average positivity rates rise from lows seen over the past month-and-a-half. West Bengal’s still remains high (and has stayed almost constant) at 8.22% (it was 8.59% on October 15). And Maharashtra’s is still over 5%, at 6.75%, although this is half the 13.80% seen on October 15. Kerala’s positivity rate, too, has fallen from the 15.9% it was on October 15, but at 9.92%, it is still high.Based only on their average positivity rates, it is clear that Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and West Bengal are not testing enough. Nor, despite the increase in testing in recent days, is Delhi. While four vaccines have now shown efficacy in protecting people from the viral infection, none has been approved yet. The most optimistic assessment of experts is that frontline health workers in India may be vaccinated in early 2021.To manage the second wave, then, states will have to test more (and use the right test), trace diligently, and isolate effectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-9ORLxLpnTdpdLlZZO6OPwN.html

India is following the race for vaccines closely, the PM said, according to a government statement, adding: “If speed is important, than safety is equally important. What we develop will be scientifically validated.”Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHe also said that for vaccine distribution, the Centre is working with states, which will “ultimately be in a better position to say what is required on ground” and assured them that a detailed plan will be shared soon. “PM made it clear that in the first stage, the vaccine will be given to the frontline health workers, in the second stage to the police personnel, sanitation workers etc; to those above 50 years of age in third stage; and to those with co-morbid conditions in the fourth stage,” Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani quoted the PM as saying, according to ANI. The statement was confirmed by Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope.The state minister, citing discussions during the meeting, also quoted the CM as saying that the key frontline and essential workers as part of the first phase could come up to about 300 million people. “He (PM) said the vaccine may come in the next 4-5 weeks. He also said to be on alert to ensure Covid doesn’t spread,” Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa told reporters at Mysuru airport following a second meeting that involved a larger group of chief ministers from across the country. Also Read | Who said what at PM Modi’s review meet on Covid-19 situationModi’s remarks, his first in detail on the vaccine distribution plan, comes a day after University of Oxford and British pharma firm AstraZeneca announced their vaccine candidate had shown up to 90% efficacy in late-stage trials. This inoculation is largely believed to be the first one that is likely to be approved and distributed in India, since Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) is among manufacturing partners and has committed to reserving half of the doses it produces for the country. It is also cheaper than the main rivals that have shown efficacy and easier to store and transport.According to a government statement, Modi assured the CMs that the government’s focus will be to get the vaccine to everyone. “It’s a sort of national commitment from the government towards Indian citizens. Two indigenous vaccines are in advance stages of trials, and there also are others being tested in India that have been developed globally but the manufactures have tied with local partners,” he told the chief ministers.The PM also added a word of caution. “We have to also look into the possibility of dealing with side-effects related to the vaccine; as people tend to develop a reaction to even medicines that are in use for a very long time. Even after 20 years or so there are side-effects seen of certain medicines, which may be also possible with the Covid-19 vaccines,” he said. Modi asked chief ministers to prepare cold storage and other infrastructure for vaccine logistics, assuring them that states would be taken on board for the vaccine drive, “just as the Centre and the states are fighting Covid together,” according to an official who was aware of the discussions. The Centre has written to states to prepare to deal with any side-effects, in addition to asking them to prepare databases of those who will be on priority lists for the inoculation. Also Read | Covid-19 situation in Bengal under control, CM Mamata Banerjee tells PM Narendra ModiUnion health minister Harsh Vardhan earlier shared a rough draft of the priority list. “Almost 25-30 crore people will be given vaccine in the initial phase. This vaccine will have to be administered at least twice within the gap of two-three weeks to each person. Naturally we will have to prioritise. Corona warriors will be our natural priority, including health care and frontline workers, then 65 plus elderly population and those who are 50-65 years old, and then 50 years and less people with diseases. All this is being scientifically decided after going through the opinion of several experts…,” he had said at a conference last week.“The interim vaccine trial results are showing promise, as up to 90% efficacy is more than acceptable for respiratory illness vaccine. India is a large country and phasing the vaccine delivery on where and whom you choose to give the shot based on their risk of exposure, makes sense,” says Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. Modi also told the CMs that they should firm up efforts to curb infections, and focus on reducing the rate of test positivity and fatality. “We need to work towards bringing down the positive rate to nearly 5 per cent and the fatality rate to under 1 per cent and called for more RT-PCR tests,” he said.The meeting, in addition to Rupani and Yediyurappa, included Union home minister Amit Shah and health minister Harsh Vardhan, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Rajasthan’s Ashok Gehlot, West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee, Maharashtra’s Uddhav Thackeray and Chhattisgarh’s Bhupesh Baghel.“At the start of the outbreak the government had to take certain tough measures but that was to ready the country for dealing with the pandemic. Now that we are ready we need to keep the momentum going,” Modi said.Modi reiterated on the need to understand public behaviour, the official quoted above said. “The first stage of people’s response to Covid was of fear, when people reacted in panic. The second stage saw doubts about the virus, when several people tried to hide that they had been afflicted by it. The third stage was of acceptance, when people became more serious about the virus and displayed greater alertness. In the fourth stage, with increasing recovery rate, people have developed a false notion of security from the virus, thus leading to rise in instances of negligence,” this official quoted the PM as saying.(With inputs from HTC in Mumbai and Bengaluru)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lays-covid-19-vaccine-road-map-in-meet-with-cms/story-1ZEvDV6OSQoH24C782sD4N.html
25-11-2020||India||UP makes ‘love jihad’ a punishable offence||The Uttar Pradesh cabinet approved on Tuesday a draft ordinance outlawing religious conversions by marriage, coercion, deceit or enticement, and prescribed up to 10 years imprisonment for those found guilty, becoming the first state to propose a law for regulating interfaith relationships. The announcement came roughly a month after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath vowed to end “love jihad”, a term used by right-wing activists to describe marital relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women, but one that the courts and the Union government do not officially recognise. The draft ordinance doesn’t mention the word “love jihad” anywhere, said UP law commission chairperson AN Mittal, who was involved in drafting the document. Also Read | ‘They are grown-ups’: Allahabad HC cancels case against Muslim man by wife’s parentsThe draft ordinance, formally called Uttar Pradesh Vidhi Viruddh Dharm Samparivartan Pratishedh Adhyadesh 2020 (UP Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance-2020), includes a provision to void a marriage if it is solemnised primarily to convert a woman’s faith. The burden of proof in such cases will be on the person who converted their faith, and those who performed the conversion, the document added. It imposed a penalty of between five and 10 years for such a union.“The way in which religious conversions are done using deceit, lies, force and dishonesty is heart wrenching, and it was necessary to have a law in this regard… The ordinance was necessary to maintain law and order and justice for women,” cabinet minister and UP government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said.Adityanath’s promise last month was based on a judgment by a single-judge bench of the Allahabad high court in October objecting to religious conversion only for marriage. But on Monday, a two-judge division bench said the previous verdict didn’t lay down good law. The division bench also said the right to marry a partner irrespective of faith was a part of a person’s constitutional right that could not be infringed. The state government, through the ordinance, appeared to have sidestepped the legal debate, and based the proposed law on a 2019 submission by the state law commission, which called for a law to check forcible religious conversions in the state. Unlike several other states, Uttar Pradesh didn’t have an anti-conversion law on its books. “The ordinance came following a law commission report and after studying all possible aspects. The UP government will stop all illegal conversions. Love jihad is a term in circulation, people use it. Everything in the ordinance is within the purview of the Constitution and people’s rights,” said deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. The draft ordinance – which now needs the assent of governor Anandiben Patel — made religious conversions using force, coercion, enticement, deceit, and fraud non-bailable and cognisable offences, which means a police officer can arrest a suspect without warrant and can start an investigation without the permission of a court.The ordinance provided for imprisonment of a minimum of one year to a maximum of five years and a penalty of not less than ₹15,000. In cases where a minor girl or a woman from the scheduled caste or scheduled tribe communities is involved, the imprisonment ranged from three years to 10 years and penalty of at least ₹25,000. In cases of collective or mass illegal conversion, the punishment is between three and 10 years with a penalty of at least ₹50,000. In such offences, the registration of the organisation holding the mass conversion event could be cancelled. The draft law also empowered district magistrates to award compensation not exceeding ₹5 lakh to victims of forced conversion. If a person wants to change their faith, they will have to apply in a prescribed format two months before the planned conversion. This is double the period stipulated in the 1954 Special Marriage Act that regulates interfaith unions. Violation of this clause in the draft ordinance would make a person liable for imprisonment between six months to three years and penalty of at least ₹10,000, said a state government statement. Uttar Pradesh’s draft ordinance comes at a time several other Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) –ruled states – such as Karnataka, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh – have declared their intention to outlaw “love jihad”, in which Hindu right-wing activists claim gullible Hindu women are being coerced into conversion on the false pretext of marriage. Many experts reject these allegations and say that adult men and women are free to convert under the constitutional right to freedom of religion. In February, the central government told Parliament that there was no definition of the term and no such cases were reported by agencies.Last week, Madhya Pradesh announced that it will bring in the next session of the assembly a bill to check incidents of “love jihad”. The new proposed law mentioned that conversion for marriage by force, fraud, lure or instigation would be punishable by a maximum jail term of five years. If such forced conversion is proved, then the marriage concerned shall be declared null and void and anyone who assisted or was a part of the conversion exercise shall be treated at par with the main accused, the proposed bill added.Samajwadi Party spokesperson and former UP minister Rajendra Chaudhary said: “This government has a track record in wasting time and energy and diverting public attention from real issues by doing such things.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-makes-love-jihad-a-punishable-offence/story-3z1DLoEU3bWI1dOz8hTqAI.html
25-11-2020||India||Tamil Nadu, Puducherry brace as cyclone Nivar nears||With cyclone Nivar expected to make a landfall on eastern coast of Tamil Nadu on Wednesday, heavy rains lashed several parts of the state including Chennai on Tuesday. As a precautionary measure, the state government has declared a public holiday on Wednesday.The cyclone is expected to make a landfall between Mamallapuram and Karaikal on November 25 late evening with a wind speed of up to 145 kmph, according to Indian Meteorological Department. The cyclonic storm over southwest Bay of Bengal moved westwards with a speed of 07 kmph on Tuesday afternoon over southwest Bay of Bengal about 370 km eastsoutheast of Puducherry and 420 km south-southeast of Chennai. It is likely to intensify further into a severe cyclonic storm during next 12 hours and into a very severe cyclonic storm during subsequent 12 hours according to IMD’s Tuesday bulletin. IMD scientists however said that it was not possible to confirm the exact time and location of landfall until Wednesday morning when models will have a clearer picture. “We can say it could cross the coast anytime between 6 to 8 pm,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD. A red category warning for extremely heavy rain has been sounded in coastal and north interior Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal on November 25 and for Rayalseema on November 26. “The cyclone has gradually intensified and wind speed has increased so the warnings have changed,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre. With 43,409 first responders, several rescue teams and personnel including the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the coast guard have been deployed. “We have made our moves to prepare for the cyclone. We have to leave it to nature now and respond,” said Phanindra Reddy, principal secretary and commissioner, state’s disaster management and mitigation department.

This time, the cyclone relief centers have been doubled to 8,813 to accommodate 2.5 lakh people so as to ensure social distancing. “We didn’t want the relief camps to end up becoming super spreaders,” Reddy said, adding that people will be screened for Covid symptoms at the camps. Till Tuesday evening, less than 1,000 people had moved there but authorities are expected a bigger crowd on Wednesday when the cyclone approaches the coast. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced a public holiday on Wednesday urging people to remain indoors. Essential services will continue to operate. “We have taken all precautions so that people aren’t affected due to the cyclone. There is no need to panic,” he said, after inspecting an emergency control room in Chennai. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Palaniswami and Puducherry chief minister V Narayanaswamy on Tuesday and assured them of assistance from the Centre. In Chennai, the officials asked people not to panic as water levels rose in the Chembarambakkam reservoir. The government has issued orders to release surplus water from Chembarambakkam if it exceeds its storage capacity. Overflow from Chembarambakkam had caused the 2015 devastating Chennai floods. “The situation is under control,” said Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner, G Prakash. The city has opened 80 relief camps with another 80 on stand-by. Civic workers in Chennai were pressed into clearing water-logged roads as the city received heavy rains from Monday night. However, authorities were more concerned of the impact of winds which could uproot trees and blow away tin sheets and roof which could be fatal if people stay outdoors. District administrations are running control rooms with emergency numbers for the public to call. The coast guard has stationed 15 disaster management teams while two helicopters are on standby. Four off-shore patrol vehicles will be available to assist fishermen and in Chennai there are five flood relief teams and one diving team. Southern railways have cancelled 24 trains including trains connecting Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Suburban train services have also been suspended from Wednesday until further orders. Meanwhile, section 144 has been imposed in Puducherry. The administration has also opened a 24x7 control room coordinating with various teams and has set up 96 relief camps. “When there is a need they will be moved, we don’t want to unnecessarily create a hotspot,” said Puducherry collector T Arun, who was confident with their mitigation efforts. “Our only concern is people venturing out which is why we have prohibited movement and we have asked families to stock up,” said Arun.

Bihar chief secretary Deepak Kumar on Monday asked the district magistrates and the superintendents of police to ramp up testing of samples and undertake special drives in their respective districts to check for masks at public places. The daily testing of samples had gone down from the month’s high of 1,43,642 on November 3 to a low of 85,174 on November 21 during the Chhath festival. “We will step up testing and intensify checking at public places, including commercial establishments and vehicles. Penalty will be slapped on those not wearing masks. We will even seal commercial establishments, like shopping malls and shops or seize vehicles, which do not follow guidelines,” said Sanjay Agarwal, Patna’s divisional commissioner. The government’s emphasis was also to keep stringent checks and continue with the curbs in containment zones. “Besides keeping special vigil on containment zones, we have also asked officials to do intensive contact tracing of Covid-19 patients to check for people they came in contact with so that they do not become super-spreaders,” added Agarwal. Patna district magistrate had constituted teams for checking. “We have asked our officers to intensify checking for masks at public places and ensure that people wear them. We have also asked them to penalize the defaulters,” said Patna’s district magistrate Kumar Ravi. “Vending zones will be closed for three days if people and shopkeepers are found not to follow guidelines on wearing masks and maintaining social distance,” he added. Occupants in private and commercial vehicles will be checked for masks and penalized for defaulting. They will also be subjected to random rapid antigen Covid-19 tests, said officials. Officials had been instructed to penalize vehicle occupants not wearing masks for other violations as well under the Motor Vehicle Act so that they felt the financial pinch. Civil surgeons have been asked to hold testing camps in crowded areas like vegetable markets, commercial areas and bus stand. Airport and railway station authorities have been asked to ensure compliance and also create public awareness against the pandemic through loudspeaker. The Patna district magistrate has also asked magistrates to do videography of crowded public areas to check for violations. Bihar had 5,016 active cases against 2,31,697 total cases and 1,233 deaths reported so far, according to the health department’s bulletin on Tuesday. As many as 2,25,447 people had recovered from the disease, with a recovery rate of 97.30%. Bihar had conducted 1,37,43,532 tests till Monday with 1,07,624 tests per million so far. Most of these tests were through rapid antigen kits. On Monday, for instance, Bihar conducted 1,06,055 tests of which 11,992 were through real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 3,112 TrueNat and the remaining 90,951 through rapid antigen testing kits. The number of new infections has been down since 865 cases were reported on November 9, two days after culmination of the Bihar assembly elections. Bihar has been on alert since September 25 when elections to the state assembly were announced. A Central team had specifically asked the state to be vigilant during elections and the festive season of Diwali and Chhath when many people from outside the state return. Bihar taking full precautions to curb Covid-19, says CMBihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said the state was taking full precautions to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease. He said the state government was preparing a structured plan to ensure the dissemination of Covid-19 vaccine to the masses once it was available. Kumar on Tuesday participated in a meeting, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi carried out through video-conference on the Covid-19 vaccine and safety precautions to be taken against the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-to-ramp-up-covid-19-testing-intensify-checking-for-masks-penalize-defaulters/story-lQEDMK2CkCgbLgi2fXZ5EO.html
25-11-2020||India||Former Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath link in I-T dept’s probe on Congress||The Income Tax department is a step closer to completing its investigation into the recovery of unaccounted cash from individuals and entities linked to Congress leaders during extensive raids in Delhi, Bhopal, Goa and other locations ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, people familiar with the development said. The department found that huge tranches of unaccounted cash were delivered at the headquarters of the Congress in Delhi, the people added, asking not to be named.According to documents reviewed by HT, the investigation is centred around Vikas Dhingra, a relative of Vinela Jain, a close associate of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath. The investigators have also claimed in the documents that Dhingra’s immigration data shows that he left India in April 2019 and is yet to return. They add that he is likely a “conduit” and not the beneficiary. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) , in April 2019, said in a statement that part of ₹281 crore of unaccounted cash, “was transferred to the headquarters of a major political party in Delhi”. Without naming the political party at that time, CBDT said that around “₹20 crore of this cash was moved through hawala (channels) to the party’s headquarters from the residence of a senior functionary at Tughlak Road”. The department’s statement last year came after raids at 52 locations linked to several individuals and entities, including Nath. His officer on special duty (OSD) Pravin Kakkar, his former advisor Rajendra Miglani, and executives linked to his brother-in-law’s firm Moser Baer and his nephew Ratul Puri’s company Hindustan Powerprojects Pvt Ltd were all raided. Two of the people cited in the first instance said the tax probe had revealed that the amount delivered to the party was much higher than what was initially believed and that a final report will be sent to the Election Commission and other agencies soon. The documents say Rs 106 crore was “delivered” to the Congress HQ and a further Rs 72 crore to an account maintained by Dhingra, and controlled by Nath. They also claim that some of the money was generated in Madhya Pradesh (when Nath was the chief minister).Despite repeated attempts to contact him, Nath couldn’t be reached for comment. When contacted, his former OSD RK Miglani declined to comment. MP Congress spokesperson Saed Jafar said: “Central agencies are working under pressure of the central government. The BJP {Bharatiya Janata Party} leaders are hatching a conspiracy against Congress leaders and they are misusing all the central agencies in it. But we are sure that public is watching everything.” In Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh home minister Narottam Mishra on Tuesday ordered an inquiry into the transfer of unaccounted money into the account of All India Congress Committee from the year 2016 to 2019 allegedly by former chief minister and MP Congress Committee president Nath. MIshra told journalists: “We have always said that the previous Congress-led state government was the most corrupt government. Brokers were so active during the tenure of Kamal Nath. People were busy in minting money. Kamal Nath spent money of woman and child development department allocated to resolve the issue of malnutrition on Rahul Gandhi and deposited social welfare fund on Gandhi Welfare. ” Congress declined to comment on the matter.According to the two people cited above, the tax department examined several hand-written diaries, computer files and excel sheets recovered during the raids last year, and also questioned individuals linked to these payments . The findings of the investigation are still being finalised and some of the details being reported are part of the “appraisal report” the two people said. . “It appears that a section of media has ostensibly accessed some documents, and on that basis they are quoting a sum of Rs 106 crore of unaccounted money that can be traced to the Congress Party. But that may not be the whole truth. The case could involve money worth several hundred crores and there are not just one or two beneficiaries. But, it is an ongoing investigation. The Income-Tax Department is governed by laws and without completing the entire process of investigation and assessment, which also involves replies and responses of entities involved, one cannot reach a final conclusion,” one of the two people said.The CBDT, which controls the Income-Tax Department, did not respond to queries from HT.“Investigations are carried on by designated authorities [director general of investigation] and details of an ongoing investigation are not shared even within the Department or the ministry [of finance]. It is understood that matters are currently being investigated,” a finance ministry official said, requesting anonymity.But MP minister Mishra is keen on pressing ahead with the state’s own case. “The state government has taken cognizance in the matter. We will take advice of legal experts and also get documents from the Income Tax department. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) will hold an inquiry in the matter,” he added. MP Congress leader Narendra Saluja challenged the state government to “prove the accusations”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nath-link-in-i-t-dept-s-probe-on-cong/story-F4NQ0jX4C5dfwvru3zoWiJ.html

The CWC, however, has not witnessed any election in over two decades now -- one of the key issues raised by several leaders who have called for urgent organisational and functional changes to check the party’s electoral decline in recent years.The last time an election was held for the party's highest decision-making body during the Kolkata plenary in 1997. “Hopefully, we will issue a detailed schedule of the organisational elections by December-end after the CWC clears our proposal,” said a member of the party’s central election authority (CEA) who asked not to be named.The member added that there was no decision yet on holding a virtual AICC session, though some leaders expressed reservations over the physical presence of over 1,500-1,600 delegates at one venue in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. In any case, he said, an AICC session is unlikely to be held before next February. While carrying out a major organisational reshuffle on September 11, Congress president Sonia Gandhi formed a five-member CEA to hold internal polls. It is headed by Madhusudan Mistry, and its members are Rajesh Mishra, Krishna Byre Gowda, S Jothimani, and Arvinder Singh Lovely.Lovely one of the 23 signatories to a letter to Sonia Gandhi in August seeking a complete overhaul of the party functioning, internal polls, and a full-time leadership to stem the steady decline of the 135-year-old organisation.CEA met on Tuesday to review the progress on its previous communication asking all state units to send an updated list of AICC delegates who form the electoral-college for the organisational polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/schedule-for-elections-to-cong-chief-post-cwc-may-be-declared-in-dec/story-b1Kqe2ipOYppMw1yIKd75J.html

According to forest officials, the Royal Bengal tiger moved out of the corridor connecting the Kaziranga and Nameri national parks into the Napam area close to the Tezpur University. “The tiger moved towards the Jia Bharali area close to the 9th addition to the Kaziranga national park. Two people were injured in the attack by the animal and have been admitted in hospital. The situation is under control,” P Siva Kumar, Director, Kaziranga National Park said. “Section 144 of CrPC was imposed in the area in order to ensure crowd control and an operation launched to drive out the animal towards Kaziranga in the evening,” he added. A video of the animal chasing a group of people has been circulating on social media. In the video, the tiger is seen injuring a man who falls into a ditch. The animal moves away from the spot immediately. “We are monitoring the situation closely. Hopefully, the animal will move back towards Nameri or go to the Burha Chapori area without causing more worry,” said Sivakumar.

25-11-2020||India||TRP fraud probe: Mumbai Police files charge sheet against 12 accused||The Mumbai Police on Tuesday submitted a charge sheet at the metropolitan magistrate court, running into 1,400 pages, against the 12 accused in connection with television rating point (TRP) fraud case. The charge sheet includes the statements of 140 witnesses along with relevant documents. Mumbai Police have listed the names of the owners and directors of the two news channels as wanted accused in the charge sheet. The police said that their probe would continue and they would submit supplementary charge sheet at a later stage with more evidence. The accused are facing charges under sections 409 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 468 (forgery for cheating), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 204 (destruction of documentary evidence, 212 (harbouring offender) and 34 (act done with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The case was registered with Kandivli police on October 6 after the arrest of Vishal Bhandari, 21, former employee of Hansa Research Private Limited. Also read | The purpose of TV media measurementApart from Bhandari, the police have also arrested Bompalli Rao Mistry,44; Shirish Pattanshetty, 44; Narayan Sharma, 47; Vinay Tripathi, 29; Umesh Mishra, 32; Ramji Sharma, 41; Dineshkumar Vishwakarma, 37; Harish Patil, 45; Abhishekh Kolwade, 35; Ashish Chaudhary, 50; and Ghanshyam Singh. 44. Singh, who is Republic TV’s distribution head, was the last to be arrested. He was arrested on November 10 from his Thane home. “Pattanshetty, Sharma and Mishra are out on bail. We have arrested republic TV representative and distribution head Ghanshyam Singh in the case and the other accused are connected to him. Mishra and Chaudhary have turned approvers in the case. The investigation in the TRP case will continue,” assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, who is part of the probe and also heading the CIU of the crime branch, said. The police began the probe after ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers. The police then discovered that some channels were allegedly paying bribes to boost their TRP fraudulently to increase their advertising revenue. Bhandari allegedly told the police that it was an old modus operandi to pay households where barometers for recording TRP were installed to keep tuned to certain channels, to help enhance rating of the channels fraudulently. Hansa is one of BARC’s vendors on engagement with panel homes or people’s meters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trp-fraud-case-mumbai-police-file-charge-sheet/story-RUSRCPWtuQB8dz9YegHVHK.html
25-11-2020||India||UP child abuse case: CBI hints main accuse was not working alone||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing a child abuse racket allegedly run by an irrigation department junior engineer in Chitrakoot, Uttar Pradesh, has found that the porn videos he sold on the dark web were of high quality, indicating the involvement of a professional. Also Read | UP child molester gifted mobile phones to kids he abused:CBIOfficials aware of the development said on condition of anonymity that the CBI, which arrested Ram Bhavan Singh from Chitrakoot on November 16, is now searching for the location where the videos were made. The agency has in its possession about 100 videos found on pen drives and a laptop it received from an anonymous whistle-blower. It also recovered spy cameras and video making equipment during the searches it carried out as part of its investigation. An examination of these videos has revealed that they were made by a professional, a sign that Bhavan was possibly not working alone, the officials said. “Seeing the videos, one can easily make out that the locations were arranged and shots were taken professionally, as the way the camera pans and closes in on the subjects is apparently beyond the ability of this man (Bhavan), who is not that tech-savvy,” said one of the officials cited above. To build a strong case against the suspect, the agency is focusing on tracing the maximum number of children Bhavan trapped and abused. The CBI has managed to trace 35 of Bhavan’s victims -- 15 of them from Banda district alone. His victims were only boys, aged between six and 15 years, the officials said. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court in Banda will decide on the CBI’s plea for custodial remand of Bhavan on Tuesday. The court had deferred an order on November 20 after Bhavan’s counsel Anurag Singh Chandel alleged that the CBI arrested him on false charges. CBI’s standing counsel Ashok Kumar Singh would file a rejoinder in the court on Tuesday. The five-day custodial remand the CBI has sought from court is to identify Bhavan’s remaining victims and find the locations where the videos were made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-child-abuse-case-cbi-hints-main-accuse-was-not-working-alone/story-NoxRv0wXQk2et295HWq9IL.html
25-11-2020||Editorials||The President’s message||In his inaugural address at an annual conclave of the presiding officers of Parliament and various state legislatures, President Ram Nath Kovind made a series of significant points — which may appear cliched, but are central to the functioning of any democracy. He underlined that dialogue was essential to ensure that debates did not become disputes. He said that the role of the Opposition is essential in a parliamentary system along with that of the ruling party, and harmony and cooperation between the two is important. And he told the presiding officers that it was their duty to create an enabling atmosphere for debate with impartiality, righteousness and fairness. The president’s remarks assume additional importance because of two disturbing trends in the democratic system. The first is a function of the deeply-polarised nature of Indian democracy and politics at the moment. Political competitors see each other as enemies, the room for cooperation between the Treasury and Opposition benches on even issues related to national security has shrunk, and the trust deficit is at an all-time high. All of this has had an impact on the functioning of legislatures across the board, reducing their efficacy as a platform to refine laws and policies through deliberation. So when the president says that dialogue is essential, both sides need to work together, and presiding officers should create conditions for it, it has a contemporary relevance that’s hard to miss for political actors. The second disturbing trend is of partisan presiding officers. This has been clear in states, where a ruling party or alliance is facing a challenge from the Opposition on whether it enjoys the confidence of the house. In such a scenario, the speaker of the assembly has to take decisions on a range of issues — from disqualification of legislators who may be switching ranks to timing of a confidence or no-confidence motion, among other issues. This should be done on the basis of existing rules, but often, the decision of the presiding officer is dictated by the past political allegiance of the functionary. This, then, raises questions about impartiality and erodes the legitimacy of the institution. The fact that these allegiances also come into play in the everyday functioning of the legislatures doesn’t help. So when India’s biggest constitutional functionary suggests that presiding officers must be fair and just, they may want to heed the advice in letter and spirit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-president-s-message/story-lj99yJ9q7cto2pEyVzvRiI.html
25-11-2020||Editorials||In Nepal, a test for FS Shringla||Foreign secretary (FS) Harsh Vardhan Shringla has an old Nepal connection. He is a Nepali language speaker and has served in the northern division (handling Nepal and Bhutan) of the ministry of external affairs as a director. In addition, having been a joint secretary handling other neighbours such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Myanmar, he is also familiar with how domestic political dynamics in smaller South Asian countries collide with regional geopolitics. And that is why the FS’s visit to Nepal, starting on Thursday, is an important moment to reset bilateral ties. The FS will need to navigate four challenges. One, while keeping up protocol and respecting Nepali sensitivities, he must get a feel of the complicated internal dynamics within Nepal, where Prime Minister KP Oli’s position is both strong (he has control over State institutions) and weak (he faces intra-party rebellion). This will entail listening to leaders across the spectrum, in particular older allies, about their objectives. Two, while respecting Nepal’s sovereign right to pursue ties with China, he must, privately, make Indian redlines clear and warn that if these are crossed, Delhi will have to reconsider its approach. Three, he must — in his public statements — reach out to all stakeholders, perhaps with a Nepali-language address to Kathmandu’s political and opinion-making elite and a special gesture of support to marginalised social groups in the Tarai, reiterating India’s support for the principle of inclusion. And finally, at a time when there remains an effort to challenge the progressive political transformation of 2006, Mr Shringla should make it clear that New Delhi stands by a federal, democratic, republican, and secular Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-nepal-a-test-for-fs-shringla/story-tRaNmod2amUE4PJUSye8JK.html
