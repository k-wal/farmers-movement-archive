23-11-2020||News||The ball is in China’s court, writes Harsh V Pant||India’s recalibration of its ties with China continues apace even as the situation along the Himalayan frontier remains tense. From Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi targeting China at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit to external affairs minister S Jaishankar talking of the need to respect territorial integrity and sovereignty at the East Asia summit, New Delhi is now more vocal than ever at articulating its frustration with Chinese behaviour. The irony in the Chinese leadership extolling the virtues of rules and norms in the conduct of international relations at various global forums is not lost on a world that is struggling to come to terms with Beijing’s aggression and a newfound sense of entitlement.India has also mounted a vigorous challenge to China across sectors — political, economic, military and diplomatic — though it is not readily evident if Beijing is cognisant of how far to the brink its reckless behaviour has taken the Sino-Indian relationship. At the same time, military talks between the two sides have continued and, for New Delhi, the objective remains complete disengagement and full restoration of peace and tranquility along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the western sector. Earlier this month, there were reports that at the eighth round of corps commanders meeting, China had proposed moving its troops back to Finger 8, and a mutual return of Indian and Chinese troops to their original locations on the south bank of Pangong Tso. The aim, it seems, is to reduce the possibility of inadvertent clashes and incidents at a time when harsh weather conditions are exacerbating an already volatile situation. This three-step disengagement and de-escalation process is to include removal of armoured personnel carriers, withdrawal of troops from specific areas on the north and south banks of the Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh, and a verification of the disengagement process by both sides.The fact that this proposal came from the Chinese side should be viewed in the context of Indian Army occupying all the dominating heights on the southern bank of Pangong Tso and Chushul in August, positioning itself on Gurung Hill, Magar Hill, Mukhpari, Rechin La and Rezang La. This strengthened New Delhi’s bargaining position and underscored for Beijing that India remains willing and able to fight its way out of the crisis if needed.Chinese military superiority is real and growing, but the Indian military has much greater exposure to fighting at high altitudes. Military gains on the battlefield are key to diplomatic outcomes at the negotiating table, despite India’s lacklustre record in this regard. In the current crisis, India has been able to alter the tactical calculus of the Chinese military and so disengagement is now much more of a serious consideration. Beijing is signaling that it doesn’t want to go any further, at least in the near future. There is a new administration in Washington and the Chinese leadership will be reluctant to start with it on a sour note by initiating a crisis with India. So, all eyes are now on the next round of corps commanders meeting where India’s position will be spelt out more clearly.But the larger challenge remains one of reducing the trust deficit which is widening by the day between the two Asian giants. It is striking that PM Modi has been interacting with key world leaders on a regular basis bilaterally, but one leader is missing in that matrix. Xi Jinping and Modi have been part of a number of multilateral platforms, but Modi has challenged Chinese actions without naming the country. India’s decision to keep itself out of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) should also be viewed through the strategic lens. New Delhi had announced its decision on RCEP last year when it had misgivings about the trade pact and about the role China would have in it. Those misgivings have become sharper post Covid-19 and border tensions. The use of trade policy for geopolitical ends has been trademark Chinese behaviour and India is trying hard to reduce its vulnerabilities vis-à-vis China.China’s rise and its attendant consequences was the central determinant of Indian foreign policy even before the border crisis of this year. But after the military standoff across LAC, it is clear that Indian policymakers will have to ascertain the China factor and assess its implications for all major policy choices they make. After all, as Jaishankar has underlined, the choices nations make today will have deep “strategic implications” tomorrow. India’s policy choices today will have a great bearing on its future global role. And as Chinese behaviour spurs greater clarity in Indian actions and choices, a more confident New Delhi should hopefully be better able to shape its strategic environment in consonance with its priorities. India’s military and diplomatic responses to Chinese aggression have made it clear that is India neither without options not is it reticent in choosing them. It is now for China to make up its mind about whether it wants a permanent foe in India or a neighbouring country with whom it can do business with.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-ball-is-in-china-s-court/story-Ld60zrfCeFbOvq8hdRSnWJ.html
23-11-2020||News||Joe Biden’s win is good for India-US ties, writes Frank F Islam||Nearly three weeks after the historic presidential election, United States (US) President Donald Trump is yet to concede, clinging on to hope that he can somehow miraculously hold on to power despite losing by a huge margin. However, with even his Republican allies at state and local levels refusing to help him, there is no chance that Trump will succeed in his attempt to overturn the will of the people.But, unfortunately, Trump’s unfounded accusations of election fraud and his refusal to concede have no doubt sullied the spirit of the American democracy, which has always prided itself on smooth and orderly transition of power. The outgoing president is also dragging down the Republican Party, whose leaders largely have stood by him.The president has suffered defeats in a string of court cases — many of which were absurd and farcical — and even many GOP election officials in states and at local jurisdictions have refused angry demands via Twitter to nullify the election results. What these legal and political defeats prove is that the world’s oldest democracy is going to pass the most intense stress test it was subjected to thus far with flying colours.A big example is that, despite the incumbent’s stonewalling, President-elect Joe Biden is at work, putting together teams and personnel that will form the core of his administration and crafting policies to tackle Covid-19 and revive the economy, two of his biggest election promises. The US business community and a number of world leaders have recognised Biden as the rightful winner. Among the global leaders who congratulated the president-elect was Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The presidential election has implications for India, due to its status as the world’s largest democracy, strategic imperatives and the special involvement of the Indian-American community electorally in the US this time around. New Delhi was anxious about the election, especially after it provided platforms for Trump to deliver campaign speeches on two occasions in the past 15 months. Despite the presence of Kamala Harris, who is of Indian and African-American origin, on the Biden ticket, some in India were rooting for the president’s re-election because he did not oppose the government’s actions in Kashmir and the enactment of the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act.There is no question that human rights would go back to being one of the centerpieces of the US foreign policy under the Biden administration. For this reason, some in in India are apprehensive about a Biden White House “meddling” in India’s “internal affairs.”There is a consensus among objective observers in Washington, however, that no single issue will derail the bilateral ties between India and the US. In fact, ties will only strengthen. And this is because, under the Trump administration, India-US relations had become primarily transactional. While defence ties between the two countries continued on the trajectory of the Bush and Obama administrations, commercial ties took a step backward. Trump quarrelled with India publicly on a number of small trade issues that could have been better addressed privately through constructive negotiations among foreign policy experts. His foreign policy was largely been based on his whims and fancies. He routinely ignored the Department of State. Under the Biden administration, bilateral relations with India will go back to being institutionally-centered and subject-matter expert-driven.Under the Biden presidency, the US will rejoin the Paris Agreement — which took effect on November 4, the day after the elections — and a series of other international accords and treaties, and rebuild the bridge with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners. India will benefit from the US once again taking an active role internationally.Another aspect of this presidential elections that triggered a lot of interest in India was the significance and involvement of the Indian-American community. As has been widely reported, the community was openly courted by both parties. In terms of mobilisation and campaign donations, and now with Kamala Harris set to be sworn in as the first woman, African-American and Indian-American vice-president of the US on January 20, this election has been unprecedented in more ways than one. Judging by the number of Indian-Americans Biden has included in various cabinet transition committees, one can expect a significant Indian-American presence in the administration. There are close to two-dozen Indian-Americans in the 500-member transition agency review teams. Three teams are led by Indian-Americans. Biden’s Covid-19 task force includes three Indian-Americans, including Vivek Murthy, who is a co-chair. Murthy, a former surgeon general of the US, is reportedly a candidate for the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Service. Other Indian-American names touted for top jobs include Stanford professor Arun Majumdar for the secretary of energy and former PepsiCo chief Indra Nooyi for the secretary of commerce.2020 was a long and contentious year politically which ended with a win for Biden, the US, and India. That is good news. The better news is that the best is yet to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/joe-biden-s-win-is-good-for-india-us-ties/story-F2iPwWkjf9vHEPLdPiSOJO.html
23-11-2020||News||In Nepal, how domestic politics is colliding with geopolitics||Last month, Nepal’s Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli’s government quietly issued a circular to its administration to replace “Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal” with “Nepal” in its documents. Many saw it as a matter of practicality. To others, however, the move showed Oli in his true political colour — a conservative leader, who had never owned up to Nepal’s 2006 political transformation to a secular federal democratic republic from the 250-year-old Hindu monarchy that had put a tight political leash on Nepal’s linguistic, cultural and ethnic diversity.The 2006 mass movement was led by civil society groups and political parties, including Oli’s own then-Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML). But well into the second decade of the mass movement, there are people on the political Right (and don’t get taken by the communist label; in Nepal, the Left is home to cultural conservatives too) but also in the ruling party and the main opposition, the Nepali Congress, who question the political changes. To them, the 12-point agreement between the underground Maoists and the parliamentary parties that led to the sweeping changes is tainted, for it was signed in New Delhi. China, whose reading of the ground situation was out of sync with the turn of events, belatedly consented to the move when it saw that the monarchy was fast losing its political base.Now, many seem keen to dismantle the political edifice. The move is aimed at isolating Oli’s political nemesis, Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who was a key architect of the 2006 change and is making a bid to remove the PM, but it also puts Oli’s signature conservatism to the heart of the polity. How the internal political battle within the Nepali communists shapes up will determine who controls the reins of power in Kathmandu till the next elections two years away, the trajectory of Nepal’s relationship with India and China and the rest of the international community, and the future of Nepali democracy.All of this will be at stake when Oli responds to Prachanda’s challenge at an internal party meeting on November 28. There are three possible scenarios — Oli takes a middle-of-the-road approach that placates Prachanda for now; he takes a belligerent position (purges are common in communist parties whosoever gains ascendance); or, in the extreme case, Oli opts for a vertical split of the party.The big question is how far will this domestic dynamic intersect with changing regional and global geopolitics. China has invested a lot of energy to bring the two communist parties together, with its ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi, active in her bid to stave off a split, including during Diwali. It’s now Beijing that seems to be inviting public ire for meddling in Nepali politics — a sole preserve of New Delhi for decades.It’s equally interesting to observe a subtle shift in Oli’s foreign-policy priorities. After flirting with the nationalist card early this year — best evidenced by the publication, and subsequent parliamentary endorsement, of Nepal’s new map that puts the Kalapani area within Nepal’s territory, notwithstanding India’s claims over the territory. Indian Army chief General MM Naravane (instead of a civilian leader) controversially accused Nepal of acting “at the behest of someone else”, in a reference to China, and ended up becoming the key target of Nepali anger. But the past few weeks have seen Oli and New Delhi make conciliatory overtures. Last month, he met the chief of India’s external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing, Samant Goel.Soon after, General Naravane was conferred the rank of an honorary general of the Nepal Army by President Bidya Devi Bhandari. India’s foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla is now scheduled to arrive for a visit. China is not going to be outdone. By November-end, defence minister Wei Fenghe will arrive — the highest-ranking Chinese leader to visit Nepal since President Xi Jinping last year. The flurry of diplomatic activities is an indication that there is lot at stake here in the fast-emerging Asia-Pacific foreign policy and security architecture. The question is how Nepal will navigate it.Akhilesh Upadhyay is senior fellow, IIDS, a Kathmandu-based think tank The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-nepal-how-domestic-politics-is-colliding-with-geopolitics/story-rn13tL5lzGKnZTWVZ5rGYK.html
23-11-2020||News||RCEP is a China club, best India stays out of it||The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was signed on November 15 at a virtual meeting of member-states, on the margins of the annual East Asia Summit, eight years after the bloc was launched in Phnom Penh. The timing is neither surprising nor linked to any geopolitical development — it was announced during the East Asia Summit in Bangkok in 2019. India joined the negotiations in 2012 and continued to be part of them until the Bangkok meet. It was flexible in negotiations and made adjustments in pursuit of a comprehensive, fair and a balanced agreement. In the end, the final document did not meet any of the three parameters. For one, it remained weak on services, especially in areas where India had a competitive advantage. But the breaking point was the absence of specific safeguards on imports from China. One circuit breaker was the steep rise in imports; another, because RCEP permits differential coverage of market access between countries, India wanted, but did not get, full assurance that China would not be able to take advantage of the higher coverage permitted to Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) countries. And a third was adequate protection on tariff increases it had instituted on some products since the negotiations commenced, partly to remove anomalies such as levies on inputs being higher than those on finished goods.Facing a growing trade deficit with China, the risks were too high.There are also no guarantees that China will play by the rules. It did not do so as a World Trade Organization (WTO) member. India has found it hard to access Chinese markets in areas of its competitive advantage, despite this being routinely taken up at the highest levels. China has not stopped using coercive trade measures to express political displeasure against The Philippines, Vietnam, and even Singapore — all partners in Asean-China Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) – or, for that matter, with Japan, Korea and, more recently, Australia.India started entering into FTAs and Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements (CEPAs) from the mid-2000s. Among RCEP members, it has FTAs or Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreements (CECA) with Asean, Singapore, Japan and Korea. RCEP would have added China, Australia and New Zealand to the list. But it would have been an FTA with China. India’s domestic industry, however, wasn’t competitive enough to benefit from the existing FTAs. In any case, India’s largest exports were going to countries it did not have FTAs with. It is unlikely that India would have been able to withstand the import surge (from China) and damage to its industry in the short-run had it signed RCEP.India’s focus should first be on becoming industrially strong through a “Make in India” programme. Many RCEP members have reached this stage. An industrially weak and economically vulnerable India would have hardly been able to shape the region’s rules, no matter what those arguing on the strategic merits of joining RCEP believe. And China, after all, did not become the world’s biggest manufacturing power by entering into FTAs. RCEP is being touted as a triumph of multilateralism in an age of protectionism. But it is, at best, regionalism and it militates against multilateralism, pursued through WTO.FTAs did not prevent supply shocks and disruptions during the pandemic. Supply chain resilience, trust and efficiency have become more important these days and will influence trade.Will RCEP shape or influence strategic relations? Unlikely. China is already the largest-trading partner for most RCEP members. That has not prevented friction among them. Nor has it stopped countries from making strategic hedges. Japan and Australia joined the Malabar Exercises; 35% of Australia’s exports go to China, but, China has just presented 14 grievances to Australia. On the eve of RCEP’s signing, Japan and Australia signalled stronger defence ties. Australia has also become part of a trilateral with India and France. Japan and China are close trading partners, but tensions between them remain high over China’s territorial claims. Neither the existing FTAs nor RCEP will stop China from trampling on Southeast Asian claimants in the South China Sea. The United States (US)-China trade integration has not restrained the two countries from turning into strategic rivals. And European enthusiasm for China is waning, with the latter using its economic clout to divide Europe.To deepen trade and economic ties in the Indo-Pacific region and with current RCEP members, India does not need RCEP as much as it needs to get its own house in order. For a start, it must make its industry innovative and competitive, its research and development on par with the best, its logistics and trade infrastructure efficient, its human resources skilled, its financial markets healthy and capable of low-cost finance, its administrative and legal systems responsive, and its taxation stable, competitive and predictable. This is the mission of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-india-was-right-in-staying-out-of-rcep/story-IbGTgBnZBwS4vvJbzxITxH.html
23-11-2020||News||When citizens act against their interest | Opinion||As the world continues to grapple with the most extraordinary health crisis of recent times, more than 200,000 people have been fined for not wearing masks and more than 8,000 fined for not maintaining the required physical distance in public spaces in Delhi between September 7 and November 16. And this represents only those who were caught.It appears that only a direct and personal confrontation with Covid-19 may have a powerful enough impact on people to take precautions. Until then, they will neither protect themselves nor others. It is only when their parents test positive that they will run from one hospital to another trying to find a bed for them. Private hospitals will ask them to download an app and receive an online doctor’s consult when asked about the availability of beds. Finally, they will find a bed in a government hospital where the staff is so overworked that they have no compassion or empathy left to display. Till then, the lackadaisical attitude towards preventive health behaviour recommended for Covid-19 will continue.Why is there such disregard for preventive health behaviour, up until it catches up with them or someone close to them? Psychology professors, Timothy Osberg and Sidney Shrauger, found that people use their own experiences to predict future outcomes more than they use other factors such as circumstances, personal disposition, and population-based trends. Experts also feel that personal experience may elevate the perceived likelihood of personal victimisation more effectively than experiences of unknown others. In other words, unless Covid-19 is experienced up close and personal, the threat of the disease is negated, which is detrimental for the mass adoption of preventive health behaviour. Further, according to the health behaviour theory, people protect themselves based on their perception of the severity of a threatening event and perceived vulnerability of the occurrence of the event. Understanding the severity in general, and not just until it affects them somewhat directly, is critical.Several Indian cities have seen a significant spike in cases since the run-up to Diwali. Festivals are celebration time and social interaction is unavoidable. However, this pandemic necessitated, first, decreased social interaction, and, second, an adoption of recommended preventive behaviour. However, research suggests, when people find themselves in a potentially dangerous situation and others around them seem unfazed, they are likely to remain unfazed. This behaviour in social psychology, called pluralistic ignorance, refers to a situation when people, who otherwise privately reject an act, are found doing just that by observing others who are doing it and going along with it because they assume, incorrectly, that most others are fine with it. This leads to a wider display and acceptance of that behaviour and this “inaction breeds inaction”, says Catherine Sanderson, author of Why We Act: Turning Bystanders Into Moral Rebels. Accordingly, in a social setting when more people do not adopt recommended preventive behaviours, the more it confirms that when others are seen not wearing a mask, for instance, it becomes acceptable. And soon, no one cares. The lone person who probably still cares will refrain from going against the group for the fear of causing disruption. This could explain why, despite being the second highest nation with most infected cases, India is seeing a fresh spike of newly-infected cases post-Diwali.There is a need for a frequent and consistent display of the adoption of preventive health behaviour by social influencers. When young people see their favourite Hindi cinema star or their most admired business tycoon wear a mask or sanitise his hands in public, this will, in effect, become the new social norm. Adopting these new norms is easy, far easier than finding a hospital bed to ensure that our family and loved ones are still here to hug us when this pandemic is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/when-citizens-act-against-their-interest-opinion/story-2MVgC5rqTVfGxBAVfpUfXN.html

The authority wants to set up food courts and other commercial vends at Biodiversity Park in sector 91, Medicinal Park in sector 91, Express View Park in sector 93 and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Park in sector 150. As people have started visiting these parks, the authority wants to develop facilities for them, officials of the Noida authority said. The authority started the process of inviting bids from interested agencies from November 20. The last date to submit the forms online at its website noidaauthorityonline.com is December 5.“Any interested agency can submit its documents to participate in an e-auction either manually by December 3 or online forms will be uploaded by December 5,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty, Noida authority.Once the forms are submitted or uploaded, the applicants can submit their bids on December 10 from 11am to 2pm on its website. Under this scheme, the authority will offer its kiosks, restaurant and food plaza space on rent.“Whosoever will submit the highest bid will get the space on rent to run the services required in these city parks. We want to offer all necessary services to visitors at these city parks, which will witness a huge rush in the time to come. These four parks will emerge as hot spots for family picnic activities after these facilities are in place,” said a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to the media. There are four kiosks, each having an area of 62.175 square metres at the Biodiversity Park in sector 91. The food plaza has an area of 230 square metres. The Expressway View Park restaurant has an area of 93 square metres and the Bhagat Singh Park has the biggest food plaza space with 828.20 square metres, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-set-to-develop-services-for-visitors-in-parks-to-invite-bids/story-bNCkYWGnW30rkjBlQWXhYO.html
23-11-2020||Noida||UP issues directions for limiting gathering in open and closed spaces for events||The UP government on Monday issued a detailed order limiting the gathering of people at cultural, social, educational, sporting, entertainment, religious and political events. As per the latest directions issued by UP chief secretary, RK Tiwari, the maximum limit in closed spaces like halls/room will be 50% of the capacity of the hall but subject to maximum of 100 people. The gathering will be subject to mandatory availability of hand washing facility, sanitizer, thermal scanning along with use of face masks and maintaining social distancing. In previous October 1 order, the limit in such closed spaces was limited to 200 people. Further, the latest order has defined that the limit of gathering in open spaces be below 40% of the capacity of the space. Earlier, this had no limit. “The guidelines issued on Monday have become effective and will be applicable for functions like marriages etc. The directions have been issued to keep check on spread of Covid-19 infection and to prevent further rise in cases,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “As part of the enforcement, copy of the permission for events will be made available to the respective police station and the police will keep a check and enforce the measures. Besides, our administrative officers will also conduct surprise inspections at such places to ensure that guidelines are actively followed,” he added. Last week, both Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar had issued directions to limit attendance to 100 in events like marriages. Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health), on Monday said that there should be efforts to protect old aged persons and they should ideally not be taken to events like marriages to prevent them from infection. “It is so because earlier the share of those above 60 years in total infection cases in UP was about 8% and now the share has increased to about 10.13%. On the other hand, the share of this age group in total fatalities is about 45%. Since the old aged people are vulnerable, they should not be taken to functions like marriages. Otherwise, if they contract infection, there will be complications. In such case such people can participate through video-calling and avoid attending functions physically,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-issues-directions-for-limiting-gathering-in-open-and-closed-spaces-for-events/story-Xp4PZ4Y6cLFQ8OJXtOg38L.html
23-11-2020||Mumbai||MU’s rules on paper patterns, question banks still unclear for upcoming exams, say Mumbai colleges||Almost a week after the University of Mumbai (MU) issued a circular with guidelines to conduct the upcoming semester exams, city colleges are still unclear about several issues. While some course heads under the Bachelors in Mass Media (BMM) and Bachelors in Management Studies (BMS) faculties are confused about the paper pattern, absence of clarity on the system of question banks for the exams has left many teachers in a spot. As per guidelines issued by the university last week, exams for undergraduate and postgraduate traditional (arts, commerce, science) courses will constitute a 60-mark theory paper. This will include 50 marks of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), of which students could attempt 40. Each question will carry 1.5 marks. Similarly, for professional courses, exams will constitute of a combination of 40 marks of MCQs and 40 marks of descriptive-type questions, making up an 80-mark paper for each subject. “Confusion lies for interdisciplinary courses because as per the MU guidelines, exams for interdisciplinary courses will also be conducted in an MCQ and descriptive-type question format, each section holding 30 marks. While BMM falls under the arts faculty, TYBMM is an interdisciplinary course, so colleges are currently unsure what paper pattern to choose,” said a BMM faculty coordinator of a suburban college. Earlier this year, all state universities conducted final-year (summer 2020) exams online and the same were conducted as per guidelines issued by the respective universities. All clusters were asked to put together question banks of 250 questions in each subject. However, with no clarity on this in the recent circular, colleges are drawing their own conclusions. “Different colleges under different clusters are interpreting the university guidelines differently, and this is leading to more confusion. In some clusters, colleges are asking their faculty to put together a question bank of almost 400 questions in each subject, whereas in some cases, teachers are being asked to simply put together a question paper for their respective college and ignoring question banks,” said a senior faculty member of the mass media department of MU. At present, several colleges are busy conducting meetings and ensuring exams are conducted within the prescribed deadline. “We have to follow the rules and ensure that all traditional course exams are conducted by December 31, while professional courses need to be completed by January 15. As of now, our focus is on putting together the question papers and conducting exams as smoothly as possible,” said Anju Kapoor, principal of Usha Pravin Gandhi (UPG) College, Andheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mu-s-rules-on-paper-patterns-question-banks-still-unclear-for-upcoming-exams-say-mumbai-colleges/story-lbx50s6YtWCo1oKfoB4Q9I.html
23-11-2020||City||84% of sanctioned faculty posts vacant in Ludhiana’s govt colleges||With no recruitments for the past 16 years, 84% of the sanctioned posts for faculty at five government colleges in Ludhiana are currently lying vacant. A sixth college, Government College, Ludhiana (east), does not have even a single sanctioned post—not even for the principal. It is, therefore, taken care of by the principal of Satish Chander Dhawan (SCD) Government College.The recruitments had been stalled in 2003 due a pending litigation in the Punjab and Haryana high court. In the absence of regular staff, the colleges started hiring guest faculty members, who, as per sources, are not qualified for the posts.To be hired as a lecturer in a college, a candidate has to either clear the National Eligibility Test (NET) or hold a PhD degree. For the post of an assistant professor, both PhD and NET are compulsory. But authorities are said to have ignored these rules while recruiting the guest lecturers, thereby leaving an adverse impact on the quality of education at these colleges. This, sources say, has led to more and more students opting for higher studies abroad, or at least in other states. SCD Government College The SCD Government College, which is celebrating 100 years of inception, has 131 sanctioned posts, the highest among all colleges in the district. But only 25 of these posts have been filled up. Many of its teachers are also required to take classes for the Government College, Ludhiana (east), the building of which is still under construction. Baba Sheehan Singh Gill Govt College, Sidhsar The college has strength of 115 students and offers only the Bachelor of Arts course. Of the seven sanctioned posts in the college, only one has been filled up. Government College for Girls Established in 1943, the college is a premier institute for girls’ education. It offers 15 courses at the undergraduate and postgraduate level and has 89 sanctioned posts. But as of now, there are only 20 teachers on regular posts. The college has 51 guest faculty members and a few part-timers, who shoulder a major chunk of the day-to-day activities of the college. Government College, Karamsar Government College, Karamsar, which caters to the needs of students in rural areas, was established in 1969. The college offers three courses -- Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Commerce and Bachelor of Science. It has 23 sanctioned posts, of which only two have been filled up. With a student strength of 750, the college largely depends on its 19 guest faculty members for course completion. Government College of Science, Education and Research, JagraonThe Government College of Science Education and Research, Jagraon, was started to provide science education up to postgraduate-level. The college was established in 1968 and provides science education to meritorious rural and semi-urban youth. The college has 39 posts of regular faculty but only three teachers on these posts. There are three part-timers too while the rest are guest faculty.Why recruitment was stopped During the tenure of former Punjab Public Service Commission chairman Ravi Inder Singh Sidhu, who was arrested by the vigilance bureau for corruption in recruitments in 2002, the personnel department had cancelled the selection of college lecturers through a notification on May 16, 2003. The move was challenged by 69 selected candidates who filed different writ petitions in the Punjab and Haryana high court (HC). In reply, the HC had imposed a stay on the recruitment of regular lecturers in 2003 and directed the state to first decide the fate of petitioners. The education department then started hiring guest faculty to conduct the classes. In June this year, the court gave its judgment, and found the 61college lecturers eligible. The stay on recruitments was also removed. Barjinder Singh Tohra, president of government college teachers’ association, Punjab, said, “We have been seeking the filling up of the posts for a long time now. But the higher education department hasn’t done anything.

And now it has come up with a new scheme -- offer VIP status to rural customers in whose area the feeder line loss is below 15%.As per the instructions given by state energy minister Srikant Sharma, these consumers will get round-the-clock power supply and complaints about will be redressed on priority. Line losses are of two kinds -- technical losses (because of materials) and non-technical losses (power theft, metering inaccuracies, dues default etc). At present, the Noida zone is reporting 19% line loss as a whole, which is even greater than 30% in some areas. The state government has given a target to reduce this to 15%.PVVNL (Noida zone) chief engineer Virendra Nath Singh said that despite several awareness drives, defaulters had so far given a cold response in clearing their outstanding electricity dues. “Since the rural consumers are enthusiastic in getting VIP status for them, it might prove effective in bringing down the line loss. Some of these areas are also prone to power theft, which is energy delivered to customers that is not measured by the energy meter for the customer. Customers also tamper the meter,” he said. The scheme could benefit 117,000 of the overall 323,000 consumers linked with PVVNL. The chief engineer also said that at present Noida has 25,378 defaulters, who are having outstanding individual electricity dues up to ₹50,000. “The total outstanding dues on them are approximately ₹33.74 crore. Our officials have also contacted the village heads and local leaders, to encourage them for clearing their power dues. In November last year, we had also appealed the clergies of temples and mosques of those areas to inspire the defaulters to clear their dues, so as to ensure uninterrupted power supply. However, despite assurances given by the religious and political leaders concerned, those publicity drives failed to yield any positive output,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/to-come-out-of-line-loss-discom-now-offers-vip-status-to-rural-consumers/story-f1aiVJq0SRkyFS4Uh0vBaM.html
23-11-2020||Noida||Dhanauri documentary to be screened at national science film festival||Noida: The 10th national science film festival, that will be showcased online from Tuesday, will also have a documentary on Dhanauri Wetland situated in Gautam Budh Nagar district. The 37-minute film by Noida-based birder Anand Arya titled Dhanauri Wetland as Ramsar site and Sarus Sanctuarywill be shown on the first day. The film highlights the importance of conserving the wetland and urges government to declare it a sanctuary for the sarus crane and part of the Ramsar convention that recognises wetlands for conservation. “I had been highlighting the matter to speed up the process of conserving Dhanauri for several years and the documentary is a step in that direction. I hope that the government and the concerned authorities will speed up the process of officially recognising the wetland and further declaring it as protected site,” said Arya. The festival is being organised by Vigyan Prasar, department of science and technology in collaboration with Tripura State Council for Science & Technology, Govternment of Tripura. The festival will screen 117 films online on Vigyan Bharti’s YouTube and Facebook channels between November 24 and 27. Situated in Greater Noida, the 101 hectare Dhanauri is home to over 50,000 birds of 222 species and is also one of the biggest habitat of the Sarus crane in the region. “Of the birds, 99 are migratory and 123 are resident. As many as 18 species are either vulnerable, endangered or near threatened, including Sarus crane, Egyptian vulture, panted stork, black necked stork and imperial eagle to count a few. The wetland is needs conservation and that would begin with forest department first recognising it as a protected site,” said Arya. In 2018, the district forest department first sent its proposal to declare the waterbody as a wetland under Wetland Rules 2017, the government has initiated the process of declaring it a Ramsar site and appointed a nodal officer to the task. In September 2020, the officials from Wetland International and state forest department on Monday begun ground inspection and terrain analysis to make a case for the wetland to be declared as a Ramsar site and a Sarus crane sanctuary. “The site is a wetland as per the definition and the groundwork to officially declare it as a protected site had already started. We are speeding up the process of it to be declared as Ramsar site as well,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, and nodal officer appointed by the state government to initiate legal processes. Ramsar sites are the wetlands of International importance. India is a signatory to the Ramsar Convention held in 1971 in Iran that seeks to recognise and protect the important wetlands of the world. India has a total of 41 Ramsar sites, including Narora in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/dhanauri-documentary-to-be-screened-at-national-science-film-festival/story-1YiiAMAy0dhPR7aknTHSNN.html

We have finalised the land for the police offices and residences for future requirements of this area,” said the police commissioner.On October 30, 2020 the Yeida has sent a proposal to the Uttar Pradesh government for six new police stations and other facilities in view of the upcoming multiple projects in the area. The new police stations are to be built in sectors 18, 20, 22D, 25A, 29 and Dayanatpur, said Yeida and police officers, where police residences will be built as well.“We will prepare the estimate to approve budgets for these projects. Subsequently, we will present the budget in our upcoming board meeting for approvals. We will start work at the site in the next two months’ time and these stations will be ready by the end of 2021. We needed police stations for our new residential areas meant for farmers, allottees, the airport, Film City and industrial sectors,” said the CEO of the authority, which will fund and build these stations along the 165km Yamuna Expressway that connects Greater Noida with Agra.The Uttar Pradesh government has directed the Yeida and the police to build facilities and upgrade the policing apparatus before the airport at Jewar is developed by 2023-24, said officials. Swiss firm Zurich International AG, the concessionaire, is likely to start work at the site by mid-2021.Following demands from Jewar MLA Dhirendra Singh, one police station has been approved in Sector 25A, where residential plots have been allotted to farmers whose land was acquired for projects.“We need to focus on development in a manner so that services can be delivered to all sections, be it farmers, investors or allottees, who want to build houses along the Yamuna Expressway,” said Dhirendra Singh MLA, Jewar, who accompanied the officials during the inspection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/land-identified-for-new-police-stations-police-residences-near-jewar-airport/story-R4b8tQ4CA7kEMOkFpe2R9M.html
23-11-2020||Noida||Noida’s air quality slips in very-poor category, may worsen further||The air quality of Noida and adjoining regions slipped into very-poor category on Monday as calm winds kept pollutants suspended in the air. Weather analysts believe that the pollution levels may spike over the next two days. The city had been reeling under ‘poor’ category air quality over last three days despite good wind speed. On Monday, the weather analysts said that the wind directions did not change from northwesterly to easterly as expected, however their speed dropped leading to a spike in pollution levels. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind speed will remain calm over next two days leading to increase in the pollution levels. “The wind speed on Monday was around 6 kmph during the morning which went down almost nil towards the evening. Due to the low wind speed, the ventilation was poor and the pollution levels increased. This situation of may prevail for the next two days and lead to even worse air quality,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. He added that the maximum temperature may however rise slightly by 3°C. On Monday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 6.3°C, against 6.7 °C a day earlier, qualifying for a cold-wave as the temperatures were 5 °C lesser than the season’s minimum. The maximum temperature was recorded at 26.2 °C against 24.2 °C a day earlier. Tuesday may see a minimum temperature of 7 °C which may spike to 9 °C by Wednesday. According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Monday was 301 or ‘very-poor’ against 273 or ‘poor’ a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 286 against 270 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 365 against 288 a day earlier. The AQI between 201 and 300 is ‘poor’, and between 301 and 400 is considered ‘very-poor’. The pollution mass also increased slightly with PM2.5 for past 24-hours in Noida recorded at 156.02 microgrammes per cubic against 135.90 microgrammes per cubic metres (μg/m³) a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 147.5 μg/m³ against 132.49 μg/m³ a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 μg/m³. According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is likely to drop further. “The AQI is likely to deteriorate towards the high end of Very Poor by tomorrow and likely stay at the high end of Very Poor on 25th November and may reach Severe in few locations for short period. This scenario is valid if prevailing low fire counts remain but if counts increase then it may further deteriorate. Marginal improvement is expected by 26th November,” said the SAFAR statement on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-air-quality-slips-in-very-poor-category-may-worsen-further/story-zz4gF8ZjZPSXkGPQrtN2SK.html
23-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad most polluted city across country; local pollutants, traffic responsible, say experts||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad city on Monday, with an air quality index (AQI) of 365, under “very poor” category, topped the list of the most polluted cities in the country. The records of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) indicate that the city, in the last winter season during January, February and March earlier this year, had topped the list 15 times.Meanwhile, this season, the city has seen “severe” category pollution levels on at least eight occasions since September. According to the forecast by private agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the contribution of stubble-burning to the national Capital’s particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels stood low at 6%. According to environmentalists, if a city tops the list of most polluted cities but levels of pollutants are in the lower ranges, it indicates that the local pollutants come into play.“When the AQI is “severe”, the burden is on stubble burning. However, if the city is the most polluted in the country despite the contribution of stubble burning being lower, then local pollutants are responsible. There are hardly any effective measures to control road dust, while traffic snarls are rampant everywhere. It is the local pollutants which are affecting the AQI at present and there is hardly any enforcement,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. According to the CPCB’s records, the city topped the most polluted list at least six times in January – on January 4, 5, 6, 10, 21 and 27 – and eight days in February – on February 2, 3, 4, 10, 25, 26 and 27.In March, the city topped the list two times – on March 2 and 8.On all the 15 occasions in the three months mentioned above, the city topped the list even though AQI was under “poor” or “very poor” categories. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.” “This is the first time this season that Ghaziabad has topped the list. Since November 21 evening, the AQI levels have been high due to increase in traffic since then, and this contributed to the PM2.5 levels. As a result of traffic, issues of road dust also came into play, which increased PM10 levels,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the Uttar Pradesh pollution control board. The CPCB’s bulletin said that the primary contributor to Ghaziabad’s AQI is PM2.5. PM2.5 and PM10 levels need computation for past 24 hours as they have to be averaged for all the four monitoring stations of Ghaziabad.“Our Indirapuram and Vasundhara stations are also not relaying data to CPCB since Monday afternoon. Due to this, the exact data could not be computed. Further, there is construction work going on in Loni which has also affected the overall AQI. The two stations of Loni and Sanjay Nagar are in higher levels of “very poor” category. So, overall air quality is affected,” he added. The situation had also prevailed in winter season of 2019, when the city had topped the list of the most polluted city on several occasions, including October 16 and 24, and from October 27 to 31, barring October 28, and again on November 2, 14, 15, 19, 20 and 21 as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-most-polluted-city-across-country-local-pollutants-traffic-responsible-say-experts/story-xgz6vLMPyG19OAlqoMVOKL.html

As per the waste management rules-2016, “bulk waste generators” are housing complexes and other buildings built on at least 5,000 square metres or that produces 100 kg waste daily, and need to treat it at their premises. “We have started crackdown against the bulk waste generators under our campaign to make sure all adheres to rules when it comes to waste treatment. The action will continue against those, who found violating the rules. Our teams will conduct inspections in each sector, both commercial as well as industrial,” said Indu Prakash Singh officer on special duty of the Noida authority.This is the first action against the bulk waste generators under the authority’s drive started ahead of 2020-21 Swachhta survey. The authority wants to improve on all fronts of sanitation so that it can perform better in the cleanliness index, said officials.“We informed shopkeepers about the need of following the waste management rules and warned them of penalty during the next inspection. We will carry out random inspections,” said Singh.Singh, assistant project engineer Gaurav Bansal and supervisor Satya Prakash were part of the team that carried out inspection and imposed penalty. “As of now we are taking action against only the bulk waste generators because their compliance is crucial in improving the waste management system. We have not fixed any date but soon we will start imposing penalty against individuals who are found flouting rules too. Our objective is that Noida should adhere to rules and handles all kinds of waste as per rules,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/crackdown-against-bulk-waste-generators-begins-in-noida/story-nNNnsbXvF8yVlRcq9mJtSJ.html

23-11-2020||Noida||NHAI starts process of deciding toll charges at Delhi-Meerut Expressway||Ghaziabad: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has started the process of ascertaining toll charges on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway (DME), which is planned to be completed by the end of December. NHAI officials said they have sent a proposal to their headquarters according to which the per kilometre cost for plying on expressway lanes will be about Rs 2. They have also proposed to bar the entry of bikes and autos on the expressway lanes. Work on the two under-construction stretches of the DME project -- 19.8km phase 2 from UP Gate to Dasna and 32km phase 4 from Dasna to Meerut -- is scheduled to be completed by end of December. Phase 1 from Akshardham in Delhi to UP Gate is already operational. “We have sent a proposal to our headquarters and proposed the rate at about Rs 2 per kilometre. It includes Rs 1.65 as basic rate. Other costs are based on price index and cost of structures. So, it will be about Rs 2 per kilometre. The rates will be determined on per kilometre of distance travelled and will be paid at the exit points,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. Apart from phase 2 and 4, DME also comprises 8.7km of phase 1, which spans from Akshardham in Delhi to UP Gate. The entry/exit points are located at Akshardham, Indirapuram, near Dasna, eastern peripheral expressway, near Bhojpur and near Partapur in Meerut. Once approved, the rates will come into effect after the project starts operation. The officials had earlier sent a proposal for the installation of automatic registration-plate readers (ANPR) at entry/exit points and the plan has already been approved. The ANPRs will read the registration plate of vehicles at entry and exit points and will calculate the distance travelled. The fare will be automatically detected at the exit point from the online wallet of the commuter. The project comprises three inner lanes each side as dedicated expressway lanes and four lanes each on both sides as highway lanes. “We had earlier sent a proposal for limiting the speed on expressway to 120kmph but there were certain issues with regard to high speed, which could result in accidents. So, during the trial period, the vehicles will maintain a speed limit of 70kmph in Delhi, 100kmph under phase 2 in Ghaziabad and 120kmph under phase 4 between Dasna and Meerut. No autos or bikes will be allowed on expressway lanes,” Garg, said. The officials said vehicles such as cars, jeeps and commercial vehicles will be allowed on expressway lanes while autos have been advised to ply only on services lanes and not on highway lanes to avoid traffic congestion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/nhai-starts-process-of-deciding-toll-charges-at-delhi-meerut-expressway/story-7HKthCofhtdUzrxW4YdqGL.html
23-11-2020||Noida||Change in covid strategy needed for rising cases in five Ghaziabad hotspots, say experts||Ghaziabad: The residential segments of Indirapuram, Carte, Sahibabad-II, Raj Nagar and Vaishali have emerged as the top five major contributors to the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in Ghaziabad district, as per mapping done on directions of the Uttar Pradesh government for focussed surveillance. Experts said that a different strategy needs to be chalked out for such areas as their contribution to case tally is on the rise. According to the mapping done over from November 11 to November 20, the health department has found that residential segments of Indirapuram, Carte (comprising localities like Kavi Nagar, Avantika, Nehru Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Chiranjeev Vihar, among others), Sahibabad-II (Raj Bagh, Shalimar Garden, Rajendra Nagar and Lajpat Nagar among others), Raj Nagar and Vaishali occupy the top five spots in the list of areas having highest number of cases during the given period. The five segments contribute about 56.82% share of the 1,260 Covid-19 cases which came up during the 10 days’ surveillance period.Of the five, Indirapuram and Sahibabad-II have remained among the top five since June, while Indirapuram, Carte and Raj Nagar were in the top five in July, August, September and October. Experts said that to tackle the recurrence of cases in such areas a shift in strategy is needed, as it seems that present efforts have not yielded effective results. “If such areas are emerging as the top contributors then we must take strict containment. This would mean that areas of clusters or specific areas where cases have emerged need to be contained or shut down for effective surveillance and testing. If some areas are yielding the highest number of cases, then there seems to be gaps in strategy and needs review,” said Dr Ashish Agrawal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “Such areas generally have a common source of infection, which could also include service-providers or vendors in markets. So, there has to be effective surveillance and testing. Surveillance will also bring to notice if anyone is hiding his/her health conditions,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). The government directions said that if within 24 hours three houses within a radius of 50 metres of each other, have one or more positive case each, then the entire area that falls under the radius will be identified as a cluster and a minimum of 100 houses in each such cluster will be subjected to focussed surveillance.If there is only a single house within 50 metres that has a confirmed case, then the focussed surveillance will be extended to 50 houses around it. The government has not specified conditions for two houses with a Covid-19 positive patient. Apart from houses, officials have also been directed to take up surveillance in nearby markets, shops, ration shops and milk booths, among others. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said he is working on a strategy to conduct surveillance and testing together. “We feel that surveillance and testing together will prove effective rather than telling suspected persons to walk to the nearest testing centre to get tested. Further, rapid response teams which go to houses of home-isolated patients will now be accompanying lab technicians who will get contacts tested there and then,” Pandey said. “Further, we are also planning to get some corporate social responsibility funds for getting more rapid antigen kits so that testing can be double the present capacity. The areas (with highest cases) are majorly having working class populations which also get affected by cross-border infection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/change-in-covid-strategy-needed-for-rising-cases-in-five-ghaziabad-hotspots-say-experts/story-HVoEENr4C0CvUYtUvbQmzI.html
23-11-2020||City||AAP alleges “loot” in property tax, BJP rejects charge as baseless||New Delhi: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday alleged that the North Delhi Municipal Corporation doesn’t maintain any account related to property tax. Party chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said the civic body was supposed to collect Rs 2,838 crore in property tax but it has got only Rs 1,703 crore. The BJP dismissed the allegations as baseless.“The biggest betrayal by the BJP-ruled North MCD is that they do not maintain any proper documentation regarding the collection of property tax. The local MCD officials decide about the property tax collection from an individual establishment. The BJP-ruled MCD officials can change the use of the property, which means if a property is rented then they can show that it is not rented. If the property is vacant then they can show that it is being used for commercial purposes. In 2002, the BJP-ruled MCD decided that a survey will take place of all these properties (to check if the property is empty or being used) but nothing happened,” he said at a press conference.Bharadwaj added that in the absence of a survey, the loss of revenue on account of property tax cannot be assessed. “They have never maintained any kind of assessment books…The AAP demands that BJP leaders of Delhi should come clean about such incidents and tell the people of Delhi the reality behind such massive corruption,” he said.Responding to AAP’s allegations, Delhi BJP general secretary Harsh Malhotra said that since 2004, the self assessment scheme is being followed for property tax evaluation by civic bodies. “People file their own assessments and pay tax as per applicable category and rates. MCDs do random check on some 10% returns. It is possible that a small section of tax payers might be misusing the method but by and large the self assessment scheme has given people freedom from the Inspector Raj. The AAP has been constantly raising baseless allegations of misappropriation of property tax, demanding service of notices to assessees. Does AAP want revival of Inspector Raj in MCDs property tax departments?” Malhotra asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-alleges-loot-in-property-tax-bjp-rejects-charge-as-baseless/story-Nsv3VlkNiwn5hsZFmCo5XP.html

Her parents said her stress had worsened after the college asked around 150 students to vacate the hostel.The notice to vacate -- it was later withdrawn as a one-time measure in view of Covid-19 pandemic -- was based on a policy introduced last year which limited hostel facilities to first-year undergraduate students from 2019 onwards to implement the reservations for students from other backward classes (OBC) and economically weaker section (EWS).Due to the Covid-19 lockdown, the family was in great financial distress as the student’s father, a motorcycle repairman, was out of work and so was her mother, a tailor. The deceased student was struggling to adapt to online education as she did not have any laptop and had to follow her classes on her phone, parents said.Her mother told HT, “The college principal had called us, asking how much money we would needed to tide over our financial crisis. We don’t know much details but we have received around ₹2.5 lakh from the college so far. We will use this money to pay off our debts.”Despite repeated requests, LSR principal Suman Sharma did not comment on the matter. However, officials from the college, requesting anonymity, told HT that till November 13, over ₹3 lakh was contributed towards the deceased student’s family fund and the amount was raised by over 80 faculty members.The parents said they had mortgaged their house and pawned gold ornaments in order to support their elder daughter’s education at LSR, along with discontinuing the education of their 16-year-old younger daughter.“As soon as the pandemic subsides and the schools reopen, we will try to get our younger daughter enrolled into a school. Right now, she is too traumatised by the death of her sister. Despite our hand-to-mouth existence, we tried to provide our eldest daughter with an education and yet could not save her,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lsr-teachers-raise-2-5-lakh-to-help-dead-student-s-family/story-1g16FxLCfvMbOJ36O7GijL.html
23-11-2020||City||SC confirms bail to Delhi riots accused||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a petition filed by the Delhi Police, challenging the grant of bail to one of the accused in the conspiracy behind the north east Delhi riots that led to 53 deaths in February this year.The accused, Faizan Khan was released on bail by the Delhi High Court on October 23 after the court found no ground to directly link him with the commission of offence. Khan was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in March this year and was accused of arranging SIM card for a co-accused Asif Iqbal Tanha. According to the police, this number was used to communicate messages by students of the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), who too were charged for instigating the February riots in protest to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) passed by Parliament in December last year.Khan had been named in a supplementary charge sheet, along with former Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam, filed by the special cell of the Delhi Police on Sunday. Dealing with the Delhi Police’s appeal, a three-judge bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah said, “The special leave petition is dismissed.”Additional Solicitor General (ASG) SV Raju told the bench that observations made by the high court should not influence the trial in the case. The bench went on to state, “We make it clear that observations made by the high court in the impugned judgment are only for the purpose of granting the bail and shall not be treated any expression of opinion during trial.”The HC had observed, “For invoking the UAPA against the present petitioner, it is the duty of the investigating agency to demonstrate that the petitioner had ‘actual knowledge’ that the said SIM card would be used for organizing the protests.” It was imperative for the investigation agency to demonstrate that the petitioner had “active knowledge” about the utilization of the said SIM card. It is not alleged that the petitioner was party to any such conspiracy to organize protests. Since the SIM card was provided in December 2019 while the violence erupted in February 2020, the HC noted, “There is no proximate nexus between the aforesaid alleged incidents nor is it alleged that the said SIM card was provided, on the pretext or with the intention/objective, to be utilized for organizing protests.” Khan was released on bail on payment of Rs 25000 bail bond and one surety of the like amount. He was directed not to tamper with evidence or influence any witnesses in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-confirms-bail-to-delhi-riots-accused/story-bzdur8V6NCDx6QE3XBfYLO.html
23-11-2020||Chandigarh||GMCH admissions: HC dismisses plea seeking change in criterion for NRI category||The Punjab and Haryana high court has dismissed a plea seeking changes in the criterion for admissions to MBBS course under the NRI category at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32. The plea was filed by one candidate, Aanchal Setia, who had demanded that the first-degree relatives of NRIs be made eligible for the NRI-category seats offered by the institute. Detailed order is awaited. The petitioner had brought before the court the contradiction in the eligibility criteria laid down in prospectus by the college stating that for admission to MBBS/BDS courses for students under the NRI category, Harvansh Singh Judge Dental College, Panjab University, has expanded the scope of the definition to include first-degree NRI relatives, like uncles and aunts of the candidate, but GMCH excludes them. GMCH limits the criterion for candidates who resided in a foreign country for a certain period or have their parents or grandparents residing in other nations, it was stated. As both the institutes are affiliated to PU, there can’t be two different sets of rules for admissions to the same course, she had argued. The plea was filed last week. The college has 150 MBBS seats, of which 115 are under the UT quota. Off the remaining, 23 are under the all-India quota, three under the central pool, and nine under the NRI quota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gmch-admissions-hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-change-in-criterion-for-nri-category/story-FqojJ1jx0slWzbS90tkiSK.html
23-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC plans to run gyms at community centres on PPP mode||Having failed to run gyms in community centres for years, the Chandigarh municipal corporation is now all set rope in private firms to operate and maintain these facilities across the city. Under this public private partnership (PPP) plan, “the gyms will be run more professionally, while at the same time, the civic body can generate additional revenue,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav, adding that the firm will operate and maintain the facility and share revenue with the MC on pre-decided termsThe agenda will be tabled before the MC General House for approval on November 27. “After the approval, expression of interest will be called and other modalities will also be set for revenue sharing and fees to be charged from residents,” said Yadav. Of 42 community centres under the MC, 28 have gyms, which were constructed at a cost ranging from ₹7 lakh to ₹25 lakh depending on the equipment installed. Making facilities relevant for residentsAt present, there is no uniform policy for running of the gyms. In some community centres, the executive committees of area residents have been formed for the purpose, while other ones are without such committees.The older community centres, such as the one in Sector 8, have gyms with rudimentary equipment, and are seldom used by the locals because of poor quality. The recently constructed ones have modern gyms with high-tech equipment, but are still underutilised. Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation, said, “We have been repeatedly requesting the MC and councillors to make the gyms functional, but no positive action has been forthcoming. Some of these gyms have the latest equipment, but are still lying defunct.” One of the reasons is that there are no trainers appointed in these gyms. Under the proposed PPP model, the firm will also provide the trainers. MC to cap fee charged from usersEven as gyms fail to generate any revenue or become self-sustaining, the MC is bearing the cost for the maintenance. It was the revenue augmentation committee of the MC that had recommended the PPP model, while also suggesting ways to ensure that the fee charged by private firms doesn’t pinch the residents’ pocket. Councillor Maheshinder Singh Sidhu, who is a member of the committee, said: “The hired firm will be allowed to charge the same fee as being collected by executive committees currently. For people from outside the sector, the firm can be allowed to charge higher fee.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-plans-to-run-gyms-at-community-centres-on-ppp-mode/story-ZYQQmT3JCcvouny9KnhrZN.html

23-11-2020||Gurugram||Special police teams formed to crack down on illegal mining in Tauru belt||The special enforcement team of Haryana Police has deployed 20 more personnel on stretches connecting Tauru to crack down on illegal mining activities in the Aravallis, said the police on Monday. According to the police, the move was taken after an attack on police teams on Saturday night after they had tried to intercept a loaded dumper carrying illegally mined stones near Bilaspur. The hawkers and tea stall owners, who are stationed on the roadside on the stretches connecting to Tauru and nearby villages, have also been asked to alert police in case they find any dumper movement on the road. The police said as many as 300 people would be keeping an eye on the movement of illegal dumpers as they had only 25 personnel for South Haryana. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that since December 2019, they have deployed teams in the Aravalli belt to control illegal mining but the number of cases are rapidly increasing. “On an average, three to four dumpers laden with crushed stones are spotted every day. Despite regular checking, they manage to flee with the help of locals. We have roped in hawkers and people working on roadside eateries to alert us in case they find any dumper moving on any stretch,” he said. Sangwan said that some locals in nearby villages of Nuh and Tauru are involved in illegal mining. The illegal miners have also hired drivers and trained them in dodging police teams. “The drivers often pelt stones and damage police vehicles so that they cannot chase them. The drivers are familiar with all the stretches of the area and have several hideouts in the outskirts of the villages. Many of the drivers arrested have criminal records and are involved in illegal activities for the last few years,” he said. The police said there are five villages in the Tauru belt which are under the scanner. The teams deployed in the area said there are a few families that have trained even women and children on how to surround police teams during raids.Sangwan said locals, including women, block the road and lie down with children to stop police from entering the village. They have 25 teams deployed in 14 districts that are monitoring these illegal mining activities in South Haryana. The state has collected a total fine of ₹57.50 crore since December 2019. A total of 2,744 vehicles, including tippers, trucks, tractor-trolleys, and earthmovers, have been seized by the police between December 2019 and November 23, 2020. This number also includes 425 vehicles seized in November— the highest so far. The police added that during the course of the anti-mining operations, several police officers have been attacked by truck drivers carrying illegal material and more than 50 police vehicles have been damaged. Over four dozen cases of attempted murder have been registered against such drivers over the last six months, said the police. The police said illegal mining operations have been taking place in the Aravallis for over two decades. In November 2019, IPS officer Amitabh Singh Dhillon, who is also the director-general of mines and geology department of Haryana, had put together a special enforcement team to crack down on illegal mining operations in the Aravallis. The state was divided into two parts and two police officials were given charge of each. While assistant commissioner of police(ACP) Rajesh Phogat has been given the charge of the Sonepat region, ACP Sangwan is in charge of curbing illegal mining in Gurugram and Nuh. The National Green Tribunal(NGT) in 2019 had ordered that all confiscated vehicles will be released only after recovery of at least 50% of the showroom value of such vehicles. “Besides, the confiscated vehicle owner will also have to pay a royalty fee, the value of the mineral loaded on the vehicles, along with ₹10,000 fine before the vehicle can be released,” said Sangwan, adding that the state has been suffering severe revenue losses because of the illegal mining activity in the Aravallis for the last several years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/special-police-teams-formed-to-crack-down-on-illegal-mining-in-tauru-belt/story-f9hAWfoGWAzsarVJHQUrnI.html
23-11-2020||Gurugram||Portion of Dadri-Rewari freight corridor collapses near Sohna||A portion of an under-construction freight rail corridor from Dadri to Rewari collapsed on Monday morning at Atta-Rampur village near Sohna. The impact of the crash was such that the launcher used to install concrete spans between pillars was badly damaged. A driver of a Bolero jeep, who worked at the construction site, had a narrow escape as he managed to jump to the passenger seat as pieces of equipment crashed on his vehicle parked near the spot. The incident happened around 11.30am, when the section between piers 60 and 63 of the freight corridor collapsed. Sunil Kumar, the driver, who barely managed to escape, said he was badly shaken even several hours after the collapse. “There were only few workers at the site and the crash happened so suddenly that no one got time to react. I saw the launcher coming down and even started the jeep. However, instead of driving, I was able to jump only to the passenger side on the left and saved myself,” said Kumar, a resident of Faridabad, who suffered minor scratches. Project officials said that the accident was serious and they would thoroughly probe the incident to prevent a repeat. On August 22 this year, a similar incident took place on Sohna Road when a portion of the concrete span of the Sohna elevated road collapsed near Vipul Greens condominium, following which the NHAI had stopped construction work on the elevated road project. At Monday’s accident site, the launcher, which is used to install concrete spans between piers, had fallen from a height of around 50 to 60 feet and it affected around 150 metres stretch between the four pillars. Apart from the equipment damage, top portions of the two concrete pillars were also damaged.The Rewari-Dadri stretch of elevated freight corridor is part of the double line broad gauge freight corridor being developed by Indian Railways, through its subsidiary Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India Ltd (DFCCIL). The 1483-km-long corridor starts from Dadri near Uttar Pradesh and concludes at Navi Mumbai in Maharashtra. The 141-km Rewari-Dadri stretch is part of the corridor and is being constructed by a consortium led by infrastructure major Larson & Toubro (L& T). A team from L&T took stock of the situation and rescue work to remove the damaged equipment from the spot was carried out. A senior official of L&T said that the incident happened around 11.30 am, but there were not many workers at the crash site. “We have launched spans all along the corridor and near the Atta-Rampur road we took special precaution and work was carried out safely. A committee will be formed to probe the matter. Right now it is not possible to say whether the reason was mechanical fault, a design failure or a human error,” he said on the condition of anonymity. The workers on the site said that a team from Nuh Police also visited the spot to take stock of the situation. The DFCCIL, which is developing the freight corridor, said that they will seek a report from contractor in this matter. “The matter will be probed and reasons behind the accident will be investigated,” said Ved Prakash, general manager, safety and operations, DFCCIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/portion-of-dadri-rewari-freight-corridor-collapses-near-sohna/story-BYuWleS0477OvGWGkU6KTJ.html
23-11-2020||Gurugram||West and east Gurugram fare worst in mask discipline, shows data||As Covid-19 cases continue to surge in the city, data compiled by the Gurugram Police shows that west and east police zones in the city are witnessing the maximum number of violations in mask discipline based on the enforcement challans issued between June and November this year. The findings also show that south and Manesar police zones reported the least number of violations as the areas in these zones continue to see a surge in cases. According to the data compiled till November 20, at least 47,055 people were fined for not wearing the masks in the police’s west zone, which includes mostly old Gurugram areas such as old bus stand near Sadar Bazar, old DLF Colony, Rajiv Nagar, Sector 12, 12 A, 14,15 and Rajiv Chowk. Close on heels, comes the east zone, which reported 12,426 challans. It includes areas such as Sushant Lok Phase 1 (Block A and B), sectors 27, 28, areas near Galleria market, Cross Point Mall, MG Road, Saraswati Vihar, Maruti Vihar and Chakkarpur and Chanderlok. Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police (headquarters), who recently visited parts of old Gurugram to check mask enforcement, said, “We have our teams patrolling in congested areas. People are taking mask- wearing very callously. People are seen removing their masks while coughing even if they are sitting in a group. Elderly say that they feel suffocated while wearing masks. Enforcement becomes challenging in such situations,” said Kundu.Experts say that wearing masks is crucial in containing the infection as symptoms only appear after four to five days of getting infected. It is likely that during this period, patients might not develop usual symptoms of cough, fever or difficulty in breathing, but can still spread the infection to others. A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine in June found that Covid-19 can also be spread by those who have a very mild disease and do not show any symptoms. Studies show that mask can reduce the growth rate of coronavirus infection by 40%. Going by the health department data, some of these areas have noted a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Police department’s east zone areas, which fall under Chanderlok Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHCs), has shown a consistent upward trend in cases from July onwards. Even areas like Rajiv Nagar (west zone) are among the worst-affected areas for a few months now. Nonetheless, residents in these areas are having lackadaisical approach in wearing face masks, said the police.South police zone, which has Badhshahpur, Fajilpur and Hasanpur, among other areas, have also been reporting a surge. However, only 3,365 people were issued challans in these areas — the least in the district. Even in Manesar, only 9,681 cases of challans have been registered. Overall, at least 89,582 challans in violation of Covid-19 guidelines have been issued by the police department between June 9 and November 20. Cumulatively, the department has collected nearly ₹4.47 crore till now. The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), which has also been assigned the task of imposing fines for mask violations, has collected a fine of over ₹13 lakh till October, as per the data available with the state government. “Nearly 1,300 challans are issued every day for violating mask discipline. Gurugram Police have penalised nearly 22,817 violators in November for not wearing face masks,” said KK Rao, commissioner of police. “Strict directives have been issued to station house officers to identify congested areas in their jurisdiction. Recorded messages on mask discipline will be announced through loudspeakers in these areas,” said Rao. Although Delhi has increased the challan amount from ₹500 to ₹2,000, Rao said that the department has not received any directive till now for Gurugram.The department has also formed 40 teams, comprising 1,600 police personnel, who have been directed to visit parks, banquet halls, restaurants and hotels, where small-scale gatherings are being organised. Rao said, “Weddings season will also begin now. Area-wise SHOs have directed to keep an eye on functions and social gatherings. Guests found without masks will be penalised on the spot,” said Rao. Police teams are also deployed at all the 11 borders connecting Gurugram to the national Capital. Out of the total violations, at least 16,755 were penalised for not wearing face masks while sitting in their cars. The police said that people who are driving alone were exempted.“Be it someone in a car, a two-wheeler or a bicycle, people are being challaned,” said Rao. When HT visited a police post near Signature Tower, it found that people in four- and two-wheelers were stopped to pay the fine. In some areas, labourers without masks were not challaned as they did not have enough money to pay ₹500. “For poor people, who cannot afford mask and the challan money, the department is providing cotton masks,” said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/west-and-east-gurugram-fare-worst-in-mask-discipline-shows-data/story-PxBvnEOY9UvpQ3Pt6iht1M.html
23-11-2020||Gurugram||Mobile app for Covid-related information launched||The district administration on Monday launched a mobile application and a web portal for information related to Covid-19. The application, known as Gurugram Covid Combat Companion (GC3), will provide real-time information related to Covid-19 testing collection centres in the city, testing charges and availability of hospital beds, among other information. Rajeev Ranjan, divisional commissioner, who launched the application from his office at Civil Lines, said, “Real-time data on all Covid-related issues will be available on the portal and the mobile application. Information regarding testing and new cases will be directly uploaded from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal, based on which different departments like health, police, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and Ayush can work simultaneously.”The portal shares almost similar details available on the existing oneMap Gurugram application developed by Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) during the initial months of the pandemic. In a statement issued by the district administration, Ranjan said, “The data of the positive patients will be uploaded every hour. The application can also work in areas having lower internet bandwidth and connectivity.” Ranjan advised people to maintain mask discipline and respiratory hygiene to keep Covid-19 infection at bay. He said that citizens should not move out of their homes unless it is important as it would help in tackling the transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mobile-app-for-covid-related-information-launched/story-7PjUWeySTmbByNDRLgw3KM.html
23-11-2020||Gurugram||Cops contact US Embassy over traveller who forged Covid-19 test result||The police has contacted the US Embassy to share the report and the name of a person who got his Covid-19 test results forged to travel to the US along with his wife on November 18. The instance of forged results came under the police scanner after it busted a fake pathology lab at Sainikhera village in Sector 30 three days ago and arrested two persons.The police said the man had travelled to the US on a work visa and they are still trying to trace the couple’s address.Harish Budhiraja, inspector, chief minister’s flying squad, said, “They had to travel to the US on November 18. The man had tested positive but as his flight tickets were booked, he paid Rs3,000 for a forged report, which showed his result as negative.” The police had busted the lab after being tipped off by informers, who told them that at least 10 such reports were being forged every day.Inderjeet Yadav, deputy superintendent of police, Crime Investigation Department, said there is a nexus of people in the city who are fabricating Covid-19 test reports by charging extra money. “We arrested two suspects and recovered a mobile phone which had around 10 forged reports, including that of the couple who travelled to the US,” he said. Yadav said the report did not mention the address of the couple and that the Sector 40 police team is in touch with the US Embassy. The police have identified the accused who were running the lab as one Anirban Roy, of Kolkata, and Parimal Roy, of Murshidabad. The duo was residing in a rented accommodation in the village and was involved in this illegal practice for the last two months, said police. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that the suspects, during questioning, revealed that people also paid Rs 1,400 for forged positive reports to avail of leaves from work. “He has delivered more than 20 such reports and more are expected to surface during the investigation. We have seized the mobile phone of the suspect arrested and scanning all the reports. So far, 12 reports and four names of the lab providing false reports have surfaced. A Delhi lab is also under the scanner,” he said. The police teams are conducting technical surveillance to ascertain details about the flight boarded by the couple. The suspects were operating under the banner of ‘Medikartz Pathology Lab and Medical Tourism.’ The lab has claimed a tie-up with a diagnostics facility in Delhi, but could not furnish record of the same, said police. “We are also questioning staff of Delhi lab to get more details in the case and to know their role in partnering with this lab,” Rao said. A case under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 52 of the Disaster Management Act was registered at the Sector 40 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-contact-us-embassy-over-traveller-who-forged-covid-19-test-result/story-duaObsuoSM2xhnkFAWcVRM.html
23-11-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 case count past 45,000 in Gurugram||The district on Monday reported 866 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total tally to 45,072, according to the health department. Due to a faster-than-estimated spread of the virus, the district has already crossed the November-end projection of 43,000 cases with a week left. Since the beginning of November, over 15,000 new cases have been reported, of which 6,000 new infections were recorded in the last six days alone. As per the data, one in six persons who underwent the test has tested positive this month, which is double the October figures, as one in 12 persons tested positive. According to the World Health Organisation, the infection is considered to be under control only if one in more than 20 persons test positive.Of the total number of cases, 5,942 are active cases while 38,864 have recovered from the illness. The death toll stands at 266, with nearly 79% of deaths happening due to co-morbid conditions. At least 488 seriously-ill patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus are admitted to hospitals. Active cases and hospitalisation have been showing a consistent upward trajectory due to the 16% weekly test positivity rate. “The active transmission of Covid-19 can be controlled through increased testing, and thereby, identification of new cases and timely isolation. People should get themselves tested timely, instead of taking the disease lightly, as common flu,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner. In controlling the ongoing surge, where daily infections are fluctuating between 500-970, the health department on November 19 had ramped up the infrastructure to conduct 6,000 tests per day. On Monday, a total of 6,502 tests were administered, with 4,447 of them the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). On November 21, a record of 10,200 tests were administered in a day. In the last two weeks, at least 68, 542 tests have been administered, almost 30% higher than the cumulative numbers (47,902 tests) of the previous two weeks from October 27 to November 9. With this, the average daily positive cases have crossed 670, up from the 457 between October 24 and November 6). The overall test count has increased due to an increased share of the rapid antigen test, which increased to 17% last week from 14% in the first week of November. In September and October, the antigen testing rate was 28%. Due to a high chance of false-negative, experts suggest a minimum use of rapid antigen tests as it masks the true positivity rate of the area or city.As a part of the targeted testing, the health department is continuing with its camps. On Monday, a camp was held at Mini Secretariat, where employees and workers directly involved in public dealings were tested and 76 rapid antigen tests were conducted. Two had tested positive. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Testing will continue in different areas having increased footfall of the general public. The current focus is on timely identification of cases and their home isolation to prevent mortality from increasing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-case-count-past-45-000-in-gurugram/story-LZGZeJ5xMuxJFLKfpe2Q6J.html
23-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray gives nod for Rs1,600-crore desalination project for Mumbai||To tide over the shortage of drinking water faced by Mumbai, Maharashtra chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Monday gave a go-ahead to a desalination project with a capacity of 200 MLD (million litres per day). The ₹1,600-crore project to be set up on around 30 acres at Manori, Malad, is expected to be completed in four years if everything goes as per the plan.After tapping about six possible locations, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) finalised Manori. The plant will have the capacity to expand to 400 MLD in the future, which can make up for the shortfall of 10% (of the total water consumption of the city of 3,800 MLD) when there is poor rainfall.Also read: BMC revives plan to set up desalination plant for potable water“The detailed project report will be prepared in about nine months and will need another three months to complete the tendering process. The actual completion of the project will need about three more years. The site was finalised by our technical team as it has no mangrove around it, has good quality of water and is connected by roads, among other reasons. We also had tapped five other locations, including Versova, Gorai, Malad, among others,” said P Velrasu, additional civic commissioner, BMC.Thackeray said that the project will help in make up the shortfall of potable water in summer due to late arrival of monsoon or shortfall in expected water stock. “Many other countries have already set up such projects or are in the process of it. If operated on solar, the operational cost of the project will reduce significantly. We have government land available at the site and no habitat around it, making it suitable,” he said.The operational cost of the desalination plant is, however, higher than the dam-based water-supply projects and has been one of the reasons behind the delay to the project, which has been planned for years. The BMC expects it to be 50% more than its existing system of dam based water supply.Also read: Mumbai civic body’s desalination plant project: Why not focus on water conservation, ask experts “We expect it to be Rs30 per kilolitre against the existing cost for dam-based projects of Rs20 per kilolitre after using solar power for generation. Over a period of time, the cost will come down. The project will be operated on a need-base mechanism, like other countries such as Australia, during the period of the shortfall to keep the overall operation cost low. Another advantage of the project is that it is climate neutral,” Velrasu said.He said that the capital cost of the project was same as the dam-based projects. “The cost of 400 MLD Gargai dam project is Rs4,000 crore, whereas the 200MLD desalination project is costing us Rs1,600 crore,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-gives-nod-for-rs1-600-crore-desalination-project-for-mumbai/story-5K3TSNYlRYbZPUkMvLSV4O.html

23-11-2020||City||Passengers suffer as Punjab Roadways staff go on strike in Ludhiana||Passengers at the Ludhiana inter-state bus terminal (ISBT) were a harried lot on Monday, as the joint action committee of Punjab Roadways and PRTC contractual workers observed a strike for two hours to protest against private operators plying inter-state buses illegally. As the bus drivers and conductors protested from 10.30am to 12.30pm, hitting the movement of over 120 inter-state and inter-district buses, passengers were left at the mercy of private operators. PRTC and Punbus services came to a halt completely for two hours, as the protesters closed the gates of the bus stand, forcing private bus operators to provide their services from outside the premises. “My mother and I had to travel to Delhi and were forced to buy more expensive tickets through a private operator after waiting for over 90 minutes for the roadways bus to depart,” said Nitish, one of the affected passengers. Similarly, Gurpreet Singh, who was on his way to Moga, said when he reached the bus stand around 11am, he got to know about the strike and could not get a certain answer on when the buses will resume their services.The protesting contractual staff complained that the authorities, including the roadways and district transport departments, had failed to take action against the private transport mafia, even when unauthorised private buses remained parked right outside the bus stand. The protest was lifted after two hours following an assurance by the roadways and transport department officials of taking action against bus operators plying inter-state buses illegally.“The private bus operators have installed their counters right outside the bus stand and lure passengers even before they enter the ISBT. But the authorities have turned a blind eye to the issue, even when it is resulting in losses to the transport sector. We will organise a protest march from the ISBT to Bharat Nagar Chowk on December 2 if the authorities don’t act by then,” said Shamsher Singh, district president of Punbus Contractual Employees’ Union.Station supervisor Jasvir Singh said movement of over 120 buses was hit due to the protest. “The demands of the union are justified and we will recommend action to the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) office, as roadways cannot do anything about the buses parked outside the ISBT,” he added. Private bus headed to Delhi stoppedHigh drama was witnessed outside the bus stand after the protesters stopped a private bus headed to Delhi. While the union members slammed the authorities for taking no action against the bus operator, station supervisor Jasvir Singh said they had clicked pictures and will send their recommendations to the RTA office. Services to be hit again on November 26The joint action committee of the Punjab Roadways and PRTC contractual workers has also extended its support to the November 26 “Delhi Chalo” protest by farmers against the farm bills. Therefore, there will be no movement of buses on Thursday, said Jasvir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/passengers-suffer-as-punjab-roadways-staff-go-on-strike-in-ludhiana/story-FYDzGiUPjVzk98HxZWQwWP.html
23-11-2020||City||Notices, challans to south Delhi RWAs, residents for not separating waste at source||New Delhi: The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has issued more than 1,400 notices to resident welfare associations (RWAs) and fined 122 residents for not segregating dry, wet and hazardous household waste at source. The RWAs put on notice include Defence Colony, Panchsheel Park, Lajpat Nagar, Andrews Ganj, Gangotri Enclave, Hari Nagar, Janakpuri, Punjabi Bagh, Green Park Extension, South Extension-II and Hauz Khas. Fines were imposed on as many as 122 residents in localities such as Defence Colony, Kotla Mubarakpur, South Extension-II among others.The civic agency threatened to impose a fine of Rs 10,000 for handing over non-segregated waste to waste collectors. Municipal officials said as per Solid Waste Management Rules 2016, waste segregation should be done at the source both in commercial and residential areas. According to municipal officials, wet waste or kitchen waste should be deposited in green bins, dry waste such as plastic bottles, milk pouches, etc., in blue bins and hazardous waste such as needles, sanitary napkins among others in red bins.“Some residents were fined around 20-25 days back for not segregating waste. We have appealed to residents to provide segregated waste to collectors. We are doing waste segregation at source and there is no laxity on our part,” Ranjeet Singh, president the Defence Colony RWA, said.An SDMC official said waste segregation in residential areas began a year ago. But from June this year, the process was made mandatory for all residents in SDMC’s jurisdiction. “As many as 1,430 notices have been issued to RWAs and 122 violators have been fined Rs 200 per day for not providing segregated waste. Those who have been challaned are repeat offenders. Our intent is maximum compliance of the Solid Waste Management rules so that no waste goes to landfill sites,” a senior official from the department of environment management services of SDMC said.Out of the total notices to RWAs, 125 were issued in south zone, 535 in central , 300 in west and 470 in Najafgarh zone. The civic body had performed poorly in the Swachh Survekshan 2020, ranking 31 out of 47 cities. Neha Puri, a representative of Green Park Extension RWA, said waste segregation in her neighbourhood began in March but the process slowed down due to the pandemic. Later, SDMC issued a notice for waste segregation. “We were told waste segregation at source is mandatory, which we had already been doing since March this year. We are still working to ensure 100% segregation. Nearly 50% residents are segregating their waste. We update our residents about solid waste management norms and encourage them for waste segregation,” Puri said.She said there were instances of segregated waste getting mixed again at collection points by municipal workers.Amarjeet Singh, president of the Lajpat Nagar-3 RWA, said waste segregation was happening in all 13 blocks of the neighbourhood.SDMC collects nearly 3,600 metric tonnes of garbage every day. Some of this garbage is sent to the Okhla landfill site and the rest to the waste-to-energy and construction & demolition waste recycling plants.South mayor Anamika Mithilesh said: “Waste segregation will help in reducing load on landfills and ease the process of waste disposal. It will improve sanitation conditions in the area. We are making efforts to spread awareness about waste segregation and holding meetings and camps in different localities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/notices-challans-to-south-delhi-rwas-residents-for-not-separating-waste-at-source/story-DleXpFXTTCkRs4yxriulUJ.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||HC seeks Centre, Delhi govt response on plea to stop felling of 315 trees in south Delhi||The Delhi high court on Monday sought a response from the Centre and the Delhi government on a plea challenging the permission given by the forest department to fell or transplant around 315 trees for the redevelopment of a south Delhi colony.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan sought to know the stand of the environment ministry, the Delhi government, deputy conservator of forests (south) and the NBCC-India seeking their stand on the plea filed by South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) councillor Abhishek Dutt, which has contended that felling of the trees would cause irreparable damage to the environment.Dutt, through his counsel Varun K Chopra, has sought to set aside the September 14 decision of the deputy conservator of forests (south), allowing the felling/transplantation of 315 trees for the redevelopment of Ayur Vigyan Nagar on August Kranti Marg.Dutt has contended that the September 14 decision has been taken “without any application of mind” and no reason was given for approving the project. During the proceedings, Chopra said the “rights of citizens” to breathe clean air is being abrogated by the removal of 315 trees from the heart of Delhi.He urged the bench to stay the felling/transplantation of trees till the next date of hearing, on December 11, but the court did not allow that.The petition has claimed that the process of transplanting trees is not effective or successful, especially in India and planting of saplings would not be sufficient to compensate for the loss of green cover.“Planting 10 saplings for each tree which is felled is not enough considering the large size, ecological impact of larger trees and poor survival rate of saplings,” the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-seeks-centre-delhi-govt-response-on-plea-to-stop-felling-of-315-trees-in-south-delhi/story-j71h1L9928yVVNnElHbYWP.html

23-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh colleges reopen to poor attendance||Not many students showed up on Monday as some city colleges reopened for final year classes for the first time after the Covid-19 lockdown.Some institutes were expected to open after sanitisation processes were complete in accordance with safety protocols .The higher education department last week took a call on reopening the colleges from November 23 for final-year students of undergraduate and postgraduate courses for academic and placement purposes. However, online classes of all the batches will continue.Professor Kamlesh Bajaj, principal, Post Graduate Government College, Sector 46, said, “Classes which did not have many students on the rolls and had practical subjects are resuming. However, there was not much of a response from the students and we are using both offline and online modes of teaching.”Another principal of a city college who did not want to be named said the attendance on the first day was poor.The decision to reopen the colleges came after the University Grants Commission (UGC) earlier this month issued guidelines for colleges and universities across the nation to restart classes after consultations with state governments.Last week the higher education department had directed the colleges to develop their own standard operating procedures (SOPs) and adopt UGC guidelines issued on November 5 according to their needs and conditions.In an official communique issued on Monday, the UT higher education department said that colleges which had reopened on the first day were being sanitised and protocols were being worked out according to the guidelines of the UGC and the Chandigarh administration for the safety of students.“In some colleges the online house examinations are also being conducted during this week. The regular physical classes of final year undergraduate and postgraduate students will be functional by the end of this week,” the communique read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-colleges-reopen-to-poor-attendance/story-zlBu4SuXTuLfXKxHGPswPM.html
23-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s old, vacated structures await demolition, risk lives of those in vicinity||Standing amid the scores of residents who refuse to leave the extremely dilapidated structures in the city are at least 270 rickety buildings that have been vacated years ago, but haven’t been pulled down, even though they could collapse any moment, killing those in the neighbourhood. From a consensus among all stakeholders in the structure, to more inclusive redevelopment policies, just like the problem, experts say, the solution isn’t easy. Lessons not learnt On August 17, when Bruce D’Penha was at a repair shop near Rizvi College at Bandra to collect his laptop and charger, the adjacent ground-plus-four-storey Bharati building came crashing down, killing the 41-year-old. The 40-year-old structure which collapsed was vacated 20 years ago, but was razed by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation only after the incident. What makes matters worse is the two government agencies – the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Maharashtra Housing and Areas Development Authority (Mhada) – that handle dilapidated buildings in the city do not have a list of structures that have been vacated. Mayor Kishori Pednekar said, “All such vacated structures need to be identified at the administrative ward level and the vicinity should be secured immediately. In many cases, such structures are under litigation which is why no repair or reconstruction is carried out. Recently, I directed the G-south ward (Worli, Lower Parel) to issue tenders to demolish structures on municipal land that are vacant for several years.” Also read: The challenge of rebuilding this crumbling cityThere are nearly 17,000 old buildings in the city that either need repair or reconstruction, while some require immediate demolition. Landowners cannot reconstruct old building without a nod from tenants who are protected under the Rent Control Act. According to a senior Mhada official, Mumbai has witnessed 300 deaths in building collapses in the past eight years with more than 3,500 incidents recorded during the time. Examples galore Areas in south Mumbai, Marine Drive, Bora Bazaar, Kalbadevi, Chira Bazar, Dongri, Tadwadi and so on, house a majority of these buildings, some of which are more than 60 years old. One such structure is 92-year-old Umravati Bokaria building, located on one of the busiest Bora Bazaar streets. It is a ground-plus-five storey structure in Fort, with no compound wall. It stands less than a meter away from its adjacent structures. The building was fully vacated 10 years ago, and since then, during the monsoon, parts of the structure give way. Residents from the vicinity are worried every time they pass by. Hiren Shah, a paper merchant from the neighbouring building, said a slab from the structure collapsed two years ago, damaging his parked car. “I had fought with the landowners and residents back then as it could have been a fatal accident. However, nothing has changed,” he said. A second-generation vegetable vendor outside this building said, “Every time it rains heavily or there are strong winds, everybody in the neighbourhood is panicking. Schoolchildren, office-goers and locals cross this path daily.” Manjunath Niwas at Fort is another such structure. The ground-plus-four structure is more than 80 years old and is vacant for six years. Rajendra Bhokse, once a resident of the building, said that this structure cannot withstand the next monsoon. “The structure is very weak,” Bhokse said. Within a stone’s throw away from Churchgate railway station stands the 13-storey international hostel for students vacated two years ago. The structure at Road C near Wankhade Stadium is surrounded by six- or seven-storey residential structures. Since February, residents from the vicinity have reported multiple incidents of falling of debris from the building. Vinod Patil, director of controller of board of examination at the Mumbai University, said, “The structural audit of the student’s hostel has been conducted and repairs have been suggested. The work is still in process and the repairs will be carried out soon.” The trap A disagreement between the tenants and landowners over repairs has stalled the work on Manjunath Niwas and Bokaria building for several years. Anil Diggikar, chief executive officer of Mhada, said last Thursday, “There could be such cessed buildings that are vacant for a long time. But a major issue is a disagreement between stakeholders or litigation for other reasons. We will identify such buildings and expedite the required action. This can be done soon.” Bharat Gurjar, a former municipal councillor from Kalbadevi, said, “The authorities turn a blind eye to structures that have been vacated long ago. Landowners and tenants fail to reach a consensus for years. Moreover, policies that restrict construction on old plots stall the redevelopment.” Also read: After Mumbai building collapse, BMC to help vacate dangerous Mhada housesMahendra Jain, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, who grew up in Fort area, said, “We are surrounded by ticking time bombs that could go off any minute. I grew up in Bora Bazaar in Fort and have been hearing of slab collapses. The problem is much bigger than just disputes between tenants and landowners.” Vinod Ghosalkar, chairman of Mhada’s Mumbai’s repair and reconstruction board, said, “There are at least 272 vacated structures that are either acquired by Mhada or vacated dangerous structures that have not been demolished. I will soon give directions to conduct a comprehensive study of all such structures under Mhada and how the work on it can be expedited.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-old-vacated-structures-await-demolition-risk-lives-of-those-in-vicinity/story-1JqOPf7hj0l9OkJ4on89pI.html
23-11-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown in Maharashtra unlikely, but Covid-related curbs may be back, says health minister Rajesh Tope||A day after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray warned of possible curbs to contain the spread of coronavirus, state health minister Rajesh Tope and his cabinet colleagues said that strict measures could be put in place. The health minister said that there would not be a lockdown in the state but restrictions may be reimposed to reduce crowding in public places and ensure masks will be worn by people.Tope said people have become “casual” in their attitude towards wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, which is dangerous, given there could be another wave by December-end.Meanwhile, after five straight days of over 5,000 fresh cases daily, Maharashtra once again reported below the 5,000-mark on Monday with 4,153 fresh infections in the state. The state also recorded its lowest single-day death toll since May 3 (204 days) at 30 fatalities. The total cases count in the state rose to 1,784,361, while the death toll climbed to 46,653. The active caseload in the state saw a marginal increase from Sunday’s count of 81,512 to 81,902 on Monday.Also read: Mumbai’s next Covid-19 peak will impact both slums and high-rises, says BMC“We will have to take some strict measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. The relaxations that we had given will have to again be tightened with some curbs to maintain social distancing in public places. Currently, we do not see people wearing masks and no social distancing maintained. There is a casual attitude among people and therefore we will have to take some strict measures. Only then can we save ourselves from coronavirus,” Tope said.The minister added that the CM and key ministers will meet in a couple of days to decide on restrictions. “We have to learn from what is happening around the world and in the country. We will meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy chief minister Ajit dada [Pawar] in a day or two and implement measures to keep the spread contained. There is no need to panic. We are prepared to tackle the surge in cases,” he said, adding that people will have to remain careful for the next two months.The state could introduce measures such as night curfews to curb the movement of people, senior bureaucrats said. “Night curfews are an option, which other states have adopted. Other measures such as making interdistrict travel tighter are also there, but that would depend on how the surge is. So far, it is not being discussed,” the bureaucrat said, requesting anonymity.Tope said the testing had reduced during Diwali, but it has now picked up and therefore, there are more cases. He further said that there is no need to panic, but people should remain alert.Another state minister Anil Parab said that Thackeray keeps a close eye on the Covid-19 situation in the state. He added that the administration will study the trajectory of cases in the next week and then the government will make a decision. “The state government still does not want to impose lockdown, but if the situation goes out of hand, some tough decisions will have to be taken… If there is another wave, he has directed all officials to maintain the Covid care infrastructure and temporary hospitals… The government will study the situation for the next eight days and then arrive at a decision.Also read: Maharashtra won’t allow passengers from 4 states without Covid-negative reportEarlier in the day, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said that strict measures are required to save lives ultimately, “If needed, in the next eight days, after careful study, we will decide whether there is a need for a complete lockdown or imposition of curbs or addition of new conditions. Such measures will have to be taken because ultimately, lives are important.”Mumbai, meanwhile, reported 800 fresh cases, pushing the city’s tally to 276,514. Mumbai reported 14 fatalities, taking the death toll in the city to 10,689. The active cases in Mumbai reached 12,707--an increase by 259 from Sunday’s tally.

The letters sent on WhatsApp groups, stated that the work done by the school heads and staff is an inspiration for other schools. “The department acknowledges and appreciates the extraordinary efforts put in for teaching through LEDs and projectors installed in government schools. As a result of their efforts, children of primary schools have been able to study online as the schools were shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic.” Due to the lockdown imposed in March, schools had been shut down due to which teachers were directed to use e-content for teaching that was sent daily on WhatsApp. According to the school heads, the acknowledgment of the work put in by them will motivate them to do better. School heads have also stated that every teacher has tried to reach out to their students and encourage them to study online. Lakhwinder Singh Grewal, head of GPS, Macchiwara 2 who is a recipient of the letter, said, “We have a total of 12 teachers in our school who are sending slides to students on a daily basis so that they can study at home. The state education department has come up with an app and all the study material is available through which teachers are continuing to teach students. This appreciation will motivate more teachers to work hard.” Rajinder Kaur, district education officer, elementary, said, “We have dedicated teachers and all of them are using online material to teach students.

Representatives of the dyeing industry were also present in the meeting.Talwar stated that apart from the officials, he and the Congress councillors of the East constituency will also conduct surprise inspections at factories and the areas where ash is illegally dumped by owners.Talwar said, “The dyeing and washing units are situated at Tajpur road, Bahadurke road, Focal point, Gehlewal, Chandigarh road among other areas. Residents of these areas are unable to sit out or do any outdoor activity due to flying ash coming out of the chimneys of nearby industrial units. The authorities at the central jail have also been complaining about the same.”“Apart from fly ash, some unit owners were found dumping the ash in vacant plots with the help of truckers or tractor trolley drivers. This is also troubling residents as the ash gets into their houses. The PPCB and MC officials have been told to conduct inspections at the units and certify that no dyeing or washing unit in their area is using illegal fuel, releasing fly ash in the air, or dumping ash in vacant plots, which results in air pollution and may prove fatal for Covid-19 patients,” said Talwar while adding that next meeting in this regarding will be held on December 15.Last week, residents of Gaunspur village had also complained regarding fly ash coming out of the paper mills situated near their village. Members of Faridkot-based NGO Naroa Punjab Manch had also forwarded a complaint against the same to the monitoring committee of the National GreenTribunal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-ppcb-to-inspect-dumping-of-fly-ash-by-industrial-units/story-DxQVRb1FAFjfI7DiPEgv9H.html

The Delhi government has put in place measures to check the spread of the disease. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) too has pitched in by announcing that they are increasing the number of beds at Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and Hospital at Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Delhi’s Chhatarpur.ITBP Director General SS Deswal said they are increasing the number of beds by 1,000.“We will expand the operational capacity of beds from 2,000 to 3,000 for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Delhi-NCR,” Deswal told news agency ANI.He also said that the new beds at the Covid-19 care facility will be equipped with a proper supply of medical oxygen. “The added beds will also have medical oxygen supply available on them. We have no shortage of medical oxygen,” Deswal said. The ITBP chief also denied rumours about the shortage of medical oxygen at the facility.“There are nearly 550 patients admitted and patients admitted here are those who can’t afford private and high-end hospitals. There is enough supply of oxygen and there are sufficient doctors, nurses & pharmacists to cater to 3,000 patients at the Centre,” he said.Deswal further stated that as per Union home minister Amit Shah’s order, the number of doctors and medical staff has also been expanded in the Covid-19 care centre. He added that now there is enough healthcare stuff to attend as many as 3,000 coronavirus patients.With alarming rise in coronavirus cases in the national capital, Shah, earlier today, launched a mobile lab that will conduct free RT-PCR tests for coronavirus with the results being available in six to eight hours. The cost of the test will be Rs 499 and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will bear this cost, ANI reported citing officials from the ministry of home affairs. However, the test will be absolutely free for people of Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/itbp-to-add-1-000-beds-at-covid-care-centre-in-delhi/story-XuePpxpCJQZwDz6VE301yN.html

During the initial interrogation, the suspect Ramakant said he was angry with his wife for being overly involved with her side of the family and “neglecting their three children”, said Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west).The victim also worked as a daily wage labourer and there were frequent arguments between the couple over who ran the family, the DCP said. The woman, Soni, lived with Ramakant and their three children -- aged between three and seven -- at a rented room in Singhalpur village in Shalimar Bagh. The murder happened in the early hours of Saturday while the three children were sleeping in the room, the DCP said. Ramakant allegedly escaped from the house even as the children continued sleeping. “Around 6am on Saturday, we received a call from Soni’s sister who lives in the same neighbourhood and had knocked on the door to check on the family. When she noticed her sister unresponsive and the husband missing, she had raised a hue and cry,” said the DCP. Since Ramakant was missing, he became the prime suspect. “We were following his trail and suspected that he would go to his native home in UP’s Jalaun district. We raided his house on Sunday and arrested him. He has confessed to the crime,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/man-kills-wife-as-children-sleep-in-same-room-in-delhi-s-shalimar-bagh/story-PPolg2K6u6VOoAzbpmVV6I.html

Hussain told police Shanu had married Safeeq two years ago. Around two months ago, the couple came to Ludhiana to visit Safeeq’s brother Farooq, who lives in Paddi village here. On November 1, Shanu gave birth to a boy in Ludhiana. Days after this, Shanu called her sister, alleging that her husband and in-laws were forcing her to handle all house chores, despite her weak health. On November 10, Farooq called Hussain, informing him that she was unwell and in the evening, he called again and said that Shanu had died.“Farooq took Shanu’s body to Kathua and buried it there. However, there were injury marks on her body, which relatives noticed before the burial. Therefore, I approached the Kathua district magistrate, who ordered that the body be exhumed and an autopsy be conducted,” Hussain said.After the autopsy report confirmed that Shanu was beaten to death, the Kathua police referred the matter to their counterparts in Ludhiana for further action.ASI Ranjeet Singh, who is investigating the case, said after the autopsy, the woman was buried again in Kathua. Her husband and two brothers-in-law have been booked under Sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and 34 (acts done in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at the Dehlon police station in Ludhiana. Efforts are on to arrest them, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/murdered-woman-s-body-exhumed-in-j-k-husband-two-in-laws-booked/story-nRBMsk3GzNwxZw9lKmlGGM.html
23-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s next Covid-19 peak will impact both slums and high-rises, says BMC||The next peak in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, anticipated in December due to the ongoing festival season, is likely to affect both slums and high-rises equally, unlike the peak in May that was concentrated in slums, and the September peak that affected more high-rises in the suburbs, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The civic body has attributed this to unlocking of the city, and opening of malls and eateries, along with domestic helps and drivers returning to work, ferrying their employers around the city, or carrying out chores in high-rises, while at the same time returning to their own homes at the end of the day. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “During the first two-three months after the Covid outbreak in Mumbai, our focus was on slums. We set up fever clinics, went door-to-door and carried out contact-tracing in high volumes to move high-risk contacts to institutional quarantine facilities.” Also read: In case of peak, Mumbai’s health infrastructure can handle upto 17,000 symptomatic Covid-19 cases: Civic bodyAs the virus gradually shifted to non-slum establishments, BMC started Mission Zero to focus in top six wards in the western suburbs, and conduct door-to-door campaigns in high-rises. Kakani said, “We are now refocusing on slums, but we have to focus equally on high-rises. During our My Family, My Responsibility campaign, many houses in slum and chawls that we found locked will now have opened as labour is returning to Mumbai. At the same time, these people are returning to work in shops and establishments, markets, as domestic helps. The city has unlocked considerably, and everyone is stepping out too.” Currently, the average growth rate of Covid cases in Mumbai is 0.27%. The top five wards with the highest growth rate are M-West ward in Chembur and K-West ward in Andheri at 0.37%, R-South ward and P-South ward at 0.36%, and T ward in Mulund at 0.34%. B ward of Mumbadevi, Pydhoni and Dongri has the lowest growth rate of 0.10%, followed by E ward in Mumbai Central (0.14%), G-South ward of Worli and Prabhadevi (0.15%), and G-North ward of Dharavi and Dadar (0.16%). According to data from BMC, at the end of May, the highest number of cases were from G-North ward (2,900), E ward (2,528), F-North ward covering Wadala and Sewri (2517), L ward covering Kurla and parts of Ghatkopar (2,495), H-East ward covering Bandra East (2,221), M-East ward covering Govandi and Mankhurd (1,814), where as non-slum suburban areas of Borivli, Kandivli, Malad, Goregaon, Mulund, and upmarket areas of the island city such as A ward had cases below 1,000.

According to India Meteorological Department officials, it is likely to continue in the coming days.“Due to cloud cover and relatively high humidity in the morning, mist was seen in many parts of the city, especially around open areas and in the city’s periphery. However, there was no drop in visibility at the Sector-39 observatory.” said an IMD scientist.The weatherman said that western disturbances will be active in the region and cloudy weather is likely to continue, due to which more mist may be seen in the coming days.Fog and mist differ by how far you can see through them. Fog is when you can see less than 1,000 metre away, and if you can see further, it is called mist. Mist typically is quicker to dissipate and can rapidly disappear with even slight winds or sunlight.

23-11-2020||Lucknow||UP caps wedding guests to 100 due to Covid resurge. Ruined, say marriage hall owners||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday reduced the number of persons allowed at social and other gatherings, including marriages functions, to a maximum of 100 across the state in view of a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases. State chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari issued an order to all commissioners, district magistrates, senior superintendents of police and others, asking them to strictly enforce the home department’s guidelines in regard to gatherings.As per the new guidelines, not more than 100 people can gather at a social/religious/ cultural/educational/recreational/political function or for any other collective activity outside containment zones.Also, the limit of 100 people will further be restricted to 50% of the capacity of the hall or a similar closed space at a time. Besides this, maintaining physical distance and wearing masks will be mandatory and arrangements for thermal scanning and sanitiser/ hand-wash will have to be put in place. The permissible limit of 100 people for open spaces will be restricted to 40% of the capacity of any such place on the condition of all other safety measures being in place. The government, according to Tiwari, has amended the guidelines issued in October after the Central government allowed some relaxations with regard to social and other gatherings. As per those guidelines, a maximum number of 200 people could gather with certain restrictions in halls/closed spaces but not more than 50% of the capacity of the space at a time. Also, there were no other restrictions for a social or any other gathering up to 100 persons outside containment zones. There was no such limit fixed for gatherings in open spaces depending on the area, though norms related to social distancing, wearing mask, sanitisation etc were to be followed. Also Read: Universities and colleges across UP reopen after 8 months, attendance thinSoon after, the UP government’s fresh anti-Covid guidelines were released on Monday, the Lucknow district administration restricted the total numbers of guests at a marriage function to 100. “No gathering of more than 100 people will be allowed,” said Abhishek Prakash, district magistrate. Meanwhile, the sudden change in anti-Covid guidelines ahead of the marriage season, which is scheduled to start from November 25, has added to the woes of marriage hall owners and others who are engaged in the wedding business. “We are in a no man’s land. We actually don’t know where to go and how to react. Since the marriage season will start in a couple of days, all preparations have been made and in such a situation, adjusting to the new norms is next to impossible. The order will certainly leave a massive financial dent on us,” owner of a marriage hall said. He said holding marriage functions may seem a one-day affair but actually it’s not so.“Preparations have to be made well in advance, be it decoration, booking of band, making payments at the marriage hall, inviting guests and so on. But the last minute change in the total limit of guests will certainly cause major financial loss,” another marriage hall owner said. The city has more than 200 venues that hold such function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-caps-wedding-guests-to-100-due-to-covid-resurge-ruined-say-marriage-hall-owners/story-bZ6NeTBp4TluedNIj2FClJ.html

Commuters were still using the old flyover which has been partially demolished and further work is going on. Although, the overall traffic is less due to the work from home initiative by IT companies in the area. The new flyover will be constructed at the same place as the old one. “Most of the people are using the old flyover even after we had placed signs to use alternative routes so now, we have decided to completely stop the movement,” said Sunil Dahiphale, police inspector, Hinjawadi, traffic unit. The old flyover consists of a single lane from both the sides while the new flyover which will come in place will have two lanes on both ends. “Due to a single lane, there was more congestion of traffic but after the new flyover will be in place, traffic movement will be managed in a much better way.

23-11-2020||Pune||Rohit Pawar plugs into power ‘surge’||Nationalist Congress Party MLA from Karjat Jamkhed and party supremo Sharad Pawar’s grandnephew Rohit Pawar has showered praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over Centre’s energy and ethanol policy. Rohit Pawar in a series of tweet said India has made progress in areas of energy and ethanol. “Progress made by the nation in areas of solar energy and ethanol under the leadership of PM ji in the last few years is remarkable. The central government must be appreciated for it. I also believe that similar efforts will be made to put a check on rising pollution in the nation,” Rohit Pawar said in a tweet. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on Thursday revised ethanol procurement prices for state-run oil marketing companies, a move that will boost farmers’ income. In another tweet, the Pawar scion praised Modi over his address during the G-20 summit. Rohit Pawar at the same time also took a dig at the state BJP unit for politicising the Covid-19 situation. “It was pleasing to see the way Modi Ji urged world leaders in the #G20Summit to take decisive action against corona, the biggest challenge faced by the world since World War II. #BJP in the state should also be informed so that they will stop politicizing this issue,” Rohit Pawar said in a tweet. Modi on Saturday called for greater transparency in governance systems and decisive action by the G20 to counter the impact of the Covid-19 crisis that should focus on both economic recovery and preserving the planet. Modi participated in the two-day virtual summit chaired by Saudi Arabia along with the heads of state and government of the 19 member countries and representatives of the European Union and international organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/rohit-pawar-plugs-into-power-surge/story-m5TzBasyn6mFjsNtopDOmM.html
23-11-2020||Chandigarh||Three Haryana Congress leaders want high command to show Azad the door||A day after Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad demanded sweeping changes in the party following its poor performance in the Bihar assembly elections and byelections, three Haryana unit leaders accused him of weakening the party and urged the high command to show him the door. Former Haryana ministers Subhash Batra and Krishan Murti Hooda besides Kuldeep Bishnoi, the Adampur Congress MLA and former chief minister Bhajan Lal’s younger son, said Azad, who was nominated five times by the Congress to the Upper House of Parliament, is now raising his voice for elections in the party. Azad is the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha. Addressing a press conference in Rohtak, Batra and Krishan Murti Hooda blamed Azad for the poor performance of the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Haryana besides the failure to form a government in the state after last year’s assembly elections. “Azad claims there is five-star culture in the party which is wrong. He himself lives in five stars and never interacts with workers. We have always met him in five stars. He did not conduct a single district level meeting when he was Haryana in-charge ahead of last year’s elections. The party should throw him out along with Kapil Sibal and former minister Anand Sharma. The trio is making efforts to divide the party at the behest of the BJP,” Batra said and Krishan Murti Hooda agreed. AZAD HAS NO MASS SUPPORT: BISHNOI In a video message, Bishnoi said Azad had won only three elections in his life but remained in the Rajya Sabha for five terms with the support of the top brass. “I have won six elections so far and I know Azad has no mass support in Jammu and Kashmir. No one bothers about him in J&K and he is advocating elections from the booth to national levels. He is asking for reforms in the organisation, which is a good step, but I want to ask him why didn’t he ask for the same when he was nominated youth president of J&K and later of the nation, too. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi is working hard with his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra under the leadership of party chief Sonia Gandhi,” Bishnoi said. The Adampur MLA accused former J&K chief minister Azad of weakening the Congress and held him responsible for not forming the government in Haryana in 2019. “He was solely responsible for the Congress’s narrow defeat in last year’s assembly elections. If he was not the party affairs in-charge of Haryana, we would have been in power in the state,” Bishnoi said. GUNNING FOR EX-CM HOODA, TOO All three leaders belong to the anti-Bhupinder Singh Hooda camp and had left the party when Hooda became chief minister in 2005. Bishnoi’s father Bhajan Lal formed the Haryana Janhit Congress. The former ministers said they will protest against Bhupinder Singh Hooda too if he indulges in anti-party activities. Hooda was among the 23 party leaders who had written to Sonia Gandhi, demanding changes in the party organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/three-haryana-congress-leaders-want-high-command-to-show-azad-the-door/story-j7DIzmXHDJz8DzKURmMHjP.html
23-11-2020||Pune||Pune suburbs overflow with garbage post-Diwali||The major suburbs of Pune are grappling with overflowing garbage dumped at public places post-Diwali. The garbage lifting work has been hit due to the non-availability of manpower and health workers not visiting the suburbs since the festival. The areas particularly affected are Parvati, Wadgaonsheri, Kharadi, Aundh, Mohammadwadi, NIBM, Wagholi, Vimannagar and Vishrantwadi. According to residents in the area, unhygienic conditions are already prevailing in the city and the open containers are proving to be a breeding place for germs and other toxic substances. “The garbage issue has become a topic of concern for area residents as foul-smelling garbage is getting entangled in the two-wheelers passing through the area. Flies and other organisms are breeding at the garbage spots which is threatening public health in our area,” said Sachin Kshirsagar, a resident of Sahakarnagar. Kasturba Vasahat and Indira Vasahat in Aundh has witnessed overflowing garbage during the past four days while garbage bins in Vadgaonsheri gaothan, Thite Vasti and Nagpul roadsides in Kharadi have been overflowing with no action in sight. Pradeep Chopde, a resident of Bharati Vidyapeeth said, “The entire expenditure on garbage management is wasteful exercise unless and until the garbage generated is disposed in the same area where it is generated. The current elected representatives lack the necessary acumen in dealing with issues of garbage generation and its disposal. PMC must immediately remove the garbage from those spots and clean up the area with disinfectants. Such lackadaisical behavior during the Covid-19 crisis is uncalled for.” PMC solid waste management chief Sanjay Gawade said, “We are taking necessary steps for quick disposal of garbage. There were some issues related to ground clearance and have been sorted out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-suburbs-overflow-with-garbage-post-diwali/story-8wHQ84rdDQrvxRet9zWGQI.html

23-11-2020||City||No increase in drug consumption: Goa Police on increased seizure of narcotics||Goa has witnessed an increase in drug seizures with the police stating they have seized drugs worth Rs1.2 crore more than last year, despite the pandemic dealing a huge blow to tourism, which they said provides the primary market for drugs in the state. According to records, the police have seized narcotics drugs worth Rs6.7 crore in total this year as compared to last year when the total seizure amounted to Rs5.5 crore. “As compared to last year, the value of drugs seized is more this year. Our focus is on the source,” Goa’s Director General of Police Mukesh Kumar Meena said. However, Meena suggested that the increased quantity was likely on account of the Goa Police being more proactive this year instead of an increase in consumption. Also Read: Goa to adopt curbs like Maharashtra on arrivals from Delhi, says health minister Vishwajit Rane“Drug activity might have decreased because we have taken action. I wouldn’t say that consumption has increased. But we are very alert, all agencies are taking action,” Meena said. According to police records, two significant raids—a raid on a cannabis plantation at Keri in Pernem in North Goa in mid-October, in which drugs worth around Rs1.10 crore were seized, while another in Morjim in March this year prior to the lockdown in which drugs worth Rs1.65 crore were seized—have helped the police seize more drugs this year. The police also busted an underground rave party that was held after the lockdown had started being lifted, but parties were still not allowed, and seized drugs including cocaine, MDMA and marijuana worth Rs9 lakh . The state’s top cop also said it was everyone’s collective responsibility including that of parents, to ensure that drug consumption does not rise in the state. With the tourism industry having recovered and tourists once again having returned to the state, the Goa Police have said that they are preparing for a surge. “It will be a challenging task,” Meena said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-increase-in-drug-consumption-goa-police-on-increased-seizure-of-narcotics/story-ffzSaAYd98HKTeavBRWqzL.html
23-11-2020||Pune||81-year-old defeats stage four cancer successfully, say Pune doctors||Doctors at a private hospital in Pune have reported the success story of a miraculous recovery of an 81-year-old man suffering from stage four colon cancer. Nandan Kalbag, an 81-year-old from Pune has now even started pursuing his hobbies of making bamboo handicrafts and has started a new life post-recovery. Doctors mentioned that complete recovery at the age of 81 from stage four cancer is remarkable. Doctors also said that determination and continuous efforts made him emerge victorious in his fight against cancer. Nandan not only fought the disease but also continued with his hobby of making home and landscape models of bamboo and cane. During the last three years when he was undergoing his cancer treatment, he was also making one model made of bamboo and cane every day. said the treating doctors. Dr Minish Jain, an oncologist from the hospital said, “He was suffering from stage four colon cancer. His cancer had spread to the liver too. He showed complete willingness to take the entire treatment. He underwent 12 chemotherapy sessions. We gave him Folfox 6 chemotherapy. At this age, he is not only disease-free but also living an active life by pursuing his hobbies.” He added, “At his age, many are not willing to start the treatment. He not only underwent the complete treatment, but he also pursued his daily activities and hobbies. Cancer treatment is a prolonged treatment, and you need determined efforts to fight it back.” Kalbag said, “I am happy that I recovered completely, and I am disease free now. I followed all the instructions given by the doctor. I used to always follow a treatment schedule. I followed a healthy diet and did some basic routine exercises. I am pursuing my hobby. Every day I make models made of cane and bamboo. I have even started teaching about handicraft at some centres in Pune.” Dr Chakor Vora, a consultant medical oncologist from Sassoon hospital, said, “Many patients do not continue the treatment. Many are afraid when it comes to chemotherapy. But the determination shown by an 81-year-old cancer patient is remarkable. With the help of recent treatment options, it is possible to beat cancer and become disease-free, if we take correct and complete treatment.” Dr Shona Nag, a senior oncologist said, “It is too premature to say that it is a complete recovery since it is a stage four cancer, which may relapse. However, it is commendable that the senior citizen showed the will and determination needed to fight the disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/81-year-old-defeats-stage-four-cancer-successfully-say-pune-doctors/story-q3bq81VpNZMHy4GZWXOHlN.html
23-11-2020||Pune||Private schools in Pune dist seek time to reopen, demand free Covid-19 test for teachers||As the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations are mulling over reopening of schools for students for classes 9 to 12, in Pune’s rural area schools will be starting from Monday (November 23). However, Independent English Schools Association (IESA), which works for the betterment of the academic ecosystem of private schools in Maharashtra, has said they are unable to reopen schools immediately and need at least a weeks time.They have also put forth their various demands like free Covid-19 test of teachers, funds of purchasing Covid safety equipment and sanitisation among others.IESA also represents Maharashtra at the National Level through the National Independent School Alliance (NISA).There are 1,400 private schools in Pune and around 40,000 teachers teaching at these schools.“State government has declared that schools can reopen from November 23 for classes 9 to 12, but while issuing the guidelines for reopening schools they did not mention anything about private schools. The government should make arrangements to conduct free Covid-19 tests of teachers from private schools like that of government schools,” said Rajendra Singh, president, IESA. The Maharashtra education department has made it mandatory for teachers to undergo an RT-PCR test for Covid-19 before schools reopen and teachers from government schools can get themselves tested for free at state-run centres.“The financial condition of private schools is not stable and it is not possible to reopen schools immediately. It will take more one week’s time to commence classroom lectures for students, for that sanitisation of classes, benches and schools premises is necessary. So our other demand is that sanitisation equipment should also be provided to private schools by the government,” he said.“Also, our RTE admission fee is due from the education department, the state government has given around Rs 23 crore funds to the education department for RTE which it should disburse to schools immediately. This will ease the financial burden of private schools,” he said.Following sharp reactions from parents and teachers, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Saturday rolled back its earlier decision to restart schools from November 23 and has now decided to defer it till December 13. The civic administration will review the situation and decide whether to open the campuses or not. While Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has held its decision to start school for Class 9-12 on November 23. The decision will now be reviewed on November 30. “The civic body has now decided to revise its earlier decisions. PMC has issued fresh order on Saturday stating that civic-run, as well as private schools, will not open till December 13 when the administration will review the situation and decide whether to open the campuses or not. Pune is seeing a rise in cases and so it seems only logical to postpone the opening of schools,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol, on Saturday.Survey findingsIndependent English Schools Association (IESA) carried out a survey to know about students current status on attending the online and offline classes. In this survey, it is found that around six to eighteen per cent of students have not yet attended a single online lecture. As many as 30 to 35 per cent of students are still staying at their hometown or village and not returned back to Pune. Also, 50 to 60 per cent of parents are not willing to send their children to school to attend offline classes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/private-schools-in-pun-dist-seek-time-to-reopen-demand-free-covid-19-test-for-teachers/story-LMXSoHyqodrJkaX8HWqpfI.html

The deputy chief minister also shared examples of Ahmedabad and other places where night curfew has been imposed along with Delhi where the coronavirus disease tally has spiked over the last few days. In Maharashtra as well, the cases of fresh Covid-19 positive patients have been steadily rising post Diwali, when thousands of people came out on the streets in major cities for festive shopping. Pawar said, “During Diwali there was a huge crowd at the marketplaces as if Covid-19 was under control. Now, there are speculations that a second wave of Covid-19 may occur.” On schools being reopened in various parts of the state starting Monday, Pawar said that various steps are being taken to reopen schools. “Government has made a lot of regulations with respect to restarting of schools, which includes different ways on maintaining safety and following sanitisation guidelines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/govt-will-review-covid-19-situation-for-8-10-days-then-decide-on-lockdown-ajit-pawar/story-7MHKRNQvLKgcZWpAc6PBWJ.html

23-11-2020||Mumbai||Let Bihar enact law on ‘love jihad’, then Maharashtra will think about it: Shiv Sena||Days after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders sought the enactment of a legislation against “love jihad”, a term coined by Hindutva groups for Hindu girls being allegedly forced to convert to Islam in the guise of marriage, the Shiv Sena said that it will study the law that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s government brings into effect, if he does so. Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that BJP leaders in Maharashtra are attempting to “distract” the Uddhav Thackeray-led government from the course of development by using such tactics.Last week, BJP leader Ram Kadam targeted the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and asked why it was silent on the atrocities committed against women under the pretext of “love”.The Shiv Sena said it will think about a legislation against “love jihad” if the Bihar government brings in such a legislation. BJP union minister Giriraj Singh has backed an enactment of the law in Bihar, but Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) is reportedly against it.Also Read | ‘Interfaith marriages in families of BJP leaders examples of Love Jihad?” questions Bhupesh BaghelRaut, the Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson, said, “I spoke to the chief minister about the demand for a ‘love jihad’ law by BJP leaders. We will study the law against ‘love jihad’ in other states, especially in Bihar, and then think about it. Nitish Kumar has become the chief minister with the help of the BJP, but the BJP is running the government. We will study what law Nitish Kumar’s government brings in. The BJP should bring in an ideal law on ‘love jihad’ in Bihar and then ask questions [to others] about it.”The Shiv Sena parliamentarian also slammed the BJP over the lack of a development plan for the country. He said that the politics of religion and communalism is being practised due to the upcoming assembly election in West Bengal. “The politics over ‘love jihad’ will end after the West Bengal elections,” Raut said.He added, “The BJP doesn’t have any issue related to development. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is guiding Maharashtra towards development, and therefore, they are attempting to disturb and distract us from the course. However, despite all this, Maharashtra will become the top state in the country in the next three years.”An editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana also hit out at the BJP leadership in Maharashtra and said that they shouldn’t play with the people’s lives during the Covid-19 pandemic for the sake of politics.Also Read: ‘Love Jihad’ a term created by BJP to divide nation: Gehlot“On one hand, they criticise the government for not controlling Covid-19 numbers, and on the other, they create chaos and crowding, which leads to the spread of Covid-19. The second wave of Covid-19 is coming, but the BJP thinks this wave is of their political ideology. They want to use the wave as the ladder to uninstall the saffron flag on the Mumbai civic body. That is fine; you play your politics, but why are you pushing innocent people into an abyss,” the editorial read.Radical Hindu groups have popularised the term “love jihad”, which they use to describe what they believe is an organised conspiracy of Muslim men to trick Hindu women into marriages. In February, junior home minister G Kishan Reddy told Parliament the term “love jihad” is not defined under the laws and no such case has been reported by any central agency. Despite the political mobilisation, experts say that the charges of love jihad are bogus and that adult men and women are free to convert under the constitutional right to freedom of religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/let-bihar-enact-law-on-love-jihad-then-maharashtra-will-think-about-it-shiv-sena/story-zAC8HHulEmJodnIvmbTQeM.html

This has been further aggravated by a series of anti-people legislations on agriculture and labour code enacted by the central government. Along with these measures, the National Education Policy (NEP) imposed on the nation during the pandemic will further cause irreparable harm to the equity and access of education,” said the joint statement released on Monday morning.Also Read: Farm leaders mobilise support for November 26 rally in capitalThe statement further highlights how the introduction of NEP will violate the constitutional mandates of the policy of reservation and right to free and compulsory education act. “This new act will systematically break the present structure of education and could also result in the closure of thousands of schools and colleges. Not only will this lead to high drop-out rates among students, but also simultaneously push more teachers and non-teaching staff in ad-hoc and contractual appointments,” said the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/teachers-unions-to-join-nationwide-strike-against-labour-farmer-and-education-reforms/story-7LxuRLGHUelXAolm0MpKmK.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Stephanians initiate fundraiser to help fellow DU students beat financial distress||Recently when Aishwarya Reddy, a student of Lady Shri Ram College (LSR), died by suicide due to financial crisis, and the news reached a group of students from St Stephen’s College, it shook them like most others. But, the young guns decided to not let another fellow student fall prey to the many difficulties that they have been facing since the pandemic challenged their education and future prospects. Wanting to help peers who may be facing a similar crunch of resources, 25-30 students of St Stephen’s have initiated a fundraiser to support old as well as new students in the university, with their fees, mobile data packs, essential technological devices and study material. Evita Rodrigues, a final year student pursuing BA, who is one of the organisers of the fundraiser, says, “Shortly after we heard of Aishwarya’s death, a few of us started collecting funds. We came to learn that most of the smaller colleges have almost no support mechanism, be it for concessions or scholarships. And in absence of a significant alumni base, no funds are being raised either. We then expanded the team to bring in more students from our college, and put out an online form to collect details of students (beneficiaries) and potential donors. Some students have come forward to support their peers with internet data pack requests, but we certainly need more help.” “My father is a security guard, with an income of ₹9,000 per month. I needed around ₹13,000 for my college fee, which I received from the donors after I filled the form. I’m extremely thankful to the students at St Stephen’s who helped me else I might not have been able to continue my studies,” says Khemchand, a final year student at Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College, is one of the students who received financial aid through this initiative. Through the form, available on internet, the collected money goes straight from the donor to the beneficiary via bank details provided directly to the donors. The students carefully whet the background of all who are seeking help, through their college ID cards, fee receipts and income certificates. And it’s through this initiative that devices such as laptops and smartphones are also being arranged for students who need them. “The need is quite urgent, especially since DU exams happen next month, and it’s quite challenging to attempt practicals, arrange readings etc on a small smartphone. We have requests from visually impaired students as well, which we are keeping on priority. It is hard to access online classes on outdated phones, so we are trying to arrange for donations of devices,” says Susan Maria Mathew, a second year student at St Stephen’s. This group has so far managed to provide necessary devices to about 20 DU students. Prachi Jain, a resident of Aligarh, who recently got admission in Shyam Lal College, says she didn’t have a smartphone until the students who are part of this initiative helped her get one. “We had one phone in the house, and my sister also needed it for her classes. So I put in a request for a phone, simply because I need to pursue my classes. I also need a laptop to give my exams, but for now I’m happy that I won’t miss out on my studies,” says Jain, adding that she is grateful for this help from her peers.

Thus, total value of the smuggled gold comes out to be around 60 kg valued at over Rs 30 crore (based on average values),” Rohilla said.Follow-up searches were conducted and the receiver of the gold was also apprehended, he said, adding that incriminating documents and other evidence have been recovered.Both the accused were placed under arrest by the officers of the Customs (Preventive), Delhi on Sunday evening for violation of the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 and remanded to 14 days of judicial custody, the officer said, adding that further investigation is underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/customs-seizes-gold-worth-rs-3-26-crore-from-man-at-new-delhi-railway-station/story-nmoEjpKt0Xwy86mGKV7SSI.html
23-11-2020||Bangalore||CBI raids residence of ex-Congress minister Roshan Baig arrested in IMA scam||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday raided the Bengaluru residence of former Congress minister Roshan Baig, who was arrested by the federal agency in connection with a Rs 2,500 crore ponzi scheme on Sunday. A team of 12 CBI officials has been searching Baig’s premises in Coles Park since morning. The seven-time MLA was arrested on Sunday after being quizzed for nearly 10 hour and has been remanded to 14 day-judicial custody. He is currently lodged in Parapanna Agrahara jail. Karnataka-based I Monetary Advisors (IMA), an investment firm purportedly run in compliance with Islamic banking rules, collapsed in May last year after it could not repay either the deposits or dividends on the deposits it had illegally accepted. IMA co-founder Mohammed Mansoor Khan at the time of his arrest had alleged that Baig had cheated him of Rs 400 crore and forced him to gift expensive cars and jewellery. He had also named some other government officers. The former minister had then rejected the charge and claimed that except for some donations to Haj facilitation centers, he had not accepted any money. Over 51,500 depositors are said to have lost approximately Rs 2,500 crore collected by IMA and its subsidiaries in the ponzi scheme.The then coalition government of Congress and JD(S) had formed a special investigation team to probe the matter in September 2019. However, the BJP government which came to power later handed over the case to the CBI. The CBI has arraigned an IAS officer, two IPS officers, a KAS officer and a corporator as accused among others in the case after the state government gave permission for prosecuting them.Baig was suspended from the Congress party in June 2019 after he criticized the leader of opposition Siddaramaiah as well as then KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao. Baig had also attempted to join the BJP. He, however, was not inducted into BS Yediyurappa’s party, unlike 16 other disqualified legislators of Congress and JDS, whose revolt led to the collapse of the HD Kumarasamy led coalition government last year.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/cbi-raids-residence-of-ex-congress-minister-roshan-baig-arrested-in-ima-scam/story-vBZ3fZuFwV9bpDZUuZz06I.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||‘Is lockdown only solution?’: Delhi HC refuses to hear plea amid Covid-19 surge||The Delhi High Court on Monday refused to entertain a petition seeking a lockdown in the national capital with immediate effect in view of the surging cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “Is lockdown the only solution?” the court asked the petitioner. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan sought to know from Kaushal Kant Mishra, a doctor, as to whether a lockdown is a solution while also stating that they had not done any homework before filing the plea. The court said that a writ court does not have the jurisdiction to impose a lockdown as it a policy decision. “How do you think a writ court can do this?? Have you considered the studies? This situation is despite too much lockdown, “ Justice Jalan said. The court said that it was inclined to dismiss the plea with cost. Appearing for the Delhi government, advocate Gautam Narayan, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government told the court that a circular from the Centre issued on September 30, none of the Union Territories can impose lockdown without prior permission from the Centre. The court said that this is an “unnecessary litigation”. The plea was later dismissed as withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/is-lockdown-only-solution-delhi-hc-refuses-to-hear-plea-seeking-shutdown-in-delhi-amid-covid-19-surge/story-Hv8aaOcLQTsc1xDw8blCJP.html
23-11-2020||Patna||Bihar: Remains of ancient structures discovered in Chandan river||Remains of what seem to be ancient-age structures and settlements have been discovered in the Chandan river in Amarpur block of Banka district. The brick structures, which are spread over a vast area in the river, were first spotted by the locals of Bhadaria village who were preparing for Chhath Puja celebrations and were trying to create a ghat on the banks of the Chandan river for the rituals. The local administration of Banka has taken note of the findings and has informed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Patna circle, about it. Meanwhile experts said that the remains must be the ruins of some ancient settlements in this area and that excavations of the site and study of the findings would provide further insight in the history and heritage of the state, especially of Banka district.Also Read: Chhattisgarh government fixes tribal Devgudis to counter Maoists in Bastar region“Even the ancient age Vikramshila University which is now located in the neighbouring district of Bhagalpur, is not far from Amarpur block of Banka district and from Bhadaria village, where ancient structures have been discovered. This is why locals believe that the remains found in Chandan river might have some Buddhist connections,” Manoj Kumar Chaudhary, SDO (sub-divisional officer), Banka, who had visited the spot, said. “The matter has been reported to the top authorities in the administration and to the Archaeological Survey of India, Patna circle. They will take suitable action,” he said. The superintending archaeologist of the ASI HS Naik said a team of experts from the ASI would soon visit the site. “The pictures of the site shared by the locals show a long wall and cell-like structures in the river. Seems a settlement was there in ancient times which might have been buried by river water,” he said. Once experts review the site, further action would be taken on the basis of their report, the official added. Bipin Kumar, a local from Bhadaria village, said the remains of the structure are spread over a vast area in Chandan river. “And the size of brick is quite big. We often find this kind of brick in ancient monuments,” he said. “The structures were discovered after we removed a few layers of sand in the river to construct a ghaat for Chhath Puja. The water level in the river is low these days,” he said. Anil Kumar, the head of the history and archaeology department at Santi Niketan, West Bengal, who had done a study on Mandar hills in Banka, said the findings in Chandan river are important and needed to be studied well. “The Chandan river valley has great potential. In the 1960s, a team of Patna University’s ancient history department, which included RCP Singh, had discovered Mesolithic tools in the area,” he said. After that, no detailed work in Chandan river valley has taken place, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/bihar-remains-of-ancient-structures-discovered-in-chandan-river/story-9nHIqCcMD4UeWeBKoZINBO.html

The markets were to remain shut till November 30, as per an order issued by the the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Click here for full Covid-19 coverageA senior government official on Sunday had called these markers ‘unauthorised’ and said that the crackdown was a temporary measure due to the prevailing coronavirus situation in the Capital.“Both these markets are unauthorised and comprise around 100 makeshift shops selling goods ranging from garments to kitchen utensils. The crackdown was necessary in the light of rampant violation of Covid-19 regulations. This is not a lockdown, but a temporary measure because of an emergency,” he said.“The government directives for wearing face mask, maintaining physical distancing and other such Covid-19 safety measures were being flouted both by the vendors and shoppers in the two rehri-patri (street side) markets despite repeated instructions and warnings by officials,” he added.The Nangloi market association expressed relief over the withdrawal of the order and claimed that officials sealed the market despite all norms being followed.“It was wrong to seal the market.

23-11-2020||Lucknow||UP: Winter sets in, Lucknow has coldest November in three years as mercury drops to 9.5°C||November this year is turning out to be the coldest since 2017 with the early morning temperature in Lucknow dipping to 9.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday, which is two degrees Celsius below normal.Last year this month, the lowest temperature was 12.6 degrees Celsius on November 20 and in 2018, it was 10.2 degrees Celsius on November 8.In 2017, the lowest temperature was 8 degrees Celsius on November 24. The lowest-ever temperature for the month was 3.9 degrees Celsius on November 29, 1952, according to the Indian Meteorology Department (IMD) website.Also this year on November 16, Lucknow experienced a record highest single day rainfall measuring 26 mm in more than a decade for this month.Also read | More girls being adopted by foreign couples, UP gives credit to Mission Shakti programmeThe minimum temperature has dropped in several other cities of Uttar Pradesh as well. The night temperature in Varanasi dropped to 9.4 degrees Celsius which was 4 degrees below normal. The city of ghats witnessed its coldest November in a decade. In the last decade, the lowest temperature in Varanasi was 10 degrees Celsius recorded in 2017 and 2013.With 10 degree Celsius, Kanpur recorded lowest temperature in November this decade. The minimum temperature in Agra was 9.4 degrees Celsius.Experts say the nip in the early morning air is due to snowfall in hills including Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. “It’s unusual for the minimum temperature to drop to single digits in November. Winter is setting in early this year,” said professor Dhruv Sen Singh of Lucknow University.“The drop in the minimum temperature is mainly because of a combination of cold winds blowing from the snow-clad Western Himalayan region as well as largely clear skies in Lucknow. When there is no cloud cover, the heat trapped in the ground dissipates fast, resulting in lower temperatures,” said JP Gupta, IMD director in Lucknow.He said snowfall in the Himalayas was an annual phenomenon, which impacts the temperature in all of northwest India, but local factors such as the absence of a cloud cover play an important role.The maximum temperature in Lucknow, however, was 24.4 degrees Celsius, which was 3.2 degrees below normal.The forecast for the next 24 hours is mist in the morning and clear sky thereafter. The maximum and minimum temperatures will be around 26 and 9 degrees Celsius respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-winter-sets-in-lucknow-has-coldest-november-in-three-years-as-mercury-drops-to-9-5-c/story-b59OHTqkJnZgtgMOEkoNpM.html

From his checked-in baggage, we recovered a packet full of a white powder which was tested to be cocaine. The total recovery is 990 grams worth Rs5.94 crore,” said a Customs officer from the airport.

Officials said that a depression has formed over the Bay of Bengal near the Tamil Nadu-Puducherry coast and is likely to intensify further into a cyclone. “The system is sucking winds from all directions as a result of which cold and dry northerly winds are passing through Kolkata and other districts. This has helped to bring down the temperature,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/kolkata-residents-feel-winter-chill-as-mercury-drops-to-15-degrees-celsius/story-vX5FggyAW4Qh4IRbUXJ6RL.html
23-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: As Covid-19 cases rise, govt warns of a lockdown if people ignore guidelines||As Covid-19 cases start rising Maharashtra again, a concerned state government has warned of a lockdown. The Covid-19 pandemic had been brought under control in Maharashtra thanks to the restraint and discipline of the citizens, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said Sunday, but he also warned that if people did not continue to follow safety measures, it could trigger a second wave “like a tsunami”. The warning came as Maharashtra clocked over 5,000 cases for the fifth consecutive day, taking the tally to 1,780,208, with 5,753 new infections on Sunday. Nearly 20% of the cases recorded on Sunday came from Mumbai alone, where 1,135 new infections were recorded. The state had clocked fewer than 5,000 cases for nine days in a row till November 17, with a daily average of 3,628 cases.Also Read: G-20 summit ends with support for Covid-19 vaccines for allThackeray said that Maharashtra was at a crossroads in its fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and warned people that there could be another lockdown if appropriate behaviour was not followed.“Delhi, Ahmedabad, and some western countries have seen a surge in cases again... We are at a crossroads now. Today, the numbers have come down in Maharashtra. We have to decide which way we want to go. Do we want to go the lockdown way? We need to take control of our actions right now. The vaccine will come when it does, but for now, masks, social distancing and sanitisation are the only medicines to stay away from coronavirus,” Thackeray said.Health experts and the state administration are expecting a second wave to hit Maharashtra by December-end. The next eight-10 days are crucial to ascertain how huge the surge might be.The chief minister, in his address to the state, said that he’s been advised by some to impose night curfew like in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. “Some people are suggesting to me that there should be night curfew. But not everything can be done by enacting laws. We did not ban firecrackers for Diwali and instead we appealed to the people to exercise caution. And they followed. Similarly, I’m appealing to you not to venture out of your homes unnecessarily,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-as-covid-19-cases-rise-govt-warns-of-a-lockdown-if-people-ignore-guidelines/story-nKsjWT7A8EvUmdaSNpnTzN.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi to experience misty morning; partly cloudy sky later in the day: IMD||With a further drop in temperature, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday forecast a minimum temperature of 8 degree Celsius and a maximum of 25 degree Celsius in the national capital.As per the IMD forecast, Delhi will experience fog or mist in the morning and partly cloudy sky later in the day.Minimum temperatures continued to drop in most parts of northwest India on Sunday and Monday. Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of only 6.5 degrees Celsius, 5 degrees below normal until 6.30am.IMD data shows that Delhi recorded 7.3 degrees Celsius on November 28, 2006. It was the previous record for the lowest minimum temperature since IMD began maintaining data from 1990. The lowest ever minimum temperature was recorded on November 28, 1938, when the minimum temperature dipped to as low as 3.9 degrees Celsius.IMD scientists have warned that this time the Capital is likely to have a colder winter than usual this year, because of a Pacific Ocean weather phenomenon known as La Nina, which leads to a cascading impact on global weather in winter months.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC), said local factors, too, have contributed to making days colder. “Delhi has had a cloudless streak, with only one western disturbance so far bringing in moisture. When there are no clouds, the ground cools faster and the minimum temperatures stay low,” he added.Experts said a western disturbance on November 23 will briefly cause a slight increase in temperatures. Once that passes, days and nights will become colder again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-experience-misty-morning-partly-cloudy-sky-later-in-the-day-imd/story-vAJ1ypLVcVKylt3YTrvnYL.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air quality remains poor, likely to deteriorate further||Air quality in Delhi remained in the higher end of the "poor" category on Monday morning. The air quality index (AQI) reading at 6 am was 279. The average AQI reading on Sunday was recorded as 274 in the "poor" zone. The air quality is likely to deteriorate to "very poor", as wind speed is likely to reduce from Monday night onwards, government agencies have forecast. As per System for Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the union ministry’s air quality forecasting wing forecast, air quality may deteriorate to "very poor" over the next two days on account of reduced ventilation and slow dispersion of pollutants. Also Read: Over 7 million litres of water sprayed in pollution hot spots: Delhi Fire deptBesides, the share of stubble burning to city’s PM2.5 levels on Sunday reduced to 12% from 13%. As per India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists, the average wind speed may reduce to 5-6 kmph, not favourable for dispersion of pollutants. “Due to a Western Disturbance in the Western Himalayan Region, which impacts Delhi as well, the wind speed is likely to reduce while the minimum temperature is likely to rise slightly,” said a senior IMD scientist. On Sunday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 6.9 degrees Celsius, the lowest minimum temperature recorded in the month of November in 17 years, as a cold wave swept parts of the city. The last time when the minimum temperature in November dropped lower than Sunday’s was on November 30, 2003, when it was recorded at 6.6 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-quality-remains-poor-likely-to-deteriorate-further/story-FJG6NbOLDFuOrlePakdV6O.html

23-11-2020||City||800 students in Patiala school deprived of mid day meal ration for 7 months||A shoddy implementation of the Mid Day Meal Scheme in Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s home district deprived 800 students of the ration allotted to them for seven months despite the Centre’s directions to ensure regular supply of the same to children during the closure of schools. The Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD) in March had directed all the states to provide mid-day meal to students on monthly basis when a countrywide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus. These 800 children study at Government Model Senior Secondary School, Pheelkhana, and is situated just 2 kilometres from the CM’s residence in Patiala. The matter came to light when the teachers flagged the issue of principal Karamjeet Singh not providing them ration for distribution to students. The state education department has provided the school with the requisite ration till October that never reached the students. Principal Karmjeet Singh admitted that around 800 students remained deprived of the ration during this period. He, however, failed to give a satisfactory reply as why the ration was not provided. The school has just started distributing 3kg rice and wheat to each student against the sanctioned 14kg rice and wheat each. Mera Devi, mother of Sahil Kumar who studies in class 8 in the school, said, “I earn Rs 6,000 a month by working as a housemaid. My husband lost his job of tiffin service to paying guests during the lockdown. We cook food just once a day. If the school had provided us mid-day meal ration, at least my son could eat twice a day. Even till now they have not provided any ration for my son,” Jaitra (40), a housewife and mother of Khushi who studies in class 7, said, “My husband, a painter, struggles to make both ends meet. Khushi was completely dependent on mid day meal but she did not get it since the school was closed.” A teacher said, “The education department needs to conduct an inquiry to check what is going on in the school. The department will find several irregularities if the inquiry is conducted by officials of other district.” “The rest of the ration will also be delivered to the students soon,” said the principal. School education minister Vijay Inder Singla said, “I will direct the district education officer to look into the matter. Action will be taken against the person concerned if any irregularity is found.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/800-students-in-patiala-school-deprived-of-mid-day-meal-ration-for-7-months/story-b6awtKPXWnFMreI0ZPLMFK.html
23-11-2020||City||Gobind Singh Longowal remains frontrunner for SGPC president’s post, again||Incumbent Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal has again emerged as a frontrunner in the race for the top post in the upcoming annual elections despite facing allegations of mishandling of the issue of missing 328 Guru Granth Sahib saroops. Besides electing the president, the SGPC general house will assemble on November 27 to choose vice-president, junior vice-president, general secretary and the 11 executive members.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who takes a final call to choose the top brass of the gurdwara body, is meeting the SGPC members in Chandigarh these days. Longowal, who is serving as the president for last three consecutive years, is seen as trustworthy and loyal by the SAD chief. An SGPC member said, “Longowal is a perfect yes man for the Badals and this will go in his favour. He even takes minor administrative decisions with the consent of Sukhbir.” “If the incumbent president is replaced, some senior faces in the SGPC house such as Tota Singh and Jagir Kaur may feel jittery amid a threat of revolt. Keeping the reins in hands of Longowal will be a safe bet for SAD,” said a member from Ludhiana district after holding a meeting with Sukhbir.A former executive committee member known for dissent within the SAD, said, “He does not take any decision on his own. In the current scenario, Sukhbir is not likely to take any chance by giving the reins to someone who poses challenge to his authority.” Secondly, the Badals are facing challenge from the Dhindsas (Rajya Sabha member Sukhbir Singh Dhindsa and his son MLA Parminder Singh Dhindsa) who turned rebels and floated a splinter party with the same nomenclature ‘Shiromani Akali Dal’ adding a suffix ‘Democratic’ to it.“The Badals picked Longowal from the bastion of the Dhindsas. Till the Dhindsas pose a challenge to them, Longowal will remain their top choice,” he added.Talwinder Singh Butter, who writes on the gurdwara body affairs, said, “This is for the first time in the recent years that no other face has emerged as a frontrunner to replace the incumbent president ahead of the annual polls.” Though names of senior Akali leaders Jagir Kaur, who has been SGPC president earlier, and former Punjab minister Tota Singh, are also doing the rounds, their seniority is a hurdle in their way of getting the top post. During the SGPC budget session recently, Jagir Kaur had even questioned the ability of Longowal in dealing with the issue of the missing saroops.Incumbent general secretary Harjinder Singh Dhami is also being seen as a candidate for the job as an educated face but he lacks political influence. Balbir Singh Ghunas will be on the forefront in the race if the SAD wants Dalit face for the position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gobind-singh-longowal-remains-frontrunner-for-sgpc-president-s-post-again/story-vuBvOTkT1g3jr3Vksuo10N.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The flag wearer||He is sitting on his rickshaw saddle, by the arcades of a central Delhi avenue. It is late in the evening, and Pankaj Kumar is waiting for customers. He is in a very distinctive T-shirt—it is painted in stripes of saffron, white and green.“It is our tiranga,” he says, confirming that the shirt is modeled after the national flag. “The jhanda (flag) is a symbol of our country, it is our pehchan (identity), whether we are rich or poor, Bihari or Bengali.” Mr Kumar bought the shirt from a stall near the Red Fort. “It was expensive,” he notes, saying he had to shell out 250 rupees. This is almost as much as his daily income. He makes about 300 rupees everyday. “I know it is very low,” he says somberly, explaining that this drop in earnings took place following the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic. “Earlier I would earn one hundred rupees a hour, and if I was pedaling for 12 hours straight I would make 1,200 rupees daily.”In his late 20s, Mr Kumar, a native of Begusarai in Bihar, has been in the city since childhood, and has been a rickshaw puller for more than a decade.Looking down at his shirt, he says that he takes very good care for it. “It represents our country’s flag. I cannot disrespect it,” he murmurs, his tone solemn and grave. Usually, he would wear the same shirt continuously during his working hours, day after day until it wears off, “but this one is so nice, I want to last it longer... I wear it every other day, and give it a wash when I’m not wearing it.”Mr Kumar uses a public tap for washing and bathing. His house in Delhi is his rickshaw, he says, “where I sleep, eat and work.” Every night he returns to a patri (pavement) near the New Delhi railway station where he parks his rickshaw for the night. “That’s a night thikana (destination) for many rickshaw-wallas like me.... we all sleep on our respective rickshaws.“What will happen when the T-shirt gets too frayed for daily wear? “Usually I throw away my clothes, but this one... “ — here he pauses, probably considering the disposal of the wear in question for the first time. “I will fold it carefully and keep it in the baksa (box) under my rickshaw’s seat.... it’s a nishani (mark) of our desh (country).”Meanwhile, another rickshaw puller arrives, eavesdrops on the conversation and consequently gazes upon Mr Kumar’s shirt to see what the fuss is all about.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-flag-wearer/story-I82aeiFiEsT0vn6JydUloI.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 pushes tourism in Delhi to the edge||Satyam Bhatnagar runs a handicrafts shop in Paharganj’s main bazar, a backpackers’ paradise that boasts of hundreds of touristy establishments such as money changers, hotels, rooftop restaurants, tour operators, and handicrafts shops selling a range of stone and wood sculptures, puppets and magnets featuring Delhi monuments. His shop, Bhatnagar says, always saw a steady stream of foreign tourists before the Covid-19 pandemic hit in March. “But in the past seven months, I have not seen a single foreigner in the market which once teemed with tourists from all over the world at any hour of the day. Our sales are almost down to zero,” he says. The pandemic has almost wiped out tourism in Delhi. Paharganj, once a bustling, thriving market whose entire economy depends on foreign tourists, is a microcosm of the devastation caused by the ongoing coronavirus crisis in the capital’s tourism sector. The otherwise popular city tours conducted by Delhi Tourism ---a Delhi government undertaking that facilitates tourism in the city --- have no takers. Travel and tour operators in the city complain of the loss of lakhs of jobs and see no hope of their return in the near future.This is quite a sad turn for the tourism industry in Delhi, a city which last year was ranked 11th in the list of ‘Top 100 city destinations’ in the world by Euromonitor International, a global market research agency. Besides, it was among the country’s top four destinations with about 29 lakh foreign tourists arriving in the city in 2019, according to India Tourism statistics. This is peak travel season, and yet Paharganj wears a deserted look. No wonder then, on a bright, balmy November afternoon, Subhash Vij’s mood is dark as he sits inside his handicrafts shop filled with incense sticks, smoking pipes, designer cotton bags, and a host of brass and wood souvenirs. “Eighty per cent of our customers were foreign tourists, most of them from countries such as the US, the UK, Israel, Russia, Korea and Japan. Unlike other markets, which are thriving ever since the lockdown was lifted, shop keepers here have no business at all, as 80 per cent of the business in the market depended on foreign tourists. With restrictions on tourist visas continuing, our market is the biggest victim of the pandemic,” says Vij, who is also president of the Paharganj Market Association. Over the years as the market became a favourite with backpackers, dozens of eateries—many of them run by expats and mostly catering to foreign tourists--- came up in the market. Most, including popular ones such as Brown Bread Bakery, an Italian restaurant run by Italian and German expats, have remained shut. “Unlike restaurants in other parts of the city I cannot afford to open mine till foreign tourists are back because almost all my customers were tourists, ” says Surinder Sharma, who owns Diamond Restaurant in the market. With over 800 hotels, Paharganj is also Delhi’s biggest hotel hub—and half of them are shut. “A large number of guests of these hotels were foreign tourists, with as many 100 hotels completely dependent on them, ” says Ajay Kumar Agarwal, president Paharganj Hotel Mahasangh. “Quite a significant number of tourists who visited Delhi lived in Paharganj’s budget hotels.” The first hotels here came up in 1972 to cater to the visitors to the Asia 72 Trade Show, held at the newly opened Pragati Maidan to celebrate 25 years of India’s Independence. In the 70s, Paharganj also became a regular part of the hippie trail. In the 1990s, it attracted a large chunk of Russian and Japanese budget tourists. The Asian Games, 1982, triggered a hotel boom here. As many as 70 -80 hotels had come up here then, with many locals turning their houses into hotels. Rajan Sehgal, member, managing committee, Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), says the city has roughly about 10,000 small and big tour operators, and about 3.5 lakh of the 5 lakh people employed in the city’s tourism sector have lost their jobs. “These jobs are not going to return any time soon because not just inbound tourism , but domestic tourism is unlikely to pick up in the near future,” he says. “We have lost 90 per cent of our business. We had eight employees, now we have only two. It is becoming impossible to sustain the business now,” says Anil Chetwani, managing director, CEE BEE CEE Travels and Tours. It is not just private travel and tour companies, even Delhi Tourism, too hardly have any takers for its many full and half-day guided city tours famous as Delhi Darshan , which it has been conducting for the past 40 years. The tours include visits to places such as Lakshmi Narayan Temple, Gandhi Smriti, Qutab Minar, Bahai’s House of Worship (Lotus Temple), Red Fort, Rajghat and Humayun’s Tomb. “ Most of our local and outstation guided tours have remained suspended as there are hardly any bookings for them. Besides, there is only 25 per cent footfall in our various properties such as Dilli Haat across the city. We do not see the situation changing in the next few months,” says Sanjay Goel, MD, Delhi Tourism. With no tourists coming to the city, among the worst hits are tour guides. The city has about 1,200 tourists guides approved by Union ministry of tourism; and another 5,000 irregulars. Most tour guides depended on freelance assignments from tour and travel operators, and on an average made about Rs 35,000 a month in the peak season. They have had no work in the past eight months. “Eighty per cent of the people in the group tours I conducted were foreigner tourists. I have not got any assignment since February. This is a peak tourist season, which lasts from October to March, and I have no work. I have never faced such a grim situation in the past 23 years that I have worked as a tour guide. I do not know how l would survive,” says Anand Kumar Pandey, a government-approved tour guide in Delhi. Sehgal believes that the government should promote golf tourism in Delhi and NCR which, with its many world-class golf courses can become a hot golf tourism destination. “There is a going to be a great demand for golf tourism in the post-Covid world. After all, it is a perfect sport for social distancing, ” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-pushes-tourism-in-delhi-to-the-edge/story-2kbTFF5LkpQXDsfZr5ffpN.html

In a live telecast, Khattar appealed to the people to wear masks and maintain social distance. Stating that last nine months experience teaches us to be careful while fighting this battle, the chief minister said the state government is making provisions to provide masks in adequate quantity. “The fine amount of ₹500 or ₹2,000 for not wearing masks does not matter much as everything cannot be cured with penalty. But those who break the rules again and again must be punished.” he said, informing that health department has been directed to make one crore masks. He said that so far, about 32 lakh people have been tested which is about 12.5% of the total population of the state. Regarding the possibility of imposing a lockdown again, the CM said it might create more problems. He said during the first lockdown, markets, factories and businesses were closed and that “we should ensure that there is no need to take such a step again.” Khattar said as every child was not able to get the benefit of online education due to lack of resources, a decision had to be taken to reopen schools. But recently, schools were closed till November 30 when quite a few students and teachers were found Covid-19 positive. Now, whenever schools will be opened, Covid-19 tests will be conducted in their houses or localities, he added. Appreciating them for donating crores towards Covid fund, he said that employees should stay away from strikes and dharnas during this time of crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/25-more-deaths-reported-in-haryana/story-yv9ETHbIYzcuo0luFAcdsN.html
23-11-2020||Mumbai||14 months on, Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank depositors yet to get RBI relief on withdrawals||Fourteen months on, there is no relief to around 17 lakh depositors of the scam-hit Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. On September 23, 2019, the RBI moratorium on the bank had barred the depositors from withdrawing money from all the 137 branches in six states. The apex bank regulator had first capped the withdrawal limit at Rs1,000. Later, depositors were allowed to withdraw money upto Rs50,000 in a six-month period, which was further increased to Rs1 lakh till December 22, 2020. PMC Bank’s top management is accused of unlawfully sanctioning around 73% of the bank’s loans to Housing Development Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) group of companies and favouring its promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang. The bank allegedly concealed HDIL’s non-performing assets (NPAs) from RBI. The depositors, who constitute over 37% senior citizens, said they are facing a financial crisis. According to the depositors, the RBI administrator informed them that the documents of the assets mortgaged with the bank are not in order and hence, their auctioning has been delayed, owing to which, the central bank is unable to provide any relief to the depositors. Nikhil Vora, 51, who represents the PMC Depositors’ Association, said, the RBI is “lethargic” in its approach. “In the past 14 months, RBI failed to auction the assets of the accused mortgaged with the bank and recover money. The apex regulator could not detect the irregularities in the documents while scrutinising them and now despite learning about the wrongdoings, they are not doing anything. Why would citizens trust the banking system?” said Vora, whose lifetime earnings are stuck in the bank. “The depositors have explored all the options – from meeting ministers to politicians to suggesting RBI all the possible measures to bring the bank back on track. However, all the efforts have gone in vain. For the past 14 months, the depositors are left to die. The elderly depositors have all of their life savings in the bank and were running their homes on the interest they used to get from the bank. They are now living under tremendous financial stress which worsened owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the time the restrictions were imposed on the bank, 95 people (depositors or their kin) have died, of which four died by suicide,” added Vora. Another depositor, Anita Lohiya, said that RBI resolved similar issues pertaining to Yes Bank and Laxmi Vilas Bank in no time, but is not “concerned” about the lakhs of depositors of PMC Bank. “After deaths of more than 90 depositors, the RBI has not woken awakened. This is so frustrating for us. The finance minister said that now cooperatives banks are at par with commercial banks and the RBI has the power to save them. Yes Bank was saved in 13 days, while Lakshmi Vilas Bank will be saved in a month, but it’s been 14 months since PMC Bank depositors are facing problems. Passing the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act in the Parliament was just a waste of time.”She said the depositors will sit on a hunger strike for 10 days from Tuesday opposite the RBI headquarters. “If the central bank fails to resolve the issue even after that, then the depositors will be on indefinite hunger strike,” added Lohiya. Initially, the depositors were hopeful that the prompt action taken by the city police’s economic offences wing (EOW) would lead to the recovery of money from the accused, but nothing fruitful came out. “The police have far lesser scope for recovery in such a banking fraud. EOW has already shared details of the assets of the accused linked to the irregularities at the bank to the RBI administrator. The recovery of money by auctioning the mortgaged properties is the [central] bank’s duty and not of the police. So it would not be correct to expect recovery in the case from police. But we will ensure that the offenders are prosecuted,” said an EOW officer. Fifteen people have been arrested in the case so far. “While one accused has been granted on medical grounds, 14 of them are in jail. We have filed three charge sheets in the case, detailing the role of all the accused behind the fraud. The roles of the top management of the bank, its directors, officials, evaluators and auditors have been clearly established in the investigation. Sufficient evidences were collected. The two accused who were rejected anticipatory bail from the courts are to be arrested. Forensic auditing is still going on and we are recording of statements of key witnesses before the magistrate,” said senior police inspector, Kishore Parab from EOW, who is the chief of the special investigation team probing the case. RBI said that the efforts to revive the bank are on. In the first week of November, the RBI administrator for PMC Bank, AK Dixit, had invited expressions of interest from prospective equity investors to identify a suitable investor or group of investors willing to take over the management control to revive the bank. The new investors could be financial institutions, including banks and Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFCs), micro-finance institutions controlled by residents, individuals, companies, societies, trusts or any other such entities. The administrator was forced to reach out to potential bidders to bail out the troubled lender with a minimum capital infusion of ₹3,500 crore. The decision to go for an open bidding process was prompted by PMC Bank’s failed attempts to receive any interest from other lenders as cooperative banks and scheduled commercial banks refused to bail out PMC Bank. PMC Bank had deposits worth ₹10,727.12 crore and advances of ₹4,472.78 crore and gross non-performing assets worth ₹3,518.89 crore as on March 31. Its share capital was ₹292.94 crore, and it registered a net loss of ₹6,835 crore in financial year 2019-20. The bank also has a negative net worth of ₹5,850.61 crore. Dixit wrote a letter to all the depositors, assuring them that a “meaningful resolution” is his top priority. “The bank has already initiated actions for the recovery of bad debts, including accounts of the HDIL group. We have intensified our recovery efforts through close follow up, settlements and legal action, as appropriate. We have taken aggressive steps to control costs and cut expenses. Branch network is being rationalised, premises are being surrendered and rents are being re-negotiated down,” stated his letter. He also assured depositors that he and his team are working in their best interest and that various options are being considered and discussions with different entities are going on. Dixit did not respond to phone calls or messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/14-months-on-punjab-and-maharashtra-co-operative-bank-depositors-yet-to-get-rbi-relief-on-withdrawals/story-og2fTEGtyuXQvGHAvtKdLL.html
23-11-2020||City||FIR against Punjab farmers for transporting urea||A joint team of agriculture department officials and police on Sunday intercepted a tractor trailer in Fatehabad and seized 300 bags from the procession of three Punjab farmers, who were carrying the fertiliser for wheat sowing. Farmers initially need DAP, but after three weeks of wheat and mustard sowing, the crop demands urea, which is helpful in growth of the crops.A day earlier, Jind police had registered an FIR against four Punjab farmers, who were allegedly transporting 840 bags of urea in four tractor trailers as the neighbouring state is facing shortage amid the wheat sowing season due to suspension of freight trains in Punjab over farmers’ agitation against three farm laws. Nearly 10 FIRs have been registered against Punjab farmers in Haryana for carrying urea. Mahabir Prasad, quality control inspector, Fatehabad, said they had booked a group of Punjab farmers under Section 3 of the Fertilizer (Movement Control) Act and Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act. “Fertiliser cannot be transported to another state without prior permission,” he added. A senior official of the agriculture department said farmers of the neighbouring state are buying urea from border areas of Sirsa, Fatehabad, Jind , Kaithal and Ambala. “We have directed the dealers not to sell urea to Punjab farmers because demand for the fertiliser is increasing in Haryana too. Some dealers have been selling urea to Punjab farmers at ₹50-70 more than the actual rates,” the official added.Abhay extends support to Punjab farmersExtending support to Punjab farmers, INLD’s Ellenabad MLA Abhay Singh Chautala said the farmers of the neighbouring state are sitting on dharna against three farm laws, which would ‘ruin’ the farming. “It is surprising that the police have been booking farmers for transporting urea from Haryana. The government’s claim of buying and selling commodities from any part of the country has fallen flat after state police seized urea bags from Punjab farmers and registered FIRs against them. The farmers living on Haryana-Punjab borders have family relations. Why can’t they buy urea and other things from any town of both the states,” Chautala questioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fir-against-punjab-farmers-for-transporting-urea/story-Ic0hgPLUc5Wd8m20rM9bIO.html

The deputy CM, who also holds the excise and taxation portfolio, has been battling the allegations of alleged irregularities pertaining to the sale of liquor during the lockdown. The new excise policy could not be implemented due to the lockdown. The old policy runs till the end of the financial year (March 31) and the new policy comes into effect from April 1. This year the new policy started from May 6. On Sunday, the excise department declared the figures for the first quarter (May 6 to August 19) and the second quarter (August 19 to November 18). “From May 6 to November 18, the department has collected ₹660 crore more revenue as compared to the corresponding six months of the previous year,” Dushyant Chautala said in a statement. He said the excise department will not only meet the target of raising ₹7,500 crore revenue as projected in the new policy, but also there is a possibility of generating about 25% additional revenue. He said in the first quarter (May 6 to August 19), a total revenue of ₹2,391 crore was generated in comparison to ₹2,142 crore during the same period last year. Similarly, in the second quarter (August 19 to November 18), ₹1,773 crore was collected, while in the second quarter last year this amount was ₹1,361. He said from the Covid cess, ₹195 crore has come to the treasury till the second quarter. The excise minister said the state government has made provisions in the excise policy to curb the practice of tax evasion and that the flow illicit liquor from neighbouring states has been curbed. “Due to the alertness of the officers of the department, every single rupee of excise revenue is coming into the treasury and that is why we are getting more revenue than the target,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-excise-department-generated-600-crore-more-revenue-this-year-dushyant/story-cGMZ29LixJRSs2t4oNihQM.html
23-11-2020||City||Farm leaders mobilise support for November 26 rally in capital||Ahead of their protest at Delhi against farm bills on November 26 and 27, farmer unions’ leaders from Haryana are visiting villages to ensure huge gatherings from the state for the two-day stir.Punjab farmers will also reach Haryana and join the local farmers for the march to Delhi. As per the information, farmers will enter the national capital from Delhi-Karnal highway, Delhi-Rohtak highway, Delhi-Agra highway and Delhi-Gurgram road. Union leaders said that most of the farmers, from Punjab too, will reach Delhi via NH 44 (Ambala-Karnal-Delhi). Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) state president Gurnam Singh Charuni said, “We are touring each and every village to ensure all farmers from the state reach Delhi and join this protest against the black laws enacted by the Centre.” He said that the support is overwhelming and the government cannot suppress the voice of farmers by using the police force. “The government is worried about the farmers’ protest and it may impose another lockdown citing increasing number of Covid-19 cases, but they cannot stop us. We will reach Delhi by our own”, said BKU (Tikait) state president Ratan Mann.The government so far has not made any announcement in this regard and it is not clear whether the farmers will be allowed to proceed. However, farm leaders said there is a strong possibility that the Haryana government will not allow Punjab farmers to enter the state and the government may issue instructions to the district administrations to prevent the farmers to move from one district to another. Haryana inspector general of police (law and order) Navdeep Virk said, “We are working out a solution, but it is for sure that nobody will be allowed to disturb the law and order in the state. The police will ensure the implementation of the government’s order.” It has been learnt that farmers, arhtiyas, labourers and people associated with mandis will also join the protest.The farm leaders have also got the support of employees and trade unions as their representatives have announced to observe a strike on November 26 to join the farmers’ protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farm-leaders-mobilise-support-for-november-26-rally-in-capital/story-8oHiMMpEXdCcMwm9X1eh9J.html
23-11-2020||City||Former Panipat councillor’s body fished out||Body of former Panipat councillor Harish Sharma was fished out of Delhi parallel canal near Khubru village of Sonepat on Sunday, three days after he jumped into it following the registration of an FIR against him and his daughter for allegedly selling firecrackers and assaulting a police team. Harish’s family and supporters held a protest at Panipat flyover, accusing the police of abetting his suicide and also blocked traffic on the NH 44.His daughter Anjali Sharma also joined the protesters and threatened to intensify the stir if no action is taken against the cops, who raided their residence on Diwali and booked them for selling firecrackers and assaulting cops. She also demanded for investigation to be handed over to the central bureau of investigation (CBI). BJP MP from Rohtak Arvind Sharma later reached the spot to pacify the protesters and assured them of action against the cops as per the findings of the investigation. He also said that he will talk to top police officials for registration of fresh FIR for abetment to suicide against the police officials who raided the Sharma’s residence. After a high drama of more than three hours and repeated assurances from Arvind Sharma on their demands, including registration of fresh FIR against the cops, formation of a special investigation team and government jobs to the next kin of Harish and Rajesh, the protesters agreed to lift the blockade. Panipat DSP Varinder Saini said that the police will act as per Anjali’s statement. “An investigation is being conducted by a special investigation team,” he added. A day after registration of FIR against him and his daughter, Harish had jumped into a canal, with his brother Satish and friend Rajesh Sharma also jumping after him for the rescue. Satish was taken out by a local diver, but Rajesh couldn’t be saved. Haryana home minister Anil Vij has already formed a committee under ADGP Sandeep Khirwar for investigation in the case and two cops, who led the raid at Sharma’s residence, have been suspended. As per the information, the MP also arranged a telephonic conversation of Anjali with chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. The police also had to resort to using mild force to disperse the protesters to ensure smooth passage of traffic. Some protesters also sustained minor injuries, it has been learnt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-panipat-councillor-s-body-fished-out/story-wwolJNfR6hedJlx8gkj0ZK.html

23-11-2020||City||Ludhiana plastic factory blaze: Firemen’s families rue bureaucratic apathy||Families of the nine firemen, who lost their lives in the 2017 plastic factory fire and the subsequent building collapse, gathered near the tragedy site at Suffiyan Chowk on Sunday, to mark the third anniversary of the tragedy. In all, 16 persons had lost their lives in the incident, of which nine were firemen. Paying homage to their loved ones, the family members expressed disappointment over the bureaucratic apathy towards them. They claimed that the authorities seem to have forgotten the sacrifice of the firemen.Sixty-four-year-old Malkit Singh, who is the father of deceased fireman Manpreet Singh, said, “It has been three years since my son’s death but so far, no one in my family has been offered a job on compassionate grounds. Even those who were offered a job, have been recruited on probationary basis which is unfair.”Navan Hans, son of firefighter Manohar Lal who died in the incident, said that for the past two years, they had been holding a path (prayer ceremony) at the central fire station, near Laxmi Cinema but this time, they were denied permission. “We were told to look for another venue, following which, we approached the rickshaw factory located adjacent the tragedy site. During the plastic factory fire, the rickshaw factory had also suffered a lot of damage. When we approached the factory owner, he happily agreed and allowed us to organise the prayer meeting here,” said Hans.He added while honouring 14 other firemen for their bravery last year, the Centre had stated that the families of the firemen who died in the Ludhiana factory fire will be provided certain allowances. “But so far, we have received nothing—neither by the Centre nor the state government,” said Hans.Congress MLA Surinder Dawar, zonal commissioner Jasdev Singh Sekhon and the fire department officer visited the sport and paid their respects. Family members claimed that they had sent invitations to mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal too, but they did not turn up.Despite repeated attempts, MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal was not available for comments. Mayor Sandhu, meanwhile, said, “I share a personal connect with the families of firefighters who laid down their lives for others. I make it a point to attend all their programmes. Today, I was out of town due to a family function. And despite my best efforts, I could not make it back on time. I had intimated the families about it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-plastic-factory-blaze-firemen-s-families-rue-bureaucratic-apathy/story-Op9n424G7gghOxmIwGztYN.html
23-11-2020||City||Maratha community to send one lakh petitions to Supreme Court for vacation of stay on reservation||More than two months after a three-judge Supreme Court (SC) bench put an interim stay on the reservations for Marathas in government jobs and school admissions, the community members have started a movement to plead the top court for the vacation of the stay by sending 1 lakh postal petitions. The community has been agitating after the bench stayed the implementation of the reservation and transferred the petition to a constitutional bench on September 9. The Maratha community was granted 12% reservations in employment and 13% in admissions two years ago under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018. Owing to the stay by the Apex court on the implementation of the reservations, the junior college and medical course admissions in the state have been stalled. The Maharashtra government has requested the Chief Justice of India, through four applications in the past six weeks, to form a constitution bench to hear the reservation petition at the earliest. The 18-page petition by the community members states that the SC bench set aside the Bombay high court decision (HC), permitting the implementation of the reservations, without going into the factual aspects of the matter. “The reservation has been stayed without giving an opportunity of hearing to the members of the aggrieved SEBC category. The reservation to the Marathas has been stayed when there is 42% reservation given for 43% population, which excluding the reservation for SC (Scheduled Castes)/ST (Scheduled Tribes) and SEBC, is 62% reservation in the state. The 103rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 2019, has nullified the limit of 50% reservation and the existing reservations have been protected till the date of enactment. This means the reservation to Marathas, which was in existence by then, has been protected,” their petition stated. It further read that the reservation to Marathas was given in an extraordinary and exceptional situation and the HC had justified it under three grounds. “The situation arises because of an erroneous exclusion of Marathas for seven decades. Secondly, the reservation was given on the basis of the quantifiable data and recommendations by the state backward classes commission. The extraordinary situation has also arisen as 85% of the state population is backward,” the petition read, while quoting the HC order given last year. Balasaheb Sarate, a community leader who is a part of the movement, said, “The petition covers all the factual aspects, legal points and substantial questions of law for the attention of all the judges. Till date, more than 5,000 applications have been sent through registered post and email and the number is expected to reach 25,000 in a week. More than 2,500 community members have signed the online petition. In the first phase, at least one lakh applications will be submitted under our ‘One family, One Application’ drive. The community had submitted about 2 lakh memorandums to the state backward classes commission in 2018 as part of the collection of the quantifiable data. This movement too will get similar support.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maratha-community-to-send-one-lakh-petitions-to-supreme-court-for-vacation-of-stay-on-reservation/story-G1nezCCVssY5tQfx6BxvGI.html

As many as four cases of snatching, two cases of vehicle lifting and eight cases of burglaries have been reported in the city since November 15. The number of these crimes was much lower between November 9 and November 15, when the Ludhiana police had deployed around 2,500 personnel across the city to control the law and order situation amid the festive rush. The police had also formed 120 patrolling teams and set up 125 checkpoints at various points in the city during this period. The security plan clearly worked and only four cases of snatching, burglary and vehicle lifting were reported in the week before Diwali. However, as police withdrew its personnel from the city markets and other public places, the crimes starting going up again. On November 17 alone, four cases of burglary and one case of snatching was reported in the city. Police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said, “The safety and security of citizens is our priority and we will increase patrolling and checkpoints in the coming days to deter such incidents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/crimes-go-up-in-ludhiana-as-cop-presence-goes-down-post-diwali/story-WjULbIhQUZLzUKXKfYNwHN.html

The meeting is likely to be held between chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and Maharashtra Congress chief and state minister Balasaheb Thorat to chalk out the next step to increase MVA’s strength in the upper house of the state legislature. The Raj Bhavan has not taken a call on the names yet. Though as per the constitutional provisions there is no time frame for the Governor to take a decision on the government’s recommendations, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray in his letter had requested Koshyari to take a call on the 12 names in 15 days, Sena minister Anil Parab said. “The CM has requested the Governor to take a decision in 15 days. It is a request, not a law. It is his (Governor’s) prerogative to accept the request or not. The 15-day period has ended and therefore, MVA leaders will meet to take a decision for the next course of action,” said Parab. When asked if the state government would move the court over the issue, Parab said, “For this, every aspect needs to be examined and only then can a decision be taken.” On November 6, a delegation of state ministers, including Parab, Amit Deshmukh (from the Congress) and Nawab Malik (from the Nationalist Congress Party) submitted the 12 names. While the Sena had sent the names of actor Urmila Matondkar, Nitin Bangude-Patil, Vijay Karanjkar and Chandrakant Raghuvanshi, the NCP had picked former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Eknath Khadse, farmers’ leader Raju Shetti, Yashpal Bhinge and Anand Shinde.

During patrolling, forest officials found four foetuses, around seven to eight weeks old, aborted near the carcass. At SGNP, forest officials said the 11-month-old tigress was brought to the national park around 7pm on Sunday from Chandrapur after covering a journey of almost 900km between since Friday. “The cub is healthy. She has been kept at a quarantined cage as per protocol. We will continuously monitor her health and allow her to settle first. Only then will we take a decision on relocating her closer to the rest of our tigers [at the safari area],” G Mallikarjuna, director and conservator of forest, SGNP said, adding, “The team that brought the cub to SGNP did not face any trouble during their long journey.” SGNP is now home to five female and one male Royal Bengal tigers. The cub was brought to SGNP after a failed reunion attempt with her mother at Chichpalli range of Chandrapur forest division in June. The forest department carried out a DNA matching study to accurately identify which tigress the cub belonged to but failed in reuniting them. “All tigresses at SGNP are dominant, and keep clear of the male tiger Sultan. We hope the female cub will help improve the breeding programme of the tiger safari,” said Mallikarjuna. Meanwhile, the pregnant tigress found dead at Umred was at compartment number 1452/1 of the TAS beat, which was within the forest area, and about 3 km away from a nearby village. “As per our observations during the post mortem and circumstantial evidences, prima facie, the tigress died due to infighting with another animal, most likely another tiger,” said Ravikiran Govekar, field director, Pench Tiger Reserve, adding, “The body was found dragged to about 50-m inside the forest. Several signs and indications of infighting were found near a stream in the area, including blood trails, multiple tracks of pugmarks, drag marks, and body hair spread in this region.” He added that the carcass was found eaten up from the left side with the rib cage broken. “There were puncture marks on the ventral neck (due to canines) and the death might have been caused due to asphyxia and bleeding,” he said. The carcass was disposed of as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) protocol. “The adult tigress was reported to have entered the UPK range in March, and thus was a new entrant to the sanctuary. We do not name tigers until they spend at least a year. In this case, it seems territorial dominance led to her death,” said Govekar. While samples of the carcass were collected for further examination, 25 camera traps across the area where the tigress was found dead will be used to collect additional information. “As there seems to be another tiger involved, we are monitoring the area to locate the animal to check whether it is injured. Additionally, further medical examination will help us explore and rule out all other possibilities for the tigress’ cause of death,” said Govekar. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-sgnp-gets-6th-tiger-pregnant-tigress-four-unborn-cubs-found-dead-at-maharashtra-s-umred-sanctuary/story-qdWwfYA1QOtki8FlGg7EOI.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi records 100-plus Covid-19 deaths for third consecutive day||The Capital recorded 6,746 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, as the city continued to combat a third wave of the disease, even as authorities continued to augment Delhi’s health infrastructure to ensure it was able to keep up with rising hospitalisations.In a grim statistic, the city saw over 100 deaths of the disease for the third day in a row, with 121 fatalities on Sunday — the second-highest single day toll so far. On Saturday, the state government’s daily health bulletin had recorded 111 deaths of the infection, and 118 on Friday. November 18 saw 131 deaths of the infection — the highest so far in a day.Meanwhile, the proportion of RT-PCR tests, considered the gold standard to diagnose Covid-19, continued to remain high in the city’s total-test count. Of the 54,893 tests conducted on Sunday, 42% were of the RT-PCR variety, while the remainder were done using the rapid antigen method.The Capital’s positivity rate, the percentage of tests that return positive, was 12.29% on Sunday. The World Health Organization (WHO), recommends that the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control in the region. In case the positivity rate rises, WHO recommends increasing testing numbers for prolonged periods of time till the number drops below 5%. Meanwhile, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said 400 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients were added to the city’s hospitals in the last three days — as part of a strategy aimed at augmenting Covid-19 ICU beds by 1,650.“Total Covid-19 beds were increased to 17,252 till yesterday (Saturday). We are further increasing beds across hospitals. Around 7,700 beds are currently vacant. In the last 3 days, 400 ICU beds have been increased in Delhi’s hospitals. ICU beds will be further increased in the next 2-3 weeks. Under the augmentation plan private hospitals will have 250 more ICU beds, Delhi government hospitals will have 650 more and 750 are supposed to be added in central government hospitals,” said Jain in a press briefing.A majority of hospital beds, especially intensive care unit (ICU) ones, continue to be occupied. By Sunday evening, hospitals across Delhi — both private and public ones — had 17,423 total Covid-19 beds, of which 7,967 were vacant. The government records further showed that there are 4,086 ICU beds, of which 734 are vacant.Jain had earlier said the government’s order directing around 90 private hospitals in the city to increase beds reserved for Covid-19 patients from 50% to 60% has added another 2,644 beds.The increased Covid-19 deaths in Delhi have added to the burden of crematoriums. Jain said, “The municipal agencies have assured us that there will be no hassles in cremating Covid-19 patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-records-100-plus-covid-deaths-for-third-consecutive-day/story-VPAB7wCyZIzUc0mcrCF3sI.html
23-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra saw highest leopard deaths in 5 years in 2020||The state saw 159 leopard deaths between January and November 2020, the highest in at least five years, and the decade’s highest human kills in leopard attacks (23), according to the forest department data. According to data from the office of the state’s principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF-wildlife), of the 159 deaths, 80 were natural, 64 were accidents (road accidents, train accidents, falling in open wells, and hunting by dogs), two were electrocuted, and 13 were poached. Last year, 110 leopard deaths were recorded in Maharashtra – 66 natural, 35 accidents, and nine poaching cases. There were 88 deaths in 2018 (54 natural, 27 accidents, seven poached), 86 deaths in 2017 (55 natural, 21 accidents, nine poaching and one electrocution), and 89 in 2016 (53 natural, 29 accidental, and seven poaching cases). Meanwhile, prior to 2020, 17 human kills by leopards were reported in 2013, followed by 14 in 2011, 2015 and 2017. Last year, 12 people were killed in leopard attacks. “Increasing leopard deaths and kills by the animal in 2020 is a result of considerable rise in their population,” said Nitin Kakodkar, PCCF (wildlife), Maharashtra, adding, “While there is no population estimation study so far, cases are being reported from across the state as the animals are spread all over (rural, urban, and agricultural fields, forests). While people have learnt to live with this animal in most areas, leopards, too, are adaptable to threats around them. These factors have allowed their numbers to rise.” Kakodkar said there was a rise in poaching incidents this year too, owing to isolated cases in different parts of Maharashtra during the lockdown. The state forest department plans to conduct a population estimation exercise of leopards over the next two years. The forest department on Sunday said an example of the rise in population was witnessed at Sangareshwar sanctuary in Sangli (one of the smallest sanctuaries in Maharashtra) where leopard sighting was observed for the first time. “We have planned to go in for a sampling-based approach for all regions. While leopard numbers seem to be most in western Maharashtra, we have identified hotspots where most leopard deaths or human kills have been reported. They include Nashik, Nagar, parts of Marathwada, especially Aurangabad, Ratnagiri, and the entire sugarcane belt of Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli, north Maharashtra and Marathwada,” said Kakodkar. Delhi-based Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI) estimates the number of leopard deaths in Maharashtra has been the highest in at least 10 years with 30 deaths in 2010, 34 in 2011, 43 in 2012, 36 in 2013, 41 in 2014, and 46 in 2015. WPSI data also showed Maharashtra had recorded 22 leopard kills in road accidents in 2018, 19 kills in road accidents and three in train accidents in 2019, and 19 road accidents and one train accident in 2020. “Fragmented forests and more linear infrastructure planned outside forests have worsened the situation in Maharashtra,” said Tito Joseph, programme coordinator, WPSI. Independent experts said there was a need for a mitigation focused approach to address the issue. “We really do not know what is happening on ground at the moment, and the cases being reported are a fraction of what they actually may be. With so many leopards, the number of human deaths is currently low across Maharashtra. For years, in areas like Nashik and Aurangabad, there has not been a systematic conflict resolution programme. An example of a successful approach is Mumbai, where people and leopards have learnt to live in co-existence and there have been absolutely no cases of human deaths. Thus, such a model carried out after stakeholder engagement needs to be replicated through a well-drafted program across hotspots identified by the department,” said noted human-leopard conflict expert Vidya Athreya, wildlife biologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society-India. Meanwhile, scientist from Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, Bilal Habib is presently undertaking a four-year study at the Junnar landscape (Pune) where a population estimation exercise will be done to understand the behavior of animals, how they hunt and how they use the human-dominated landscape. Ten leopards would be radio-collared under this exercise. “There is a need to think about strategies as soon as these numbers (deaths) start pushing up. We may need to think of a committee constituted to solve the tiger problem in Chandrapur district, for leopards as well. The focus should be on areas where leopards are actively breeding. Studies like ours at Junnar may help develop basic understanding of the issue and can be replicated across other problem areas in the state,” said Habib. The recent deaths Recent leopard deaths included a three-to-four-year-old pregnant leopard (carrying three unborn cubs) in a road accident on the Western Express Highway near Kashimira, Mira Road last Sunday. Another leopard was killed in a road accident on Saturday near Satara on the National Highway 4 that connects Pune and Bengaluru. “I will be directing local authorities to identify problem areas within their jurisdiction where mitigation measures are needed,” said Kakodkar, adding, “The spurt in population is causing more road and train accidents. On the main roads like Ghodbunder, there is a need for more speed breakers, signages, and similar mitigation measures that are being worked out with Sanjay Gandhi National Park forest staff.” Last week, two human deaths (a father and a son) killed in leopard attacks were reported from Aurangabad and another person killed prior to that from Jalna. Earlier this year, around 20 leopards were trapped along a 12-km stretch along the Darna River (between Sinnar and Eklahare) where leopard numbers had risen significantly leading to a surge in conflict with five deaths and five serious injuries reported since December 2019. “The entire sugarcane belt provides a lot of water, it provides good prey density, and due to long term harvesting, it provides a lot of security to these carnivores. It is a safe haven for leopards. That is the reason, leopard numbers have grown tremendously. The houses in this belt are not separated from the sugarcane fields. There are instances of farmers walking out of their house and being face to face with leopards leading to conflict. Apart from awareness not much is possible in these areas,” said Kakodkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-forest-department-plans-survey-to-check-on-state-of-leopards/story-ZRshA0gppscC3CKwNn4GjK.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots conspiracy: Police file charge sheet against Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam||Delhi police on Sunday filed a charge sheet against Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and Faizan Khan in the case of the conspiracy behind the Delhi riots. This is a supplementary charge sheet. Earlier, the police had charged 15 persons in the same case but did not name Khalid, a former JNU student leader. The police have arrested at least 21 people, including the three named in the fresh charge sheet, for planning and orchestrating the riots. In the charge sheet, the special cell of the police have claimed that the riots, which broke out in different parts of north east Delhi in February, were not spontaneous but was planned by some prominent voices of the anti-Citizen Amendment Act protests such as Khalid and Imam at the protest sites. Among those who were named in the main charge sheet were former councillors Tahir Hussain and Ishrat Jahan. The police have invoked the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) against the arrested accused in the case. The main charge sheet lists statements by protected witnesses, WhatsApp messages of different anti-CAA groups, call detail records and other evidence to support charges against the accused. Delhi police’s additional spokesperson Anil Mittal said the 930-page supplemetary charge sheet against the three accused -- Khalid, Imam and Khan -- was filed on Sunday in the court of Amitabh Rawat, special judge, Karkardooma courts. The matter is listed for hearing on Monday.Mittal said the trio were charged under sections of UAPA and IPC sections of criminal conspiracy,.murder, attempt to murder, rioting, among others. Police said they have also been charged under sections of illegal possession of arms and under Prevent of Damage to Public Property Act (PDPPA), the officer said.On Friday, a Delhi court extended the judicial custody of Khalid and Imam till November 23. Faizan Khan, who was granted bail last month, was arrested by Delhi Police on July 29, and is alleged to have been part of the conspiracy hatched by a group of prominent anti-CAA activists, local politicians, student activists and some local residents in February 2020.Khan had allegedly supplied and activated the SIM card registered fraudulently in the name of one Abdul Jabbar, but had given it to Tanha and was used by Safoora Zargar. Tanha and Zargar have also been arrested in the case of the conspiracy behind the Delhi riots. The communal clashes had started in north east Delhi on February 23 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/riots-conspiracy-police-file-charge-sheet-against-umar-khalid-sharjeel-imam/story-zEJEzCfcOvstKyjUZlccDP.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt temporarily shuts two markets in West district after Covid-norm violations||The state government on Sunday temporarily shut two makeshift markets in west Delhi district, citing rampant violations of Covid-19 regulations concerning wearing masks in public places and social distancing.The two markets, in Punjabi Bagh and Nangloi localities, will remain shut till November 30, as per an order issued by the office of the concerned district magistrate. HT has seen the order.“Both these markets are unauthorised and comprise around 100 makeshift shops selling goods ranging from garments to kitchen utensils. The crackdown was necessary in the light of rampant violation of Covid-19 regulations. This is not a lockdown, but a temporary measure because of an emergency,” said a senior government official.Meanwhile, senior leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday launched RT-PCR testing facilities in assembly constituencies and distributed masks across the city.RT-PCR [reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction] tests are considered the most accurate diagnosis for Covid-19.The AAP’s initiative to distribute masks across Delhi started on Saturday, a day after the government implemented increased penalties, hiked from ₹500 to ₹2,000 — for not wearing masks, spitting and not adhering to social distancing rules in public places. The initiative was discussed in an all-party meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress have initiated similar initiatives as well.The first major RT-PCR drive through mobile vans was launched by Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha, who also distributed masks in his assembly segment. “Increased RT-PCR testing is an effective way of knowing how much Covid-19 has spread in Delhi. We don’t want to be a mere statistic, but take proactive and effective steps to contain the spread of this dreadful pandemic. I’ve also observed several people wearing their masks incorrectly. It must be understood that the mask goes over the nose, not under it. That defeats the purpose of wearing one,” said Chadha.“There is no medicine to treat Covid-19. You can only protect yourself and your family by wearing a mask and following social distancing,” said Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj.“If you love your family and are worried about their life, do not leave the house without wearing a mask,” said Malviya Nagar MLA Somnath Bharti.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain and environment minister Gopal Rai also participated in the mask distribution drive on Sunday. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had distributed masks in his assembly constituency Patparganj on Saturday.While the revenue districts and the police continue distributing free masks, several market welfare associations in the city too have now joined hands in the initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-temporarily-shuts-two-markets-in-west-district-after-covid-norm-violations/story-PSpEtV1nnG8ikfT2d0jKLN.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Covid-19 lockdown rumours hit business in city markets||In east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar wholesale market, Akashdeep Balli pulled out a stack of packed jackets from a shelf in his shop as few eager customers asked him about the possibility of stock clearance rebates.As Balli wholeheartedly agreed, his neighbouring shop owners came out yelling higher discounts in the light of a “lockdown” which, they said, can be imposed any time due to a surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi.There is anxiety among traders in Delhi about a possible lockdown, even as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and several other senior leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) insist that it is out of question.Click here for complete coverage on Covid-19“This is the time of the year when the second round of trade for winter apparels take place. The first round happens in October. In late-November, most traders go for another round to refill their stocks. As small-time wholesalers, we are not going for the second round this year fearing a lockdown. Instead, we are only focussing on clearing current stocks at a discount and keep a close eye on the Covid-19 numbers and trends,” said Balli.In Delhi, several traders said rumours about the possibility of a lockdown was already in place during the festive season in October, largely backed by the high numbers of daily Covid-19 cases and deaths.The anxieties were triggered last week when the chief minister said that he has written to the central government asking permission for temporarily closing down markets, which are assessed as potential Covid-19 hot spots. Senior officials said that the government has not received anything on this regard from the Centre yet.Also Read | Delhi records 100-plus Covid deaths for third consecutive dayA Delhi government spokesperson said, “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has met the representatives of the market associations of Delhi to seek cooperation in controlling the rising cases of Covid-19 in the national capital. In the meeting, the CM was assured by the market associations that they will support the government to prevent coronavirus infections in the marketplaces.”“The CM clarified that the Delhi government does not want to shut down any market. He appealed to the market associations to provide masks to the shoppers who are visiting markets without masks. The Delhi government has no intention to hamper the ongoing economic activities but at the same time seriously monitoring the Covid situation. The government believes that with the participation of market associations, volunteers and the people of Delhi the situation will improve soon,” the spokesperson added.However, despite clarifications and assurances by the government, there is anxiety among traders in wholesale markets such as Gandhi Nagar and Sadar Bazar and prominent retail hubs such as Lajpat Nagar, Karol Bagh and Sarojini Nagar. HT visited these markets on Sunday.The wholesale markets such as Gandhi Nagar and Sadar Bazar are also a major source of garments for the thousands of local weekly markets, flea markets, and vendors operating without permanent shops in the prominent markets. So, temporary closing of one would have cascading effects on business in others, the traders said.“We are trying to convince traders that there will be no lockdown, with regular meetings, social media messages and video conferences, but it looks like the rumours and the fears have already affected the trade cycle – especially in winter apparels,” said Brijesh Goel, president of the chamber of trade and industry.A widely circulated message shared on WhatsApp which had a list of 16 prominent markets chosen for a “20-day lockdown” later this month also fanned fears. Senior government officials have dismissed the message as “rumours”. OP Gupta, president of wholesale garment traders’ association in Gandhi Nagar, said: “The anxieties have affected the winter garment business directly. And unsold stocks are a big problem because several designs go out of fashion in a year. Most traders are focusing on clearing unsold stocks now – often with big discounts. Fresh procurements entail risk. The market anyway has not recovered well from the shock of the first nationwide lockdown.”Devraj Baweja, president of general secretary of confederation of Sadar Bazar traders’ association, said: “Even though some traders in Delhi markets are trying to procure fresh stocks, dismissing possibilities of a lockdown, they are facing difficulties too. Material for winter garments come mostly from Ludhiana (in Punjab) and Tiruppur (in Tamil Nadu). In those states, traders have heard about the lockdown rumours in Delhi and they have clearly started to anticipate problems in recovery of debts. So, they too are hesitating to sell more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-rumours-hit-business-in-city-markets/story-nQcFpcycWhCGc9rrx56V9M.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Appoint official for inquiry into misgovernance charges: Education min to DU||The Union education ministry has asked Delhi University (DU) to appoint a representative for the visitorial inquiry to be held into a litany of charges related to administrative misgovernance against suspended vice-chancellor Yogesh K Tyagi.According to a person aware of the development, the ministry has written to DU officials referring to a specific provision in the Delhi University Act that mandates a representative of the university be held in case an enquiry is held.It is learnt that the office of President Ram Nath Kovind, who is the Visitor to central universities, had raised the issue.After the President’s office flagged the issue, the ministry is learnt to have informed the university that sub-section (3) of Section 7 of the DU Act, which pertains to the matter, needs to be followed in case of an enquiry. The ministry has also told the varsity that mandatory compliance of the provision is important to ensure that any challenge at a later stage can be defended.According to the sub-section concerned, the Visitor shall in every case give notice to the University of his intention to cause an inspection or inquiry to be made, and the University shall be entitled to appoint a representative who shall have the right to be present and be heard at such inspection or inquiry.Accordingly, the DU has been requested to appoint a representative who shall be present and have the right to be heard at the enquiry.The ministry has also sought clarification regarding some other aspects related to the enquiry from the varsity, the person cited above said.The ministry has pointed out that Section 45 of the DU Act provides that any dispute arising out of a contract between the University and any of its officers shall at the request of the officer, teacher or varsity itself be referred to a tribunal of arbitration.The ministry has sought to know from the varsity its view on whether this provision has a bearing on the present case. Delhi University (DU) Vice Chancellor Yogesh Kymar Tyagi was last month suspended and the process of initiating an enquiry into a range of charges of misgovernance and dereliction of duties began after a nod from President Kovind.According to an order issued by Union ministry of education joint secretary Chandra Shekhar Kumar, all orders issued with the approval of Yogesh Kumar Tyagi during the period of his absence on medical grounds, after pro-VC Joshi assumed charge as acting VC on July 17 this year, were set aside and to be treated as null and void.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/appoint-official-for-inquiry-into-misgovernance-charges-education-min-to-du/story-jOEdB9TMi96yP7QMEpW7iK.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Over 7 million litres of water sprayed in pollution hot spots: Delhi Fire dept||With the rise in pollution levels in the national capital, the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) said it has sprayed around seven million litres of water, to suppress dust and other pollutants, over the past one month. The fire department sprays water at 13 hot spots in the city every morning and evening.Atul Garg, director, Delhi Fire Services (DFS) said the special drive was started on October 17. There are 13 hot spots identified in the city, where pollution levels are at their highest, including Okhla, Vivek Vihar, Punjabi Bagh, Rohini, Dwarka and industrial areas.“The spraying is done every morning for two hours and for about an hour-and-a-half every evening. Fifteen fire tenders are used every day and around 200,000 litres of water is sprayed every day. This helps settle dust in the air and clean the trees,” Garg said.He said the department will continue the practice until pollution levels subside. A 2019 analysis of Delhi’s pollution sources done by Council on Energy, Environment and Water showed that vehicular emissions contributes to 39.2% of PM 2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) levels in the city. Dust from roadsides is a close second, and contributes 37.8%. In PM 10 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres), the contribution of road dust goes up to 65.9%, while construction activities contribute 21%. The Delhi government, as part of its anti-pollution campaign this year has identified road dust as a primary contributor to local pollution. Apart from directing construction agencies to ensure the installation of anti-smog guns, which spray water at construction sites, the government has also directed enforcement agencies such as the Public Works Department (PWD), the four municipalities of the city (north, south and east Delhi municipal corporations, and the New Delhi Municipal Council) to ensure regular water sprinkling. Delhi environment minister, Gopal Rai said that going into winters, when the pollution levels are at its worst in the city, the aim would be to utilise all the resources to minimize the impact of polluting sources.“All agencies will have to come together and fight pollution. In fact, not just the government agencies, people of Delhi will also have to join hands with the government in this fight against pollution,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-7-million-litres-of-water-sprayed-in-pollution-hot-spots-delhi-fire-dept/story-JZgPgIHwRVBSaUAgFPJfTJ.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Marginal drop in air quality, IMD forecasts higher pollution levels from Monday||Delhi’s air remained in the poor zone on Sunday, deteriorating marginally from a day before, according to data from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), as strong winds kept pollution levels from getting worse in the national capital.CPCB data shows that Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) on Sunday was 274, while on Saturday, this was recorded at 251, both in the ‘poor’ range. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said reasonably high wind speeds over the National Capital Region (NCR) have helped keep pollution levels in check. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the average wind speed recorded over the Capital on Sunday was around 10kmph. “On Saturday and Sunday, wind speeds were on the higher end, so the air quality has remained in the poor zone and not deteriorated much,” said Srivastava. He, however, warned that from Monday with the impact of a western disturbance over Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, wind over Delhi and its neighbouring satellite towns will slow down, causing pollution levels to rise. “From tomorrow (Monday), the wind speed is likely to slow down to around 6kmph,” he added. The Union government’s weather and air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), also said winds are forecast to slow down from Monday. “Slow winds and low ventilation is forecasted for November 23 and November 24. The AQI is likely to deteriorate to the middle end of very poor by tomorrow (Monday). It is likely to further deteriorate to the high end of very poor by November 24,” the Safar bulletin read. The Safar analysis also said that while instances of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana had reduced, they had not stopped completely. On Sunday, 649 fires in Punjab and Haryana contributed to 12% of levels of PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) in Delhi’s air.Meanwhile, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Sunday held a review meeting with the Public Works Department (PWD), where he was informed that the department had installed 23 anti-smog guns at key intersections and construction sites across the city. PWD officials in the meeting also assured that more will be installed, if necessary. Rai said PWD officials have also been instructed to sprinkle water on trees, roads and on the construction sites to combat dust pollution. “A total of 150 water tankers have been deployed for sprinkling water,” Rai said. He also said PWD officials have been instructed to increase this number to cover more locations. “I have also instructed PWD officials to increase the number of tankers further so that all of the city’s key roads can be covered. If necessary, we will install more anti-smog guns as well at key intersections in Delhi,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/marginal-drop-in-air-quality-imd-forecasts-higher-pollution-levels-from-monday/story-RZk2UVnDx7seG6Ow6AV2MI.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Vehicles and chaos back at pedestrian-friendly markets||Over a year since Karol Bagh market was made pedestrian-friendly, with decorative street lights, benches, flower pots, and bollards, it is back to its usual congested self. A ground check by HT on Sunday found the lane marked for emergency services on the Ajmal Khan Road has been taken over by vehicles, street lights have been stained by people chewing paan or gutkha spitting on them, and cars and two-vehicles parked near the benches meant for the shoppers to relax. Similar scenes were witnessed at east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar market, which was also made pedestrian friendly under a project by the municipal bodies to decongest city markets and make some portions no-go zones for vehicles. The municipal corporations had allowed vehicular movement in these markets in July on the insistence by the traders that they need to ramp up sales that were devastated due to the prolonged lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Now, the civic bodies have extended the relaxation given for vehicle movement by two months. Traders of the two markets had sought to extend relaxation till March next year. The civic authorities say that the current relaxation is likely to continue till January 2021. “Vehicular movement was allowed on traders demand due to the pandemic. It is a temporary relaxation. In January, there will be an assessment and efforts will be made to re-launch the pedestrianisation plan,” a senior North Delhi Municipal Corporation official said.Karol Bagh was the first shopping hub in Delhi to be pedestrianised, as part of which its main market road (Ajmal Khan Road) was restricted for vehicles in May last year. Similarly, around 1-km stretch between Chhachi Building and Ghondli Chowk in Krishna Nagar’s Lal Quarter Market was pedestrianised in October last year.Shoppers, however, said the experience was better with pedestrian facilities. “When there was no vehicular movement on the main road of the market, everything looked in order. But now, most of the space is taken over by vehicles. Many a times we have to sit on benches with cars parked just beside it,” Nikita Sangwan, a shopper in Karol Bagh market said.Murli Mani, president Ajmal Khan Road Traders Association, said due to Covid-19 pandemic sales went down by 60% and that restriction on vehicular movement will further restrict business.“Mostly shoppers use private vehicles. They do not want to use public transport due to Covid-19. If the main road is pedestrianised again, the customers will stop visiting the market. We have requested the civic body to extend relaxations till March but they have agreed to allow vehicular movement in the market till January 2021,” Mani said.Jagdish Vohra, president, Lal Quarter Market Association, said pedestrianisation should not be implemented till Covid-19 situation prevails.Jai Prakash, mayor north corporation, said, “It is an unprecedented situation which has badly hit the businesses. So, we also have to think about our traders and take necessary steps. These relaxations are temporary and pedestrianisation will be re-implemented when the situation improves.”Knowledge partner to the Union ministry of home affairs, Anuj Malhotra, who had assisted north and east corporations in making Karol Bagh and Krishna Nagar markets pedestrian friendly, said it was disappointing to see the vehicles running on a pedestrianised stretches. “Such relaxations should remain only temporary measures. The authorities should try to restore pedestrian-only stretches in both the markets,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vehicles-and-chaos-back-at-pedestrian-friendly-markets/story-BtwJW78n3naCi04bPUYM7J.html
23-11-2020||Delhi||Robber out on parole caught for stealing cop’s pistol||A man out on parole broke into a south Delhi house where five policemen lived and stole a service revolver and 10 bullets belonging to one of them, the police said on Sunday after arresting him and two of his suspected partners. The three had planned to use the revolver to rob a Karol Bagh-based jeweller, but were caught before they could execute their plan, said Sanjay Bhatia, deputy commissioner of police (central district). The police identified the suspects as Atul Bhardwaj and his associates Vipin and Vishal. Bhardwaj was to return to jail on November 30 after a 45-day parole in a robbery case, for which he was imprisoned in September this year. “On November 17, he broke into a rented home in south Delhi’s Kishangarh. At the time, he didn’t know that the house had been rented out to five policemen,” said the DCP. In a bag lying in the house was a service revolver and 10 cartridges belonging to a Delhi Police constable on security duty.“Bhardwaj thought he could sell the revolver at a good price,” the officer said. But later, he allegedly roped in two of his associates and planned to use the revolver to rob the jeweller. The police, meanwhile, were hunting for the man who stole the police’s gun. “On Friday night, we received a tip-off that the man who had stolen the police’s revolver would be visiting Karol Bagh to carry out a reconnaissance of a jeweller he planned to rob,” Bhatia said. The police laid a trap and nabbed him, and seized a country-made pistol and two bullets.At his instance, his two associates were also arrested and the stolen revolver and the bullets recovered from them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/robber-out-on-parole-caught-for-stealing-cop-s-pistol/story-fEcPPbH5CNO4LMP4nAHAoI.html

23-11-2020||Delhi||Decorated cop plotted extorting Rs 2 crore from Delhi builder, arrested||Five months after a builder in south Delhi made a complaint about an extortion call from an alleged gangster, the Delhi Police on Sunday said they have arrested a decorated assistant sub-inspector of their own force for masterminding and facilitating the crime. The ASI, 48-year-old Rajbir Singh, allegedly passed on the builder’s phone number to the gangster and even advised him to shoot at his son’s car to scare them into paying up.The police had arrested the alleged gangster and three other suspects previously as part of their investigations, which eventually led to Singh’s role being revealed.The police did not reveal the builder’s name to protect his privacy.Singh had, in 2005, been conferred with the President’s Police Medal for Gallantry, as well as the Asadharan Karya Puraskar (award for extraordinary work) seven times, and also received an out-of-turn promotion in 2015. The police, in a statement released on Sunday, said they were contemplating dismissing him from service and examining the possibility of withdrawing the medals conferred on him.Atul Kumar Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (south), said the sequence of events, which culminated in the ASI’s arrest, began on June 28 when the builder received an extortion call for Rs 2 crore. “The caller introduced himself as gangster Kaala and threatened to eliminate his family if he didn’t pay Rs 2 crore,” Thakur said. The victim approached the police, who registered a case at Hauz Khas police station.Investigations revealed that the phone number used to make the extortion call was snatched in Rohtak in Haryana the previous evening. The SIM card was removed from that phone and inserted into another handset to make the call, the police said. Within the next month, the police arrested three suspects — Mukesh, Sawan and Sunny — and recovered three mobile phones from them.In August, the police arrested Kaala, an alleged criminal who works out of Rohtak. Meanwhile, as the police analysed call records from the seized phones, they found that ASI Singh had been in regular touch with Kaala and the other suspects before and after the extortion calls were made, said the DCP. “He had also met them extortionists a few times,” the officer added. The police then began focusing on Singh’s role and found that he knew the builder for at least 10 or 12 years. “After the extortion calls, on July 14, Singh had also called the builder to speak to him about the crime and offer help. But he was actually trying to gauge his mood and the situation,” Thakur said. The police then questioned the arrested suspects, who allegedly disclosed that the policeman was the mastermind. “Singh had passed on the builder’s phone number to Kaala to make the extortion calls,” Thakur said. When the builder did not pay, the ASI had also allegedly advised Kaala to shoot at his son’s car, an attack that eventually did not take place. “The ASI has denied making such a suggestion, though there is enough evidence against him for planning the crime and getting it executed,” said another police officer who didn’t want to be identified. Singh was arrested on Friday, until which point he was posted in the south-west zone of the police control room. “The Delhi Police is examining the possibility of withdrawal of medals conferred upon him. He has been suspended and proceedings for his dismissal are being contemplated,” read a statement released by the force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-police-cop-who-had-received-president-s-medal-arrested-for-role-in-extortion-calls-to-builder/story-usZ9UHuY8jtp4xkDFGV6IM.html
23-11-2020||Chandigarh||Omaxe MD, 2 directors booked for fraudulent sale of flat||The managing director of Omaxe New Chandigarh Developers Pvt Ltd, Rohtash Goel, and directors Bhupinder Singh and Kamal Kishore Gupta were booked on Sunday for fraudulently selling a flat built without requisite approvals. A case was registered under Sections 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code at the Mullanpur police station after advocate and Ropar resident Manpreet Singh alleged that he had been fraudulently sold a flat in the Silver Birch project in Mullanpur’s New Chandigarh.In his complaint, Manpreet said he had bought the apartment in September 2019. It was previously registered in the name of a woman, Manju. Omaxe had taken approximately Rs 1.4 lakh as transfer fee for the allotment rights in his favour, which he transferred to the company through a bank transaction. However, “after checking the facts thoroughly, I found that the project was based on forgery of documents. The builders had got the project approved in 2010 by showing a forged layout of the housing project and started the bookings then,” alleged Manpreet. He also found that the project was coming up without the necessary change of land use certificate (CLU).In 2018, the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) had marked it “not to be sold”. “In spite of this, they continued selling the flats,” he added. As no action was taken by the police on his complaint in the matter in February this year, Manpreet moved the Punjab and Haryana high court, which sought a status report from the police, after which the FIR was registered.Allegations refutedRefuting Manpreet’s allegations, director, business development and liaison, Omaxe, Daleep Moudgil, said, “In 2011, we got the CLU for the land. Then layout was approved by the competent authority and accordingly, we got the zoning plan and building plans for independent floor from the authority, following which the construction was carried out. We have got occupation and completion certificate from the authority concerned.”“In December 2015, when we added more area, our layout was approved, but it was found that some revenue road from the corner of plot was passing through it. We have acquired this revenue road from the government and its CLU was also got approved and necessary rectification carried out in our revised layout, which we have already submitted with the competent authority,” Moudgil added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/omaxe-md-2-directors-booked-for-fraudulent-sale-of-flat/story-whjnlRKQvnXZytthg5olcO.html
23-11-2020||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee begins outreach in tribal belt days after Shah’s visit; BJP says it’s too late||Seventeen days after Union home minister Amit Shah visited Bankura district in the western part of West Bengal, discussed elections with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders from the region and had lunch at a tribal home, chief minister Mamata Banerjee reached the district on Sunday afternoon. Shah spent around eight hours in Bankura. Banerjee will be attending administrative meetings and public rallies till November 25, said Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders. “Mamata Banerjee is not a migratory bird who pays a visit once in a while to have lunch with people. She has done a lot for the tribal population. We are confident that she will do more in the future,” said Jyotsna Mandi, the TMC legislator from Ranibandh which is reserved for scheduled tribe candidates. Incidentally, the 13 assembly segments in Bankura district are part of two Lok Sabha seats that the BJP won last year. These are Bankura and Bishnupur. The BJP also won the Bardhaman-Durgapur and Asansol Lok Sabha seats in the adjoining district of West Burdwan. BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats in 2019.. Banerjee’s visit is significant because the TMC also launched its new outreach programme in Bankura on Saturday. All legislators in the state have been asked to visit their constituencies with local bureaucrats and interact with people about their problems and solve those within a stipulated time frame. Sampa Daripa, the legislator from Bankura assembly segment visited a tribal village prior to the chief minister’s visit. “The villagers are having some problems getting subsidised ration. They also want a road repaired. These will be taken care of,” said Daripa. BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu, who visited Durgapur on Sunday to attend organizational meetings, scoffed at the chief minister’s visit to the tribal belt. Also Read: 5 TMC MPs could resign any moment, says BJP MP Arjun Singh in poll-bound Bengal“Banerjee is making desperate efforts but nothing can save her government. It’s like saying prayers for the dying. She should have reached out to these people when they needed her help. All these years the TMC delivered nothing but corruption. The tribal people want jobs and security that she cannot provide,” said Basu. The region will be a crucial factor for the TMC in the assembly polls due in about five months because voters expressed their confidence in the BJP in 2019.Dr Subhas Sarkar wrested the Bankura Lok Sabha seat from the TMC by securing 49.2 % votes while TMC’s Saumitra Khan retained the Bishnupur seat after joining the BJP prior to the polls. Khan is now president of the BJP’s state youth front.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/mamata-banerjee-begins-outreach-in-tribal-belt-days-after-shah-s-visit-bjp-says-it-s-too-late/story-aed4ugnhGB4xq9G9Eb2JHN.html

23-11-2020||Chandigarh||Save Ambala’s war cemetery, MP KJ Alphons writes to Haryana CM||Ambala Former union tourism minister and Rajya Sabha MP for Rajasthan KJ Alphons has written to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and principal secretary to the state government (archaeology and museums department) Ashok Khemka, highlighting the “obstruction” created by a man named Shaukat Masih Bhatti at the Ambala Christian Cemetery on Jagadhari Road.BJP parliamentarian Alphons’s letter dated November 12 also encloses a representation from the Cemetery Committee member Father Anthony of the Holy Redeemer Church in the city. It reads that Bhatti, allegedly a self-declared Anglican bishop, has taken custody of the burial ground and is denying access to the committee to maintain the heritage site.“Obstruction is being caused by one Shaukat Masih Bhatti... He has locked the gate. His objective is to convert this into real estate, step by step. This is a war cemetery and government property. Since it is a national heritage (site) it must be protected and maintained properly.... the Cemetery Committee is constituted with the blessings of the government, kindly permit them to continue functioning, allowing persons to be buried there, and undertaking all maintenance work,” writes Alphons.HT on November 18 highlighted how the burial ground was virtually in ruins as two parties battled over possession rights.The site has graves of around 66 World War I (1914-1918) soldiers, 20 of Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) prisoners who fought in South Africa and those of a number of Britons from the pre-independence era.Commenting on the matter, Khemka on Saturday said the letter was yet to be examined.“Ownership and possession lies with two different bodies, but protection is with my department. Any kind of changes at the site can be done with the approval of the department. As stated in the letter, here the dispute is about the possession,” he said.However, Bhatti hit out at the Alphons saying “he doesn’t know the Christian law” and reiterated his claim that he was the chairman of the committee.“Seems like Mr Alphons is not aware of the constitution, which has recognised only two churches in India – the Church of England, known as the Anglican Church, and the Catholic Church, even after Independence. I’m affiliated with the Anglican Church. On the custody of the cemetery point, I’m the chairman of the committee and have full rights to deny entry to those who are using the body’s documents without my permission,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/save-ambala-s-war-cemetery-writes-mp-kj-alphons-to-haryana-cm/story-6ijcDPrmGucXOtwiMYzkLP.html
23-11-2020||Lifestyle||In Mumbai, one man’s mission to put fish back into the sea||When Kapil Jani, 31, goes for his run at Juhu beach in Mumbai every other day, he keeps an eye on the fishing nets. If they’re blue, he keeps running. If they’re white, he has to stop. The blue nets are smaller and designed to catch baby shrimp. The bigger white nets, held vertically, capture larger fish, including tonnes of marine life every year that the fishherfolk can’t sell. Jani, having run past as this bycatch was gasping for air on the sand, decided to do something about it. So when the nets are white, he stops, waits, collects up the bycatch as the fisherfolk do their sorting, and releases it back into the ocean.He’s been doing this on and off, for three years. “It was almost instinctive,” he says. His day job that of environment, health and safety manager for the Essel Group, but in his own time, he’s been an animal rescuer for years. “Birds, insects, bats… when I see something in distress, I go to help,” he says. In October this year, his solo campaign became a group effort. “One morning I saw that there were hundreds of fish on the beach — octopus, bamboo sharks, pufferfish, moray eels, all dying,” Jani says. What he was witnessing was a seasonal phenomenon called upwelling. Swapnil Tandel, a marine expert and fishery consultant, explains: “Every winter, as the depths cool, that water rises to the surface, carrying with it a lot of nutrients and attracting sea creatures of all kinds. During this time, the fishermen are also in overdrive, after the monsoon months of no fishing.” Put the two factors together and you have a situation where innocent byswimmers snacking on their nutrients get caught in the nets by the thousands. “For the Kolis it’s a happy lottery of pomfret, Bombay duck, stingrays, lobster, crabs, cuttlefish, bangda and more. The bycatch is proportionate,” Jani says. Realising he couldn’t deal with these volumes alone, he reached out to friends, family, conservation groups and NGOs. “Different groups had different ideas on how to deal with this, but all I was looking for was more hands,” Jani says. The next day, he was working with three buckets and a few friends. “People on the shore also joined in when they saw what we were doing. We worked every day for four days,” he says. Since then, Kapil and his handful of volunteers have become regulars on the shore here. They have a WhatsApp group where they coordinate their visits to the beach and discuss what was observed and done each day. The reality is that there are policy-level changes needed, but in the meanwhile, every bit helps, Tandel says. Jani has his eye on the immediate and is looking to scale up his effort. “My hope is that by this time next year we will have enough people stretched across whatever shores are left in Mumbai, given all the coastal road work, operating in tandem with the Koli community,” he says. “As they work, we’ll start scooping and putting all the fish they don’t want back in the sea.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/in-mumbai-one-man-s-mission-to-put-fish-back-into-the-sea/story-vHkTTu4eBgxbGmTVVUxI6H.html
23-11-2020||Mumbai||Seaplane services in India take flight; routes hold the key to success, say experts||After Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi inaugurated a seaplane service between Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad and Kevadia on October 31, for those who want to visit the Statue of Unity, seaplane services are back in the spotlight. This route is the first seaplane to operate under the government’s Udey Desh ka Aam Naagarik (UDAN) project. Industry experts have raised concerns regarding recently-launched seaplane routes, flagging how previous seaplane services were forced to shut down due to poor response.The new seaplane service in Gujarat comes almost three years after PM Modi travelled by seaplane from Sabarmati riverfront to Dharoj Dam in 2017, and announced his government’s intention to harness waterways. In addition to the newly-operational Ahmedabad-Kevadia stretch, 16 seaplane routes were recently announced as part of UDAN. These routes include Port Blair to Havelock, Delhi to Haridwar and Delhi to Rishikesh. Seaplane services will also cater to Udaipur, the backwaters of Kerala, Leh and Dal Lake. Previously, between 2011 and 2017, Pawan Hans Helicopters Limited (PHHL) and Mumbai-based Maritime Energy Heli Air Service Pvt Ltd (Mehair) had operated seaplane services in Andaman and Nicobar islands. Mehair had also operated seaplanes between from Mumbai to Pawna dam (Lonavla) and Mumbai to Aamby Valley. These operations closed down owing to poor response and high ticket prices. Siddharth Verma, co-founder of Mehair said, “It’s good to see seaplane operations resuming and the government’s contribution to it in the form of UDAN is a big support to the operators. It is a much-needed push to establish seaplane services in the country. ” Verma said Mehair plans to relaunch seaplane services in the second quarter of 2021. “We have firm plans to relaunch with a Cessna 208A from Mumbai and another Cessna 208A from Goa,” he said. Industry experts said they hoped the UDAN scheme would boost seaplane activity, but routes should be chosen keeping in mind both tourism and business traffic to prevent another set of failures.“During Covid times, there has been no international tourism at all. All flights operated under the government’s efforts are seeing passengers travelling for emergency purposes. Domestically too, India will barely see tourism traffic increasing until the vaccine is available,” said aviation expert, Captain Mohan Ranganathan. Another industry expert, requesting anonymity, questioned the government’s decision to choose Kevadia as a destination. “Kevadia is not even a township and reportedly lacks developed accommodation facilities. It seems that there are preferences for some routes over those which can bring success to seaplane operations. I do not see the newly-commenced route to be a good idea to commence seaplane operations,” said the expert. Kevadia is 3.5 kilometres from the location of the colossal statue of Sardar Patel that is known as the Statue of Unity and is the world’s tallest statue.A former Airports Authority of India (AAI) official said, “Seaplane services were a hit with tourists in Andaman and Nicobar islands and were high in demand until the contract expired. However, these services didn’t see passenger load when they were extended to other parts of the country, like Maharashtra and Kerala.” The official attributed the limited popularity of seaplane services to affordability. “Today a tourist can use the service by paying around Rs 2,000, for which he had to earlier pay around Rs 4,200 (for a 30-minute ride). The tax regime was different. Value-added tax (VAT) was higher and infrastructure like seaplane corridors and water drones were not in place.”In terms of operational ease, a former Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) official said seaplane operators under UDAN could obtain assured slots from airports. Requesting anonymity, the official said, “They [the slots] may not be the most desirable ones, but at least getting slots and parking bays in major busy airports like Delhi and Mumbai doesn’t become a problem. The biggest step this time is policy change. The government has introduced stringent water drone requirements. UDAN has undoubtedly reduced hurdles. The rest of it depends on how the operator markets and ensures the sustainability of their business.”The official agreed with industry experts who said that routes with more than one type of passenger traffic were essential to make seaplanes a successful business model and a sustainable mode of transport in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/seaplane-services-in-india-take-flight-routes-hold-the-key-to-success-say-experts/story-48Av1puBDlNrrxqIByyNtK.html

On September 24, the administration had notified 24 zones and another 20 on October 1.UT adviser Manoj Parida said the current status of the Covid-19 outbreak 19 was examined by the area affected committee and advised to declare 14 areas as micro-containment zones.“Residents of these areas will be screened, along with frequent sanitisation of the localities. People living there are advised to strictly maintain social distancing, wear masks and follow hand hygiene,” he added.No bend in Covid curveIn a worrisome trend, the city has been witnessing a steady rise in cases since the mid of October, with Thursday recording 155 cases in a single day after a gap of 45 days since October 3. The number of active cases also breached the 1,100 mark to reach 1,105, while the Covid deaths surpassed 250 on Monday and are 254 as of Thursday.From 316 cases in the week between October 16 and 22, a month later, November 13 to 19 recorded 779 cases – an over two-fold spike in infections.The situation is similar in neighbouring Mohali and Panchkula, where the cases also burgeoned by more than a double in the same period (see box).“The spike in cases is the fallout of not following precautions during the festival season. The manner in which the infections are increasing gives the sense that we should be ready to deal with the second surge soon,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.UT health department director Dr Amandeep Kang said people who may have come in contact with positive patients and those having symptoms should immediately get themselves tested to rein in the rise in cases and fatalities. A department official, wishing not to be named, said to encourage testing, they were considering to slash the testing rates at private centres by 25% for RT-PCR as well as Rapid Antigen Test on the lines of a recent decision by Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-seals-14-areas-as-covid-cases-see-twofold-spike-in-a-month/story-Z39koB9aY2khW2tHuV91TP.html
23-11-2020||Chandigarh||Amid rising Covid cases in Chandigarh, museums, Rock Garden thrown open||Having remained out of bounds for nearly eight months, Rock Garden, Tagore Theatre and various government museums will be reopened for the public from Tuesday.These were closed off in March in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. Except the Rock Garden, which is expected to be opened on Thursday, the other centres will be accessible from Tuesday.The decision, which was taken at Monday’s Covid-19 review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, comes even as Covid-19 cases in the city are surging once again since the onset of November. Against the 444 cases between October 23 and 29, the number rose to 502 in the subsequent week (October 30 to November 5) and further to 749 last week (November 6 to 12) – a jump of 69% in a fortnight.Even in the last four days, 261 fresh infections have surfaced despite a dip in the number of tests due to the festive season.“The Covid-19 situation is under control. Also, since cinema halls and malls are open, why shouldn’t public places like Rock Garden also be accessible? The decision is in line with the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) order that puts restrictions only on containment zones,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida.Notably, the Union ministry of culture on November 5 had allowed opening of arts galleries, museums and exhibition halls from November 10.On delay in opening the museums in Chandigarh, Parida said, “We decided to analyse the Covid-19 situation in the city till Diwali before allowing their opening.”Cinema halls and multiplexes were allowed to open with 50% capacity on October 15 after a gap of more than seven months. SOP issued by culture ministryThe Union ministry of culture in its November 5 order issued the standard operating procedure (SOP) for the opening of museums, art galleries and exhibition halls. To allow museums and art galleries to reopen and resume their operations, strict precautionary measures are to be observed by all staff members and visitors to prevent transmission of Covid-19.“We have started conducting tests of all staff at the various museums and art galleries under the administration’s purview, and so far, nobody has been found infected,” said a UT official, not wishing to be named.“Access to different segments of a museum will be regulated to prevent crowding.

23-11-2020||World||For the first time, can see route out of Covid-19 pandemic: UK PM Boris Johnson||Hailing the University of Oxford’s success on the Covid-19 vaccine as a “wonderful British scientific achievement”, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday said that for the first time since the “wretched” coronavirus took hold, people can see a route out of the pandemic.Outlining post-lockdown measures to come into effect from December 3, Johnson, who is in self-isolation in Downing Street, told the House of Commons virtually that developments in vaccines, treatment and testing mean that the “scientific cavalry is now in sight”.He said, “By the spring, these advances should reduce the need for the restrictions we have endured in 2020 and make the whole concept of a Covid lockdown redundant. When that moment comes, it will have been made possible by the sacrifices of millions of people across the UK.“I am acutely conscious that no other peacetime prime minister has asked so much of the British people and just as our country has risen to every previous trial, so it has responded this time… But the hard truth, Mr Speaker, is that we are not there yet. First, we must get through winter without the virus spreading out of control and squandering our hard-won gains.”England’s month-long lockdown will end on December 2, with the other three UK constituents - Wales, Scotland the Northern Ireland - enforcing versions of local lockdowns and curbs. New infections continued to remain at nearly three or four times (15,450) the peak of April-May, but the number of daily deaths is down (206), as of Monday evening, compared to the nearly 1,000 daily deaths earlier this year.Johnson said that from December 3, parts of England will return to the earlier tiered alert system, but each tier will have tougher restrictions. Collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports will be allowed to resume, and shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector will reopen when the lockdown ends.On the issue of allowing families to meet during Christmas, Johnson said, “This will be still a hard winter, Christmas cannot be normal, and there is a long road to spring… Mr Speaker, I can’t say that Christmas will be normal this year, but in a period of adversity, time spent with loved ones is even more precious for people of all faiths and none.”“We all want some kind of Christmas, we need it, we certainly feel we deserve it. But what we don’t want is to throw caution to the winds and allow the virus to flare up again, forcing us all back into lockdown in January,” he said.Guidance on allowances and restrictions to be followed during Christmas will be announced later, he said, so that families could come together while at the same time minimising the risk of new Covid-19 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-the-first-time-can-see-route-out-of-covid-19-pandemic-uk-pm-boris-johnson/story-j3qeHhY92TkJR1xx74HVqL.html

The UK government published its plan aimed at suppressing the spread of infection while enabling life to return “closer to normal”.The Johnson government said that the winter plan will minimise damage to the economy and society, jobs and livelihoods. In its winter plan summary, the government stated that lifting national restrictions has become possible because the ongoing restrictions have slowed the spread of the virus and eased the pressure on the National Health Service (NHS).Also Read | Boris Johnson confirms Dec 2 end to lockdown, Covid Winter Plan until March 2021On December 2, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector will reopen regardless of tier. The winter plan also provides for the resumption of collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports. According to the plan, the stay at home requirement will end and travel will be allowed, subject to the guidance in each tier.However, the government cautioned that the novel coronavirus is still present and that’s why a regional, tiered approach will be introduced. While Tier 1 indicates ‘medium alert, Tier 2 and Tier 2 indicate ‘high’ and ‘very high alert’ respectively. Meeting friends and familyOther than single households or support bubbles, a maximum of six people will be allowed to meet indoors or outdoors in Tier 1 region. Tier 2 will mandate no mixing of households indoors, apart from support bubbles, and a maximum of six people will be allowed to meet outdoors. For Tier 3, no mixing of households indoors, or most outdoor places, will be allowed apart from support bubbles.Bars, pubs, and restaurantsFor Tier 1, the government has directed that the venues must be table service only and they must stop taking orders at 10pm and must close by 11pm. In Tier 2 zones, pubs and bars must be closed, unless they are operating as restaurants. Under the plan, hospitality venues will be allowed to only serve alcohol with substantial meals. Hospitality will remain closed in Tier 3, with the exception of sales by takeaway, drive-through or delivery.Wedding and funeralsAs many as 15 guests will be allowed for weddings, civil partnerships and wedding receptions, while 30 people will be permitted for funerals in Tier 1 and Tier 2. The guidance remains the same for Tier 3, but wedding receptions won’t be allowed.Large Events - Elite Sport, Live Performances & BusinessIn Tier 1, large events will be open to the public but limited to 50 per cent capacity or 4,000 people outdoors and 1,000 indoors, whichever is lower. It will remain the same for Tier 2 but the limit on outdoors will go down to 2000. It won’t be allowed for Tier 3 except Drive-in events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-winter-plan-all-you-need-to-know-about-uk-s-3-tier-system-starting-december-2/story-Np4EVx6TQRSbuywIuA8FcO.html
23-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson confirms Dec 2 end to lockdown, Covid Winter Plan until March 2021||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday confirmed that the complete stay-at-home lockdown in England will end on December 2, from when a tough new Covid Winter Plan will kick in to last until at least March 2021.Addressing the House of Commons via videolink from Downing Street in London, where he continues to self-isolate after contact with an MP who later tested positive for Covid-19, Johnson began by praising “the scientific cavalry” which has offered vaccine hopes to eventually make lockdown “redundant”. But he stressed that it is important not to “squander all our gains” from the past few weeks of lockdown with a “free for all”.“From next Wednesday people will be able to leave their homes for any purpose and meet other people in public places, subject to the rule of six,” said Johnson.“I am sorry to say we expect that more regions will fall at least temporarily into higher levels than before,” he said, in reference to a tougher tiered system.From the middle of next week, shops, personal care, gyms and churches can reopen as part of a bolstered three-tiered system. As part of the restrictions, people will be expected to continue to work from home if they live in a Tier 1 region; in Tier 2, alcohol can only be served with a meal; and in Tier 3, all forms of hospitality except takeaways will have to close. The 10pm curfew for bars and restaurants will now change to last orders at 10pm, with closing time at 11pm. Sports will be allowed to resume with spectators in the first two less strict tiers, with capacity limits and social distancing, including a similar approach for theatres and concert halls.Read more | UK foreign policy needs a tilt towards Indo-Pacific: ReportThe parliamentary speech comes as Oxford University announced promising Phase 3 results from its vaccine candidate being developed with AstraZeneca, in reference to which Johnson said: “For the first time since this wretched virus took hold we can see a route out of the pandemic.” As for which specific tiers the different regions would fall under, Johnson said he hopes to be able to confirm by this Thursday, depending on how cases of Covid-19 are falling or rising. These tier allocations will then be reviewed every 14 days, with the wider region-wise approach will last until March next year.While lockdown measures in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be decided by the devolved administrations, Johnson said that he would set out plans for “a time limited Christmas dispensation embracing the whole of the UK” in the coming days. He, however, earned that the deadly virus would not “grant a Christmas truce”. “Christmas cannot be normal and there is a long road to spring but we have turned a corner and the escape route is in sight,” he said.He added that the mass testing pilot scheme from the city Liverpool will now be rolled out more widely and those who test negative will be offered the prospect of fewer restrictions.The Opposition Labour Party Leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said they would await the full details of the plans.The UK’s death toll from Covid-19 stands at 55,024, after 398 new victims across all settings over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-confirms-dec-2-end-to-lockdown-covid-winter-plan-until-march-2021/story-vbalriY92fOakkoFziw4eO.html
23-11-2020||World||Shops, gyms to reopen in England under new Covid-19 plan||Haircuts, shopping trips and visits to the pub will be back on the agenda for millions of people when a four-week lockdown in England comes to an end next week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday.Johnson confirmed to lawmakers that on December 2 the government will lift the stay-at-home instruction introduced early this month to curb a new surge in coronavirus cases. Shops, gyms, personal care businesses and leisure facilities will be allowed to reopen, and collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports can resume. Fans will also be allowed back into sports stadiums for the first time since March.Johnson said “the scientific cavalry is now in sight,” and breakthroughs in mass testing and vaccines should eliminate the need for lockdowns by the spring. But first, he said, “we must get through winter without the virus spreading out of control and squandering our hard-won gains.”He said England’s lockdown will be replaced with regional measures involving three tiers of restrictions based on the scale of the outbreak in different areas. The measures have been toughened slightly from a similar system that was in place last month because government scientific advisers say those measures weren’t enough to stop the virus spreading.In the top tier, pubs and restaurants will have to close except for takeout and delivery. In other areas they will have to close by 11 p.m.In the lower two tiers, indoor and outdoor spectator sports can resume with capacity limits.The rules apply to England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have their own restrictions.People will have to wait until up-do-date data is released later in the week to learn what tier their local area will be in, but the government says most of the country is likely to be in the two highest levels.In those areas, households will be barred from mixing indoors, but the government is planning to ease the rules over the Christmas period.Johnson said people will be allowed “to see more of their family and friends over Christmas,” though he did not announce details.In common with other European countries, authorities in Britain introduced restrictions on daily life to combat an autumn surge in cases. The UK has had Europe’s deadliest Covid-19 outbreak, with more than 55,000 deaths among people who tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shops-gyms-to-reopen-in-england-under-new-covid-19-plan/story-5anfsC3Nr0wOnBTOn8xlrL.html

23-11-2020||World||EU, UK still have ‘fundamental’ differences on trade talks||With the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in quarantine, trade talks with the United Kingdom continued by videoconference this week, though the optimism expressed last week seemed to have faded.Barnier stressed on Monday that negotiators were running out of time to make a January 1 deadline and that “fundamental divergences still remain.” The talks were shifted to a videoconference last week when an EU official tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing Barnier into a quarantine until at least Thursday. Both sides have indicated that to reach an agreement on key issues the negotiators need to meet in person.On Friday, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen issued one of the most upbeat assessments of the state of post-Brexit trade negotiations in several weeks, saying the EU had seen “in the last days better progress, more movement on important files.” But on Monday, EU Commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie said that “while some progress has been made in drafting legal texts, significant fundamental divergences remain in the three key areas” that negotiations have centered on - the fishing industry, how to check compliance with the deal and the standards the UK must meet to export into the EU.The UK left the EU on January 31 but remains in its trade relations with the EU until the end of this year. Both sides hope to get a trade deal in time to protect hundreds of thousands of jobs that could be affected if the trade agreements lapse with no deal on future ties.Any deal brokered by Barnier and his British counterpart, David Frost, would need to be approved by the individual EU countries and the European Parliament. The legislature is even considering meeting around Christmas - when it is usually enjoying a long recess - to make any deadline.The bloc accuses Britain of wanting to retain access to the EU’s lucrative markets, much like any EU country, without agreeing to follow all its rules. The EU fears Britain will slash social and environmental standards, and pump state money into UK industries, becoming a low-regulation economic rival on the bloc’s doorstep.Britain says the EU is making unreasonable demands and is failing to treat it as an independent, sovereign state, especially when it comes to the control of its fishing waters.If the talks resume in person from Thursday, they would be held in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-uk-still-have-fundamental-differences-on-trade-talks/story-jwaY8mSq7jV0tTwlqah0AJ.html
23-11-2020||World||Covid-19: All you need to know about global QR code proposed by China||Chinese President Xi Jinping is pushing for a Covid-19 tracking system by using QR codes, as a part of “global mechanism” to ease international travel during the coronavirus disease pandemic. During a virtual G20 summit on Saturday, Xi stressed the need to restore the secure and smooth operation of global industrial and supply chains.He proposed a mechanism on the mutual recognition of health certificates in the form of “internationally accepted QR codes”. “We need to further harmonise policies and standards and establish fast tracks to facilitate the orderly flow of personnel,” Xi said at the summit.The Chinese president said that the health certificates will be based on “nucleic acid test results” and expressed hope that more countries will join the mechanism, without further elaborating on the proposal.Also Read | China says it has eliminated poverty from last nine poorest countiesWhat is Covid-19 QR code?Earlier this year, China reportedly mandated the widespread use of QR-based health certificates which stores the travel and health history of an individual. The system has been credited with helping contain the virus in the country, the first epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.The Chinese government issues colour codes based on the big data on health information submitted by the users. While the green colour code allows users to travel freely, an orange or red code suggests that they need to quarantine for up to two weeks.Several countries have used contact tracing apps to monitor and curb the spread of Covid-19. In April, a study by Oxford University found that even if approximately 60 per cent of the population used a contract tracing app, it would have significantly reduced the number of coronavirus cases and related deaths.However, there have been concerns regarding privacy, and executive director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, cautioned against Xi’s proposal for a global QR code system. “An initial focus on health could easily become a Trojan Horse for broader political monitoring and exclusion, akin to the dangers associated with China’s social-credit system,” tweeted Roth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-all-you-need-to-know-about-global-qr-code-proposed-by-china/story-1DHgYzLmRyr273NpT0TBJJ.html

23-11-2020||World||Snapchat challenges TikTok with curated video feed||Snapchat on Monday unveiled a new curated short-form video feed in a stepped up challenge to social media rivals like TikTok.The new format called Spotlight will allow Snapchatters to see content from influencers and other members of the network popular with young smartphone users.Spotlight is aimed at broadening the connections among Snapchat users by enabling anyone to create a video that gets distributed on the platform.It aims to encourage more users to create short-form video “snaps” which can be embellished with filters and augmented reality effects.“We designed Spotlight to entertain our community while living up to Snapchat values, with our community’s well being as a top priority,” said a statement from Snapchat parent firm Snap Inc. announcing the new service.Spotlight is being launched in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Britain, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and France, and in other markets later.It marks the latest challenge to the wildly successful TikTok, which is facing pressure from the Trump administration, which wants to ban the app or forces its sale to American investors due to alleged national security concerns about its Chinese connections.Others using similar short-form videos include Facebook-owned Instagram’s Reels and startups like Triller.- New experience -Snap describes Spotlight as a “new consumption experience” for the social platform with an estimated 249 million active users at the end of September.The company said the new offering could enable anyone to have their videos viewed by millions of users, and potentially earn money from them. This opens up the process of becoming an “influencer” eligible for Snapchat’s funding of some $1 million per day.Snap said that all videos on Spotlight will be reviewed by human moderators before being shown on the platform -- in contrast with rivals which use automated systems and in many cases respond to inappropriate content or misinformation after the fact.Another difference will be the lack of public comments on Spotlight, eliminating the need for moderation of abusive or unwelcome content.Spotlight aims to become a “personalized” feed which will be curated by algorithm based on users’ viewing habits -- a move following the lead of TikTok which has seen sizzling growth in recent months.The launch comes amid increasing competition among social networks and rivals copying Snapchat’s disappearing messages.Facebook’s core social network has been losing ground among younger audiences to rivals like Snapchat and TikTok, even as Facebook-owned Instagram continues to grow in that demographic group.A Piper Jaffay survey of US teens last month showed Snapchat is their favorite social media platform, and that TikTok overtook Instagram for second place.Despite its popularity, Snap has yet to turn a profit some two years after its stock market debut. Snapchat gained notoriety for its disappearing “Stories” but has added a variety of media content with partnerships.It lost $200 million in the third quarter, but managed to double revenue from a year ago thanks to changes that have helped boost user engagement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/snapchat-challenges-tiktok-with-curated-video-feed/story-5HsCSk55grvRvuyDhQx85I.html

The Oxford team was identifying hundreds of significant new words and usages as the year unfolded, dozens of which would have been a slam dunk for Word of the Year at any other time”.“It’s both unprecedented and a little ironic - in a year that left us speechless, 2020 has been filled with new words unlike any other.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zoombombing-superspeader-wfh-covid-makes-oxford-dictionary-expand-word-of-year/story-xiwgvVwb6Kj8XFGJh07hIN.html

23-11-2020||World||UK foreign policy needs a tilt towards Indo-Pacific: Report||A key commission led by former prime minister of Canada Stephen Harper wants Britain to tilt towards the Indo-Pacific region as a democratic counterweight to China, complementing India’s vision articulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2018 and reiterated by foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla earlier this month.The report from the panel, convened by influential think-tank Policy Exchange, was released on Sunday night.Highlighting the economic and security-based importance of the region, the report titled ‘A Very British Tilt: Towards a New UK Strategy in the Indo-Pacific Region’, said Indo-Pacific affairs will inevitably have a major impact on Britain’s strategy after Brexit. The region is also home to over 1.5 million British citizens, including thousands in India.“As it contemplates its global interests post-Brexit, the UK could and should play a significantly larger role in the Indo-Pacific Region. Specifically, it should aim to foster a community of free and independent nations committed to upholding peace, stability, prosperity, and access in the region,” it said.“By offering a vision of a common strategic future built around shared principles and focused on shared challenges, whether domestic or across borders, Britain can add to existing defence, trade, and political relationships and inspire new approaches. Such an expanded role for the UK represents a hard but realistic task, both from a delivery and from a resources point of view.”The panel’s report is expected to feed into the ongoing major review of the UK’s foreign policy, defence and international development initiated by Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this year. A fundamental tilt towards India and the Indo-Pacific region in post-Brexit UK has been envisaged in recent interactions by diplomats and British politicians.Shringla, who set out India’s vision of the Indo-Pacific in an interaction at Policy Exchange, said India had “mainstreamed” the idea of Indo-Pacific in recent years and encouraged others to perceive the region accordingly. Germany, France and the Netherlands have recently set out their approach to the region.“The UK, we hope and expect, will be next on the list, and too will finalise its Indo-Pacific strategy soon. Given this country’s characteristic wisdom and prodigious institutional memory, we hope too that the UK’s strategy will approximate India’s own and long-standing Indo-Pacific vision”, Shringla said, noting the think-tank’s “not-inconsiderable influence” in London.The report called for enacting an ‘Indo-Pacific Charter’ to anchor a new approach to regional stability and prosperity, and recommended that the Johnson government establish an Indo-Pacific Sub-Committee on the National Security Council chaired by the Prime Minister.Besides, it said Johnson should consider creating a Special Envoy for the Indo-Pacific as a political appointment based in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and promulgating a standalone ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy’ laying out its comprehensive approach to engaging with the region.The panel which prepared the report included 18 current and former political leaders, military planners and others from the UK, Canada, US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, India, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. It is endorsed by former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.Abe wrote in the report’s foreword: “A leading global power, Great Britain has a major role to play in the Indo-Pacific.

23-11-2020||World||UK regulator begins assessing Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine data||The UK regulator of medicines said on Monday that it has begun assessing the data received from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate trial that showed nearly 95% efficacy, adding that public safety “will always come first”.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said since the UK continues to be a member of the EU until the end of the Brexit transition period on December 31, Covid-19 vaccine candidates can be licensed via the Amsterdam-based European Medicines Agency and that authorisation will automatically be valid in the UK.However, if a suitable vaccine candidate, with strong supporting evidence of safety, quality and effectiveness from clinical trials becomes available before the end of the transition period, EU legislation allows for temporary authorisation of supply in the UK, based on public health need.Based on the speed of MHRA’s assessment and approval, the Pfizer vaccine may be rolled out from December.MHRA chief executive June Raine said: “We are pleased to have received further data for the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine candidate. It is our job now to rigorously assess these data and the evidence submitted on the vaccine’s safety, quality and effectiveness”.“As we have received this data through a rolling review, we have already started our analysis and will aim to make a decision in the shortest time possible, without compromising the thoroughness of our review”.“We will seek advice from the government’s independent advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines. The Commission will critically assess the data too before advising the UK government on the safety, quality and effectiveness of any potential vaccine”, she added.The MHRA said it will evaluate the data rigorously for quality, safety and effectiveness to reach an independent, scientifically robust opinion. The data must include results from lab and clinical trials in humans; manufacturing and quality controls, product sampling, and testing of the final product. Any Covid-19 vaccine candidate submitted after the transition period ends will not need to go through a European marketing authorisation for use in the UK; it will be assessed directly by the MHRA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-regulator-begins-assessing-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-data/story-nRodmxBB8Rotfje98tJ3jO.html
23-11-2020||World||Oxford English Dictionary couldn’t pick just one ‘word of the year’ for 2020||The year 2020 has truly been “unprecedented” - for the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) which has used in the title of its report to name the “word of the year”. The OED said it has been impossible to name one winner in this “unprecedented” year.“Though what was genuinely unprecedented this year was the hyper-speed at which the English-speaking world amassed a new collective vocabulary relating to the coronavirus, and how quickly it became, in many instances, a core part of the language,” the OED said in its report titled “Words of an Unprecedented Year”.However, it has chosen words that reflect the mood and the preoccupations of 2020.From superspreader to lockdown, words commonly used owing to the pandemic found a place in the list. The report said that usage of the word pandemic increased by 57,000 per cent last year while use of the word “coronavirus” was most frequent in April.Other words which have seen a surge in use this year are terms related to technology as people are adapting to working from home. These include unmute, referring to people making themselves audible during online conferences, and Zoombombing, a variant on photobombing which was first recorded as a word in 2008, and refers to disturbing online calls on Zoom.Also words to describe the social movements witnessed around the globe this year found a place in the list. Black Lives Matter, take a knee, cancel culture and virtue signalling all appeared on the curated list.The list also included neologisms like Blursday, defined as when you have no idea what day of the week it is and covidiot, a person who disobeys guidelines designed to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and the informal term for the virus, rona. Casper Grathwohl, the president of Oxford Dictionaries, told The BBC, “It’s both unprecedented and a little ironic - in a year that left us speechless, 2020 has been filled with new words unlike any other.”In 2019, OED had named “climate emergency” as the word of the year and in 2018, the winner was “toxic”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-english-dictionary-couldn-t-pick-just-one-word-of-the-year-for-2020/story-1Y1szWG3uWJ8YkaTeFHFPN.html
23-11-2020||World||‘Highly effective’ Oxford vaccine raises hopes of normal life from April||New data from the University of Oxford’s trial released on Monday showed that its vaccine candidate is ‘highly effective,” sparking a wave of excitement due to its lower cost and logistics and prompting home secretary Matt Hancock to see normal life from Easter 2021.The analysis of its data from the trial in the UK and Brazil said the AZD1222 vaccine is highly effective in preventing Covid-19, with no hospitalisations or severe cases reported in participants receiving the vaccine.It is to be produced on a no-profit basis on a mass scale with biopharma major AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India, among others. The UK regulator also announced on Monday that it has received data from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine candidate for approval. The Oxford vaccine, expected to cost nearly £3, is cheaper than Pfizer’s (around £15) or Moderna’s (£25) vaccines.Speaking to the media after the Oxford results were released, Sarah Gilbert, leading vaccinologist, said: “The announcement today takes us another step closer to the time when we can use vaccines to bring an end to the devastation caused by (the virus).”Andrew Pollard, lead investigator of the Oxford vaccine, added: “We have a vaccine for the world. It prevents severe disease, hospitalisation and intriguingly in the results – although in the headline it is 70% protection – we do have a sub-group where we saw 90% protection.”“The vaccine can be stored at fridge temperature. It can be distributed around the world using the usual immunisation distribution systems. We had a goal to have a vaccine that is accessible everywhere. We have actually managed to do that. This is an incredibly exciting moment for human health,” he said.AstraZeneca said in its statement on the results: “One dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy of 90% when AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart, and another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart.”“The combined analysis from both dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted in an average efficacy of 70%. All results were statistically significant (p<=0.0001). More data will continue to accumulate and additional analysis will be conducted, refining the efficacy reading and establishing the duration of protection.”The company said it is immediately preparing to submit data to authorities around the world that have a framework in place for conditional or early approval, including Emergency Use Listing from the World Health Organization for speedier availability in low-income countries.The Boris Johnson government has ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine and is putting in place the infrastructure for mass vaccination in over 40 centres across the UK from December, subject to the regulator clearing the vaccine.The UK “could get back to normal after Easter”, Hancock said, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson and others hailed the announcement.Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford but not involved in the trial, said: “This is very welcome news, we can clearly see the end of tunnel now. There were no Covid hospitalisations or deaths in people who got the Oxford vaccine.”Stephen Griffin, from the University of Leeds, added: “This is yet more excellent news and should be considered tremendously exciting. It has great potential to be delivered across the globe, achieving huge public health benefits.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highly-effective-oxford-vaccine-raises-hopes-of-normal-life-from-april/story-jFvlt2UO6avnp0vMvTQ1DI.html
23-11-2020||World||European powers see hope for Iran accord in US transition||The German, French and British foreign ministers were meeting Monday to discuss the future of the international agreement on Iran’s nuclear program amid hopes that the incoming US administration might help breathe new life into the accord, Germany’s Foreign Ministry said.The three European powers have spearheaded efforts to keep alive the agreement, concluded in Vienna in 2015 and officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA. Russia and China also remain on board.President-elect Joe Biden has said he hopes to return the US to the accord, in which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions. President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the agreement in 2018 and imposed crippling economic sanctions on Iran, which responded by publicly abandoning nuclear restrictions in the agreement.Monday’s meeting at a government guest house in Berlin, which wasn’t announced in advance, aimed to discuss “what a further approach involving all signatories to the JCPOA, and perhaps also with a new US administration, could look like,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Andrea Sasse told reporters.“We are confident that a constructive approach by the US toward the Vienna nuclear agreement could contribute significantly to breaking the current negative spiral we are seeing with Iran, and opening new prospects for the preservation of the JCPOA,” she added.Sasse renewed calls for Iran to stop its violations of the agreement and comply with all of its provisions in full. She said Monday’s meeting also would address Iran’s missile program and wider regional role — issues that are not addressed by the nuclear agreement, to the displeasure of its critics.Asked whether the Europeans fear Trump taking further steps against Iran before he leaves office that would undermine their hopes, Sasse replied: “if there are such measures, we will evaluate them if they happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-powers-see-hope-for-iran-accord-in-us-transition/story-HeUu6VJnbFS8kZFPuLE9VP.html

A charity, Save the Children, said in its report that Afghanistan accounts for the greatest number of killing and maiming violations among conflict zones, terming it one of the world’s most dangerous countries for children.As many as 874 children were killed and 2,275 children were maimed in 2019 in Afghanistan, representing 30 per cent of the total number of children killed and maimed across all the conflict situations covered in the report. For four consecutive years, the combined tally has been above 3,000, and in 2019, 72 per cent of the cases were a “result of ground engagements between pro- and anti-government forces or of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in both suicide and non-suicide attacks.”Also Read | Pompeo meets Taliban, Afghan negotiators in DohaIn 2019, Afghanistan reported attacks on 70 schools and 75 hospitals, and six schools and two hospitals were used for military purposes. The report stated that in 2021, there will be critical opportunities for states and parties to conflict to take concrete actions to better protect and support children in conflict.Save the Children called on the international communities to stop the war on children and work with the government of Afghanistan to ensure national laws related to the protection of children are fully resourced and rolled out nationwide. It urged donors to ensure that child protection work in conflict is funded in line with other life-saving interventions. It also suggested UN Security Council members use their power to hold perpetrators of grave violations accountable.“Imagine living with the constant fear that today might be the day that your child is killed in a suicide attack or an airstrike. This is the grim reality for tens of thousands of Afghan parents whose children have been killed or injured,” Chris Nyamandi, Save the Children’s country director in Afghanistan, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-26-000-children-in-afghanistan-killed-or-maimed-since-2005-report/story-FT5TYyDCBWf0wPUiQKiPdP.html
23-11-2020||World||Emissions in 2020 drop a ‘tiny blip’: UN body||Human emissions of the greenhouse gases responsible for climate change will fall between 4.2% and 7.5% this year due to the global industrial slowdown caused by coronavirus lockdowns.But carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere will continue to go up, albeit at a slightly reduced pace, according to preliminary data by the World Meteorological Organization released on Monday. The short-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic can’t be distinguished from natural variability, the United Nations agency said.“The lockdown-related fall in emissions is just a tiny blip on the long-term graph,” WMO secretary general Petteri Taalas said in a statement. “We need a sustained flattening of the curve.”Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries, and in the ocean for even longer. That means concentrations of the warming gas will continue to rise for years, even if human emissions fall or are brought to a halt. In 2019, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere breached a new threshold of 410 parts per million, from 400 parts per million in 2015, according to the WMO’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin released on Monday.“Such a rate of increase has never been seen in the history of our records,” Taalas said. “The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO₂ was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3°C warmer and sea level was 10-20 meters higher than now —but there weren’t 7.7 billion inhabitants.”Concentrations of CO₂ in the atmosphere were 48% higher in 2019 than 1750, according to the report. The increase observed from 2018 to 2019 was larger than that observed during the previous one-year period, and larger than the average over the last decade.Methane presence in the atmosphere were up by 160% from pre-industrial times, while nitrous oxide was up 23%..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emissions-in-2020-drop-a-tiny-blip-un-body/story-TH7bNgjjPLt0eOEVQdFnyO.html
23-11-2020||World||China says it has eliminated poverty from last nine poorest counties||China’s remaining nine impoverished counties had eliminated extreme poverty, state media reported on Monday, marking a landmark in the country’s fight towards lifting the poorest above the poverty line.The counties, all in southwest China’s Guizhou province, had eradicated absolute poverty, the provincial government announced.“China has vowed to eradicate absolute poverty by 2020. At the end of 2019, 52 counties in the northwest, southwest and south of the country remained on the poverty list,” official Xinhua news agency said in a report.Fighting poverty has been one of China’s three “critical” battles since 2017, the other two being curbing pollution and mitigating financial risks.Last week, seven counties in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan province were the last group of counties to be removed from the national poverty list.Chinese government statistics say the country has lifted some 850 million out of poverty, contributing over 70% to global poverty reduction, in the last few decades.The country’s rural poor population was slashed from 98.99 million at the end of 2012 to 5.51 million at the end of 2019, with the poverty ratio in rural regions dropping from 10.2% to 0.6%, according to government statistics.In September, Chinese President Xi Jinping, speaking via video link at the general debate of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly, said that the country has every confidence it will meet the poverty eradication target set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and that it will achieve that target 10 years in advance.What are the criteria for a county to be removed from the poverty list?Broadly: “One income, two no-worries and three guarantees” First is income. The national income standard is the constant price per capita annual income of 2,300 yuan for farmers in 2010. According to the price index, the current price was 3,218 yuan at the end of last year, and this year it is about 4,000 yuan, as per state media reports.The two “no worries” are about food and cloths. “Three guarantees” are compulsory education, access to basic medical care, and housing security.Provinces, however, could have differing sets of poverty lines.Chinese government’s own flattering statistics on poverty alleviation, however, have been questioned.The debate over the number of poor in China was reignited last May when Premier Li Keqiang said the monthly income of some 600 million Chinese was 1000 yuan (Rs 10,000).“It’s barely enough to cover monthly rent in a mid-sized Chinese city,” Li said at his annual press conference at the closing of China’s rubber-stamp legislature, the National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing.Li’s statement assumed even more significance as it came in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has left the Chinese economy battered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-has-eliminated-poverty-from-last-nine-poorest-counties/story-Hw1eUppE2NhG4NdnxokwyN.html
23-11-2020||World||Pat Quinn, co-creator of viral ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, dies at 37||A co-founder of the social media ALS ice bucket challenge, which has raised more than $200 million worldwide for Lou Gehrig’s disease research, died Sunday at the age of 37, according to the ALS Association.Pat Quinn was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 2013, a month after his 30th birthday, the organization said in a statement announcing his death.“Pat fought ALS with positivity and bravery and inspired all around him,” the association said. “Those of us who knew him are devastated but grateful for all he did to advance the fight against ALS. ... Our thoughts are with the Quinn family and all of his friends and supporters. Pat was loved by many of us within the ALS community and around the world.”In 2014, Quinn saw the ice bucket challenge on the social media feed of professional golfer Chris Kennedy, who first dared his wife’s cousin Jeanette Senerchia to take a bucket of ice water, dump it over her head, post a video on social media and ask others to do the same or to make a donation to charity. Senerchia’s husband had ALS.Quinn and co-founder Pete Frates, along with their teams of supporters, helped popularize the challenge. The ALS Association said Quinn “knew it was the key to raising ALS awareness,” calling it “the greatest social media campaign in history.” Frates, a former Boston College baseball player, died in December 2019 at the age of 34.When the two picked it up, the phenomenon exploded, the organization said. Thousands of people participated in the viral trend, including celebrities, sports stars and politicians — even Donald Trump before his election and cartoon character Homer Simpson. Online videos were viewed millions of times.“It dramatically accelerated the fight against ALS, leading to new research discoveries, expanded care for people living with ALS, and significant investment from the government in ALS research,” the organization’s statement said.Lou Gehrig’s disease, named after the New York Yankees great who suffered from it — is also known as ALS or motor neuron disease. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to paralysis due to the death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. There is no known cure.The organization added that Quinn continued to raise awareness and funds after popularizing the challenge. In 2015, the association honored him, among others, as “ALS Heroes” — an award given to people living with the disease who have had a significant positive impact on the fight against it.On the 5th anniversary of the challenge, Quinn, who was from Yonkers, New York, addressed a crowd in Boston.“Nobody knew the Ice Bucket Challenge would become a worldwide phenomenon, but we united as one because that is what it takes to change a disease like ALS,” he said. “There are warriors all over the world unwilling to accept it as a death sentence. … We will never stop fighting together. I will not leave this Earth until I know the next person diagnosed with ALS has a real plan to live with this disease, not just die from it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pat-quinn-co-creator-of-viral-als-ice-bucket-challenge-dies-at-37/story-niGkFWOhbGXqUWmjF1DpmN.html
23-11-2020||World||China lashes out at US withdrawal from open skies treaty||China on Monday lashed out at Washington over its withdrawal from the “Open Skies Treaty” with Russia, saying the move undermined military trust and transparency and imperiled future attempts at arms control.The treaty, to which China is not a signatory, had allowed each country overflight rights to inspect military facilities.That leaves only one arms-control pact still in force between the former Cold War foes, the New START treaty, which limits the number of nuclear warheads each may have. That treaty will expire in February and the Trump administration had said it wasn’t interested in extending it unless China also joined, something Beijing says it will not do.“This move by the US undermines military mutual trust and transparency among relevant countries, is not conducive to maintaining security and stability in relevant regions and will also have a negative impact on the international arms control and disarmament process,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing Monday.Also Read |  ‘Certainly a weak president’: Chinese government advisor thinks Biden could start warCritics complain that Beijing has urged other major countries to reach arms control agreements while refusing to take part in any such arrangements, including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF, that expired last year.Meanwhile, it has taken advantage of limitations set by Russia and the US on each other to keep itself safe and engage in unrestricted development of weapons such as intermediate-range ballistic missiles, bolstering its military’s capabilities in the event of a conflict over Taiwan, the Indian border, the South China Sea and other Asian hotspots, critics say.The INF Treaty “acted as a security guarantee for China: Beijing successfully made use of the mutual limitations imposed by the treaty on Russia and the United States to minimize the military threat to itself,” Russian consultant Andrey Baklitskiy wrote in a commentary for the Carnegie Moscow Center last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-lashes-out-at-us-withdrawal-from-open-skies-treaty/story-zd1Afe5vLDWG5cCXKHulgP.html

One of them muzzled me and the other attacked me with a metal bar. I tried to resist but they overpowered me. I pulled the mask of one of the attackers and saw his face,” the victim told the court.“I managed to remove the plastic bag and the tape and went outside the room. I went to my roommate and tried to chase the attackers,” he said.The burglars stole the man’s laptop, mobile phone, cash, and credit cards, the report said.While one of the burglars was arrested by a police patrol as the victim identified him, the other two remain at large.The 25-year-old Pakistani defendant has been charged by Dubai Public Prosecution with robbery and physically assaulting the victim, the report said.The next hearing in the case is scheduled for December 9, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-man-attacked-by-three-pakistani-burglars-in-uae/story-PWGUL3BgcAjnCpGyKPedkI.html

23-11-2020||World||UK sees AstraZeneca, Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine rollout starting December||Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the U.K. plans to start rolling out two coronavirus vaccines next month before the program gathers pace in the new year, with a return to “normal” possible in the spring.Hancock was responding to trial results announced Monday by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc showing their Covid-19 vaccine prevented a majority of people from getting the disease. It followed positive results this month from a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. Both still need to be assessed by the U.K. health regulator before they can be administered to the public.“If this all goes well in the next couple of weeks, then we are looking at the potential of starting the vaccination program next month for this Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as well as the Pfizer vaccine -- but in all cases the bulk of the rollout will be in the New Year,” Hancock told BBC Radio. “We are looking with high confidence now that after Easter things can really start to get back to normal.”The vaccine data adds to the government’s growing optimism that the U.K. is beginning to reverse the tide of the virus after a new wave of infections forced England into a second lockdown this month. Virus cases “are clearly starting to fall,” Hancock said, and ministers are discussing how to relax rules to allow families to get together at Christmas. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce the new winter strategy in Parliament on Monday.Mass TestingJohnson is also set to announce a massive increase in community coronavirus testing as part of a plan to reintroduce tiered restrictions in place of the England-wide lockdown. Areas under the strictest curbs will have access to regular tests. People who come into contact with someone with the disease will be able to avoid quarantine by taking a test every day for seven days, Johnson’s office said.The program, which will be trialled in Liverpool, northwest England, is due to be announced by the prime minister alongside tougher restrictions for the worst-hit areas, and guidelines for family visits “for a small number of days” over the Christmas holidays.“The increase in new cases is flattening off, but we are not out of the woods yet,” Johnson will tell lawmakers, according to his office. “With the expansion in testing and vaccines edging closer to deployment, the regional tiered system will help get the virus back under control and keep it there.”The prime minister is trying to balance the reopening of the economy in England -- where restaurants, bars and many shops have been closed since Nov. 5 -- with the need to slow the spread of the pandemic, which has killed more than 55,000 people in the U.K., including over 3,000 in the past week.Buying VaccinesVaccines will form a major part of coming out of the pandemic, and the U.K.’s vaccine procurement program has left it well-placed to capitalize on progress being made by the pharmaceuticals industry.Even before the vaccines had been tested, the U.K. had pre-ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca one. It also has bought 5 million doses of a third vaccine being developed by Moderna Inc. that’s also yielded positive results this month.“All three are showing that they are effective, and all three are now going to need to be looked at by the regulator to double, triple-check that they are safe,” Hancock told LBC Radio on Monday, adding that the vaccines have different properties that will be incorporated into the vaccination program.Under Johnson’s new plan, non-essential retailers and gyms will be allowed to reopen, and a curfew on hospitality businesses will be moved to 11pm from 10pm, according to a person familiar with the guidelines. More areas will be placed into the higher tiers of restrictions, with stricter limits on household mixing. Details of exactly where will be announced on Thursday.Rebel ToriesBut the prime minister is facing a rebellion from a group of 70 MPs from his Conservative Party, who warned they’ll not back the return of the tiered structure unless ministers provide a full “cost-benefit” analysis of the plan.Parliament is due to vote on the new rules before they come into force, and if all the signatories to the letter join the opposition parties to vote against Johnson, the government would face defeat.“We cannot support this approach further unless the government demonstrates the restrictions proposed for after Dec. 2 will have an impact on slowing the transmission of Covid, and will save more lives than they cost,” they wrote in a letter to Johnson. “The lockdown cure prescribed runs the very real risk of being worse than the disease.”Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak sought to reassure the potential rebels, saying the cost to livelihoods, particularly in the retail and hospitality sectors, is being taken into account along with wider health impacts.‘Damaging’“Restrictions on businesses’ ability to trade are enormously damaging, not just for them, but for the people that they employ,” Sunak told the BBC on Sunday. “As we’ve learned more, there’s opportunities for us to look and refine things.”The opposition Labour Party said it will “look closely” at the new proposals before deciding whether to support them. There needs to be better financial help for people affected by the restrictions and certainty for businesses, the party said.Under the new program, care workers, employees in food manufacturing, prisons and vaccination centers will be offered weekly swabs. Increased testing will also be used to allow more visits to residents in care homes, Johnson’s office said.Universities have also been offered mass asymptomatic testing to ensure students can safely travel home for Christmas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sees-astra-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-starting-december/story-vctitgysKzC6sl1317VTLO.html
23-11-2020||World||How does Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, with 70% efficacy, stack against Pfizer, Moderna?||The phase 3 interim analysis of Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine candidate showed 70.4 per cent efficacy in preventing the disease, the University of Oxford announced on Monday. In two different dosing regimens, the vaccine, AZD1222, showed the efficacy of 90 per cent and 62 per cent. In the dosing regimen with higher efficacy, AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart. Another dosing regimen showed lower efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 per cent. “Positive high-level results from an interim analysis of clinical trials of AZD1222 in the UK and Brazil showed the vaccine was highly effective in preventing COVID-19, the primary endpoint, and no hospitalisations or severe cases of the disease were reported in participants receiving the vaccine,” AstraZeneca said in a statement.How does it stack against Moderna, Pfizer?While 70 per cent efficacy of AZD1222 would have been considered a huge breakthrough a month back, it is relatively low when compared to 95 per cent efficacy of vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna. Also Watch l Covid, vaccine race & what we don’t know yet | Dr Guleria & Dr Jha #HTLS2020 However, the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine has an advantage in terms of storage since AZD1222 can be stored at fridge temperature, while Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines need to be stored at a much colder temperature.Pfizer’s vaccine candidate needs ultra-cold storage at around minus 75°C and can be kept in the fridge for five days. Moderna’s vaccine, mRNA-1273, is expected to remain stable at standard refrigerated conditions of 2°C to 8°C for up to 30 days within the 6-month shelf life. Oxford vaccine also scores better on pricing as it costs a fraction of the price set by Pfizer and Moderna and will be manufactured in multiple countries, including India and Brazil. On Thursday, Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India told Hindustan Times that, in India, Oxford vaccine will be priced at Rs 500-600.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-does-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-with-70-efficacy-stack-against-pfizer-moderna/story-FxucvEthcdCPuAvU5Xp2gL.html
23-11-2020||World||Carlos Ghosn’s repeated arrests were ‘extrajudicial abuse,’ says UN||Carlos Ghosn’s detention for almost 130 days in a Japanese jail was neither necessary nor reasonable and violated the former Nissan Motor Co. chairman’s human rights, a UN panel concluded in a harsh critique of Tokyo prosecutors who led the case against him.The decision to arrest Ghosn four times in a row so as to extend his detention was “fundamentally unfair,” the UN Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said in a report Monday posted on its website. The panel said that it would refer the case to the UN’s rapporteur on torture, cruel and other inhuman or degrading treatment.“The repeated arrest of Mr. Ghosn appears to be an abuse of process intended to ensure that he remained in custody,” the panel said, pointing out that on at least two occasions he was arrested for the same alleged crime, only for a different time period. “This revolving pattern of detention was an extrajudicial abuse of process that can have no legal basis under international law.”Ghosn and former Nissan director Greg Kelly were arrested in Tokyo on Nov. 19, 2018, and accused of underreporting the former chairman’s compensation. Both have denied wrongdoing. Additional charges were filed later accusing Ghosn of using company assets improperly, which he has denied.Ghosn made a daring escape from Japan to Lebanon hidden inside a large box aboard a private jet in late December. It was, Ghosn argued defiantly in Beirut later, the only way for him to avoid what he called trumped-up charges of financial misdeeds concocted with the help of his former Nissan colleagues. His arrest and removal as chairman of Nissan, Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. shook the foundations of the automaking alliance he built and triggered management and operational turmoil.“We welcome a courageous decision from an independent and respected authority, that undeniably establishes Mr. Ghosn’s detention was arbitrary, he was denied his right to impartial justice, and his treatment was unfair and degrading.” his lawyer, Francois Zimeray, said in a statement.A representative for Nissan declined to comment. There was no answer to a call to the Tokyo Public Prosecutor’s Office on Monday, a public holiday in Japan.While Ghosn is unlikely to ever face trial or detention in Japan again, the report could be relevant for several ongoing proceedings related to the former auto executive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/carlos-ghosn-s-jail-time-in-japan-called-abuse-of-process-by-un-panel/story-tnrGrNzEifvAbzz69VZBLP.html
23-11-2020||World||AstraZeneca will have 200 million Covid-19 vaccine doses by this year end||AstraZeneca will have enough of its candidate vaccine for 200 million doses by the end of 2020, with drug substance for 700 million doses by the end of the first quarter of 2021 globally, operations executive Pam Cheng said on Monday.Cheng told a briefing that the company would keep the “active” drug substance in stock while it awaited regulatory approval around the world.She said there would be enough vaccine for 20 million doses in Britain by the end of the year, with enough “active” drug substance for 70 million doses for the UK by the end of Q1 2021.She said she expected that to translate into 4 million finished vaccine doses by the end of 2020, and 40 million finished doses by the end of Q1 next year.Those calculations were based on using two full doses, she said, although trial data suggests higher efficacy when the initial shot is a half dose. “If we go with a half dose you can imagine for the initial dose, we will be able to double the number of vaccinations here,” she said.She said the figures referred to the vaccine doses being manufactured by AstraZeneca, and not those being made by manufacturing partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-will-have-200-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-by-the-end-of-2020/story-BjyvW8P3gUH2XnlaOK3B6O.html
23-11-2020||World||China tests millions after surge in Covid-19 cases in 3 cities||Chinese authorities are testing millions of people, imposing lockdowns and shutting down schools after multiple locally transmitted coronavirus cases were discovered in three cities across the country last week.As temperatures drop, large-scale measures are being enacted in the cities of Tianjin, Shanghai and Manzhouli, despite the low number of new cases compared to the United States and other countries that are seeing new waves of infections.Many experts and government officials have warned that the chance of the virus spreading will be greater during the cold weather. Recent flareups have shown that there is still a risk of the virus returning, despite being largely controlled within China.On Monday, the National Health Commission reported two new locally transmitted cases in Shanghai over the last 24 hours, bringing the total to seven since Friday.China has recorded 86,442 total cases and 4,634 deaths since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.The two latest cases confirmed in Shanghai were close contacts of another airport worker who was diagnosed with Covid-19 earlier in November.On Sunday night, the city’s Pudong International airport decided to test its workers, collecting 17,719 samples through the early hours of Monday morning. Plans call for testing others in surrounding communities if further cases are detected.Videos on social media purportedly from workers showed what appeared to be chaotic scenes at the airport as they were given last-minute orders to get tested. In the videos, people are seen standing in large groups pushing back and forth against officials in hazmat suits.Shanghai has been more selective with mass testing, targeting people associated with a particular place, such as the airport or the hospital where a confirmed individual had worked, rather than an entire district.In Tianjin, health workers have collected more than 2.2 million samples for testing from residents in the Binhai new district, after five locally transmitted cases were discovered there last week.In Manzhouli, a city of more than 200,000 people, local health authorities are testing all residents after two cases were reported on Saturday. They also shut down all schools and public venues and banned public gatherings such as banquets.China has resorted to its heavy, top-down approach each time new cases of local transmission are found — shutting down schools and hospitals, locking down residential communities and entire neighborhoods, and testing millions.Read more | Indian Army takes a leaf out of Chinese warfare, deploys tunnel defences in LadakhTianjin authorities shut down a kindergarten and moved all the teachers, family and students to a centralized quarantine space. They also sealed the residential compound where the five cases were found.China’s approach to controlling the pandemic has been criticized for being draconian. It locked down the city of Wuhan, where cases were first reported, for more than two months to contain the virus, with the local government shutting down all traffic and confining residents to their homes. Domestically, however, China has called its strategy “clear to zero” and has boasted of its success.“In the entire world, only China has the ability to get to zero. Other countries don’t have this ability,” Zeng Guang, the chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a webinar hosted by Chinese media in September.“It’s not just getting to zero, even for them to control the first wave of the epidemic is hard.” “’Clearing to zero’ is actually the most economically effective way to do epidemic prevention. If you don’t do that, then this problem will get more troublesome,” he said. “Use a heavier hand, and get to zero, then people will feel reassured.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tests-millions-after-surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-3-cities/story-vNxszMopE8mbXI43eRyiUN.html

India was earlier expected to be president of the G20 in 2022, coinciding with the 75th year of its independence. It had sought a swap with Italy, which was set to be the chair in 2022 and agreed to take on the presidency in 2021. A declaration adopted at the end of the G20 Summit on Sunday said, “We look forward to our next meetings in Italy in 2021, Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023 and Brazil in 2024.” Though no official reason was available for the sudden change, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the order of the rotating presidency of the G20 is decided among members on the basis of consultations and mutual convenience. Also read | PM Modi lists India’s progress on climate change targets on G20 sidelines“India looks forward to taking forward the G20 agenda in 2023 after the Italian and Indonesian presidencies,” one of the people cited above said. Indonesian foreign minister Retno Marsudi told a virtual news briefing that her country had discussed the exchange with India because a G20 presidency in 2023 would have overlapped with presidency of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). “Indonesia has discussed the exchange for our presidency term in G20 with India, and fortunately, India has a similar intention to lead the bloc in 2023,” Marsudi said. Instead of India, Indonesia will now join G20’s “troika” in 2021 along with Saudi Arabia and Italy. The troika is a transitional mechanism that works to ensure that incoming presidents continue the vision of the previous chair.

Gen. Yehia Sarie, a Houthi military spokesman, tweeted that the rebels fired a new Quds-2 cruise missile at the facility. He posted a satellite image online that matched Aramco’s North Jiddah Bulk Plant, where oil products are stored in tanks.That facility is just southeast of Jiddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport, a major airfield that handles incoming Muslim pilgrims en route to nearby Mecca.Online videos appeared to show a tank farm similar to the bulk plant on fire, with wailing sirens heard and police cars alongside a highway by the facility. Details of the videos posted predawn Monday matched the general layout of the bulk plant. However, passers-by could not see damage to the tank farm from the highway running beside the facility later Monday morning.Saudi state-run media did not immediately acknowledge the Houthi claim. Saudi Aramco, the kingdom’s oil giant that now has a sliver of its worth traded publicly on the stock market, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its stock traded down slightly early Monday on Riyadh’s Tadawul stock exchange as crude oil prices remained steady above $40 a barrel.The claimed attack comes just after a visit by outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the kingdom to see Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The kingdom also just hosted the annual G20 summit, which concluded Sunday.A Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iranian-backed Houthis since March 2015, months after the rebels seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa. The war has ground into a stalemate since, with Saudi Arabia facing international criticism for its airstrikes killing civilians.The Houthis have used Quds, or “Jerusalem,” missiles to target Saudi Arabia in the past. The Quds-1 has a copy of a small, Czech-made TJ-100 jet engine, with a range of 700 kilometers (435 miles). United Nations experts have said they don’t believe the missiles are built in Yemen and instead have been sold or traded to them in violation of an arms embargo.Iran uses a copy of TJ-100 engines in its drone program. U.N. experts, Arab countries and the West say Iran supplies arms to the rebels, allegations denied by Tehran.The Quds-1 was used in a missile-and-drone strike on the heart of the kingdom’s oil industry in 2019 that shook global energy markets. The U.S. believes Iran carried out that attack amid a series of escalating incidents last year between Tehran and Washington, something Tehran denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yemen-rebels-claim-attack-on-saudi-oil-facility-in-jiddah/story-raPd6uZg3Y6UCxAt0Nr3PO.html
23-11-2020||World||Germany moves toward tightening partial lockdown against Covid-19 until Dec 20||Germany is moving toward extending and tightening its shutdown restrictions, setting measures that would rein in New Year’s festivities as the country struggles to slow the rapid spread of the coronavirus.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Germany’s regional leaders are proposing that a partial lockdown that was due to run until the end of November get extended until at least Dec 20. The measures would be rolled over for periods of two weeks if contagion rates remain above the government’s target level, according to a briefing paper drawn up by the officials and published in German media.“The numbers have slowed, but they are still too high,” Manuela Schwesig, the premier of the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, said Monday in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio. “We still need strict rules for the whole of Germany, particularly restrictions on contact.”The 16 state premiers will hold further talks on Monday before final decisions are made in consultation with Chancellor Angela Merkel and the federal government on Wednesday. The plan would ban the sale of fireworks for New Year’s Eve and further restrict the number of people allowed in private gatherings.While the measures are being toughened now, leaders of Europe’s largest economy have said the goal is to allow Germans to celebrate Christmas with their families.The paper also calls for an extension of financial aid for businesses such as shuttered bars and restaurants -- which cost around 15 billion euros ($17.8 billion) this month. Areas with lower infection rates could potentially ease restrictions early.Also Read | Germany may start Covid-19 vaccine programme in December: Health ministerThe number of cases in Germany has tripled since the start of October to more than 900,000, and the amount of people with disease in intensive care is at record levels. The surge in infections prompted officials to impose a partial shutdown that closed bars, restaurants, gyms and cultural venues, while keeping most of the economy running.Merkel has said the seven-day incidence per 100,000 citizens needs to come down to around 50 before the latest curbs can be eased. It was at 141 on Sunday, according to the latest report from the RKI public health institute.“The fact is that we haven’t got as far as we wanted to through the contact restrictions,” Merkel said late Sunday after a video conference with G-20 leaders. “That means we will surely have to do something more.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-moves-toward-tightening-partial-lockdown-against-covid-19-until-dec-20/story-ZU53wT7fflrl2E6EeHABrJ.html

All results were statistically significant.The interim analysis was based on 131 infections among participants who received the vaccine and those in a control group who were given an established meningitis shot.The data showing a range of efficacy between 60% and 90% comes after US rivals published interim data in recent weeks showing efficacy of more than 90%.While the efficacy reading from Astra’s viral vector vaccine is lower than its U.S. rivals, the data will boost confidence about the chances of successfully developing a variety of vaccines using different approaches. Public health experts say the world will need many vaccines to meet global demand.On Nov. 16, U.S.-based Moderna Inc said its experimental vaccine proved to be 94.5% effective based on an early data analysis. A week earlier, Pfizer Inc and Germany’s BioNTech SE said their vaccine candidate had demonstrated greater than 90% efficacy that rose to 95% with analysis of full trial data.Russia’s Sputnik-V vaccine on Nov. 11 was also shown to be more than 90% effective, though only based on 20 infections. The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee common cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus, which is different than the new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA) deployed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.The company - one of the UK’s most valuable listed companies - will now immediately prepare regulatory submission of the data to authorities around the world that have a framework in place for conditional or early approval.It will also seek an emergency use listing from the World Health Organization to speed up availability in low-income countries. In parallel, the full analysis of the interim results is being submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-can-be-90-effective-results-show/story-tWYN3QoOmXgx9SJTWtFnvJ.html

Francis was a 21-year-old seminarian in the second year of his studies for the priesthood in his native Buenos Aires when an illness that had been mis-diagnosed as influenza worsened and he was hospitalised.“They took about a litre and a half of water out of one lung and I was hanging between life and death,” he said. Several months later doctors removed the upper lobe of his right lung. Today, the 83-year-old pope can be heard breathing heavily after climbing stairs. “(The experience) changed my bearings,” he said. “For months I didn’t know who I was, if I would live or die, even the doctors didn’t know. I remember hugging my mother one day and asking her if I was about to die.”Francis recounts how a nun who worked as nurse helped save his life by secretly doubling the doses of penicillin and streptomycin that a doctor had prescribed.“Thanks to her regular contact with sick people, she knew what patients needed better than the doctor and had the courage to put that experience to work,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-says-his-brush-with-death-helps-him-relate-to-covid-19-victims/story-Ndao5xdsKgW1bovQm9r9nK.html

These restrictions will go into effect on Tuesday. Even though the state avoided strict restrictions throughout the fall as Nevada’s economy is based on tourism, Governor Sisolak who recently contracted Covid-19 himself said, “We are on a rapid trajectory that threatens to overwhelm our health care system, our frontline health workers, and your access to care. So it’s time to act.”The restrictions come at a time when health officials reported 2,155 confirmed cases on Sunday increasing the statewide total to 133,888 since the onset of the pandemic. They include mandatory wearing of masks (indoors and outdoors) and reducing occupancy in eating places and public places to 25 per cent but not closing any businesses completely as Sisolak called these restrictions that would be in place for three weeks, “ a statewide pause”.Read more | US Covid-19 death toll rises to 255,076; more than 184,500 fresh casesNevada is not alone in imposing restrictions as California has put a curfew order in effect in the majority of its counties.

23-11-2020||World||70% efficacy: Astrazeneca to seek emergency use listing from WHO, focus on low-income countries||Soon after Astrazeneca announced the Oxford vaccine has shown 70 per cent efficacy, the company said the immediate next step would be to seek an emergency use listing from the World Health Organization for an “accelerated pathway to vaccine availability in low-income countries.” It will also prepare regulatory submission of data to authorities around the world that have a framework in place for conditional or early approval. “These findings show that we have an effective vaccine that will save many lives. Excitingly, we’ve found that one of our dosing regimens may be around 90% effective and if this dosing regime is used, more people could be vaccinated with planned vaccine supply. Today’s announcement is only possible thanks to the many volunteers in our trial, and the hard working and talented team of researchers based around the world,” professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford, said.The vaccine stopped an average of 70% of participants in a study from falling ill, an early analysis of the data show. The findings were reviewed after 131 trial participants contracted Covid-19, and are based on two different dosing regimes. However, none of those 131 patients had to be hospitalised. One dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy of 90% when AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart, and another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted in an average efficacy of 70%.Astrazeneca said the company is making rapid progress in manufacturing with a capacity of up to 3 billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 on a rolling basis, pending regulatory approval. The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius/ 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered within existing healthcare settings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/70-efficacy-astrazeneca-to-seek-emergency-use-listing-from-who-focus-on-low-income-countries/story-XcL6BxL4YgF5i6MQzyInlN.html
23-11-2020||World||China in final preparations for latest lunar mission||Chinese technicians were making final preparations Monday for a mission to bring back material from the moon’s surface in what would be a major advance for the country’s space program.Chang’e 5 is China’s most ambitious lunar mission yet and marks the first time in four decades that any country has sought to bring rocks and debris from the moon to Earth. That could boost human understanding of the moon, its age and resources, and of the solar system more generally.The four modules of the Chang’e 5 spacecraft are expected be sent into space Tuesday aboard a massive Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang launch center along the coast of the southern island province of Hainan, according to a NASA description of the mission.The secretive Chinese National Space Administration has only said that a launch is scheduled for late November.The mission’s key task is to drill 2 meters (almost 7 feet) beneath the moon’s surface and scoop up about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of rocks and other debris to be brought back to Earth, according to NASA. That would the first opportunity scientists have had to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.The mission is “indeed challenging,” but China has already landed twice on the moon with its Chang’e 3 and Chang’e 4 missions, and showed with a 2014 Chang’e 5 test mission that it can navigate back to Earth, re-enter and land a capsule, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. All that’s left is to show it can collect samples and take off again from the moon, McDowell said.“As a result of this, I’m pretty optimistic that China can pull this off,” he said.Such experience is growing in value with more and more countries conducting asteroid sample returns and considering Mars sample returns, McDowell said.After making the three-day trip from Earth, the Chang’e 5 lander’s time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units that China’s current lunar rover, the Chang’e 4, possesses to withstand the moon’s freezing nights.Launched as a single space craft, Chang’e 5 is actually composed of a lander, ascender, service module and return capsule.The lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to the ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule for the trip home to earth.The technical complexity of Chang’e 5, with its four components, makes it “remarkable in many ways,” said Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the U.S. Naval War College.If successful, it could be a blueprint for a Mars sample return or even a crewed lunar mission, Johnson-Freese said.“China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programs, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships,” she said.The mission, named for the Chinese moon goddess Chang’e, is among China’s boldest since it first put a man in space in 2003, becoming only the third nation to do so after the U.S. and Russia.While many of China’s crewed spaceflight achievements, including building an experimental space station and conducting a space walk, reproduce those of other countries from years past, the CNSA is now moving into new territory.Chang’e 4 —the first soft landing on the moon’s relatively unexplored far side — is providing full measurements of radiation exposure from the lunar surface, information vital for any country that plans to send astronauts to the moon.China in July became one of three countries to have launched a mission to Mars, in China’s case an orbiter and a rover that will search for signs of water on the red planet. The CNSA says the spacecraft Tianwen 1 is on course to arrive at Mars around February.China has increasingly engaged with foreign countries on missions, and the European Space Agency will be providing important ground station information for Chang’e 5.US law however still prevents most collaborations with NASA, excluding China from partnering with the International Space Station. That has prompted China to start work on its own space station and launch its own programs that have put it in a steady competition with Japan and India among Asian nations seeking to notch new achievements in space.China’s space program has progressed cautiously, with relatively few setbacks in recent years. The Long March-5 rocket, nicknamed “Fat 5” because of its bulky shape, failed on a previous launch attempt, but has since performed without a glitch, including launching Chang’e 4.“China works very incrementally, developing building blocks for long-term use for a variety of missions,” Freese-Johnson said. China’s one-party authoritarian system also allows for “prolonged political will that is often difficult in democracies,” she said.While the U.S. has followed China’s successes closely, it’s unlikely to engage China in space amid political suspicions, a sharpening military rivalry and accusations of Chinese theft of technology, experts say.“A change in U.S. policy regarding space cooperation is unlikely to get much government attention in the near future,” Johnson-Freese said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-in-final-preparations-for-latest-lunar-mission/story-NtasFJtnwHIUW0VHITIl7M.html
23-11-2020||World||Anthony Blinken, likely secretary of state, is positive on US-India ties||US President-elect Joe Biden is expected to appoint Anthony Blinken, a long-time national security and foreign policy expert who has been enthusiastic about ties with India and called China a “common challenge”, as his secretary of state, US media reported.Jake Sullivan, a former top state department official in the Obama-Biden administration, is reported to be a frontrunner for the position of National Security Adviser. Michele Flournoy and Lael Brainard are top contenders for secretaries of defence and treasury.Vivek Murthy, the Indian American who was President Barack Obama’s Surgeon General, is in contention for the position of secretary of health and human services. He is currently a co-chair of Biden’s team of advisers tasked with preparing the incoming administration’s Covid-19 plan.Biden’s incoming chief of staff Ron Klain told ABC News on Sunday the president-elect will name some of his cabinet secretaries on Tuesday. But he did not specify how many and which ones. But names began trickling out hours later that, according to a pattern noticed to be true for the incoming administration, have tended to be remarkably on target.Blinken, who served as deputy secretary of state in the Obama-Biden administration, had been a frontrunner for the position of Biden’s top diplomat. He was also Biden campaign’s chief foreign policy official who also determined — among other things — the order in which the president-elect returned congratulatory calls from world leaders. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first leaders of non-treaty allied countries Biden called, along with Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu.In an outreach to the Indian American community in the run-up to the election — on August 15, to commemorate the Indian Independence Day — Blinken described China as a “common challenge”, taking into cognizance China’s “aggression toward India at the line of actual control.Speaking generally of ties with India he had said, “We will be an advocate for India to play a leading role in international institutions and that includes helping India get a seat on a reform. United Nations Security Council. We will work together to strengthen India’s defence.”Blinken had gone on to reiterate long-running US commitment to combating terrorism, making common cause with India. “We have no tolerance for terrorism in South Asia or anywhere else, cross-border, or otherwise,” Blinken had said, recalling meetings he attended with Rich Verma, the former US ambassador to India who moderated the panel discussion with Blinken and Nisha Biswal, the first Indian American to head the state department’s South and Central Asia bureau. “I was in virtually every NSC meeting with both of you in many instances on this issue. We used every tool at our disposal to make sure that our citizens, and the citizens of our partners are safe. And that’s something we will build on in a Biden ministration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-blinken-likely-secretary-of-state-is-positive-on-us-india-ties/story-nG4uOcqG3nyAdlKs9SvwxI.html

That’s below the high bar set by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., but effectiveness rose to 90% for one of two dosing regimes, using half a dose followed by a full one later. The other method showed 62% effectiveness.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We are excited to see 90% efficacy from the half dose-full dose regimen,” an Astra spokesman said. “We see a lot of merit in this regimen and we will now start discussions with regulators into incorporating this dose combination for further clinical investigation.”ALSO WATCH | SII’s Adar Poonawala on side-effects of Oxford’s Covid vaccine at #HTLS2020 The findings were reviewed after 131 trial participants contracted Covid-19. Among those who received the vaccine, there were no severe cases of Covid-19 in the trial and no participants were hospitalized.Two regimesThe differing results of the two regimens may leave questions about the best way to give the AstraZeneca shot. The results also look slightly less promising than data from Moderna, which said its shot stopped 94.5% of trial participants from falling ill, according to early data. Pfizer, which is working with German partner BioNTech SE, said its vaccine candidate prevented 95% of symptomatic infections.Also Read: Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine safe in older adults, induces immune response: LancetDespite the apparently lower efficacy, the British shot has some advantages when it comes to distribution. While the other two vaccines have to be stored frozen, the Astra-Oxford jab can be kept at refrigerator temperature, which would make it easier to transport and store globally, particularly in lower and middle-income countries. It also comes at a potentially lower cost.Analysts at Barclays Plc put consensus expectations for what would be deemed a success from AstraZeneca at 70% to 90%, following conversations with investors in Europe and the U.S.AstraZeneca said it will immediately prepare to submit data to authorities around the world that have a framework in place for early approval. The company said it will seek an emergency use listing from the World Health Organization for an accelerated pathway to vaccine availability in low-income countries.U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Sky News on Monday that British regulators will now need to make sure the vaccine is “effective and safe.”“Should all that go well, the bulk of the rollout will be in the new year,” Hancock said.Rolling reviewsVaccine developers will not know how long any protection lasts for a number of months as they monitor antibody levels to see how quickly or not they fade.

23-11-2020||World||‘Certainly a weak president’: Chinese government advisor thinks Biden could start war||US President-elect Joe Biden is certainly a very weak President and he could start a war with China, a Chienese government advisor has said underlying the need for the China government to mend ties with the US. Zheng Yongnian, the Dean of the Advanced Institute of Global and Contemporary China Studies, a Shenzhen-based think tank, has analysed that if Biden can’t sort out domestic issues, then he could easily do something against China. Trump was not interested in wars, as he was not interested in promoting democracy and freedom, but Biden is.“He is certainly a very weak President, if he can’t sort out domestic issues, then he will do something on the diplomatic front, do something against China. If we say Trump is not interested in promoting democracy and freedom, Biden is. (President Donald) Trump is not interested in war... but a Democratic President could start wars,” Zheng Yongnian said.Zheng said Biden might take advantage of the public resentment towards China after he entered the White House. “American society is torn apart. I don’t think Biden can do anything about it,” he said. And Biden had left enough indications of how his China policy would be during his campaigning, Zheng said reminding China of how Biden called Xi Jinping a “thug”. China’s relationship with the US, which has deteriorated during Trump’s presidency, will not improve automatically under Biden, Zheng Yongnian has noted. Instead, Beijing should be prepared for a tough stance from Washington.“The good old days are over... the cold war hawks in the US have been in a highly mobilised state for several years, and they will not disappear overnight,” Zheng said in an interview on the sidelines of the Understanding China Conference in Guangzhou recently.Zheng, who attended a symposium hosted by President Xi Jinping in August to offer advice on China’s long-term strategy, said there was now a bipartisan consensus in the US on containing China.Over 300 separate Bills targeting China have been drawn up by both Democrats and Republicans in the Congress, and the important ones addressing the catastrophes in Hong Kong and Xinjiang enjoyed full bipartisan support. The most potentially effective law, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which Trump only reluctantly signed, was co-sponsored by Republican Marco Rubio and Kamala Harris, the Democrats’ Vice-President-elect.(With ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/certainly-a-weak-president-chinese-government-advisor-thinks-biden-could-start-war/story-RoLwp8CYS5EOy4USDBsZnO.html
23-11-2020||World||Hong Kong’s pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong to plead guilty to protest charges||Prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said Monday that he plans to plead guilty to charges related to a demonstration outside police headquarters during anti-government protests last year.Ahead of a court hearing Monday, Wong said that he and fellow activist Ivan Lam would both plead guilty to organizing, taking part in and inciting protesters to join an unauthorized protest outside police headquarters in Wan Chai last June. Both Wong and Lam were members of the now-disbanded Demosisto political party.“I am persuaded that neither prison bars, nor election ban, nor any other arbitrary powers would stop us from activism,” Wong said.“What we are doing now is to explain the value of freedom to the world, through our compassion to whom we love, so much that we are willing to sacrifice the freedom of our own. I’m prepared for the thin chance of walking free.”Those found guilty of taking part in an unlawful assembly could face as long as five years in prison depending on the severity of the offense.Wong rose to prominence as a student leader during the 2014 Umbrella Movement pro-democracy protests and is among a growing number of activists being charged for various relatively minor offenses since Beijing in June imposed a sweeping national security law on the territory that has severely restricted political speech.Pro-democracy supporters have said the legal charges are part of a campaign to harass and intimidate them.Lam, who also spoke ahead of the court hearing, said he too was prepared to be jailed.Wong wrote on his Facebook page on Sunday that he and Lam had decided to plead guilty after consulting with their lawyers. The two previously pleaded not guilty to the charges.Another activist, Agnes Chow, has already pleaded guilty to charges of inciting others and taking part in the protest.“If I am sentenced to prison this time, it will be the first time in my life that I have been in jail,” Chow wrote on her Facebook page on Sunday.“Although I am mentally prepared, I still feel a little bit scared. However, compared to many friends, I have suffered very little. When I think of this, I will try my best to face it bravely,” she wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-pro-democracy-activist-joshua-wong-to-plead-guilty-to-protest-charges/story-3xykuNeBniqP5hGkZeDpYP.html
23-11-2020||World||In latest China jab, US drafts list of 89 firms with military ties||The Trump administration is close to declaring that 89 Chinese aerospace and other companies have military ties, restricting them from buying a range of US goods and technology, according to a draft copy of the list seen by Reuters.The list, if published, could further escalate trade tensions with Beijing and hurt US companies that sell civil aviation parts and components to China, among other industries.A spokesman for the US Department of Commerce, which produced the list, declined to comment. The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately response to a request for comment.Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing and Airbus, is on the list, as is Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and 10 of its related entities. The list is included in a draft rule that identifies Chinese and Russian companies the US considers “military end users,” a designation that means U.S. suppliers must seek licenses to sell a broad swath of commercially available items to them. According to the rule, applications for such licenses are more likely to be denied than granted. US President Donald Trump has stepped up his actions in recent months against China. Ten days ago, he unveiled an executive order prohibiting US investments in Chinese companies that Washington says are owned or controlled by the Chinese military. The pending list comes after the Commerce Department expanded the definition of “military end user” in April. The April rule includes not only armed service and national police, but any person or entity that supports or contributes to the maintenance or production of military items -- even if their business is primarily non-military.The export restriction applies to items as disparate as computer software like word processing, scientific equipment like digital oscilloscopes, and aircraft parts and components. In terms of aircraft, the items include everything from brackets for flight control boxes to the engines themselves. News of the list comes at a sensitive time for the US aerospace industry as Boeing seeks Chinese approval of its 737 MAX after it was cleared by US regulators last week. In March 2019, China was the first nation to ground the jet following two fatal crashes and it is already expected to wait months to lift the ban. A spokesman for Boeing declined to comment.Washington trade lawyer Kevin Wolf, a former Commerce official, said Commerce had shared the draft rule with a technical advisory committee of industry representatives, and it should have been kept confidential.Wolf said the rule and list still could be modified and that the clock was running out for it to go into effect under the Trump administration since it would need to be cleared and sent to the Federal Register, the official US publication for rules, by mid-December. In the draft rule seen by Reuters, the Commerce Department said being able to control the flow of US technology to the listed companies was “vital for protecting US national security interests”.But a former US official who did not want to be identified, said “merely creating a list and populating it is a provocative act.” An aerospace industry source said it could spur China to retaliate. The inclusion of COMAC would come as a surprise to at least one major US supplier, which had determined the company was not a military end user, the industry source said. A list also would provide European competitors with an opening to promote their manufacturers, by pointing out they do not have to clear such hurdles, even if the US grants the licenses, the industry source said.General Electric Co and Honeywell International, both supply COMAC and have joint ventures with AVIC.A GE spokesperson said its global joint ventures operate in compliance with all laws, and that the company has worked to obtain licenses related to military end users. A Honeywell spokeswoman declined to comment.Besides the 89 Chinese listings, the draft rule also designates 28 Russian entities, including Irkut, which is also aiming to break into Boeing’s market with its MC-21 jetliner development. The 117-company list is “not exhaustive,” the draft rule said, and is considered an “initial tranche.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-latest-china-jab-us-drafts-list-of-89-firms-with-military-ties/story-T3b3F4M7iZVI9kWV9KzGuL.html

Gyms and non-essential retail are also expected to be allowed to re-open in all areas under the new plans.Also Read: Covid-19: Prepare for economic shock, warns Rishi SunakAccording to the Telegraph, the government will also announce on Monday that self-isolation will no longer be required for those who have come into contact with people who have tested positive for Covid-19.After December 2, some local measures will be the same as those in the previous three-tier system, which was in place until the current lockdown began, but the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) is expected to publish research on Monday saying the previous restrictions were not strong enough, the report added.All regions of England will be notified on Thursday which tier they will be put into after the lockdown ends and MPs are expected to vote on the new tier system before it comes into force.Also Read: Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine could get UK approval this week: ReportSince before the pandemic, England has three tiers of restrictions - medium, high, and very high. Tier 1, or medium tier of restrictions means there is a rule of six if meeting indoors or outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm. Tier 2 or high tier of restrictions means no household mixing indoors; rule of six applies outdoors; pubs and restaurants shut at 10pm. Under the highest tier of restrictions, tier 3, no household mixing indoors or in some outdoor spaces; pubs and bars not serving meals are closed.Talking about a UK-wide approach to restrictions this Christmas, BBC’s deputy political editor Vicki Young said “One option that was discussed in meetings this weekend was that three households could be allowed to meet up for up to five days.” Other announcements regarding arrangements for the Christmas period will be made by PM Johnson on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-to-unveil-a-tougher-3-tiered-system-after-lockdown/story-H3uRKUjNaeqf4DzBjfZkgL.html
23-11-2020||World||US hopes to start virus vaccines in December as pandemic surges||The United States hopes to begin coronavirus vaccinations in early December, a top government health official said Sunday, the latest positive news to emerge even as cases surge across the worst-hit nation and elsewhere around the globe.The beginning of vaccinations could be a crucial shift in the battle against a virus that has claimed more than 1.4 million lives worldwide, including 255,000 just in the US, since emerging from China late last year.Encouraging results from vaccine trials have bolstered hopes for an end to the pandemic, as nations reimpose restrictions and lockdowns that slowed the spread earlier this year but turned lives and economies upside down across the globe.Two leading vaccine candidates -- one by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech and another by US firm Moderna -- have been shown to be 95 percent effective in trials, and Pfizer has already applied for emergency use approval from US health authorities. “Our plan is to be able to ship vaccines to the immunization sites within 24 hours of approval” by the US Food and Drug Administration, Moncef Slaoui, head of the US government virus vaccine effort, told CNN, pointing to possible dates of December 11-12.FDA vaccine advisors will meet December 10 to discuss approval.Slaoui estimated that 20 million people across the US could be vaccinated in December, with 30 million per month after that.But top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci, who said “maybe 20 million people will be able to get vaccinated by the middle to the end of December,” warned the situation could get worse before getting better if people fail to take precautions in the coming holiday season.“We’re in a very difficult situation at all levels,” he told CBS’s “Face the Nation.”- Vaccines for all? -With cases surpassing 12 million in the United States, the highest in the world, many Americans were nonetheless heading to airports to travel for this week’s Thanksgiving holiday, despite health officials’ warnings to stay home.Some US states were imposing new restrictions, including California, where a 10:00 pm to 5:00 am curfew took effect Saturday. New York city has closed schools again.Texas, which earlier this month became the first state to record more than one million coronavirus cases, has called in the National Guard to support the city of El Paso.Mayor Dee Margo announced on Twitter that the National Guard would provide backup to the county’s morgue operations.US drug regulators on Saturday already gave emergency approval to a Covid-19 antibody therapy -- one used by US President Donald Trump -- that could help treat those infected.However, G20 nations were pushing for “equitable” global access to vaccines, with worries poorer nations will be left behind.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done, since no major vaccine agreements had been struck yet for poorer nations.“We will now speak with (global vaccine alliance group) GAVI about when these negotiations will begin because I am somewhat worried that nothing has been done on that yet,” Merkel told reporters on Sunday in Berlin after a virtual G20 summit hosted by Saudi Arabia.There were signs that restrictions being imposed in certain countries were helping slow infections.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, whose country has been badly hit by the pandemic, said Sunday that a strategy to curb infections was working.Spain declared a state of emergency last month, which allowed regional governments to impose virus restrictions such as nighttime curfews.The country has recorded fewer than 400 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the last two weeks, compared to nearly 530 cases at the start of the month, he told a news conference after the G20 summit.- ‘A mockery’ -But the restrictions and mask-wearing rules have led to protests in some countries, particularly the United States, where people -- mainly Trump supporters -- have railed against closures.US media reported that hundreds of protesters gathered in Huntington Beach Saturday night, in defiance of California’s newly implemented curfew.Similar pushback has been seen elsewhere, and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas lashed out Sunday at anti-mask protesters comparing themselves to Nazi victims, accusing them of trivializing the Holocaust and “making a mockery” of the courage shown by resistance fighters.The harsh words came after a young woman took to the stage at a protest against coronavirus restrictions in Hanover Saturday saying she felt “just like Sophie Scholl,” the German student executed by the Nazis in 1943 for her role in the resistance.Government measures introduced to halt the spread of the coronavirus have triggered large protests in Germany, drawing in people from the far-left, conspiracy theorists and right-wing extremists who claim the curbs infringe on their civil rights.While necessary to stop the spread of the virus, restrictions have taken a heavy toll on economies across the world.Another such warning came on Sunday from Britain’s finance minister Rishi Sunak, who said the country’s economy was under “enormous strain and stress.”Britain has suffered more than any other country in Europe from the coronavirus, recording more than 54,000 deaths from 1.4 million cases.In November, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government imposed a four-week lockdown to stop the spread of the disease. That is due to be partially lifted on December 2, giving some relief to businesses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hopes-to-start-virus-vaccines-in-december-as-pandemic-surges/story-h3C0bfjX8gKEQdQ6LwlzrL.html
23-11-2020||World||Joe Biden to unveil first Cabinet picks on Tuesday, envisions scaled-down inauguration||President-elect Joe Biden will announce the first of his Cabinet appointments on Tuesday and is planning for a scaled-down inauguration due to the coronavirus pandemic, aides said on Sunday, as he lays the foundation for his new administration despite President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede.Since Biden, a Democrat, was declared the winner of the Nov. 3 election two weeks ago, the Republican president has launched a barrage of lawsuits and mounted a pressure campaign to prevent state officials from certifying their vote totals, suffering another emphatic legal setback on Saturday in Pennsylvania.Ron Klain, Biden’s choice as White House chief of staff, again urged that the Trump administration - specifically a federal agency called the General Services Administration (GSA) - formally recognize Biden’s victory to unlock resources for the transition process.“I hope that the administrator of the GSA will do her job,” Klain added, referring to GSA chief Emily Murphy.Biden is due to take office on Jan. 20.Also Read: Joe Biden poised to name cabinet“A record number of Americans rejected the Trump presidency, and since then Donald Trump’s been rejecting democracy,” Klain told ABC’s “This Week” program.Biden received 6 million more votes nationwide than Trump and prevailed 306-232 in the state-by-state Electoral College system that determines the election’s victor.The former vice president, working in his home state of Delaware, has announced a series of selections for White House posts. Klain said that “you’re going to see the first Cabinet picks this Tuesday,” but declined to disclose the choices or the posts to be filled.Biden said on Thursday he had chosen a treasury secretary. Candidates on Biden’s shortlist include former Fed Chair Janet Yellen, current Fed Governor Lael Brainard, Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor, and Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.Biden allies also indicated he could announce his selection for secretary of state as soon as this week, with former national security adviser Susan Rice and veteran diplomat Antony Blinken seen as among the candidates.FAILING IN THE COURTSKlain said there would be “scaled-down versions of the existing traditions” for Biden’s inauguration. Inauguration ceremonies and related events typically draw huge crowds to Washington. Covid-19 cases and deaths are surging in many parts of the country amid a pandemic that has killed more than 256,000 people in the United States.“We know people want to celebrate. There is something here to celebrate,” Klain said. “We just want to try to find a way to do it as safely as possible.”Critics of Trump, including Democrats and some Republicans, have accused him of trying to undermine faith in the American electoral system and delegitimize Biden’s victory by promoting false claims of widespread voter fraud.“Fight hard Republicans,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday morning as he pressed his unsubstantiated narrative of voter fraud before playing golf in Virginia for a second day in a row.Also Read: Trump wants courts to step in, maintain US ‘integrity’ as Biden set to form cabinetAttempts to thwart certification of vote tallies have failed thus far in courts in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona. U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, in dismissing the Pennsylvania lawsuit on Saturday, compared the Trump team’s arguments claiming voter fraud to a “Frankenstein’s Monster” that was “haphazardly stitched together” using meritless legal arguments and speculative accusations.Trump’s campaign issued a statement on Sunday distancing itself from Sidney Powell, a lawyer who made baseless allegations of a vast vote-rigging conspiracy at a campaign news conference on Thursday.“Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own,” Trump campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis said in the statement. “She is not a member of the Trump Legal Team. She is also not a lawyer for the President in his personal capacity.”Both Giuliani and Ellis attended the Thursday news conference alongside Powell. Powell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump’s campaign also said it was appealing Brann’s decision to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Pennsylvania is expected to certify its election results on Monday.Trump’s campaign has filed a petition for another recount in Georgia. A previous laborious hand recount reaffirmed Biden’s victory by a margin of more than 12,000 votes in the Southern state, a longtime Republican bastion in presidential elections.‘NATIONAL EMBARRASSMENT’Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans are now breaking ranks, although many, including the most senior ones in Congress, have not.Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who has served as a Trump adviser, called the president’s legal team a “national embarrassment.”“They allege fraud outside the courtroom, but when they go inside the courtroom they don’t plead fraud and they don’t argue fraud,” Christie told ABC’s “This Week,” adding that “if you’re unwilling to come forward and present the evidence, it must mean the evidence doesn’t exist.”Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski tweeted on Sunday that “it is time to begin the full and formal transition process,” noting the courts had thus far found Trump’s legal claims without merit and that the pressure campaign on state legislators “is not only unprecedented but inconsistent with our democratic process.”Critics have said Trump’s refusal to facilitate an orderly transition carries serious implications for national security and the fight against Covid-19.Klain said Biden was being denied intelligence briefings to which he is entitled, FBI background checks on potential Cabinet nominees, and access to agency officials to help develop plans including avoiding delays in Covid-19 vaccine rollout.Jen Psaki, a senior adviser to Biden’s transition team, said on “State of the Union” that legal action to compel the GSA to recognize Biden “isn’t our preference.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-unveil-first-cabinet-picks-on-tuesday-envisions-scaled-down-inauguration/story-vv8niOhAA8l0KMcbp9AedN.html

The killings were believed to be linked to drug trafficking.Meantime, in the small town of Argelia in Cauca department, at least five people died and two were wounded in attacks by the same man in a pool hall, a bar and a discotheque.Other recent attacks have also targeted nightspots. Leftist rebels of the National Liberation Army (ELN); dissident members of FARC, the guerrilla group that became a political party with the 2016 peace accord; and narco-traffickers have clashed in the area over revenues from drug trafficking and illegal mining.Cauca lies along a trafficking route linking Central America to the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-13-die-in-two-massacres-in-colombia-officials/story-lwBWDLMCQ48kzwltnPF1xI.html

23-11-2020||World||Biggest Australian states reopen borders as coronavirus cases ease||Australia’s two most populous states reopened their borders on Monday after more than four months, as Victoria stamped out a second coronavirus wave, raising prospects of a quicker return to normal and speedy economic recovery. New South Wales and Victoria closed their borders in early July, the first time in more than a century, to contain a Covid-19 outbreak in Melbourne, Victoria’s capital city. The borders were last shut in 1919 during the Spanish flu pandemic.Also Read | One man’s ‘lie’ led to harsh lockdown in South AustraliaLifting of the border ban at midnight triggered joyful scenes and celebrations across the border towns with most drivers crossing the border honking their car horns to cheers from border residents, television footages showed. Reopening of the borders should see a surge in air traffic between Melbourne and Sydney, one of the busiest routes in the world before the pandemic, with Sydney airport expecting nearly 4,000 passengers across 26 flights from Victoria on Monday.Besides providing relief to businesses that straddle both sides of the border, lifting of the border ban will also put more people back on jobs in several hard-hit sectors during the pandemic, including airlines. “Today, some people who haven’t worked since March are going to be on aircraft for the first time,” Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce told local broadcaster Seven News.Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state, appeared to have effectively eliminated the virus as it reported no new Covid-19 infections for the 24th straight day on Monday.On Sunday, Victoria, which was the country’s coronavirus epicenter just over a month ago, eased its outdoor mask rules and allowed larger public gatherings, helped by a steady decline in cases.Victoria accounts for about 73% of Australia’s total Covid-19 cases of just over 27,800 and 90% of its 907 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biggest-australian-states-reopen-borders-as-coronavirus-cases-ease/story-9fDQgJ59ahiUNtQm46bkPP.html
23-11-2020||World||Women in finance have to ask for promotions, men don’t: Survey||Far fewer women than men are promoted in the finance industry unless they first ask for seniority, a sign of institutional gender bias, according to a new study in Australia.The survey of 2,000 finance industry professionals showed 76% of men were offered a promotion at least once without requesting it, compared with 57% of women. The study was compiled by lead researchers Ardea Investment Management and Australian National University in conjunction with industry experts.The findings provide “evidence of that culture that things come to men without asking,” said Bronwen Whiting, who worked on the survey and is a senior lecturer in applied statistics at the university. “It can’t all be on women to act differently to fix it.”Australia is among the countries that can claim some success in tackling gender inequality. For example, a report by consultancy Kearney this year showed Australia tops the U.K., U.S. and India for the proportion of female parliamentarians and women board members in its top 100 firms. Yet the latest survey’s results show ongoing gaps, including the fact that male fund managers on average earn more than twice as much as female counterparts.Male quantitative research analysts are paid 43% more than women, and men in compliance roles received an additional 76%, based on 2019 data. Official Australian figures put the overall gender pay gap at 14%. In the U.K., the gap in financial services is well over 20%, according an analysis of government data.The Ardea-Australian National University study found that women asked for pay increases and promotions at the same rate as men, and when they do so, there was no difference between the genders in terms of receiving them. Yet the gap appeared when companies took the initiative with promotions.“One of the arguments put forward as to why women are paid less is that we are too agreeable,” Laura Ryan, head of research at Sydney-based Ardea, said in an interview. “Looks like we are being assertive, but if we are not we definitely miss out. Gender is a strongly significant factor in determining salary.”Glass ceilings and salary disparities due to gender remain persistent problems globally in the finance industry. One of the implications for women is that they end up falling behind in saving for their retirement compared to men, Ryan said.Australian National University’s Whiting said she hoped executives will acknowledge that progress has been slow and “it’s not something that we can talk about once a year on International Women’s Day and then forget about it.”Ryan said many colleagues in the finance industry believe there is no gender gap, adding that “while there is all this unconscious bias training and everyone seems to think that the problem is fixed, the results show that it’s definitely not fixed and we still have quite a way to go.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/women-in-finance-have-to-ask-for-promotions-men-don-t-survey/story-JbOcQkCQiRAdzBpu4N2AYL.html
23-11-2020||World||Ethiopia warns civilians of ‘no mercy’ in Tigray offensive||Ethiopia’s military is warning civilians in the besieged Tigray regional capital that there will be “no mercy” if they don’t “save themselves” before a final offensive to flush out defiant regional leaders — a threat that Human Rights Watch on Sunday said could violate international law.“From now on, the fighting will be a tank battle,” spokesman Col. Dejene Tsegaye said late Saturday, asserting that the army was marching on the Tigray capital, Mekele, and would encircle it with tanks. “Our people in Mekele should be notified that they should protect themselves from heavy artillery.”He accused the Tigray leaders of hiding among the population of the city of roughly a half-million people and warned civilians to “steer away” from them.But “treating a whole city as a military target would not only unlawful, it could also be considered a form of collective punishment,” Human Rights Watch researcher Laetitia Bader tweeted Sunday.“In other words, war crimes,” former US national security adviser Susan Rice tweeted.Ethiopia’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, in a new statement is giving the leaders of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front 72 hours to surrender, saying that “you are at a point of no return.” He accused the TPLF leaders of using religious sites, hotels, schools “and even cemeteries” as hideouts and using Mekele residents as human shields.For days, Abiy’s government has asserted it was marching to Mekele in a final push to end the deadly conflict that erupted on Nov. 4 between the federal government and the heavily armed Tigray regional government. The TPLF dominated Ethiopia’s ruling coalition for a quarter century before Abiy took office and introduced dramatic political reforms and sidelined TPLF leaders.Now, each side regards each other as illegal, complicating international pleas for dialogue amid worries that one of Africa’s most powerful and populous nations could fracture and destabilize the strategic Horn of Africa.With communications and transport to the Tigray region almost completely severed, it’s difficult to verify the warring sides’ claims.And Ethiopia’s government has expelled an analyst with the International Crisis Group, William Davison. The government hasn’t given a formal reason, the organization said, but “ultimately, there is little doubt that the reason for his deportation relates to the current tense situation in the country and the authorities’ increasing sensitivity to points of view that do not hew to its line.”It added: “It is noteworthy that on the same day Mr. Davison was expelled, authorities also issued warning letters to the news agency Reuters’ Ethiopia correspondent and to the BBC and Deutsche Welle stations.”Meanwhile, a vast humanitarian crisis is unfolding, with the United Nations saying about 2 million people in Tigray urgently need help as food, fuel, medical and other supplies run desperately short.Two refugee crises are growing. Over 35,000 Ethiopians have fled into a remote area of Sudan, where local communities and humanitarians have struggled to feed and accommodate them. And inside the Tigray region, the fighting has come close to camps that are home to nearly 100,000 refugees from Eritrea. Some of the Eritreans have now fled a second time, into Sudan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopia-warns-civilians-of-no-mercy-in-tigray-offensive/story-7CloCyWbgq6BhxClSUyngN.html

23-11-2020||World||US Navy admiral makes unannounced visit to Taiwan, sources say||A two-star Navy admiral overseeing US military intelligence in the Asia-Pacific region has made an unannounced visit to Taiwan, two sources told Reuters on Sunday, in a high-level trip that could vex China.The sources, who include a Taiwanese official familiar with the situation, said the official was Rear Admiral Michael Studeman. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.According to the Navy’s website, Studeman is director of the J2, which oversees intelligence, at the US military’s Indo-Pacific Command.The Pentagon declined comment. Taiwan’s foreign ministry confirmed on Sunday that a US official had arrived in Taiwan but declined to provide details, saying the trip had not been made public.China, which claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, reacted with fury when US Health Secretary Alex Azar came to Taipei in August, followed by US Undersecretary of State Keith Krach in September, sending fighter jets near the island each time.The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan, including with new arms sales, alarming China.It was not immediately clear whether Studeman’s visit would be seen as an escalation by Beijing. Still, he could be one of the most high-ranking US military officers known to have visited Taipei in recent years.Douglas Paal, a former head of the US representative office in Taiwan who is now with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: “If it is Indopacom J2 Studeman, I know of no precedent for such a visit.”But Randall Schriver, a former assistant secretary of defense for Asia during the Trump administration, said Trump’s Pentagon had been quietly sending one-star flag officers to Taiwan on a routine basis.He noted that the United States and Taiwan had close intelligence exchanges on the threat from China’s military.Bonnie Glaser, a regional security expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said it would not be unprecedented for a US flag officer to visit Taipei.Unmarked aircraftTaiwan’s United Daily News published pictures of an unmarked private jet, which it identified as being a US military aircraft, arriving at Taipei’s downtown Songshan airport, and what appeared to be officials waiting at its VIP terminal.Data on the flight-tracking website planefinder.net showed a private flight arriving from Hawaii - home to the headquarters of the Indo-Pacific Command - into Songshan airport late Sunday afternoon, shortly before the United Daily News published the pictures on its website.In a brief statement, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said there were frequent interactions with the United States and that “we welcome the visit of the US official.”“But as this itinerary has not been made public, based on mutual trust between Taiwan and the United States, the Foreign Ministry has no further explanation or comment,” it added.However, it said in a separate statement that Taiwan media reports that a delegation led by CIA chief Gina Haspel had arrived in Taiwan were untrue, and that Haspel had no plans to come.The de facto US embassy in Taipei declined to comment.The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is the democratic island’s most important international backer and supplier of arms.Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said last week the cabinet-level head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, will visit Taiwan. US media said that trip is likely next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-admiral-makes-unannounced-visit-to-taiwan-sources-say/story-7aopw2ppW0YvhfXLbXquWN.html

23-11-2020||World||G-20 summit ends with support for Covid-19 vaccines for all||Leaders of the world’s most powerful nations wrapped up the Group of 20 summit on Sunday, vowing to spare no effort to protect lives and ensure affordable access to Covid-19 vaccines for all people.The two-day summit of heads of state was held virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed at least 1.38 million people globally, with the world’s highest death tolls recorded in seven of the G-20 countries. The virus has wiped out hundreds of millions of jobs globally and plunged millions into extreme poverty.The virus “revealed vulnerabilities in our preparedness and response and underscored our common challenges,” the G-20 said in a final statement that focused heavily on battling the coronavirus, enhancing environmental protections and supporting the global economy.The group vowed “to spare no effort to protect lives.”The G-20, which includes the US, India, China, the U.K., France, Germany, Japan and others, also stressed the importance of global access to Covid-19 vaccines, drugs and tests.“We will spare no effort to ensure their affordable and equitable access for all people, consistent with members’ commitments to incentivize innovation,” the statement said.The G-20 expressed support for efforts like COVAX, an international initiative to distribute Covid-19 vaccines to countries worldwide. The US, however, has declined to join under President Donald Trump.German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters Sunday in Berlin after the virtual summit that Germany had given financial support to the COVAX initiative, but that more money was needed.The G-20 statement did not directly address an urgent appeal by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who said $28 billion in additional investment is needed for mass manufacturing, procurement and delivery of new Covid-19 vaccines around the world, including $4 billion immediately.There is also concern that countries such as Britain, the US, France and Germany have directly negotiated deals with pharmaceutical companies, meaning that the vast majority of the world’s vaccine supply next year is already reserved.“Fortunately, there’s now hope for vaccines,” Merkel said, adding that “it is important that not only Europe secures vaccines, as the European Union is doing now, but ... that it is important for the entire world” to have access to vaccines.She said it is important that COVAX starts negotiating with the producers of potential vaccines based on the money it already has, but that she was somewhat worried those negotiations had not happened yet.Saudi Arabia’s King Salman rounded out the summit, saying the G-20′s final statement “succeeded in sending out a message of hope and reassurance to our citizens and all people around the world.”“This is what the world has been expecting from us. This achievement today is a culmination of our joint efforts throughout this challenge-fraught year,” the Saudi monarch said.Saudi Arabia presided over the G-20 this year and was host of the virtual summit, which was originally intended to be held in-person in Riyadh before the pandemic. During the Saudi king’s speech, small video squares showed the leaders of Germany, France, the U.K., Canada, South Korea, China, India and South Africa watching the final remarks. Trump participated in the summit with prerecorded speeches, but was not in attendance for the virtual summit’s conclusion.It appeared all G-20 countries agreed to the full content of the final statement, with the exception of Turkey, which was due to give a press conference later Sunday explaining further.Delegates from the G-20 had convened virtually throughout the year to discuss the coronavirus, agreeing to suspend debt payments for the world’s poorest nations until mid-2021 to allow those countries to focus their spending on health care and social support programs. The G-20 called on private lenders to join the effort.Already, 46 countries have requested to benefit from the debt suspension initiative, amounting to $5.7 billion in debt referral. The U.N. secretary general, however, has called on the G-20 to extend debt repayments through the end of 2021 and expand the scope to middle-income countries in need.G-20 countries are allowing low-income countries with unsustainable debts to apply for permanent debt relief on a case-by-case basis.In final remarks at the summit, Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte laid out his country’s objectives for the G-20 next year as it assumes the rotating presidency from Saudi Arabia.“The existential threat, represented by climate change, soil degradation and by the decline of global biodiversity, has brought us to a crossroads, which will determine if we are able to save our planet and construct a sustainable future,” Conte said.Conte said the pandemic will continue to be at the top of the group’s agenda and reiterated his support for universal access to vaccines.___Associated Press writers Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin and Frances D’Emilio in Rome contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g-20-summit-ends-with-support-for-covid-19-vaccines-for-all/story-b2uLNWl89rY90eG52PKs3I.html

The State Department has declared that the United States is no longer a party to the Treaty on Open Skies, a decades-old treaty that permits member countries to conduct short-notice, unarmed, reconnaissance flights over other countries to collect data on military forces and activities.The treaty was first pitched way back in 1955 by the then US president Dwight Eisenhower, proposing that the United States and the erstwhile Soviet Union would allow reconnaissance flights over each other’s territory. Moscow rejected the proposal, saying the initiative would be used for extensive spying. George H.W. Bush revived the idea in 1989 and negotiations between the NATO and the Warsaw Pact started in February 1990.The treaty was finally signed in 1992 but came into force on January 1, 2002. Currently, 34 states are party to the treaty while Kyrgyzstan has signed but not ratified it. On May 21, 2020, the State Department said that the Trump administration may reconsider the withdrawal if Russia returns to “full compliance with the Treaty.”Also Read | Vladimir Putin says he’s not ready to recognize Joe Biden as US PresidentSecretary of State Mike Pompeo had accused Russia of “flagrantly and continuously” violating the Treaty in various ways for years.

Pompeo had claimed that instead of using the treaty as a mechanism for improving trust and confidence through military transparency, Russia weaponised the treaty by making it into “a tool of intimidation and threat.” He accused Kremlin of targeting critical infrastructure in the United States and Europe with “precision-guided conventional munitions” by using using the Open Skies imagery.“After careful consideration, including input from Allies and key partners, it has become abundantly clear that it is no longer in America’s interest to remain a party to the Treaty on Open Skies,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-formally-withdraws-from-open-skies-treaty-all-you-need-to-know-about-decades-old-treaty/story-0Lz5VM8PMGz4D0Cotmm9PO.html

Minakshi Khati, the 22-year-old from Nainital district has fondly come to be known as the Aipan girl of Kumaon, for continuously working to revive the old art form of Uttarakhand. Aipan is a folk design art form, drawn by women in red and white colour outside their homes on auspicious occasions like weddings, house-warming, festivals. Every occasion of event, has a different form of design in Aipan. Speaking on how she started her journey towards building Minakrti: The Aipan Project, an initiative to promote the art form by empowering local women and artists, Khati said, “Since childhood, I have been practicing Aipan with my mother and grandmother. As I grew, I noticed that people have stopped practicing the art form due to work or other responsibilities but they wish that they could. This gave me the idea of starting something which will help people feel close to home and I started making home décor or other small items practicing the Aipan art.” Starting from keychains, nameplates, wall paintings, tea cups, Khati has been continuously experimenting with the art form and started selling it. In December 2019, Khati started Minakrti: The Aipan Project, and in a year’s time she has delivered over 1000 orders, mostly to people who live in other states or countries. She further added that most of her orders are from people living in Delhi or other metropolitan cities, who have migrated from their villages. Marketing her items through social media, she now takes orders in bulk and collaborates with women from villages in Nainital, giving them an employment opportunity. “In the hilly regions, almost every house has a female member who knows how to make an Aipan. We collaborate with these women to deliver bulk orders on time to our clients. At present, we have a team of 15 members, including students who have come forward and shown interest. I am able to earn around Rs 30,000- Rs 35,000 a month through which the students and the women who help us are paid, but we are growing gradually,” added Khati. She has also started a competition named “Selfie with Aipan” to promote the art form among youth, “which has received good response”. Khati has also showcased her artwork at national level tourism fairs, participating in the Uttarakhand Tourism Festival in New Delhi last year. Beena Bhatt, director for department of culture in Uttarakhand said, “Aipan is a very old traditional art form of Kumaon region in Uttarakhand. We have seen Khati’s work and how she has been continuously working to promote this folk art. The department also holds regular workshops for women to train them in the art form and inform them on how to take up self-employment through it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-girl-revives-traditional-himalayan-artform-aipan-creates-jobs/story-BmM335o4y6gQHApImHCTwI.html
23-11-2020||India||PM Modi says 2014-29 period ‘very important’ for India||Asserting that the 2014-29 period between the 16th to 18th Lok Sabha is “very important” for a young democracy like India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the last six years have been “historic” for the country’s development and a lot remains to be done in the remaining period. As the age of 16, 17 and 18 years is very important for the youth, so is the time between the 16th and the 18th Lok Sabha for a young nation like India, he said while digitally inaugurating 76 multi-storeyed flats in the national capital for Members of Parliament. The 16th Lok Sabha (2014-19) has been historic for the country’s progress, and the 17th Lok Sabha has already become a part of history due to a number of decisions it has taken, he said, referring to the passage of landmark legislations aimed at reforming farm and labour sectors besides abrogation of Article 370 and the citizenship law. “I am confident the next Lok Sabha (2024-29) will also play a very important role in taking the country ahead in this new decade... There is so much for the country that we have to achieve. Be it ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ campaign, or economic targets or many other pledges like these, we have to achieve them during this period,” he said to an audience of parliamentarians, including ministers and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. People of Jammu and Kashmir have also joined the mainstream of development, with many new laws coming into effect in the union territory for the first time, he said in a reference to the abrogation of Article 370, which had granted the erstwhile state a special status. “It is our responsibility that when history evaluates different terms of Lok Sabha, this period is remembered as a golden chapter in the nation’s development,” Modi stated. The second term of the Modi government is scheduled to end in 2024 when the next general election will be held. The ruling BJP has already set its sight on the next Lok Sabha polls with its president J P Nadda set to undertake a 120-day nationwide tour to tone up the saffron party’s organisational machinery with a focus on regions and seats where it had not done well in 2019. In his speech, Modi referred to the GST rollout, enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and a law proposing death sentence for those convicted of raping children as among the major achievements of his government’s first term between 2014-19. India now has resources and a strong resolve to fulfil the dreams of its 130 crore citizens and attain the goal of self-reliance, he said. Asserting that the country’s “new mindset and mood” is reflected in the composition of the 16th Lok Sabha, which had over 300 first-time MPs, and the current lower house, which has 260 MPs elected for the first time, the prime minister noted it has over 400 parliamentarians who are in their first or second terms. The current Lok Sabha also has a record number of woman MPs, he said. This is a reason why Parliament has been taking decisions quickly while also having more debate, he added, observing that the 16th Lok Sabha passed 15 per cent more bills and while the productivity of the first session of the 17th Lok Sabha was 135 per cent. Rajya Sabha’s productivity was also 100 per cent, he added. Parliament’s performance is at its best in two decades, Modi said. MPs have focussed on “product and process” as well be passing more bills and also debating more, he added, noting that they engaged in two-three hours of debates in passing more than 60 per cent of bills in the last Lok Sabha. On this occasion, he also greeted Birla on his 58th birthday and lauded him for his focus on quality while also saving time in running the House. This was also reflected in the building of these 76 flats for the MPs, the prime minister said, noting that the three residential towers have adhered to green technology. The government said the construction of the flats has cost 14 per cent less than the projected expenditure and it was completed well in time despite the adverse circumstances due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These towers, which have come in place of eight 80-year-old bungalows, have been named after rivers Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. Modi said the new flats for parliamentarians, who often had to wait long for getting a house in the national capital, is among the series of projects completed under his government after being kept pending for years and decades. He referred to the completion of the Ambedkar International Centre, Central Information Commission building and War Memorial in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-2014-29-period-very-important-for-india/story-nRREokqEHUDktyIgymg45L.html

The protests saw thousands of people gather at two villages in South Goa -- São José de Areal and Davorlim-- both of which lie along the existing track where work of doubling is currently going on. However, sensing the crowd, railway officials failed to turn up instead it was left to the local people’s representatives including local MLA and minister in the government Filipe Neri Rodrigues to reassure the villagers that he will convey the wishes of the protesters to the Chief Minister in the next cabinet meeting. “I have already informed the chief minister that the protests are only growing and will grow even further if the government does not act on this. The government is sensitive which is why the Chief Minister has met the Union Minister for Ports who has assured to come to Goa and listen to the people,” Rodrigues told the protesters. At a separate location in Davorlim, another MLA, but of the opposition Congress was also mobbed by protesters Protesters questioned the government asking that if the demand is for the projects to be scrapped, what purpose will the demarcation serve.The protest was finally called off after the minister assured that the cases filed against a few protesters will be withdrawn, that he will convey the people’s opposition to the projects to the government and the land acquisition process for the railway line will be scrapped.Protests against a trio of projects, a railway track doubling, a highway expansion and a new power transmission line, all between Goa and Karnataka cutting across the Western Ghats -- especially the railway expansion which is the biggest of the three -- have been intensifying as the railways seek to fast track the project. The projects are being opposed on account of the impact on the eco sensitive and biodiverse wildlife sanctuaries that they will pass through, as well as because of the belief that they will be used to transport imported coal from Goa’s Mormugao Port to steel units in north Karnataka. Residents living in the port town of Vasco da Gama as well as along the railway line have for long been complaining that the transport is handled carelessly leading to high pollution levels and engulfing their lives with clouds of coal dust. The protests intensified after the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife in a meeting held via video conference, during the lockdown in April this year, cleared the projects. The Goa government has responded by saying that the projects are in ‘national interest’ while simultaneously denying that they were being carried out with the intent to increase the coal ferrying capacity. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant, while backing the projects, has said he has sought assurances from the Central Government that the quantity of coal imported via the port would be halved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-minister-mobbed-as-protests-against-trio-of-infra-projects-continue/story-R4ghLFpbSfZgftSyV7yJ4J.html
23-11-2020||India||Day after arrest by CBI, former Karnataka Congress minister Roshan Baig’s residence raided||A day after former Karnataka minister and seven-time MLA Roshan Baig was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the IMA Ponzi scheme case, his residence at Coles Park in Bengaluru was raided by the agency. A 12-member team of CBI officials conducted extensive searches at his residence and interrogated Baig’s wife and son.IMA refers to I Monetary Advisors (IMA), a group of companies allegedly run on Islamic Banking lines which illegally collected thousands of crores in deposits before being exposed as a ponzi scheme in March 2019 after it failed to repay its depositors.Meanwhile, a report submitted by Harsh Gupta a senior IAS officer appointed to oversee the claims of more than 51,500 depositors who have lost more than Rs 2500 crore in the IMA Ponzi scheme has recommended action against Baig. Incidentally, the preliminary report is dated November 19, just two days before Baig was arrested. Gupta was appointed by the government as special officer and competent authority to oversee all IMA related claims.The report submitted by the special officer to principal secretary, Revenue Department, Government of Karnataka, says that Baig acted as one of the promoters of the IMA group and ‘benefitted from its business activities’. Numerous business dealings between Baig and the Mohammed Mansoor Khan the chief promoter of IMA have also been uncovered. This includes one of IMA subsidiaries, Mulberry Green Super Market operating out of a building which was leased by Baig.The former Congress leader’s company Danish Publications is also said to have entered into several business transactions with the IMA Group from which it profited. According to the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act, the government may attach properties of promoters who have collected money from the public. The state government official who did not want to be identified said that it was working with central agencies to see whether Baig’s properties could be attached to recover money owed to depositors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-arrest-by-cbi-former-karnataka-congress-minister-roshan-baig-s-residence-raided/story-h08CFIg82VLGKUsyUODprM.html

He said by striking the discordant note, the farmers’ union is acting against the interests of Punjab and its people.The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee has refused to budge from its stand on clearing rail tracks for passenger trains till the farm laws issue is resolved.However, 30 other farmers’ bodies have already announced to lift the blockade.When all other farmers’ organisations had decided unanimously to withdraw from the tracks to allow both goods and passenger trains to move in the state for the next 15 days, this one union’s decision is not understandable, said Amarinder Singh in a statement here. This would alienate the committee from people, he said cautioning it against taking such a harsh stand, which could lead them losing the support of the masses. “When the state government and every person in Punjab have been extending their full support to the farmers, why is this union taking a stance against their own state,” he asked. Read more | Chandigarh wakes up to misty morningHe said the committee should not do anything to derail the process of negotiation and discussion. It is in the interest of all, including farmers themselves, to find a solution to the problems unleashed by the central laws, on which every section of Punjab’s populace as well as his government are standing shoulder to shoulder with the farming community, said the CM.The message that is emanating from the “adamant” stand of the committee is that the union is not really interested in breaking the stalemate on the farm laws issue, Amarinder Singh said.In any case, said the CM, blocking a one-odd track will serve no purpose even for the committee, which incidentally has chosen to stay away from the meeting convened by him on Saturday to urge the farm unions to lift their blockade.Farmers under the banner of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee have been protesting against the farm laws since September 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-expresses-concern-as-farmer-outfit-refuses-to-allow-passenger-trains/story-39nWQYqjKL5HA54AExiu2N.html

Since diplomatic engagements were disrupted by the pandemic, Jaishankar has travelled only to Russia for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and to Japan for a meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad. Jaishankar’s visit to Bahrain during November 24-25 will be his first visit to the country after assuming office. He will convey condolences on behalf of the Indian government to Bahrain’s leadership on the death of prime minister Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa on November 11. He will hold talks on bilateral issues and regional and international issues of mutual interest, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. Bahrain hosts more than 350,000 Indians and both sides have worked together to counter the pandemic. Flights between the two countries are operating under an air bubble arrangement. Jaishankar will be in the UAE during November 25-26, when he is scheduled to meet foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan. They will take forward bilateral cooperation under the comprehensive strategic partnership and exchange views on regional and international issues. He will discuss ways for Indian workers to resume their jobs in the UAE in the post-Covid scenario. More than three million Indians live and work in UAE.

23-11-2020||India||BJP will form govt in Maharashtra in next 3 months: Union minister||The BJP will form a government in Maharashtra in the next two to thee months for which it has made preparations, senior party leader and Union minister Raosaheb Danve said on Monday.Danve made this statement while addressing a meeting of BJP workers in Parbhani as part of the party’s campaign for the next month’s Legislative Council election to Aurangabad Graduate constituency.Shirish Boralkar is the BJP’s candidate for the forthcoming MLC poll.“BJP workers should not think that our government will not come into existence in Maharashtra. We will form a government in the next two-three months. We have worked out the mathematics. We are waiting for the ongoing elections to (the Legislative Council) to get over,” the Jalna MP said.Danve’s statement came on the first anniversary of the short-lived government formed by Devendra Fadnavis with the support of NCP leader Ajit Pawar.Fadnavis and Pawar were administered oath as chief minister and deputy chief minister, respectively, at Raj Bhavan in Mumbai on this day last year.However, that government lasted for only 80 hours with Pawar tendering his resignation as deputy CM, paving the way for the Shiv Sena-led MVA administration to assume office a few days later with the support of the NCP and the Congress.Interestingly, Danve’s statement came hours after Fadnavis told reporters in Aurangabad that if the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government falls, the oath ceremony of the dispensation that would replace it would not take place at dawn as was the case a year ago.“If the present government in the state collapses, the oath ceremony will not take place at dawn. But such incidents need not be remembered,” the former CM said.Fadnavis had earlier said on many occasions that the MVA government would fall on its own due to “internal differences” among its three constituents.The BJP had won the maximum 105 seats in the Maharashtra Assembly polls held last year, followed by Shiv Sena which bagged 56 seats. The NCP had won 54 seats and the Congress 44.Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray took oath as the chief minister of the MVA government on November 28. Ajit Pawar is Thackeray’s deputy in the present MVA government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-will-form-govt-in-maharashtra-in-next-3-months-union-minister/story-jJgHXFCUMNJCQqUTVpCYHI.html
23-11-2020||India||Karnataka govt to provide Rs 500 crore to Veerashaiva Lingayat Development Corporation||The BS Yediyurappa-led BJP government in Karnataka has decided to provide a hefty Rs 500 crore to the newly formed Karnataka Veerashaiva Lingayat Development Corporation (KVLDC). The move by Yediyurappa is seen as a bid to reach out to the dominant Lingayat community who constitute about 16-17% of the state population. The CM also belongs to the community and the move comes in the backdrop of persistent speculation that there might be a leadership change in the state, which the party has denied.KVLDC will be incorporated under the Companies Act 2013 and the commissioner of backward classes will look after it till its Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association are drawn up and registered.Yediyurappa had decided to setup KVLDC after similar corporations were setup for Kodu Golla (Yadav) caste and the Maratha community. The decision to setup KVLDC came after a number of leaders led by Deputy CM Lakshman Savadi and other BJP leaders demanded it. Some of the opposition leaders while welcoming the move to set up the corporations have demanded similar ones for other communities too.While former home minister and senior Congress leader M B Patil welcomed the setting up of KVLDC he criticized the ‘measly’ amount allocated for it and demanded that it should either be doubled or quadrupled. Former CM and JDS chief H D Kumaraswamy has demanded a similar corporation for Vokkaligas the second most dominant caste who account for 13% of the state population.The Golla and Maratha corporation moves came ahead of by-polls in key constituencies in which members of those communities play a key role in determining their outcome. Some Pro-Kannada organizations have called for a statewide bandh on December 5 to protest against the setting up of the Maratha board. Karnataka and Maharashtra have had a running feud on ownership of some of the border districts including Belgavi, Nippani and Karwar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-to-provide-rs-500-crore-to-veerashaiva-lingayat-development-corporation/story-3b6QihH8W2JyHUVv4JvcAP.html
23-11-2020||India||Foreign secretary Shringla’s Nepal visit for boosting developmental ties, review of issues||Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla’s visit to Nepal this week will be more about boosting the developmental partnership and connectivity and less about the border row that hit bilateral ties in recent months, people familiar with developments said on Monday. The external affairs ministry said Shringla will travel to Nepal during November 26-27, his first visit to the country since assuming office in January. He will meet his Nepalese counterpart Bharat Raj Paudyal and other top officials to discuss wide-ranging bilateral cooperation. India-Nepal relations were hit when Kathmandu issued a new political map in May that showed Uttarakhand’s Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, all controlled by New Delhi, as part of Nepalese territory. The map was issued after India opened a key border road to Lipulekh. In recent weeks, both countries have worked behind the scenes to improve bilateral ties against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff. Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Samant Kumar Goel and Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane recently visited Nepal and met Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli for talks aimed at taking forward the relationship. “The foreign secretary’s visit won’t be about boundary talks. The Nepalese side, including Prime Minister Oli, has been reaching out and we want to enhance the level of engagement. The visit is also aimed at the review of all issues from a holistic perspective,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. “India’s position on Nepal’s new map is very clear and unchanged. The new map includes Indian territory but then 98% of the boundary has also been demarcated,” the person added. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Nepal in 2014 – the first by an Indian premier in 17 years – the two sides have launched two cross-border power transmission lines and the Motihari-Amlekhgunj petroleum products pipeline, which is also the first such cross-border pipeline in South Asia. India has also completed some 100 high impact community development projects in the past six years and built 46,000 houses for people affected by the 2015 earthquake in Nepal. Also Read: In Nepal, how domestic politics is colliding with geopolitics“The focus now is connectivity, including power lines, railway links and inland waterways, and ensuring better and faster movement on such projects. We are trying to expand the petroleum pipeline and ensure greater integration of the two economies. There will also be a security and strategic element to the foreign secretary’s visit,” the first person said. “India’s Covid-related cooperation with Nepal also has been robust and will now extend to vaccines. There can be discord on some issues but that didn’t stop development projects or Covid-related cooperation,” a second person said. Besides his meetings with Nepalese officials, Shringla’s visit may include a public address and a visit to an India-backed project. The visit is in keeping with the priority India attaches to its ties with Nepal, and will also be an opportunity to further advance the relationship, the external affairs ministry said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-secretary-shringla-s-nepal-visit-for-boosting-developmental-ties-review-of-issues/story-9nvMu4G9jUsyZ4zClNAKRK.html
23-11-2020||India||HAL kicks off crucial testing of jet trainer that may have missed IAF bus||State-owned plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Monday announced that it has kicked off a crucial developmental test of a jet trainer that was planned as a replacement for the Indian Air Force’s ageing Kiran aircraft fleet. The spin flight testing of the much-delayed Sitara intermediate jet trainer (IJT) --- or the HJT-36 single-engine aircraft --- is being seen as a developmental milestone even though there is no indication from the IAF about a possible order. The IJT project is running late by several years.“The spin testing of an aircraft is the most crucial phase of its flight testing. The testing will be gradually progressed to assess the behaviour of the aircraft till six turn spins to either side to meet the targeted requirement,” the HAL said in a statement. HAL test pilots Group Captain HV Thakur (retd) and Wing Commander P Avasti (retd) conducted the tests on Monday. Spin is a manoeuvre an aircraft gets into on its own when its controls are mishandled. Spin testing seeks to prove that the IJT can do a spin and recover safely from it, experts said. During the first flight test, the aircraft was taken through one turn spin to the left and right to test the spin characteristics, HAL said. Rookie pilots in IAF go through a three-stage training involving the Pilatus PC-7 MkII planes, Kiran trainers and finally the Hawk advanced jet trainers before they can fly fighter jets. As the Kirans are approaching the end of their service life, some amount of stage-2 training is already being done on the PC-7.Experts doubted if the IAF would order the IJT as it was a case of “too little, too late.”The delay in the IJT programme, conceived more than two decades ago, has upset the IAF’s calculations, officials said. The project was sanctioned in July 1999 with a grant of Rs 180 crore. The IJT, first powered by a French engine and now a Russian one, was expected to get initial operational clearance by 2006 with deliveries to the IAF planned a year later. HAL said the IJT has been redesigned for the spin test “by moving the vertical tail aft and extending the rudder surface.” “These changes (made) for ensuring satisfactory spin behaviour required extensive redesign of the rear fuselage and the rudder. The changes have been incorporated in two aircraft with the involvement and clearance from certification agencies at every stage,” the statement said. After being modified, the two aircraft underwent significant flight tests to assess the general handling with the new configuration of fin and rudder, and the jets have been incorporated with the necessary safety devices (anti-spin parachute systems), it said. Meanwhile, the IAF plans to buy the basic trainer aircraft from HAL to train rookie pilots. The defence ministry, in August, gave its go-ahead to the purchase of 106 Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 (HTT-40) aircraft from HAL to provide a push to the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ (self-reliant India movement).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hal-kicks-off-crucial-testing-of-jet-trainer-that-may-have-missed-iaf-bus/story-3OQe4Ac1KrghsBm0FsBc2K.html
23-11-2020||India||AIMIM members join TMC in Bengal; defection staged, alleges Owaisi’s party||Twenty one West Bengal members of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), a party headed by Asaduddin Owaisi joined the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the presence of two senior ministers on Monday, days after ruling party leaders said the Hyderabad-based party was not a force to reckon with in the assembly polls due in about five months. Among those who joined the TMC were several lawyers and teachers. After the recent elections in Bihar - where the AIMIM won five seats and was accused by the Congress of splitting Muslim votes to help the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – Owaisi announced that his party would contest the Bengal polls. “Anwar Pasha, the main functionary of the AIMIM in Bengal, and several other members from different districts are joining us because they do not accept the AIMIM’s line of action,” Minister Bratya Basu said at the TMC’s state headquarters. “Some people, irrespective of whether they carry the green flag or the saffron flag, are out to destroy peace. After Bihar, these forces want to enter West Bengal. But the politics they preach is not part of Bengal’s culture. Bengal is our strongest fort. No other chief minister hit the streets in protest against the citizenship amendment law and the National Register of Citizens the way Banerjee did,” said Pasha. “Banerjee is accused of practicing the politics of appeasement. It is not true. If she has given allowance to Imams she has given the same to Hindu priests as well. The development in Bihar is disturbing. AIMIM helped the BJP. My advice to Owaisi is that he should not enter Bengal. If he tries to do so we will stop him with all our strength,” Pasha said. Syed Asim Waqar, the national spokesperson of the AIMIM and the leader in charge of the organization in West Bengal, said, “We have millions of members in West Bengal and Pasha is just one of them. He stayed aloof for almost a year and did not take part in any activity. He is a traitor. He tried to contact the TMC earlier also.” Reiterating that the AIMIM will contest the coming polls, Waqar said, “While addressing a rally in central Kolkata in July, 2019, I said Mamata Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee were planting their men in our party so that a defection could be staged prior to the polls to portray that AIMIM has weakened. The rest of those who joined the TMC today were TMC workers posing as AIMIM members.” “Waqar is just the national spokesperson of the party. In Bengal, Muslims in every corner knows who Anwar Pasha is and who worked for years to form the AIMIM’s base. Those who joined the TMC today established the AIMIM in Bengal,” Pasha said in reply to Waqar’s comment. Bengal’s Muslim population stood at 27.01% during the 2011 census and is projected to have increased to around 30% now. According to the last census report, the Muslim population was predominantly high in the districts of Murshidabad (66.28%), Malda (51.27%) and North Dinajpur (49.92%). In South 24 Parganas, located adjacent to Kolkata, it was 35.57%, while in Birbhum, the figure was 37.06%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aimim-members-join-tmc-in-bengal-defection-staged-alleges-owaisi-s-party/story-LnxZFpB0wgIIOjZOr24GbP.html

Checkbrand, an online sentiment analysis company, analysed online sentiment for top 95 political leaders as well as top 500 influencers on social media between August and October this year. It analysed more than 100 million online impressions for the maiden edition of the report. “Prime Minister Modi has ruled the maximum Trends (Twitter, Google Search, Wiki, YouTube etc) in the last quarter with 2,171 trends, followed by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy with 2,137 trends,” the report said. Other leaders who led significant trends include West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Congress President Sonia Gandhi, it added. For the report, 86,400 ‘Trends’ -- which refers to the top 20 topics driving highest engagement in a day on various digital platforms -- were analysed. As per the report, Modi had a consolidated brand score of 70, which is almost double that of the nearest political leader. Brand score is based on five parameters -- followers (20), trends (10), sentiment (30), engagement (20) and mentions (20). Home Minister Amit Shah’s score was 36.43 followed by the late former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi at 31.89, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Prema Khandu at 31.89 and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath at 27.03. Gogoi passed away on Monday. “The brand value in monetary terms basis the engagement and followers for Prime Minister Modi stood at Rs 3.36 billion (Rs 336 crore), for Amit Shah at Rs 3.35 billion (Rs 335 crore), followed by Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal at Rs 3.28 billion (Rs 328 crore),” it added. Brand value was calculated on the basis of followers, engagement and trends of the person, and then deducting negative mentions and sentiments. ADG Online and Checkbrand.online Managing Director Anuj Sayal said the company has developed a tool that can help brands understand their worth and improve it further wherever required. “Despite (there) being almost 25 per cent negative sentiment for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his brand value is the highest amongst 95 chosen leaders,” he added. The report also said that Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had 40,000 mentions on social media in the last three months. “... the collective engagement of PM Modi, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Home Minister Amit Shah of 4.9 million was more than rest of the collective engagement of 92 political leaders of various parties, including other BJP leaders,” the report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-led-trends-across-social-media-bjp-topped-engagement-in-aug-oct-report/story-NUBaXZCWMQ9cXPrFWvmcqJ.html

Acknowledging the important contribution of such people who, besides RSS’ own volunteers, stepped forward to help people in distress, Bhagwat said the organization now needs to use their energy and capabilities to further help the nation and people. He was speaking at the valedictory session of the two-day meet of the RSS national executive— Akhil Bharatiya Karyakari Mandal (ABKM)—of the organisation’s east UP office bearers. Speaking at the event, RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi stressed on the need for RSS volunteers to work for strengthening the joint family concept. He also said every member of the family should be encouraged to respect mothers and women. “Families are breaking up and this in turn is bringing about deterioration in family values and in society. There is an urgent need to strengthen the traditional Indian family system,” he said. Deputy secretary Dattatreya Hosabale called for a survey of RSS volunteers who are active traders and businessmen. He urged that such members be made more active as they could help generate jobs for the unemployed and also contribute in making the nation self-reliant. General secretary Mukund CR spoke on the efforts and need for developing and energizing young volunteers of the organization through ‘Yuva Karyakarta Vikas Yojna” while deputy secretary Manmohan Vaidya said the society was keen to work with RSS and efforts should be made to identify and bring such energetic people who can contribute in taking the work and mission of RSS further, informed RSS pranth prachar pramukh Murarji Tripathi. He said the issues like saving rivers and forests from pollution and destruction were also discussed. Others who attended the meeting included national level office bearers like Balkrishna Tripathi, Anik Oak and Ajit Mahapatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rss-to-work-with-people-who-did-outstanding-work-during-covid-19-pandemic-bhagwat/story-TDyRf08B3TaPupZ9Bb0LkN.html

The group of envoys, which also included the heads of mission of France and Japan, were provided a “detailed information docket” with details of the planned attack and a list of items and ammunition recovered from the terrorists that “clearly indicated their Pakistani origins”, said a person familiar with developments who spoke on condition of anonymity. The envoys were briefed on how the terrorists sneaked into India through an underground tunnel in Samba sector, and how preliminary investigations by police and intelligence agencies and markings on AK-47 rifles and other items have led India to conclude the terrorists belonged to Pakistan-based JeM. ALSO READ | Nagrota encounter: India pulls up Pakistan envoy on J&K plotThe briefing by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla on the attempted attack at Nagrota in Jammu and Kashmir that was foiled on November 19 also focused on the “implications of the incident on security, diplomacy and the battle against terrorism”, the person said. While the envoys of at least three of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council were invited for the briefing, the Chinese ambassador was not among those present, people familiar with developments said. On November 20, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said security forces in Jammu and Kashmir had foiled a plan by JeM to “wreak major havoc and destruction” by killing four members of the group and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives. The four terrorists were gunned down during a gun battle on the Jammu-Srinagar highway a day earlier. India had summoned Pakistan’s chargé d’affaires Aftab Hassan Khan on November 21 and warned New Delhi is “committed to take all necessary measures to safeguard its national security”. India also demanded that Pakistan should desist from its policy of supporting terrorists and dismantle the terror infrastructure on its territory.

The envoys were told during the briefing that the incident of November 19 was part of Pakistan’s ongoing terror campaign in Jammu and Kashmir and that in 2020 itself, there were some 200 incidents of terrorist violence while 199 terrorists had been neutralised. Details of JeM’s involvement in similar incidents in the past were also shared with the envoys. “In terms of the bigger picture, it is clear the terrorists were planning the biggest terror attack in India since the Pulwama suicide bombing of February 2019 and the implications can be guessed,” said the first person. “This is part of ongoing efforts to sabotage the district development council elections in Jammu and Kashmir and carry out a terror attack aimed to coincide with the anniversary of the 2008 Mumbai terror strikes,” the person added. The envoys were also sensitised to India’s concerns regarding Pakistan’s sustained efforts to destabilise the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and to subvert local elections and democracy, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-briefs-select-group-of-envoys-on-attempted-attack-in-nagrota-by-jem/story-BGpeytZasGNCAMOrNbyMhL.html

23-11-2020||India||Supreme Court to pronounce verdict on plea challenging rejection of nomination papers to contest against PM Modi||The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce on Tuesday its verdict on a plea by sacked BSF Jawan Tej Bahadur challenging the rejection of his nomination papers to contest 2019 Lok Sabha polls against Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi constituency.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde had on November 18 reserved its judgement on Bahadur’s plea challenging the Allahabad High Court verdict which had dismissed his election petition against the poll panel’s decision to reject his nomination papers.During the hearing before the top court, Bahadur’s lawyer had argued that the petitioner had earlier filed his nomination as an independent candidate and later as a candidate of Samajwadi Party from Varanasi constituency.Referring to the high court’s verdict, the lawyer had claimed that Bahadur’s nomination was rejected for “extraneous reasons”.The Returning Officer on May 1 last year had rejected the nomination papers of Bahadur, a Samajwadi Party candidate, who was dismissed from BSF in 2017 after he posted a video online complaining about the quality of food served to the troops.While rejecting the nomination papers of Bahadur, the Returning Officer had observed that “the nomination paper is not accompanied by certificate issued in the prescribed manner by the Election Commission to the effect that he has not been dismissed for corruption or disloyalty to the state”. “In a nut-shell the factual matrix of the case is that on the directions of the Returning officer, the nomination of the appellant to the elections was wrongly rejected for not being presented in a prescribed manner and rejected the nomination/candidature of the Appellant for the Election of the 17th Lok Sabha from 77th Parliamentary Constituency (Varanasi), UP to be held in April – May 2019”, Bahadur has said in his plea.Bahadur has said he has sought a declaration that the election of respondent (Narendra Modi) be declared as void and the order passed by the returning officer dated May 1, 2019, rejecting his nomination be set aside.He has claimed that high court had failed to appreciate that nomination letter of the appellant has been rejected by the district Election Officer by going against the intention of the legal provisions and by misusing the provisions mentioned in the sections 9 and 33(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.On May 9, last year, the top court had rejected his plea by which he has challenged EC’s decision to reject his nomination papers from Varanasi Lok Sabha seat.The top court had said that it does not find any grounds to entertain the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-pronounce-verdict-on-plea-challenging-rejection-of-nomination-papers-to-contest-against-pm-modi/story-jPuEGEFhgnCb424xgklqhI.html

He also asserted that Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution, which were nullified by the BJP-led government at the Centre in August last year, have been “buried forever and cannot be restored back”. The PAGD was formed by seven mainstream parties including the National Conference and the PDP to press for the restoration of the pre-August 5, 2019, position to J-K. The alliance is headed by National Conference president Farooq Abdullah and PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti is its vice chairperson.Also Read | Is the Gupkar alliance driven by political arithmetic or chemistry? Without naming anyone, Thakur said, “There are some who are seeking support of China, some are speaking the language of Pakistan and also insulting the national flag. “They are talking about the restoration of Article 370 with the support of China and Pakistan, the same Article with which they used to loot J-K for the past seven decades to benefit their families and deprived people of the benefits of development.” Thakur, who is the minister of state for finance and BJP’s J-K District Development Council (DDC) election in-charge, was speaking to reporters here. In an apparent reference to the remarks of Mehbooba Mufti that BJP’s policies are driving the youth in the Valley towards militancy, he said, “They are saying that if it (Article 370) was not restored, the youth will pick up guns. We are doing the politics of the ballot to strengthen democracy but they on the other hand are pursuing the politics of bullets to scare the public.”  “We believe in democracy but they believe in bullets and explosives. That is the difference. We are trying to strengthen democracy, maintained peace after the abrogation of Article 370 and ensured development by providing funds. We conducted Panchayat, Block Development Council and Urban Local Bodies elections and are now holding DDC elections which they opposed all along,” Thakur said, adding the intention is to fast forward the development activities through elected representatives at the grass-roots level. Asked about the challenge posed by the PAGD by joining the electoral fray, he said, “Gupkar gang is already scattered because they are a group of people with different ideologies. Their intention is not clean, their policy not clear and they are also without a leader.Also Read | BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain says Article 370 not there now, it will never be “This is a group of cheats, a ‘thagbandhan’ who have looted J-K in the past and have come together again to loot it again,” he said.

In response to another question regarding the continued suspension of 4G mobile internet facility in Jammu and 17 other districts, he said, “The service had already been restored in two districts and when there is a clearance from the security agencies, it will be restored in other districts as well.” “Every election is important for us,” he said when asked for his comment on star campaigners from his party campaigning for the party candidates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-believes-in-politics-of-ballot-to-strengthen-democracy-in-j-k-says-anurag-thakur/story-NClwEbioPlm28Dhr5SQHXN.html

23-11-2020||India||India, Bangladesh to hold virtual summit on December 17||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina are expected to hold a virtual summit on December 17, during which the two sides will sign at least four memorandums of understanding to boost bilateral cooperation. The summit will cap a string of engagements since foreign secretary Harsh Shringla visited Dhaka in August to put the relationship back on an even keel after it was hit by irritants such as the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Before the summit, Bangladesh foreign secretary Masud Bin Momen is expected to visit New Delhi on December 8 for talks with Shringla and other top officials, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Details of the MoUs to be signed during the summit are being finalised, they said. Bangladesh has also invited Modi to visit Dhaka in person on March 26 next year to join celebrations marking 50 years of the country’s independence. Bangladesh foreign minister AK Abdul Momen told the media in Dhaka on Monday that India had accepted the invitation in principle. Modi was scheduled to visit Bangladesh in March to join celebrations marking the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of the nation, but the trip was called off because of the pandemic. At that time, ties had come under strain because of remarks by top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders regarding the deportation of foreigners from Assam to Bangladesh. With China stepping up efforts to enhance development aid for Bangladesh, New Delhi has worked to remove irritants in ties with Dhaka and sped up work on several connectivity and transit projects. Shringla’s visit to Dhaka was his first trip abroad after Covid-19-related travel restrictions kicked in, and he had handed over a personal message from Modi to Hasina. In July, India provided 10 railway locomotives to Bangladesh, days after the first container train made its way to the Bangladeshi side and the first shipment of goods was sent from Kolkata to Tripura via Chattogram port. The two sides are setting up a new mechanism to review progress on bilateral projects, with five such ventures, including an oil pipeline and three cross-border rail links, set to be completed in 2021. However, the people cited above said rhetoric related to upcoming elections in West Bengal, including remarks by top BJP leaders that the border with Bangladesh will be sealed to prevent the entry of “fake voters”, had resulted in fresh concerns in Dhaka. Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said despite India-Bangladesh ties being affected by issues such as CAA and Beijing’s overtures to Dhaka, the “overall picture of the bilateral relationship is very good”. He said, “Bangladesh could raise the Teesta waters issue at the summit but India will have nothing new to offer as elections are coming up in West Bengal. But the two sides can work towards closer and deeper cooperation and Bangladesh will be keen to discuss the future trajectory of Bimstec (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), which is on the cusp of major rejuvenation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bangladesh-to-hold-virtual-summit-on-december-17/story-3v0y1uuYrklSOfdCrLcP0H.html

In the supplementary charge sheet filed on Sunday, Imam and Khalid were booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and other sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act and Prevention of Damage to Public Properties Act in the matter.Also Read | Delhi riots: Gulfisha gets bail in Jafrabad violence caseThe High Court had on November 11 stayed the trial of the conspiracy case after a plea was filed by the police challenging the order of the city court directing them to supply physical copies of the charge sheet to all the accused.It, however, had said the trial court is at liberty to decide any application in the case and put up the matter for further hearing on December 15. During the hearing, some of the advocates for the accused said that the grievance of the prosecutor was with the supply of physical copies of the bulky main charge sheet and so soft copies of the supplementary charge sheet can be supplied now.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, said the prosecution was willing to provide soft copies of the supplementary charge sheet to the accused but the orders have to come from the court.He, however, said if the court passes any such directions for supply of the charge sheet, then the police can challenge it before the high court.The trial court had on October 21 refused to grant time to the police to obtain funds’ sanction to provide to the accused hard copies of the voluminous charge sheet and directed to provide the same.The police has challenged the order before the high court.The soft copies of the main charge sheet, running over 17,000 pages, have been supplied to 15 accused persons but hard copies were not given to them.Also Read | College admissions: Riot-hit northeast Delhi students to get 3 months more to submit original documentsThe main charge sheet was filed in September against Pinjra Tod members and JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha and student activist Gulfisha Fatima.Others who were charge-sheeted included former Congress Councillor Ishrat Jahan, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, Meeran Haider and Shifa-Ur-Rehman, suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, activist Khalid Saifi, Shadab Ahmed, Tasleem Ahmed, Salim Malik, Mohd Salim Khan and Athar Khan.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-court-defers-hearing-against-khalid-imam-in-uapa-on-cognisance-of-supplementary-charge-sheet/story-HNIkhK2RrXHOl3csP17WpO.html

The services of these pilots were terminated in August.The court also asked the airline to hear out the grievances of the pilots, who were engaged on contract after they superannuated, and to see whether something, like a “golden handshake”, can be done for them.With the suggestions, the court listed the matter for hearing on December 16.The court was hearing two pleas moved on behalf of the terminated contractual pilots who have sought quashing of the April 2 order suspending their services and the subsequent order of August 7 by which they were all terminated.Also Read | Travellers from 4 states to carry Covid-negative report: Maha govt in orderThe pilots, represented by advocates Lalit Bhardwaj, Krishan Gopal and Jatin Anand Dwivedi, have sought a direction to AI to restore their contractual engagements or pay them salaries along with flying allowances with effect from April 1 till their licenses are restored to current ratings.Air India, defending its decision, told the court that after lockdown 90 per cent of its regular pilots are sitting at home as most of its fleet has been grounded and added that it was suffering huge losses of Rs 1,300 crore each month.It also said that contractual obligations cannot be sought to be enforced by way of a writ petition and a civil suit has to be filed.The court, during the hearing, asked the airline why it did not terminate the pilots in April itself if it could not afford to employ any more pilots after the lockdown. The airline said it was not sure how long the flying operations would be affected and therefore, had not terminated their services.The court said it understands the problems being faced by the airline in the prevailing extraordinary situation, “but we cannot also let the employees be left to hang high and dry”.“Give them at least one month’s salary,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-asks-air-india-to-consider-paying-one-month-s-salary-to-terminated-contractual-pilots/story-j9nJceRxcyWcfo600jooeI.html

23-11-2020||India||Modi govt promoting new forms of ‘economic slavery’: Congress||Days after the labour ministry proposed raising ‘spread-over time’ for a worker to 12 hours a day from the current limit of 10-and-half hours, Congress on Monday attacked the Centre saying the proposed rules will lead to 41 lakh job losses in the organised sector. This comes two months after three labour code bills were passed by the Parliament during the monsoon session in September. “India abolished slavery centuries ago. Modi Government is Promoting New Forms of ‘Economic Slavery’ for Exploitation of Labour & Working Class,” Randeep Surjewala, national spokesperson of the grand old party wrote on Twitter. The order notified on November 19, has drawn flak from many corners because the Occupational Safety, Health And Working Conditions Code, 2020 passed by Parliament provides for maximum eight working hours in a day.Surjewala also shared a statement released by the Congress in which the party has alleged that the BJP government, instead of mitigating the over-exploitation of the poor and vulnerable, has now given an open license to oppress the working and manufacturing class. “Rule 28 of the new rules now provide for 12 hour shifts for factory workers, leaving them little time for long hours of commuting, rest, sending for the household, relaxation and family time i.e. work-life balance.” This would have a severe impact on the physical and mental well-being for India’s labour and working class, it added. Terming it “Draconian Anti-Labour Rules”, the statement claims the amended legislation is bound to make 1/3rd of the current workforce in factories across the country “redundant” and “jobless,” as industries will now opt for two shifts instead of the prevailing three-shift pattern. Countering the government’s proposal of 12 hours-shifts based on suggestions of the parliamentary committee on labour, Congress cited 2017-2018 Annual Survey of Industries by the Government of India, according to which there were 1,22,24,402 individual workers employed in factories alone in India. However, with the stretched working hours allowed under the new rules, more than 40,65,000 persons will be rendered jobless immediately upon its implementation, the grand old party claimed. The OHS Code 2020, passed by Parliament in September, amended laws regulating occupational safety, health and working conditions of employees. The code empowers a state government to exempt any new factory from the provisions of the Code to create more economic activity and jobs. According to proposed labour code draft rules, no worker shall be required, or allowed, to work for more than 48 hours in a week. The establishment needs to ensure that the working period, inclusive breaks, does not spread over for more than 12 hours in a day, the draft rules state. No worker will work for more than five hours without at least a half-an-hour break, according to the proposed rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-promoting-new-forms-of-economic-slavery-congress/story-H5TL20zlYn7nqpsrnxdZgM.html
23-11-2020||India||Kerala actor assault case: Public prosecutor A Sureshan quits||The special public prosecutor in the actor abduction and assault case, A Sureshan, on Monday resigned from his post three days after the High Court rejected the pleas of the survivor and prosecution to change the judge of the trial court. He said he sent his resignation letter to the state home secretary. The court later deferred the case to November 26. Now the government will have to appoint a new prosecutor and it is likely to delay the ongoing trial. Sureshan was appointed the special public prosecutor on the request of the survivor and her family. In the letter he said since he questioned the attitude of the judge it is not proper for him to continue. He was the prosecutor in the Soumya murder case in 2011 in which accused Govindachamy was sentenced to death. But later, the apex court had commuted his sentence to life-term. Soumya was thrown out of a moving train and raped on the tracks and she later succumbed to her injuries. Last month the prosecution and survivor had moved the high court alleging “a discriminatory approach” by the special judge Honey M Varghese who is hearing the case. In the sensational case, many witnesses had turned hostile during the trial and both alleged that the court failed to take any action. The prosecution had moved the court earlier to cancel the bail of Malayalam actor Dileep, the eighth accused in the case, saying some of the witnesses were influenced by him but the trail court had turned it down. Later, both moved the high court with a plea to change the judge. But after a week-long argument the HC had turned down their plea and directed the court to resume the trail. The attack on the woman actor took place in 2017. When the 31-year-old actor was returning after a shooting assignment she was allegedly abducted and sexually assaulted in a moving car by a criminal gang. There were 10 accused in the case. They took video clippings of the assault and let her go after a three-hour ordeal and threatened to release the video clippings if she approached the police. During the attack the main accused Pulsar Suni, an alleged history sheeter, had reportedly told the victim that he was given a quotation (a contract crime) and he was forced to do this. However, the actor complained the next day and police arrested all accused who were directly involved in the crime. Since there was strong speculation that they carried out the assault at the behest of someone, after six months the Special Investigation Team had arrested Dileep and he spent three months in jail. The case witnessed many twists and turns in three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-actor-assault-case-public-prosecutor-a-sureshan-quits/story-TNXZnOCeO5sGANjoIRnUWP.html

Though he was discharged on October 25, he was readmitted on November 2 due to post-Covid complications. Loved and admired by those from his party as well as from other parties, Gogoi was closely associated with Assam’s political scenario for over five decades and his death will create a big void not just in Congress but in the political space in the State. “I am deeply saddened by the demise of former chief minister Tarun Gogoi. With his death the state has lost an experienced, capable and efficient political leader. The people of Assam will always remember his committed services and contributions to the state,” current chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal said in a statement. He had earlier in the day described him as ‘a father figure’.Gogoi was born on April 1, 1936 at Rangajan Tea Estate in Jorhat district, where his father Dr Kamaleshwar Gogoi was posted. He did his BA and LLB from JB College, Jorhat and Gauhati University respectively. After a few years stint as an advocate, he plunged into politics, getting elected as a member of Jorhat municipal board in 1968. Three years later, he was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time from Jorhat. Gogoi was re-elected to Lok Sabha for two more terms from Jorhat, in 1977 and 1983. Between 1983 and 1990, he held several senior posts in Congress including the party’s general secretary as well as Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president. Gogoi got elected to the Lok Sabha for the fourth time in 1991 from Kaliabor, a constituency he represented two more times in 1998 and 1999. Gogoi’s son Gaurav now represents Congress from Kaliabor. Paying rich tributes to the leader, Sonowal said the departed leader had set high standards with his personal and professional contributions.“His sense of humour, amiable and outspoken nature attracted everyone. He set high ethical values in the field of politics with his simple lifestyle and contributed profusely in strengthening the democratic values in the country,” Sonowal’s statement added. The veteran politician was also a union minister between 1991 and 1995 handling the portfolio of food processing ministry independently in the PV Narasimha Rao government. After a long stint in Delhi, Gogoi returned to active politics in Assam and led Congress government for three consecutive terms between 2001 and 2016, when Bharatiya Janata Party came to power for the first time. The veteran leader was representing the Titabar assembly seat at the time of his death. “His death is an irreparable loss to the state as well as to the nation. As chief minister, Union minister and a member of the Lok Sabha, late Gogoi served the people compassionately and dedicatedly. He was a towering leader who witnessed several ups and downs during his long political career.

23-11-2020||India||Goa: Feni distillers protest against govt decision to do away with auctioning of cashew groves||Cashew feni distillers in Goa are up in arms against a Goa government decision to do away with the process of auctioning of cashew groves. They say it will lead to corporatisation of feni production that is currently operated by traditional distillers known as cazcars. The All Goa Cashew Feni Distillers and Bottlers Association has written to the state government, stating its opposition to the move. The Opposition too has lent its support to the distillers, with Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat saying such a move was unwarranted. “The sinister plan is to remove, dilute and change all existing licensing, laws or governing hurdles in order to allow mass production of feni and thereafter, the wholesale takeover of the feni industry from Goans by big multinational corporations or the wolves of the IMFL lobby. This is about more than feni – Goa and our entire way of life is under threat,” Hansel Vaz, a member of the association said. Also read | Goa to adopt curbs like Maharashtra on arrivals from Delhi, says health minister Vishwajit RaneThe Goa government’s excise department earns around Rs40 lakh from these cashew auctions. It allows winning bidders to distil feni from cashew juice during the summer months of March, April and May. Most of the bidders are traditional distillers. “Cashew feni is a heritage drink of Goa. It also has medicinal uses and so, I think it is important that we preserve this brand...This is being done by traditional people. I got to know that the excise department wants to change some rules which will open the market and could also bring in big companies. The Goa government should not allow this to go from traditional distrillers to others,” Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat said.

KCR made this promise while releasing his party’s manifesto at Pragathi Bhavan, his camp office in Hyderabad on Monday. The elections are set to be held on December 1.“The scheme will come into effect from December. This will not only be a great relief to the poor and middleclass citizens, but also prevent wastage of drinking water,” said KCR. After assessing the situation within the GHMC limits, the government would extend this facility to other municipalities and municipal corporations in the state as well, he said. The TRS president also announced free power supply to salons, laundries and dhobi ghats not only in Hyderabad, but also across the state, with effect from December. “Free power supply to salons has been a long-pending demand of barbers’ community. We shall also restore all the dhobi ghats,” he said. Stating that the lockdown imposed across the country owing the outbreak of Covid-19 in March and the subsequent slowdown of economy had impacted several sections, KCR also announced waiver of Motor Vehicle Tax amounting to Rs267 crore for the two quarters of the current year payable by 337,611 vehicle owners, all over the state. Similarly, KCR announced waiver of minimum demand charges of electricity supply for high-tension and low-tension categories of industries, cinema theatres and commercial firms for a period of six months, as they suffered heavily during the lockdown period across the state. For the film industry, the chief minister said the government would reimburse the state GST for small budget films (up to Rs10 crore), allow theatres to increase the number of shows per day and make ticket pricing flexible following the losses incurred by the industry. KCR also announced implementation of comprehensive sewerage master plan for Hyderabad at a cost of Rs13,000 crore to prevent inundation of colonies during heavy rains and restoration of storm water drains at a cost of Rs12,000 crore. The state government would also take up construction of a reservoir at Kesavapuram on the outskirts of city that would ensure drinking water supply to the city for another 50 years. It has already set up Musi Riverfront Development Corporation that would help cleanse the Musi river by linking it to Godavari river, so that it will be completely rid of pollution, he said. Among the other poll promises in the election manifesto are expansion of Metro rail network up to the Shamshabad international airport, expansion of multimodal transport system and implementation of strategic road development project for smooth flow of traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-trs-manifesto-for-ghmc-polls-promises-free-water-power-supply/story-ZlDGituKA91oK0Uho1vxdL.html

Of all the Covid vaccine candidates, which will GOI choose & why? 2. Who will get the vaccine first & what will be the distribution strategy? 3. Will PMCares fund be used to ensure free vaccination? 4. By when will all Indians be vaccinated?” he posted on Twitter. The PM must tell the nation:1. Of all the Covid vaccine candidates, which will GOI choose & why?2. Who will get the vaccine first & what will be the distribution strategy?3. Will PMCares fund be used to ensure free vaccination?4.

From questioning the lockdown, to slamming the various economic measures announced by the government, the former Congress president has been on the offensive.On Sunday, he tagged a news report and tweeted that the “unplanned lockdown” pushed millions into poverty. He also accused the Centre of covering up the “bitter truth”.The latest attack from Gandhi comes a day before PM Modi holds a meeting with chief ministers of states and union territories to review the Covid-19 situation across the country.The issues of vaccine distribution and emergency authorisation are likely to come up during virtual discussions between the prime minister and chief ministers.At a recently held meeting of the Niti Aayog, issues like emergency authorisation, advance procurement, pricing of vaccines were discussed - a development which came after Pfizer and Moderna have said they would seek emergency authorisation of their vaccines, which have proved around 95 per cent efficacy in the trials.The Prime Minister has also constituted a Vaccine Task Force (VTF) to lay down principles for emergency use authorisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-in-fresh-attack-on-pm-modi-rahul-gandhi-poses-4-questions/story-Dh5LRDbqgvRT7dtXwamTVN.html

These pleas challenged the process behind the Centre’s approval to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to file appeal against the acquittal of the various accused, including former Union minister A Raja and DMK leader Kanimozhi.Justice Brijesh Sethi said the process for filing an appeal was duly followed and the CBI did not need to give any additional sanction or permission.

Leave to appeal is a formal permission granted by a court to a party to challenge a decision in a higher court.A special court had, on December 21, 2017, acquitted Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in the CBI and ED cases related to the 2G spectrum allocation scam.Besides Raja and Kanimozhi, the special court had acquitted Raja’s erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia; Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group -- Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair, in the CBI case. Also acquitted were Swan Telecom promoters, Unitech Wireless (Tamil Nadu) Ltd, Reliance Telecom Ltd, film producer Karim Morani and director of Kalaignar TV Sharad Kumar.In March 2018, the ED and the CBI had approached the high court challenging the special court’s order acquitting all the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2g-spectrum-case-delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-challenging-centre-s-decision-making-process-regarding-cbi-appeal/story-LWz2VZpw1ec6TECP0ijOzM.html

Chintamani Bhatt, bridegroom from Jaayal village in Pithoragarh district, said, “I had gone to meet my fiancé on February 28. Later, my family fixed wedding in March, but the wedding was postponed due to the sealing of border because of Covid-19 pandemic.” Bhatt’s marriage was fixed with Ambika Bhatt 19, a resident of Gurukhola village in Baitri district of western Nepal. After the sealing of the border, both families decided to postpone the wedding and wait for the lifting of the lockdown, a relative said. When an auspicious date for the wedding came in Margshish (an auspicious month according to Hindu calendar), the bride’s and groom’s families decided to hold the wedding. Both families approached competent authorities of their respective areas in Pithoragarh and Baitri for obtaining permission to cross the international border, the relative said. Bhatt said, “When the auspicious month for the wedding came, both families felt that it would not be proper to postpone the wedding anymore. So the applied for permissions to cross the border from their respective local administration”. Bhatt crossed the border from Jhulaghat through a suspension bridge on the river Mahakali that connects the two countries on Saturday with five baratis (wedding guests) including a priest before noon and returned with the bride on the same evening. KN Nagarkoti, in-charge, Seema Shashtra Bal (SSB) outpost, Jhulaghat bridge, said, “The bridge was opened only for baratis to cross the border on the permission of administration. When the barat returned we closed the bridge again.” Pramod Bhatt, a local trader of Jhulaghat, said, “This is the first wedding in the area after lockdown. Citizens of both bordering areas have ‘Roti-beti’ (trade and family) relations with each other but sealing of border prevented them from strengthening the relations this year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-borders-sealed-uttarakhand-man-waits-8-months-to-marry-nepalese-woman/story-VsISP2mghkONaIUXRpswlL.html

Navin Pant, sub-divisional forest officer of the Pithoragarh forest division said, “To preserve alpine meadows above the height of 3500 metres in Munsiyari forest range, we have taken this step. We have developed enough structures to implement the restriction and the conservation process will start from Khalia Bugyal.” He added that apart from the highly-visited Khalia, Chiplakedar and Namik meadows, the district has over 10 meadows that need preservation. According to the forest officer, camping and bonfires on the meadows lead to soil erosion and pollution on the otherwise clean land. “The soil erosion and damage to the top layer of the soil also restricts the blossoming of flowers in summer months and depletion of local vegetation,” Pant said. As part of soil erosion in the meadows, usually, initially, sheet erosion happens, which turns into rill erosion due to heavy rainfall leading to gully erosion, a widespread form of soil depletion caused by surface water flow. This leads to the formation of channels in the meadows. The forest department officials have also restricted the number of daily visitors to the meadows. The official said that not more than 200 tourists will be allowed for a day visit to these meadows and the violators will be dealt with provisions under the Indian Forest Act. The officials have also decided to remove exotic vegetation from the meadows which will be rooted out and promote the growth of local vegetation cover in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-preserve-alpine-meadows-in-uttarakhand-s-pithoragarh-no-more-overnight-stays-bonfires/story-H7hNp2BBp0LBMszyxwemcK.html

In a surprise move, Fadnavis took oath as Maharashtra chief minister after support from a splinter group of NCP led by Ajit Pawar. The government lasted for only 80 hours with both Pawar and Fadnavis resigning a day before a Supreme Court ordered trust vote.Pawar later returned to the NCP fold.After Fadnavis’ resignation, the three-party alliance of the Sena, NCP and Congress, known as Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA), formed the government in the state.Shiv Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA passed the floor test in the assembly with the support of 169 MLAs. The halfway mark in the assembly is 288-member Maharashtra assembly was 145.

Similarly, WhatsApp, which is one of the world’s most popular messaging platforms, is attacked by scammers time and again. No wonder then, they have found yet another way to target WhatsApp users, this time through the one-time password (OTP).How does the ‘OTP scam’ work?To set up WhatsApp on a new smartphone, one needs to enter his/her registered phone number. Once this is done, WhatsApp sends an OTP to the phone number; one has to type in this OTP to set up WhatsApp. However, it is important to note here that WhatsApp sends an OTP only if prompted by a user.It is this feature hackers and scammers are using to target WhatsApp users. The scammers pretend to be friends or family members and send “messages,” sometimes describing an “emergency” to grab one’s attention. Once this is done, they’ll send a WhatsApp message asking for an OTP, which, they’ll say, has been forwarded “accidentally.” The moment this OTP is shared with the hacker, the user gets locked out of their WhatsApp account and the hacker takes over it completely.The hacker can now send a message from the person’s WhatsApp account to all the contacts and continue with the scam.What to do if WhatsApp account is hacked?If somehow one falls prey to this scam, they need to immediately reset their WhatsApp account and log in again by entering their number and receiving an OTP. Logging into WhatsApp with this OTP locks the hacker out.How not to fall prey to this scam?Since WhatsApp does not send an OTP without being prompted, one should ignore an OTP sent on their number if they have not asked for it. Check with friends or family members on receiving a message from their number asking for an OTP. Activating two-step authentication is also helpful in preventing one from falling prey to this scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-otp-scam-what-is-it-and-how-not-to-fall-prey/story-Jca26IFh0GwjwbJ8txupKO.html

Its priority is to provide quality education to the students. Quality of education is getting affected due to the small schools. A better learning environment can be created at the big schools. The purpose is to provide primary and secondary education at one place,” he said.Project director of Odisha school education programme authority, Bhupendra Singh Poonia said the government is yet to work out the exact number of schools that would be saved from being shut down after the latest decision.The government’s decision came a day after a Congress MLA threatened to slit his throat if the government went ahead with its decision of closing the 7,772 schools.“It’s a plan of the government to keep children away from their basic right of education. They must rethink the closure decision,” said Tara Bahinipati, Congress MLA from tribal-dominated Koraput district, where 800 schools were up for closure.Also Read: Odisha Cong MLA threatens to slit his throat if school closure move is not reversedEarlier, deputy leader of the Opposition Bishnu Sethi questionated the rationale of the decision saying the closure would lead to more dropouts. “Nearly 11 lakh students enrol for class 1 every year but only 6 lakh students among these appear in the examination. Why nearly 5 lakh students drop out in the state,” he asked. “We will sit on dharna near the Odisha Assembly speaker’s podium if the State government does not reconsider its decision,” said Sethi.Congress leader Narasingha Mishra said shutting down thousands of schools is taking away the right to education for the underprivileged children.In two separate notifications issued by the state school and mass education department during August and September this year, the government had decided to shut down schools with student strength less than 20 in both scheduled and non-scheduled areas. The government argued that it would lead to improvement in the learning environment, better infrastructure facilities, better academic environment and co-curricular facilities for the students.The move termed “consolidation and rationalisation” under Niti Aayog’s sustainable action for transforming human capital in education (SATH-E) project is already under implementation with several such schools being merged with the nearest bigger schools called the Lead Schools over the last few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-fire-odisha-govt-spares-schools-with-15-students-or-more-from-closure/story-fpvQc3ddUviprfLxHDL6BK.html

Since the pollution due to stubble-burning is less now, the downtrend in deaths will be there in a few weeks,” Jain said.Delhi recorded 6,746 fresh Covid-19 cases on Sunday and a positivity rate of 12.29 per cent, while 121 more fatalities pushed the city’s death toll due to the disease to 8,391, authorities said.This was the fifth time in 11 days that the daily number of deaths crossed the 100-mark in the national capital.The authorities reported 111 deaths on Saturday, 118 on Friday, 131 on November 18, the highest till date, and 104 on November 12.Delhi has reported a death rate of 1.58 per cent among Covid-19 patients as compared to the national fatality rate of 1.48 per cent.Also Read | Delhi sees over 500 Covid-19 deaths in last 5 daysExperts attribute the high figure of daily Covid-19 deaths in the national capital to a large number of “critical” non-resident patients coming to the city for treatment, an unfavourable weather, pollution and a better “reporting and mapping” of fatalities.They say the easing of restrictions has exposed the vulnerable population, such as the elderly and those having comorbidities, to the deadly virus.Jain said the number of fresh cases as well as the positivity rate are gradually going down in Delhi, showing that the Covid-19 situation is improving.Since November 7, when the positivity rate was more than 15 per cent, it has come down to over 12 per cent now. The number of fresh cases was over 8,500 on November 10, which reduced to 6,746 on Sunday, he said.The health minister said 9,418 hospital beds have been occupied by Covid-19 patients in Delhi currently, whereas 7,900 are still vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stubble-burning-led-to-high-covid-19-death-rate-in-delhi-says-health-minister-satyendar-jain/story-52kAU1QHoCYpGkARYbivfL.html

Maharashtra to take call on Delhi travel in 8 days||As the cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continue to witness a spike in the national capital, a Maharashtra minister on Monday said that the state will take a call on curbs on travel between Delhi and Maharashtra within eight days.

Further details on this will be provided this evening,” Adar tweeted.  I am delighted to hear that, Covishield, a low-cost, logistically manageable & soon to be widely available, #COVID19 vaccine, will offer protection up to 90% in one type of dosage regime and 62% in the other dosage regime. Further details on this, will be provided this evening. https://t.co/KCr3GmROiWThe development will speed up vaccine roll out in India as Serum Institute of India had already planned to apply to the Indian government for emergency authorisation once it deems fit. Several countries are looking forward to Oxford vaccine as it will be cheaper than Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. In India, it will be priced Rs 600-600 per dose and the government would be able to procure it at almost half the rate, Poonawalla said earlier.On Monday, the Oxford-Astrazeneca announced that one of the dosing might be 90% effective. “One dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy of 90% when AZD1222 was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart, and another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. The combined analysis from both dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted in an average efficacy of 70%,” Astrazeneca said.Compared to Moderna and Pfizer which have claimed around 94% efficacy, Oxford’s initial reports appear to be less promising, but this is only the initial reports. Out of all the participants, 131 contracted Covid-19, but none of them was serious. There was no need for hospitalisation, Astrazeneca said. However, Covishield has a number of advantages over Pfizer that needs minus 70 degree Celcius temperature for storage. The vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius/ 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered within existing healthcare settings, Astrazeneca said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delighted-tweets-adar-poonawalla-as-oxford-vaccine-claims-70-efficacy/story-Rv8hl8l173gL27rsmCOtuL.html

The PMK has revived the demand in recent months. PMK founder S Ramadoss lamented that though they were in alliance with the ruling AIADMK, it was of “no use”. He said that they were also let down by former DMK patriarch and late chief minister M Karunanidhi. If their demands aren’t met, Ramadoss warned that they will intensify the protest across the state like the reservation-based agitations led by Patidars in Gujarat and Gujjars in Rajasthan.Though PMK hasn’t fared well in elections, they retain clout amongst the Dravidian majors for assembly elections because of their dominating influence in the Vanniyar community - their core vote bank in Tamil Nadu’s western and northern belt. PMK leader and former union minister Anbumani Ramadoss said that the reservations were not just a caste-based issue but also a developmental issue. The party and their affiliated organisations will begin their protest in front of the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) in Chennai “We filed an RTI with TNPSC for details on case-based reservations but they rejected it. We want to ascertain the beneficiaries belonging to the Vanniyar community as it remains the most backward,” said PMK spokesperson Vinoba Bhoopathy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-ally-pmk-revives-reservation-demand-ahead-of-2021-tn-assembly-polls/story-d8c5JnsAkvmi0aNvEb09WO.html

Calling the period historic in the nation’s development, the PM referred to a number of landmark legislations passed since. He also said that green initiatives were incorporated in building the multi-storeyed flats. He said that accommodation for MPs was a long standing problem, adding,“decades-old problems can’t be ended by avoiding them, but by finding solutions.” He said his government built the Ambedkar National Memorial, the idea of which had come up during the time of Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the prime minister. Similarly, he said, the new building of the Central Information Commission, the War Memorial near India Gate and the National Police Memorial, which were built by his government, had been pending for a long time.Praising Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla for his stewardship of the House, the PM expressed happiness that Parliament proceedings continued even during the pandemic, with new regulations and precautionary measures. He added that both houses worked even on weekends for ensuring smooth proceedings in the monsoon session.PM Modi said just as the age of 16-18 years is very important in one’s life, the term of the 17th Lok Sabha, which started in 2019, saw some historic decisions being taken. He expressed confidence that the next (18th) Lok Sabha will also play an important role in taking the country forward.“Be it Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign, or economic targets or many other pledges like this, we have to achieve them during this period,” he said.A PMO statement had earlier said that the construction of these flats was completed with savings of about 14% of the sanctioned cost and without time overrun despite the impact of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-inaugurates-76-multi-storeyed-flats-for-mp-in-delhi/story-1vdMgErAyc4wFPRdaYcUZP.html

The annual event will end in the wee hours of Tuesday. While the ‘panch kosi parikrama’ will start from 4am on November 25 and end the next day early in the morning. The Kartik Purnima fair will be held the entire day on November 30. Due to restrictions imposed by the Ayodhya administration and the ban on entry of outsiders, participants in the parikrama or rounds are significantly less as compared to the previous years. Last year, several lakh people took part in the two parikramas and the Kartik Purnima fair. However, this year not more than a few thousand were present for the ‘chaudah kosi parikrama’. The Ayodhya administration decided to go ahead with the two annual parikramas and Kartik Purnima fair, counted among the biggest religious events in this temple town. At a time when there is a sudden surge in coronavirus cases in UP and many cities across the country, it will be an important challenge for the Ayodhya administration to enforce Covid-19 containment protocol during these religious congregations. As a precautionary measure, the administration has set up Covid help desks at 17 places. “At 17 places, Covid help desks have been set up. Mobile toilet vans and water tankers are available. We will enforce Covid-19 containment protocols and make sure that everyone wears a mask,” said Anuj Jha, district magistrate, Ayodhya. “We have requested seers to ensure less participation of people in these events. There will be random testing and thermal scanning of pilgrims also,” added Jha. Before setting up any stall, prior permission from the Ayodhya administration has been made compulsory. Also Read: After Ayodhya spectacle, Varanasi readies for Dev DeepawaliDue to a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases, the state government has restricted the number of guests to 100 in marriage parties in Noida and Ghaziabad. “Enforcing Covid protocol in two parikramas and Kartik Purnima fair will not be easy for the Ayodhya administration. The only way to minimise the risk of virus spread is by restricting participation of people in these events,” said a health official. During Deepotsav celebrations in Ayodhya on November 13, no outsider was allowed and participation of locals was also restricted due to Covid pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ayodhya-s-chaudah-kosi-parikrama-starts-amid-covid-19-scare/story-ZSz9XzCOp25AnME4M1TtfM.html

But the TMC leader who took the first jab at the saffron camp was hit by video clips showing him making statements against chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Addressing a media conference on Sunday, Kunal Ghosh, one of the spokespersons of the TMC, dared BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya to reveal on record who he means while frequently mentioning the word bhaipo in public. Vijayvargiya, while addressing a rally in East Midnapore district on Saturday said “no person with self-esteem can stay in the TMC because the party’s reins have gone to bhaipo.” Vijayvargiya, an election observer for West Bengal, used the word several times in the past. Although Vijayvargiya did not take any name, it was apparent that he was referring to chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee. In fact many senior BJP leaders, such as Amit Malviya, head of the party’s national information technology cell and co-incharge of the organization in Bengal, frequently use the Bengal word pishi (aunt) as well. “I dare you (Vijayvargiya). If you have the courage, name the person. Who is bhaipo?” said Ghosh and made a counterattack on former TMC leader and the BJP’s national vice-president Mukul Roy who is one of the accused in the Narada sting operation case being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Malviya and the Bengal unit of the BJP targeted Ghosh by tweeting videos of the statements he made against the chief minister when he was in judicial custody for two years as an accused in the Saradha chit fund scam. “The name of the person who got the most direct and indirect benefit of Saradha Media is Mamata Banerjee,” Ghosh can be heard saying to mediapersons in a video clip once aired by a popular news channel. Saradha Media was floated by the chit fund company’s owner, Sudipta Sen, who is still in judicial custody. “Kunal Ghosh, scam tainted spokesperson of TMC, who was fielded to defend ‘Bhaipo’ had this to say in Sept 2014, “If there is anyone who has directly or indirectly benefited the most from Saradha Media, that person is Mamata Banerjee“. Pishi can clarify if the allegation is true,” tweeted Malviya. In its tweet, the Bengal BJP said, “In the next @AITCofficial press conference, @KunalGhoshAgain should reiterate his public stand on the Saradha scam. Or maybe explain what he thinks of ‘the greatest Saradha beneficiary’ or why he himself had to go to jail in the first place. Leave Bhaipo, save Pishi instead..” Ghosh responded to these tweets by tweeting old videos of Mukul Roy where he made statements against top BJP leaders at TMC rallies. Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said, “When someone utters the words didi (elder sister) and bhaipo, the entire Bengal understands who are being referred to.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-battleground-twitter-bjp-tmc-target-each-other-with-old-videos/story-PvtzjsXoYKdaThotO7PnyI.html

According to statistics released by the excise department, the distilleries and small units of UP not only produced a record 177 lakh litre of sanitiser from March 24 to November 15 but has also generated a record revenue of Rs 137 crore. “While this includes GST revenue of Rs 12,848 lakh, the licence fee added Rs 794.28 lakh. In addition, the revenue from the denaturation fees was Rs 21.18 lakh,” additional chief secretary, excise, Sanjay R Bhoosreddy said. “While more than 78.38 lakh litre of sanitiser was sold outside UP, 87.01 lakh litre was consumed within the state,” he added. “Production of sanitisers was completed quickly and the product was also promptly made available in the markets”, Bhoosreddy said. Officials said from just producing very little to exporting sanitiser to other states, UP quickly revisited its entire policy pertaining to sanitiser manufacture and sale.Soon after the lockdown started, the state’s food safety and drug administration department had relaxed norms for manufacture and availability of sanitiser, allowing general stores to sell them too. Earlier only medical centres with drug licences were authorised to sell sanitiser. Not just that, the excise department officials also ensured that the pricing of sanitiser was kept in check. “We decided that it should not have been more than Rs 100 per 200 ml pack. All credit to chief minister Yogi Adityanath for monitoring the situation and availability of sanitiser. He also asked us to ensure that the common man wasn’t fleeced,” Bhoosreddy said adding that the excise department had urged people to ask for receipts while buying sanitiser so that cases of overpricing could be verified and the guilty punished.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-generates-record-rs-137-cr-revenue-from-sanitiser-production/story-p09bcZyOke7P3xwoFdVOGJ.html

The order was passed by a three- judge bench headed by Justice LN Rao after Perarivalan’s lawyer senior advocate Gopal Shankarnaraynan pointed out that his parole was ending today. He was granted parole by the designated court earlier from November 9 to 23 for medical check up. But since he was not provided with police escort, he was unable to get it done. This was informed to the apex court which directed the state government to provide police escort and extended his parole by a week.The order came on a petition filed by Perarivalan in which he had challenged the delay on his remission plea pending with Governor since 2015.The Tamil Nadu government had earlier informed the court that the Governor had sought a report from Union home ministry for response on the remission plea as a multi-disciplinary probe by CBI is underway on the larger conspiracy with relation to Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination in September 1991.The Court had asked CBI to respond on the progress in its larger conspiracy probe. The CBI filed an affidavit last week before the court informing that the probe had nothing to do with the remission plea of Perarivalan as the scope of the probe was against persons other than those who were already convicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-convict-ag-perarivalan-gets-a-week-s-parole-from-supreme-court-for-medical-check-up/story-r8QJiBrldwrvXwCNFYtErI.html

Even after the 14 hours long mega block imposed on November 21 and 22, the work of the girder launching could be completed up to 90 per cent only. However the special mega block by railway helped in completing the launch of the 76.67 meter long open web girder for the ROB located on the Kalyan-Shilphata stretch. Technical glitches and an engine failure at Dadar station on Sunday morning had led to the delay and the launching of an 18-metre portion of the girder was pending. “As the work on Sunday started late we could not finish the entire work. Due to the special mega block the remaining works were finished. The special block was allotted between 1.30 am to 3 am,” said an officer of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). “During the block provided we managed to finish the major works and even after the block the work continued till 6 am,” added the officer. Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde who was at the spot overnight said,” Completing the launching of girder was very important and continuous efforts by the workers and engineers helped in finishing it. There were moments when we thought that the work will not finish.

Expected to make landfall on Wednesday, Nivar is likely to cause heavy rainfall in these places.However, it is not the first major cyclone which will have hit a state this year or in the last 12 months. Here are some major cyclones to have occurred in India since 2019:1. Cyclone Amphan: India’s first major cyclone of 2020, Super Cyclonic Storm Amphan caused major damage in West Bengal, as well in the neighbouring country of Bangladesh. Odisha, another eastern state, was also hit by Amphan though it was spared the sort of damage that the cyclone caused in West Bengal. Formed on May 16, Amphan dissipated on May 21, leaving widespread destruction in its trail, claiming over 100 lives, most of which were from West Bengal.2. Cyclone Nisarga: Severe Cyclonic Storm Nisarga struck the Indian subcontinent within just two weeks of Amphan, most severely affecting India’s financial hub of Maharashtra, where all fatalities due to the cyclone-six-took place. The state of Gujarat and the UT of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu (DNHDD) were also put on high alert though both escaped Nisarga’s wrath. Formed on June 1 and dissipated on June 4, Nisarga was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike Maharashtra since June 1891.3. Cyclone Fani: Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Fani caused major damage in Odisha, being the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the state since 1999. Though Fani also affected other states like West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, as well as neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, it was Odisha that bore its brunt. Fani, which formed on April 26 April 2019 and dissipated on May 5, claimed 89 lives in all. Odisha was praised by the United Nations for its handling of the crisis.4. Cyclone Bulbul: Another cyclone which affected both West Bengal and Bangladesh, Bulbul was a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm.

Vayu was the strongest cyclone to hit Gujarat’s Saurashtra region since 1998. It formed on June 10, 2019 and dissipated on June 17. Vayu, which was named by India after the Sanskrit and Hindi word ‘vayu’ or wind, impacted more than 6.6 million people in the northwestern parts of the country.6. Cyclone Maha: Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Maha mainly affected the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Kerala. Maha began as a depression, further intensifying to become Cyclonic Storm, Very Severe Cyclonic Storm and, finally, Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm. Formed on October 30, 2019, Maha dissipated on November 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nivar-heads-towards-south-coast-list-of-major-cyclones-in-india-since-2019/story-xuP9iVNniTmXcZLZ6OzVnK.html

23-11-2020||India||Dissent in Congress: From Adhir Chowdhury to Ghulam Nabi Azad, who said what||In the aftermath of Bihar election in which the Congress fielded candidates in 70 seats as part of Mahagathbandhan with the RJD and a few left parties and managed to win only 19, several Congress leaders have spoken for the need of reforms in the party. This has created a clear division inside the party. Here is who said what:Kapil SibalThe rumblings inside the party started with veteran leader Kapil Sibal calling for introspection inside the party. In an interview, he pitched for democratic process inside the party. “There has been no dialogue and there seems to be no effort for a dialogue by the leadership. We are yet to hear on recent polls... Maybe Congress leadership thinks it should be business as usual,” he said.Karti ChidambaramSupporting Sibal’s call, Karti Chidambaram said, “It’s time we introspect, ideate, consult and act.”Ashok Gehlot“There was no need for Mr Kapil Sibal to mention our internal issue in media, this has hurt the sentiments of party workers across the country. We have improved with each and every crisis and also formed UPA government in 2004 under the able leadership of Soniaji, we shall overcome this time too.But each time rank and file of the Congress Party has shown undivided and firm belief in the party leadership and that is why we came out of it stronger and united after every crisis. Even today, Congress is the only party which can keep this nation united and take it forward on the path of comprehensive development,” Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said.Salman KhurshidIn a long Facebook post, veteran leader Salman Khurshid questioned those who are doubting the party today. “When we do well, admittedly somewhat infrequently they take it for granted. But when we underperform, not even do badly, they are quick to bite their nails. By the looks of it there would be little of the nails left for future disappointments. Is it really a case of bad workmen quarrelling with their tools? If the mood of the electorate is resistant to the liberal values we have espoused and cherished we should be prepared for a long struggle rather than look for short cuts to get back into power. If we are explicitly or implicitly willing to compromise with our principles to regain power we might as well pack up our bags. It is another matter that consolidation of our principled politics, like any cause, requires periodic re-appraisal and re-writing of strategy and logistics,” Khurshid said.Mallikarjun Kharge“If we weaken the party and our leaders in such a way, definitely the party cannot go forward and ultimately if our ideology is weakened we will be destroyed. You will have to keep this in mind,” Mallikarjun Kharge said.Adhir Ranjan ChowdhuryCongress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said only speaking for introspection while doing nothing will not help. “Kapil Sibal could have raised the issues inside a party forum instead of making such embarrassing remarks in public. Those who are unhappy with the functioning of the party have the freedom to form a new party or join one if they feel that the Congress is not the right place for them. He seems to be very concerned about the Congress and its need for introspection. Earlier also he had spoken about it in public. But he was not seen campaigning for the party in the elections in Bihar or other states that went to polls last year.Instead of giving sermons sitting in AC rooms, he should work on the ground. Lecturing others without doing anything won’t help. Only calling for introspection without doing anything on our own is of no use,” he said.Ghulam Nabi Azad“Our party’s structure has collapsed. We need to rebuild our structure and then if any leader is elected in that structure, it will work. But saying that just by changing the leader, we’ll win Bihar, UP, Madhya Pradesh etc is wrong. That will happen once we change the system,” Azad said.The discourse started with RJD leader Sivanand Tiwari raising questions over Congress’s role in Bihar election. “It contested 70 seats but did not hold even 70 rallies. Rahul Gandhi visited Bihar on three days and addressed two rallies a day. Priyanka Gandhi was not seen at all. When electioneering was at its peak, he was picnicking with Priyanka Gandhi in Shimla,” Tiwari had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dissent-in-congress-from-adhir-chowdhury-to-ghulam-nabi-azad-who-said-what/story-HLngnYbL5gYX2clTp0f6cM.html

23-11-2020||India||Bharti Singh, husband Harsh’s bail hearing likely to be delayed||A Mumbai court is likely to hear the bail pleas of comedian Bharti Singh and her husband Harsh Limbachiya on Monday — a day after the duo were sent to judicial custody till December 4 in a drug-related cases. However, it may get postponed as the Narcotics Control Bureau will also file its replies on the bail pleas. “As I am busy with other cases today, we will request for some other date of argument,” Special public prosecutor Atul Sarpande said to ANI.Bharti Singh was arrested on Saturday after the Narcotics Control Bureau recovered 86.5 gm of ganja from Bharti and Harsh’s Andheri House. Up to 1,000 gm of ganja is considered small quantity, for the possession of which one can be jailed for up to six months and/or a fine of Rs 10,000 can be imposed. ALSO WATCH | Bharti Singh, husband sent to judicial custody; Nawab Malik’s question to NCB NCB has said both Bharti and Harsh have admitted to have consumed ganja. After Harsh was arrested on Sunday, the couple was produced before a magistrates court on Sunday which remanded them to judicial custody. Soon after the court order, the couple filed bail pleas through advocate Ayaz Khan. In their bail pleas, Singh and Limbachiya sought to be released saying they do not have any criminal antecedents and hence there is no question of them absconding.During the hearing, the NCB sought Limbachiya’s custody for questioning but did not seek Singh’s custody and told the court that she may be sent to judicial custody. Their lawyer Khan argued that there is no question of custodial interrogation as the alleged substance recovered is lesser than the ‘small quantity’ as prescribed under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.The magistrate accepted the arguments and noted that custodial interrogation was not required and that the accused have already been questioned for a considerable time on Saturday. Singh and Limbachiya have been booked under sections 20(b)(ii)(A) (involves small quantity of drugs) and 8(c) (possession of drugs) and 27 (consumption of drugs) of the NDPS Act.Acting on a tip-off, the NCB on Saturday conducted search at Singh’s office and residence after a drug peddler gave out Singh’s name. This is part of NCB’s ongoing probe into the alleged drug use in Bollywood — an issue that came to the fore following the death of Sushant Singh Rajput on June 14. Bharti Singh has appeared in a number of comedy and reality shows on TV and also hosted a few such shows. Harsh is a screenwriter and a lyricist.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-criminal-antecedents-court-to-hear-bail-pleas-of-bharti-singh-harsh-today/story-F2V8jcnoszUJrFylpdnMNK.html

Meanwhile, the total number of people who have contracted the disease globally is at 58.9 million, while nearly 1.4 million have lost their lives due to it, as per a worldometers tally.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn the latest update for a coronavirus vaccine, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Sunday expressed confidence that Bharat Biotech International Limited’s vaccine candidate, Covaxin, could complete its trials in a “month or two.” A top official in the United States, meanwhile, said the US might begin vaccinations in December, in what is the world’s worst-hit nation.ALSO WATCH | ‘When vaccine is around the corner...’: Warning on ‘Covid fatigue’ #HTLS2020 Here are the latest updates on the Covid-19 vaccine front:1. Dr Harsh Vardhan on Sunday reiterated the government plans to immunise 200 million to 250 million citizens by next July. “We are in the process of developing our indigenous vaccines, in the process of completing our third-phase trials in the next one or two months,” the minister said on Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, which started its third-phase trials last week. Covaxin is among five vaccine candidates undergoing trials in India and the only indigenous candidate among them. Bharat Biotech has partnered with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to develop the candidate.Also Read | Local Covid-19 vaccine final trials could end within two months, says Harsh Vardhan2. In the United States, Moncef Slaoui, head of the US government’s virus vaccine effort, said the country might begin its vaccination programme by December 11-12. Speaking to CNN, Slaoui said the plan is to be “able to ship vaccines to immunisation sites within 24 hours of approval” by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 20 million people across the US could be vaccinated next month, with a further 30 million per month after that, Slaoui further estimated. 3. Pfizer may have applied for emergency use authorisation (EUA) of its vaccine candidate in the United States but it is the United Kingdom which could give regulatory approval before the US does, the Telegraph has reported. While EUA in the US is expected to be given in December, the UK could give its approval this week, the report said. Pfizer has developed its vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, in partnership with Germany’s BioNTech SE.4. The official Twitter account of Russia’s vaccine candidate Sputnik V on Sunday said the price per dose of the vaccine would be “much lower” than that of vaccines of American firms Moderna and Pfizer. “Translating pharma lingo: the announced price of Pfizer of USD 19.50 and Moderna of USD 25-USD 37 per dose actually means their price of USD 39 and USD 50-USD 74 per person. Two doses are required per person for the Pfizer, Sputnik V and Moderna vaccines.

Ahead of the first session of the 17th Bihar assembly which begins Monday, sources said the cabinet expansion was imperative because the 14-member cabinet is overburdened with many of the senior ministers having been allotted five departments. Recently, the building construction minister Ashok Choudhary was given additional charge of education department after resignation of Mewalal Choudhary following protests by opposition RJD over alleged corruption charges. Other senior ministers like deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, Vijay Kumar Chaudhary and Bijendra Prasad Yadav are handling five to six departments while some ministers have been allotted two to three departments. “The cabinet expansion could take place after the house ends. The expansion could be any day after November 27 or in the first week of December,” said a senior leader in the NDA, on condition of anonymity. He said the expansion was necessary as ministers sworn in the cabinet after government formation on November 16 are overburdened with several departments. There are total 14 ministers in the cabinet now including the Chief Minister following the resignation of Mewalal Choudhary of the JD(U). Five ministers from the JD(U), seven from the BJP and one each from the VIP and HAM(S), smaller allies in the NDA in Bihar, were sworn in on November 16.Sources said 17-18 new ministers could be inducted in case of likely expansion of cabinet with BJP getting higher share of 10 ministers while the JD(U) could get seven new faces while the VIP and HAM(S) may not get ministerial berths in the expansion and could be accommodated later. Insiders in the NDA said a broad-based consensus has been reached among allies in the NDA on allotment of ministerial berths based on the formula of allotting two ministerial berths against seven seats to each party. That way, BJP with 74 hopes to get maximum 20 ministerial berths while JD(U) with 43 seats has a stake for 12 berths. “The BJP and JD(U) would have maximum 18 and 12 ministers from their own quota. There will be complete balance with expansion to have imprint of the unity among the JD(U) and BJP and other smaller allies,” said a source in the NDA. Sources said the NDA could restrict the total cabinet size to 32 or 33 as against the permissible limit of having 36 ministers in the 243-member state assembly.State president of the BJP Sanjay Jaiswal could not be reached for comments while many senior JD(U) leaders remained tightlipped about the possible cabinet expansion. “If there is a cabinet expansion, it would not be very, very surprising. Besides, it is obvious BJP will have higher share of ministers than the JD(U) because of a larger number of MLAs,” said a senior JD(U) leader who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-may-expand-cabinet-after-first-session-of-assembly/story-PvpTWPiXndpquUnVL9ZPsM.html

Daimary, who resigned from the Rajya Sabha on Saturday, joined the saffron party along with BPF MLA Emmanuel Mushahary in a brief ceremony held at Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal’s residence. The event was attended by BJP state chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass and other party leaders. “Two senior leaders of BPF joining BJP ahead of the BTC polls is a significant development. I welcome both Daimary and Mushahary and it will boost our prospects of winning the BTC polls even further,” Sonowal said. The development, which comes ahead of next month’s election to the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) and assembly polls due in March-April next year, is likely to sharpen differences between BJP and BPF, which is a coalition partner in the BJP-led state government of which the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) is also a part. “People in BTC areas want planned all-round development and I believe BJP has that vision to implement it. We will soon reach out to people in BTC to convey BJP’s message,” Daimary said soon after joining the BJP. Elections to BTC, which was ruled by BPF was scheduled in April this year, but the entire BTAD was placed under Governor’s rule the same month as polls couldn’t be held due to the Covid-19 lockdown. Election to BTC will be held in two phases next month and a bitter campaign between both parties is underway to take control of the council which has a total of 40 seats. The BPF leadership been unhappy with BJP for placing BTC under Governor’s rule and differences between both ruling partners sharpened in recent months. BPF has 12 MLAs in the state assembly. On Friday, chief minister Sonowal, Dass and senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had met BJP national president JP Nadda in Delhi to discuss the party’s strategy for the assembly polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-senior-bpf-leaders-in-assam-join-bjp-ahead-of-next-year-s-assembly-polls/story-x89EFNBLhMYvivWKdfRwEK.html

As four vaccine candidates in India are in either the second or the third phase of clinical trials, vaccine distribution, emergency authorisation are also likely to be discussed with the states. The Prime Minister will hold two back-to-back meetings — one with the CMs or other representatives of the states which are reporting the highest number of Covid-19 cases at present. At a recently held meeting of the Niti Aayog, issues like emergency authorisation, advance procurement, pricing of vaccines have been discussed — a development that comes after Pfizer and Moderna have said they would seek emergency authorisation of their vaccines, which have proved around 95% efficacy in the trials.

23-11-2020||India||IIM director calls for conducting CAT exam in regional languages||Should the Common Admission Test (CAT), the basis for admission to top business schools including the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), be held in English alone or also in Hindi and other regional languages mentioned in Schedule VIII of the Constitution?The director of IIM-Rohtak, Prof Dheeraj Sharma, has raised the issue with IIM-Indore, the coordinator of CAT for 2020, by suggesting that the exam be held in Indian languages as well. CAT is currently conducted in just the English language.According to a person aware of the development who spoke on condition of anonymity, Prof Sharma has written a letter to IIM-Indore director, Prof Himanshu Rai, noting that one of the aims of the National Education Policy (NEP) is to promote learning in local languages.Sharma, in his letter, wrote that the IIMs could take the lead by allowing students who want to do so to pursue programmes in management in any of the Schedule VII language of their choice. Sharma urged Rai to take up the issue with the core committee that oversees the conduct of the test.When contacted, Sharma confirmed that he had written to IIM-Indore, “suggesting” that a lack of proficiency in English should not be a reason for a candidate to not pursue higher education in management .The issue should be looked into since it is also one of the key thrust areas of the NEP, he said.Significantly, the weightage given to the CAT exam score differs from IIM to IIM. Some IIMs provide upto 60-70 percentage weightage to the score and others attach much less weight to it. More than 200,000 students take CAT every year.Significantly, the IIM director’s letter comes at a time when the Union education ministry is looking at ways to promote higher education in Indian languages. Education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank has in various meetings and speeches emphasized the need to provide higher education in Indian languages.The languages included in Schedule VIII of the Indian Constitution are Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Maithili, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santhali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iim-director-calls-for-conducting-cat-exam-in-regional-languages/story-YtP9qGmfACfpAxp6mFNr6M.html
23-11-2020||India||India to host G20 summit in 2023||India will now host the Group of 20 Summit in 2023, a year later than what was decided earlier, the grouping leaders announced on Sunday.“We thank Saudi Arabia for hosting a successful Riyadh Summit and its contribution to the G20 process. We look forward to our next meetings in Italy in 2021, Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023 and Brazil in 2024,” said a declaration of G20 Riyadh Summit leaders, issued at the conclusion of the two-day conference of the world’s top 20 economies.Also Read | PM Modi calls for reform in multilateral organisations to ensure better global governance at G20Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other two dozens leaders, participated in the summit. Sources said that India looks forward to taking forward the G20 agenda in 2023 after the Italian and Indonesian presidencies.On India now hosting the summit in 2023 instead of 2022, a source said, “The order of rotating the presidency is decided among the member states on the basis of consultations and mutual convenience.”The focus of this year’s summit, which took place mostly virtually, was the Covid-19 pandemic.In the declaration, the leaders of the G20 vowed to address the vulnerabilities revealed by this crisis, take the necessary steps to recover stronger and work to ensure that future generations are safer than we have been.The leaders said they are taking immediate and exceptional measures to address the Covid-19 pandemic and its intertwined health, social and economic impacts.“We, the G20 leaders, meeting for the second time under the Saudi Presidency, stand united in our conviction that coordinated global action, solidarity, and multilateral cooperation are more necessary today than ever to overcome the current challenges and realise opportunities of the 21st century for all by empowering people, safeguarding the planet, and shaping new frontiers,” the declaration said.“We are committed to leading the world in shaping a strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive post-Covid-19 era,” they said in the declaration.The leaders also extend support to the Anti-money Laundering (AML)/Counter-terrorist Financing (CFT) policy responses detailed in the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) paper on the Covid-19.They reaffirmed their support for the FATF, as the global standard-setting body for preventing and combating money laundering, terrorist financing and proliferation financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-host-g20-summit-in-2023/story-DOPRlkWnCa7cCkOAPOGVTL.html
23-11-2020||India||Multilateralism need of the hour for sustainable recovery in post Covid-19 world: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 Summit on Sunday asserted that for an inclusive, resilient and sustainable recovery in a post-Covid world, effective global governance is required and reformed multilateralism is the need of the hour.At a G20 session, he also underscored the importance of the ‘2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals’ aimed at “leaving no one behind”.The prime minister said that India is following the same principle in the ‘Reform-Perform-Transform’ strategy to move forward and taking inclusive development efforts that are participative, according to a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) statement.With the changing situation in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, Modi said, India has adopted a ‘Self Reliant India’ initiative. Following this vision, based on its competence and dependability, India will become an important and reliable pillar of the world economy and global supply chains, he said.The prime minister also underscored that for an inclusive, resilient and sustainable recovery in a post-Covid world, effective global governance is required and reformed multilateralism through improvement in character, governance and processes of multilateral institutions is the need of the hour.The agenda of the second day of the G20 summit focused on a session on building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future.In a recorded message at a G-20 summit side event -- ‘Safeguarding the Planet: The Circular Carbon Economy Approach’, Modi said climate change must be fought not in silos but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way.He asserted that the entire world can progress faster if there is greater support of technology and finance to developing nations.Modi said India is not only meeting its Paris Agreement targets, but also exceeding them.“Inspired by our traditional ethos of living in harmony with the environment, and the commitment of my government, India has adopted low-carbon and climate-resilient development practices,” he said.The prime minister said for humanity to prosper, every single individual must prosper. “Rather than seeing labour as a factor of production alone, the focus must be on the human dignity of every worker,” Modi said.Such an approach would be the best guarantee for safeguarding the planet, he said.Modi said that in times of Covid-19 when everyone is focused on saving citizens and economies from the effects of the global pandemic, it is equally important to keep focus on fighting climate change.“Climate change must be fought not in silos but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way,” he said and highlighted that India is not only meeting its Paris Agreement targets, but also exceeding them.India is a signatory to the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris accord was adopted at the UN climate conference “COP 21” held in the French capital in 2015 with an aim to reduce hazardous greenhouse gas emissions.Underlining that India has taken concrete action in many areas, Modi said the country has made LED lights popular and noted that this saves 38 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emission per year.“Smoke free kitchens have been provided to over 80 million households through our Ujjwala Scheme. This is among the largest clean energy drives globally,” he said.“There are efforts to eliminate single-use plastics; our forest cover is expanding; the lion and tiger population is increasing; we aim to restore 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030; and we are encouraging a circular economy,” the prime minister said.India is making next-generation infrastructure such as metro networks, water-ways and more, Modi said, adding that in addition to convenience and efficiency, they will also contribute to a cleaner environment.“We will meet our goal of 175 gigawatts of renewable energy well before the target of 2022. Now, we are taking a big step ahead by seeking to achieve 450 gigawatts by 2030,” he said.Modi also pointed out that the International Solar Alliance (ISA) is among the fastest growing international organisations, with 88 signatories.With plans to mobilise billions of dollars, train thousands of stakeholders, and promote research and development in renewable energy, ISA will contribute to reducing carbon footprint, he said. Modi also cited the example of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), saying 18 countries, including nine from among the G20 and four international organisations, have already joined the coalition.The CDRI has started work on increasing resilience of critical infrastructure, he noted, and asserted that infra damage during natural disasters is a subject that has not got the attention it deserves.The poorer nations are specially impacted by this and therefore, this coalition is important, Modi added.Noting that this is the best time for further increasing research and innovation in new and sustainable technologies, Modi said it should be done with a spirit of cooperation and collaboration. The prime minister thanked Saudi Arabia for hosting a successful Riyadh Summit and welcomed Italy as it takes over the G20 presidency in 2021, the MEA statement said. It was decided that the G20 presidency will be held by Indonesia in 2022, India in 2023 and Brazil in 2024, the MEA said. At the end of the Summit, a G20 Leaders’ Declaration was issued which called for coordinated global action, solidarity, and multilateral cooperation to overcome the current challenges and realise opportunities of the 21st century for all by empowering people, safeguarding the planet, and shaping new frontiers.

23-11-2020||India||Modi launches Rs 5.5k-crore water supply scheme in UP||Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Rs 5,555 crore Har Ghar Nal Yojana (piped water in every home initiative) for Sonbhadra and Mirzapur in the Vindhya region of Uttar Pradesh through a video conference on Sunday.The scheme is aimed at providing piped water supply to over 4.1 million people in the two districts. The prime minister said piped water supply to about 3,000 villages will transform the lives of local residents.The PM also praised chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his team for staying on the path of economic development despite the challenges posed by the global coronavirus disease pandemic.“Earlier, people used to have a perception about UP. But the way UP has launched one developmental project after another is completely changing the image of Uttar Pradesh, the state government and its employees,” he said. While tackling the Covid-19 challenge, the state government had taken care of migrant workers who returned to Uttar Pradesh from the cities and made arrangements for their employment, he said. The UP government did not let the Covid-19 pandemic slow the pace of development, he observed.The prime minister also praised the state government for successfully handling an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis, a viral disease, in eastern Uttar Pradesh.“The way in which the number of cases of Japanese encephalitis decreased in Uttar Pradesh due to efforts by the state government led by chief minister Yogi Adityanath is discussed far and wide. Even experts talk about it,” he said and added that every resident of Uttar Pradesh would “have been giving their blessings to Yogiji and his team for saving the lives of innocent children”. The prime minister made a veiled allegation about previous governments ignoring villages and tribal areas. He said villages, villagers, tribals and tribal areas were not given as much priority as his government was giving to them to develop city-like facilities, including liquified petroleum gas (LPG connections), there. “Despite having many natural resources and enjoying blessings of rivers like Son, Belan, Karmanash, Van Ganga, Kshipra, the Vindhya region faced neglect for decades since independence... the region was identified by drought. Be it Vindhya region on Bundelkhand, the whole region became one of dearth and scarcity. As a result, several people had to migrate from here,” PM said.“But during the last few years, continuous efforts were made by the government to ensure clean tap water to every house and develop irrigation facilities in the region. As a result, last year, a big water project was started in Budelkhand region and today, the scheme worth Rs 5,555 crore has been launched in the Vindhya region to ensure supply of clean water through pipes to every house,” he added. He said piped water supply would make the “life of our mothers and sisters easier in the villages”. It would also reduce the incidence of many diseases like cholera, typhoid and encephalitis caused by dirty water, he added. The PM said that 1,250 van dhan kendras (forest wealth centres) had been set up in tribal areas, adding that a district mineral fund had been created for development of tribal areas.The idea was that a large chunk of the funds generated from tribal areas should be spent on their development, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-launches-rs-5-5k-crore-water-supply-scheme-in-up/story-3qZZkpHixdLTi2XZrv67KL.html

Addressing mediapersons, BJP general secretary Arun Singh said that Nadda will begin his visit in the first week of December and Uttarakhand will be the first state on his itinerary. Singh said the BJP president will visit every state, hold virtual meetings with heads of all booth units, the smallest organisational entity in the party, and meet every MP and MLA of the organisation besides its senior leaders, including district chiefs, in each state. During the tour, he will also strategise with party leaders for strengthening the organisation in Lok Sabha seats and regions where the BJP did not win in the 2019 polls, he said.With assembly polls in four states, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Assam, set to be held in the first half of the next year, he will also review the party’s preparedness for the elections, Singh said.Nadda will spend three days in big states and two in others.The BJP-ruled states will give presentation to Nadda on various aspects of their work, including implementation of the central government schemes and on to how to further raise awareness about them. He will also meet BJP’s allies and hold public programmes and press conferences as well, Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eye-on-2024-polls-nadda-to-go-on-120-day-nationwide-tour-from-december/story-tLWUFEY5vs0HV1zFTykkRM.html
23-11-2020||India||Railways inspects tracks in Punjab as services set to resume today||Railway officials began inspection of railway tracks in Punjab on Sunday after farmer’s groups agreed to suspend their rail roko protests against the Centre’s new farm laws. According to officials familiar with the matter, freight trains are likely to be given priority with operations restarting on Monday night. Passenger trains will likely start from Tuesday, the officials said.Ambala divisional railway manager (DRM) GM Singh said the railway board will release a detailed train schedule on Monday. “After nearly two-month-long train blockade in Punjab, a safety audit of tracks started today (Sunday) by a joint team of the government railway police of Punjab government, railway protection force and technical teams. They are examining to ensure tracks have no damage. Light engines are also put on tracks to gauge the strength of rail lines in the state,” said Singh.The Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee had started its railway blockade on September 24 to oppose the central farm laws with several farmer unions later extending their support to the agitation.Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said about 2,300 passenger trains were cancelled or diverted amid the protest.On Saturday, chief minister Amarinder Singh had announced that leaders of 31 farmers unions had unanimously decided to suspend the blockade.According to Ferozepur DRM Rajesh Agarwal, railway department officials have started issuing security clearance reports for resumption of services. “These reports contain inspection details confirming that no protesters are sitting in the vicinity of the tracks, on station premises or near the railway property across the state. Once the necessary safety and security protocols are completed, the railways may restore services in less than 24 hours,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-inspects-tracks-in-punjab-as-services-set-to-resume-today/story-Hmn78jWipHtHq4oicyWKXP.html
23-11-2020||India||GST registration may be linked to biometrics||New Goods and Services Tax (GST) registrations may not be instant for those who do not possess an Aadhaar identity number. An empowered panel is considering linking GST registration to biometric details with a live photograph of applicants in an attempt to check GST fraud, two officials said.The law committee of the GST Council has suggested that new or fresh GST applicants follow an Aadhaar-like process under which new registrations can be done online with a live photo, use of biometrics and verification of documents, the officials with direct knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity.“Such facilities [registration with biometric details] can be provided at banks, post offices, and GST Seva Kendras (GSKs) just like Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) or Aadhaar Seva Kendras (ASKs). The GSKs can work on the pattern of Passport Seva Kendras to provide new registration facilities with required checks on fake registration,” one of the officials said.This process is under consideration to check GST-related fraud, the second official said. “Annually, 18-19 lakh new GST registrations take place, but at the end of the year only 30% of them are left. About 13-14 lakh GST-registered entities vanish. Most of them are fly-by-night operators, they create bogus firms, claim input tax credit (ITC) without actually supplying goods and services,” he said.The committee held a two-day meeting at a time when the government has launched a nationwide crackdown against GST fraud and has so far arrested 48 people, including one woman and three chartered accountants (CAs). It has booked 648 cases besides identifying 2,385 bogus entities in just 10 days.Alarmed over rampant misuse of the liberal GST registration rules that made fake invoice generation a business for unscrupulous elements, the law committee has felt the urgent need to modify existing GST registration rules. Currently, GST registration is almost instant as there is a provision of deemed registration to avoid any bureaucratic delays, the officials said.“The new system is proposed for honouring the honest, who will not face any difficulty in registration with Aadhaar numbers. It will be difficult only for those who want to con the system,” the second official said.The law committee has proposed two-pronged measures -- tackle the menace of fake invoices and also ensure “ease of doing business” for the honest -- liberal registration, easy refunds and self-compliance with little checks, he said.The panel has also suggested that these measures be discussed with states and other stakeholders before they are implemented, officials said.“A fresh registrant must go for compulsory physical verification and personal identification in case he or she opts for non-Aadhaar authentication based registration process and do not have income-tax return supported adequate financial capability. In such a case, the applicant may have to submit recommendation letter by two taxpayers of adequate reliability,” he added.On the basis of documents, a “trustworthy” applicant could be given registration within seven working days. If an applicant is not deemed “trustworthy,” conditional registration should be given within 60 working days only after physical verification of the place of business. In such cases, input tax credit to their buyers shall be allowed only after filing of their returns, the officials said. It is also proposed to take some cash deposits against their tax dues from such dealers instead of allowing settlement of 100% tax liabilities through input tax credit, they added.The committee is of the view that to be categorised as trustworthy, a registrant or dealer must have good income-tax credentials, no previous cancellation of GST registration on same permanent account number (PAN) for any violation of law, and would need to undergo Aadhaar authentication, as is required in the case of an individual, proprietorship and partners, officials said.An applicant can get waivers from some of the conditions by submitting relevant documents, the first official said. “A jurisdictional officer, satisfied with the credentials verification, would waive some or all the restriction. Also, certain class of applicant (who appear riskier) shall be required to undergo in-person for verification at GSKs,” he added.In the Law Committee’s opinion, once a dealer is suspended, he has to explain the discrepancy within a prescribed time limit for revocation of suspension, he said.Archit Gupta, founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of the financial technology platform ClearTax, said: “The government has been taking several measures to curb fraud in ITC claims for GST. Several measures have been implemented; auto-population of GST return forms have been introduced. With e-invoicing, gaps in invoicing and corresponding ITC claims can be further reduced. With the introduction of Aadhaar-like biometric registration, the government is now tightening controls on registrants at the very first point of contact.”“However, Aadhaar based e-KYC is already required for GST registration. Therefore introducing live photos and live biometrics may become another hurdle for genuine businesses. Especially during Covid times, it may be impractical to implement. This will be an added layer to all the currently required authentications through Aadhaar linked to OTP {one-time password},” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-registration-may-be-linked-to-biometrics/story-z8fHot2NSZ19JVBezIs1hO.html
23-11-2020||India||India must draft long-term plan for disposal of microplastics||Five samples of Mr Everest snow were investigated for micro-plastics by the University of Plymouth. All five samples of snow contained microplastics. Think of it yourself. Recently, several tons of trash was removed from the world’s highest peak. But the microplastics might be more than that : it is possible, believe researchers, that the plastics came from gear and outdoor clothing.First of all, this is terrible news by itself. People have left no spot safe from plastics-the pollution is universal. Second, it is possible, although not entirely confirmed, that microplastics could accelerate the snow melt. Of course, we all know how terrible it is when microplastics embed themselves in eco-system, because they emit both toxics and can disrupt the metabolism of even lower order animals.For India, the lessons are clear. Although data is always welcome, we don’t have to wait for it. Tourism-dependant regions must address plastic trash. I’ve never been a votary of clean up drives without a back-up plan for long term prevention, but this study pushes me to think that a one-time clean up with adequate disposal might help prevent microplastics. Prevention must be locally designed for impact. From local cess from tourists for plastic handling, to implementing collection systems, to invoking the Extended Producer Responsibility clauses from Indian rules, tourism rich states must make time bound plans. India should join other tourism dependant nations to ask that branded outdoor gear be redesigned to prevent fibre shedding. This is where states should turn their focus, instead of endless, futile bans on plastic bags.(The writer is Founder and Director, Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-real-stuff-bans-are-lazy/story-R1UziFfq4KFjUAsca9bqpO.html
23-11-2020||India||Congress rumblings grow, Ghulam Nabi Azad for internal polls||Days after the Congress managed to win just 19 seats, the lowest tally among the top four parties in the Bihar assembly polls, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad on Sunday said elections were not won by adopting a “five-star culture and party office-bearers should be elected”. Azad, one of the 23 leaders who signed a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in August demanding major changes in the party’s functioning, also said the “general impression (is) that there is no president of the party.”“Both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi said that party elections should be held in October. But we said that the election should be held after six months due to Covid-19,” he added.The party contested the Bihar elections, which were won by a coalition of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), as part of an alliance led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal and comprising the Left parties. Of the 70 seats it contested, it managed to win just 19. Azad claimed he didn’t blame Sonia or Rahul Gandh for the setback. But his criticism of the selection process of office bearers, according to some party insiders, is a veiled protest against the current system. Senior leader and former foreign minister Salman Khurshid hit back at Azad, rejected any perception of a leadership crisis in the Congress and said all-round support for Sonia and Rahul Gandhi is “apparent to anyone who is not blind”. Khurshid said public statements by Congress leaders critical of it hurt the party, in an oblique reference to recent statements by Kapil Sibal and others. Asked about comments by Sibal and another senior leader, P Chidambaram, on the Congress’s poor showing in the Bihar election and recent by-polls, he said he cannot disagree with what they have said, but asked why anyone has to go out and tell the media and the world that “we need to do this”. “Analysis is done all the time, there is no quarrel about analysis. It will be done. The leadership, of which all these people are a part, will appropriately look at what may have gone wrong, how we could have improved, and that will happen in the normal course, we needn’t talk about it in the public,” said Khurshid, a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC), he party’s highest decision-making body. In an exclusive interview with ANI, Azad said: “Office bearers should understand their responsibility. Till the time office bearers are appointed, they won’t go to the grassroots. But if all office bearers are elected, then they will understand their responsibility. Right now, anyone gets any post in the party. Our people have lost the connection with the grassroots.” He also said: “Polls aren’t won by five-star culture. Problem with leaders today is if they get a party ticket, they first book a five-star hotel. They won’t go if there’s a rough road. Till the time 5-star culture is given up, one can’t win elections.” Azad on Sunday also supported Chidambaram and Sibal’s opinion about the need for “retrospection” in the party. He said it was “not wrong but it also does not mean changing the top leadership”. He maintained that the “medicine for the party” was to conduct organizational elections at different levels. “Retrospection means there should be a discussion on why we lost in Bihar, why we won few seats in Madhya Pradesh. And after a discussion on these, how to apply the conclusion we get from the discussion on these issues-- this is what we have to do,” Azad said. Sibal, critical of the current state of functioning in the Congress, said people in Bihar did not consider Congress to be an effective alternative, adding that the time for “introspection” was over. Chidambaram too, expressed concern over the poll results, and asked for a comprehensive review on why the RJD-Congress-Left alliance lost despite being so close to victory. “We all are worried about losses, especially about Bihar and by-poll results. I don’t blame the leadership of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi. Office-bearers should understand that their responsibility begins with their appointment. They should love the party. I quote a couplet: ‘Ye ishq nahi aasaan, bas itna samajh lije. Ik aag ka darya hai aur doob ke jaana hai,’”, Azad said.“Love should be for one’s party, profession and country,” Azad added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-rumblings-grow-ghulam-nabi-azad-for-internal-polls/story-300W3Ac5oQafFRBoXweXdL.html
23-11-2020||India||Test frequency, not accuracy, may be key to controlling outbreak: Study||Repeated, widespread testing with quick results is more effective in controlling an outbreak than using a more accurate test, according to two research papers published recently that draw on a crucial way the Sars-Cov-2 behaves: people are most infectious in the first week of their illness, when the viral load in their upper respiratory tract is at its highest.The findings hold significance for a city like Delhi where the proportion of tests turning positive has consistently been higher than the acceptable limit of 8% for weeks now, and officials are at present working on a strategy on how best to increase tests while maintaining a balance between the more reliable but slow RT-PCR test and the quick but low-sensitivity rapid antigen tests. “At least for viruses with infection kinetics similar to SARS-CoV-2, we find that speed of reporting is much more important than sensitivity, although more sensitive tests are nevertheless somewhat more effective,” said the study that included researchers from University of Colorado and Harvard University. Also Read | Centre to rush more expert teams for Covid management; sending teams to Himachal, UP and PunjabThe researchers make a distinction on the need to test more people when they are contagious versus those who may merely be infected. Using computational modeling of how viral load and infectiousness evolves, they determined infectiousness increased once viral load exceeded 10^6 viral copies of RNA per ml (cp/ml). RT-PCR method, they added, could detect 10^3 cp/ml in viral load while rapid antigen and LAMP tests detected concentration 10^5 cp/ml.Using testing as a strategy to reopen cities “has placed a microscope on the analytical sensitivity of virus assays, with a gold-standard of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)”. But these, the report added, “remain expensive and as a laboratory-based assay often have sample-to-result times of 24-48 hours”.These findings, published in Science Advances, tied in with another recent study published in The Lancet. In this, the authors analysed all scientific literature on Covid-19 till June, 2020 and found patients had the highest viral load in the first week. “SARS-CoV-2 titres in the upper respiratory tract peak in the first week of illness. Early case finding and isolation, and public education on the spectrum of illness and period of infectiousness are key to the effective containment of SARS-CoV-2,” said the team of researchers led by Muge Cevik, an infectious disease specialist at the University of St Andrews, Scotland and an advisor to the UK government. No study detected live virus beyond day 9 of illness, the study said, despite persistently high viral loads that were inferred from cycle threshold values in RT-PCR tests. Cycle threshold values indicate the number of times a sample was amplified before it was detected as positive for the virus.The Science Advances study too referred to this report. It added that detecting infectious people is crucial, particularly since asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people are often aware of their infection and pass it on. “These results demonstrate that effective screening depends largely on frequency of testing and the speed of reporting, and is only marginally improved by high test sensitivity. We therefore conclude that screening should prioritize accessibility, frequency, and sample-to-answer time; analytical limits of detection should be secondary,” they said.Experts in India agreed that testing and timely reporting is a challenge. Anecdotal feedback suggests RT-PCR tests can take up to two days in a city like Delhi. “RT-PCR tests miss 30% of infections while rapid antigen tests miss 50%. You can bring these numbers down to 5-10% by doing repeat tests but that has not been possible here,” said Dr T Jacob John, the former head of virology at Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore. He added that Delhi in particular faced a unique challenge because of a large population that travels to and from its satellite cities every day. “The infection risk has anyway increased because behavioural fatigue has meant that people are no longer disciplined in wearing masks or maintaining distance,” he added.The rollout of the Feluda test, Dr John added, could address the problem of delayed results as well as low test sensitivity. “The test can return answers in one hour. I think the administration is already in talks for an immediate rollout,” he added.The Feluda test, commercially named TataMD Check, uses a protein from a gene-editing tool known as Crispr. The test has shown high sensitivity and specificity, the two markers that indicate a diagnostic tool’s ability to detect true positives and true negatives.For now, a temporary answer may lie in removing RT-PCR test-result bottlenecks and even ramping up the rapid antigen tests, the Science Advances study suggested after citing simulations. “Testing frequency was found to be the primary driver of population-level epidemic control, with only a small margin of improvement provided by using a more sensitive test,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/test-frequency-not-accuracy-may-be-key-to-controlling-outbreak-study/story-88HdKvlF5SDhiyPK1Z3oEJ.html

The 27th edition of the India-Singapore Bilateral Maritime Exercise (SIMBEX-20) will be held from November 23 to 25. The drills come on the heels of the Malabar exercise involving the Quad navies and a trilateral exercise conducted by India, Singapore and Thailand. “The scope and complexity of these exercises has increased steadily over the past two decades to include advanced naval drills covering a wide spectrum of maritime operations,” navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said. The SIMBEX annual exercise was first held in 1994. Indian Navy assets taking part in the drills include destroyer INS Rana, corvettes INS Kamorta and INS Karmuk, submarine INS Sindhuraj and the P-8I maritime reconnaissance aircraft. Singapore will be represented by frigates Intrepid and Steadfast with integral S70B helicopters and landing ship tank Endeavour. The drills are being conducted as a non-contact, at sea only exercise in view of Covid-19 pandemic. Also Read | Malabar exercise that upsets China is a tectonic shift in power balance“SIMBEX-20 will witness the two friendly navies participate in advanced surface, anti-air warfare and anti-submarine warfare exercises including weapon firings over three days of intensive joint operations at sea,” Madhwal said, adding that the drills also highlight the commitment of the two navies to a rules-based international order. The Indian Navy has conducted a series of exercises with friendly navies in the Indian Ocean Region in recent weeks. India, Singapore and Thailand on Sunday wrapped up the 2nd edition of a trilateral naval exercise in the Andaman Sea. “Besides improving inter-operability between the friendly navies, the India, Singapore and Thailand Trilateral Maritime Exercise (SITMEX) series of exercises also aim to strengthen mutual confidence and develop common understanding and procedures towards enhancing the overall maritime security in the region,” Madhwal said. The navies of India, United States, Japan and Australia concluded the Malabar exercise in the northern Arabian Sea on November 20. The drills were conducted at a time when China is closely tracking the activities of the Quad countries and seeking to increase its footprint in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). The Malabar naval drills were conducted in two phases: the first phase in the Bay of Bengal from November 3 to 6; the second phase was held in the Arabian Sea from November 17 to 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-singapore-to-kick-off-naval-drills-in-andaman-sea-today/story-ZB8j9XjoEBEuLOqunNopTI.html
23-11-2020||India||Centre to rush more expert teams for Covid management; sending teams to Himachal, UP and Punjab||A week after sending high-level teams to five states to handhold them in containing the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) , the Centre is set to dispatch experts to three other states to review public health measures there and assist local authorities in managing the pandemic. The three-member expert teams are being sent to Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, and expected to submit a detailed report on the outbreak in these states. Alarmed by a surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, meanwhile, has begun random testing of people travelling to the state from the National Capital Region, chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari said. Also Read | Local Covid-19 vaccine final trials could end within two months, says Harsh VardhanThe moves come in the backdrop of 6,746 fresh cases in Delhi on Sunday along with 121 deaths. The positivity rate in the Capital remained high at 12.29%.“The Union government has decided to depute high-level Central teams to Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh to support the States in COVID response and management. These States have been either reporting a rise in the number of active cases i.e. those who are hospitalized or are in home isolation under medical supervision, or demonstrating a rise in the daily new cases,” the Union health ministry said in a statement.Each team consists of an official from a ministry, and two doctors including a respiratory medicine specialist and a specialist from community medicine department.Separately, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to hold a virtual meetings with chief ministers and other representatives of states and union territories on Tuesday to review the Covid-19 situation and discuss a vaccine distribution strategy when one becomes available.Also Read | ICMR increases RT-PCR testing capacity on Amit Shah’s directionsModi is expected to hold two back-to-back meetings, one with eight states with high caseloads and another with states and UTs to discuss a vaccine distribution strategy, people familiar with the development said.“The teams will meet additional chief secretary/principal secretary (health) of respective states to de-brief and are also requested to submit a report of their observations to respective states…,” reads an official document sent out by the public health division of the Union health ministry. A copy of the document has been seen by HT. The nodal officer for the team being sent to Punjab is Vijay Kumar Singh, additional secretary, ministry of textiles. The pulmonary medicine specialist is Dr AN Aggarwal from the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh. Dr PVN Luxmi from the same hospital is the community medicine specialist . Former director general of health services, Union health ministry, Dr Rajiv Garg will be heading the team being sent to Himachal Pradesh. The other two members include Dr NK Gupta, department of respiratory medicine, Safdarjung Hospital, and Professor B Dhiman, director, community medicine, Lady Hardinge Medical College. The team being sent to Uttar Pradesh is headed by Mritunjay Kumar Narayan, joint secretary, ministry of power. The other two members are Dr AK Singh, department of TB & Chest Diseases, Lady Hardinge Medical College, and Dr SK Jain, additional director, community medicine, National Centre for Disease Control. These teams will be visiting the districts reporting a high number of Covid-19 cases and support the states’ efforts towards strengthening containment, surveillance, testing, infection prevention and control measures. The experts will also help in efficient clinical management of the positive cases, and shall guide the states in effectively managing the challenges related to timely diagnosis and follow-up action on cases so that more lives are saved and the chain of transmission is successfully halted. India’s current active caseload (440,962), which is the country’s actual disease burden, has declined to 4.85% of the total positive cases, and has been sustained below the 5% mark. The recovery rate has improved to 93.69% as on Sunday, and the total number of recoveries has jumped to 8,521,617. According to the government data, 26 states and union territories currently have less than 20,000 active cases. Seven states have between 20,000 and 50,000 active cases; Maharashtra and Kerala are reporting at least around 50,000 cases. “Overall the situation may not be that bad but at certain places a combination of cold weather, pollution, and festivities, weddings or other family functions is increasing the risk of infection. People need to be extra careful as the virus is very much in circulation so wearing a mask, physical distancing and not crowding is key to prevent contracting the disease,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.In Uttar Pradesh, health authorities have started random testing of people travelling to the state from the NCR centred on the national capital and adjoining satellite towns, the state chief secretary said. “We have started testing on a random basis people reaching UP by buses, trains, flights or personal vehicles from Delhi and other NCR districts in view of a fresh surge in the coronavirus cases in Delhi,” Tiwari told HT in Lucknow on Sunday. He said officials had been asked to set up Covid-19 desks at all important railway stations and bus stations. He, however, said there were no plans, as of now, to put curbs on travel or impose other restrictions. “But certainly, people have to be even more vigilant and strictly follow the rules related to social distancing and wearing of face masks considering the fact that the pandemic has again become a serious challenge in several states including neighbouring Delhi,” he stressed. At a Covid-19 meeting in Lucknow on Saturday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath asked officials to step up the state of alert across the state against the backdrop of a fresh wave of Covid-19 cases in neighbouring states, especially Delhi and think two steps ahead to win the battle against pandemic. According to Tiwari, although personal protective equipment (PPE) kits do act as a wall against the spread of the coronavirus disease, they undermine the level of trust Covid-19 patients have in their treatment because they are not able to see the faces of doctors and health workers examining them. “Health personnel including doctors who visit Covid wards to examine patients are all covered from head to toe under the PPE kits. Patients do not know as to who is examining and treating them— doctors or compounders/nurses,” he said. “This is why we are regularly telling chief medical officers and other senior officers to ensure that all doctors, nurses etc who walk up to patients in the Covid wards must also wear plates on their PPE kits, clearly showing their name and designation,” he said. “By reading the name and designation of the treating doctors, the patient will know which doctor is attending to him and this will infuse a lot of confidence and hope in him making his recovery even faster,” Tiwari pointed out. The chief secretary cautioned that the World Health Organisation’s praise of Uttar Pradesh for its improved Covid-19 management should not create a sense of complacence. The situation may have improved in India’s most populous state, but the government cannot allow anyone to lower their guard at this juncture. He said the government’s current focus is on minimising the number of Covid-19 fatalities in the state through a detailed analysis of deaths that had already taken place and try and save as many lives as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-rush-more-expert-teams-for-covid-management-sending-teams-to-himachal-up-and-punjab/story-D4buFEe21QLzUuZpY47dEN.html
23-11-2020||India||Is the Gupkar alliance driven by political arithmetic or chemistry?||The union territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir will have its first direct elections, the District Development Council (DDC) polls, in eight phases starting on November 28. Local body elections in Ladakh, the other union territory which came into existence after the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir were held in October.After the union government’s decision to revoke the erstwhile state’s special status in August 2019, politics has undergone a fundamental shift in the region, especially the Kashmir valley. A large number of commentators see the downgrading of the state’s constitutional status as a snub to the mainstream political parties, which unlike separatists advocated engagement with India’s constitutional apparatus. Most important Kashmiri political leaders were arrested ahead of the centre’s decision. They were released gradually, with former chief minister Mahbooba Mufti becoming last month the last important politician to be freed from detention. After being released and just before the DDC polls, leaders of seven political parties in Jammu and Kashmir have announced formation of an alliance called the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), a joint resolution issued by major mainstream political parties of Jammu and Kashmir on August 4, 2019, against the nullification or modification of the state’s special constitutional position. They also announced that they will contest the upcoming DDC polls together. What explains the decision of the erstwhile adversaries to come together? An HT analysis shows that both political arithmetic and chemistry could be behind the move.Showcase unity to ensure voter turnoutThere is reason to believe that the centre’s decision to effectively nullify Article 370 has led to widespread resentment in the Kashmir valley. Voter turnout in the DDC polls will be the first litmus test of the magnitude of this resentment. Voter turnout had fallen sharply in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and in by-polls held before that in the Kashmir valley. The erstwhile state had been engulfed in yet another spell of political turmoil since protests erupted after the killing of militant Burhan Wani by the security forces in 2016. By burying their earlier differences and making the restoration of status quo ante their main demand, the PAGD constituents might be trying to channelize this simmering discontent towards a democratic mandate to champion their demand and reaffirm their political legitimacy. But will it make a difference to election results?The parties in the PAGD, put together, have won a majority of seats in all assembly elections held in Jammu and Kashmir since 1996, when the electoral process resumed after a gap of nearly a decade after armed insurgency erupted in the region. The new alliance was stronger even in the Lok Sabha polls. An analysis of the last five Lok Sabha elections shows that these parties put together had a lead in a majority of assembly segments in all these elections, except in 2019. This suggests that pure political arithmetic might not have been the main reason behind the formation of this alliance. Can the PAGD hurt the BJP in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir?Simple arithmetic suggests that the PAGD might not make a big dent in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) performance. The reason for this is that the BJP’s electoral stakes are concentrated in the Jammu region of the UT, where Hindus have a significant share of the population. This is especially true in the four Hindu-majority districts of Jammu, Udhampur, Samba and Kathua. Eighteen of the 25 assembly constituencies (ACs) the BJP won in the 2014 assembly polls came from these four districts. In 12 of these ACs, the BJP’s vote share was more than 50%, which would make any kind of opposition alliance irrelevant there. This factor makes BJP a strong party in select parts of Jammu while the Congress and the newly formed alliance are strong in most of the Kashmir region and a significant part of the Jammu region.  Is the PAGD a pre-emptive strike to neutralise the delimitation effect?The ongoing process of delimitation of constituency boundaries in Jammu and Kashmir, which will also increase the number of ACs from 83 to 90, could change electoral equations in the state. Several ACs have sub-regions dominated by different religious communities. If there were to be a calculated redrawing of boundaries, for example one that increases the share of Hindu population in some Muslim-dominated ACs, then the political arithmetic can change. The case of two adjacent ACs of Jammu district – Ranbir Singh Pura and Bishnah – is one such example. The BJP won Ranbir Singh Pura in 2014 by a margin of 22% votes while it lost Bishnah by a margin of just 4% votes. The booth level result shows us that the BJP had pockets of very strong support in both of these constituencies while there were also booths where the support was very weak. A careful redrawing of boundaries between these two constituencies, for example, can easily tilt the political arithmetic in the BJP’s favour. The DDC polls will signify a new epoch in the political history of Jammu and Kashmir. From political participation to election results, everything could change drastically from what it has been in the past. It is these tectonic changes which might have caused the erstwhile adversaries to come together in the PAGD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-the-gupkar-alliance-driven-by-political-arithmetic-or-chemistry/story-QHsy7bY4ME6mTVxVzJcRPJ.html
23-11-2020||India||Ganga’s status in Haridwar to be restored finally as CM vows to scrap Congress order||Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Sunday announced that the state government will soon scrap the order that had given escape channel status to Ganga stretch at Har-Ki-Pauri in Haridwar. Rawat made this announcement before meeting Akhada Parishad representatives at his residence in connection with the preparations for 2021 Kumbh. Rawat said the decision has been taken given the long pending demand of saints and priests and to respect the sentiments of people. Congress-led government on December 14, 2016, had issued an order declaring part of Ganga from Sarvanand ghat, Bhoopatwala till Shri Daksheshwar Mahadev temple, passing through sanctum sanctorum of Brahahmkund, Har-Ki-Pauri as an escape channel. This meant Har-Ki-Pauri ghat is not on the main river Ganga course and thus didn’t come under National Green Tribunal (NGT) directive regarding the prohibition on construction activities within 100 metre of the Ganga river. The declaration had come in the wake of NGT making “no development zone” within 100 metres of the Ganga on both sides of the river bed. In July this year, ex-Congress chief minister Harish Rawat had sought an apology from the saint community for issuing the government order in 2016, asking BJP led government to render it null and void. Akhada Parishad, saints, local priests, traders and Ganga activists have welcomed the decision to scrap the previous Congress-led state government’s order. Rawat assured Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri-led saint delegation on Sunday of scrapping the order with a notification to be issued on Monday in this regard. Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad general secretary said though it is a bit late, restoration of the old status of Har-Ki-Pauri stream flow as being a part of mainstream Ganga, is a welcome development. Ganga Sabha, which manages affairs of Har-Ki-Pauri, expressed gratitude to CM for announcing to scrap the Congress government order of 2016.Urban development minister Madan Kaushik hailed the decision saying the BJP government has nullified the wrongdoing of the previous Congress-led government and by Monday government notification will be issued. Local saints and priests who were staging an indefinite sit-in agitation at Har-Ki-Pauri for the past one month also ended their agitation with this announcement. Elated, the local priests also offered milk to deity Ganga following the announcement. Also Read: Snowfall likely in Uttarakhand districts over next few days: IMD bulletinOne of the representatives of local priests, Saurabh Shikhaula, said that had BJP led state government further delayed the scrapping of the order, they would have intensified their agitation. “Since ancient times, Brahamkund, Har-Ki-Pauri is one of the revered places for taking holy Ganga dip, performing rituals and hosting Kumbh fairs. How come it became an escape channel of Ganga Canal when the Ganga Canal was built by Britishers during 1840-1850. It was unacceptable for not only priests here but also pilgrims who arrive at Har-Ki-Pauri for religious and spiritual reasons. Our sentiments were hurt when we see, on government papers, Har-Ki-Pauri is deemed as part of a canal and not that the main course of sacred Ganga,” said Shikaula. Meanwhile Opposition Congress, too, has welcomed the move and said it will restore the status of Har- ki- Pauri as Ganga ghat. “CM’s announcement has rectified the mistake done in 2016 by then CM Harish Rawat, who a few months ago, accepted it and urged the present government to revoke the order related to it,” said Dhirendra Pratap Singh, state Congress vice-president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ganga-s-status-in-haridwar-to-be-restored-finally-as-cm-vows-to-scrap-congress-order/story-ecPOqLjF8WG5CDygV0euLK.html

23-11-2020||Editorials||The BJP focuses on the local | HT Editorial||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s stated aim is to win elections from Parliament to the Panchayat. While a lot of attention is paid to the party’s strategy and success in national elections, its organisational machinery that helps convert support to votes, and the careful branding of Narendra Modi as the leader who is committed to India’s national interests, there is often inadequate attention to how the party builds its strength from the local to the national. Two recent episodes show the extraordinary importance the BJP gives to the local — confirming the adage that all politics is, eventually, local. In Jammu and Kashmir, where district elections are scheduled, the BJP has invested tremendous energy and resources in ensuring that it registers a respectable presence. This is important for the party — and the government — to show that its constitutional changes in the Union Territory have popular sanction as well as build its own independent strength in the region. At the other end of the country, in Telangana, for local civic polls in Hyderabad, the BJP has deputed its powerful general secretary Bhupender Yadav— who is in charge of crucial states such as Gujarat and Bihar — to oversee the party’s effort, besides sending ministers to campaign. With four parliamentarians from the state and two state legislators in the assembly, the party sees an opportunity to position itself as the principal opposition to chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao; Telangana is also a key target for the 2024 polls since it is among the regions the BJP believes it can expand its numerical strength. All of this is happening in the backdrop of party president JP Nadda about to embark on a 100-day tour of all states to strengthen the party. There are three clear lessons from this visible energy that the BJP is investing in even local polls. One, every region — irrespective of the party’s historical weakness or its demography — is on the party’s radar; and it is willing to work hard and invest energy in expanding its base. Two, the party recognises — and this may also spring from the focus the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has on grassroots work — that the route of capturing power at the state level is often through winning battles on the ground, on issues that are closest to citizens. And finally, it is a lesson for other parties — both national and regional — that politics is a 24/7 job, and every election matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-bjp-focuses-on-the-local/story-vD5m87aDcHuvrjTmPARgFP.html
23-11-2020||Editorials||Planning for a post-Covid world | HT Editorial||The Group of Twenty (G20) ended its annual summit without deliverables, but with a sense that global leaders have begun shifting their gaze to a post-Covid-19 world. The G20 has been largely missing in action through much of the pandemic. The inability to have physical interactions inhibited genuine diplomatic outreach. More dama-ging was the every-government-for-itself scramble that followed the outbreak, something that left little space for the spirit of multilateralism. The hostility between the two most powerful nations, the United States and China, did not make summitry easier. In any summit, participants reach out to their domestic public as well as lay out an agenda for their fellow world leaders. Outgoing US President Donald Trump’s decision to play golf during a special session on Covid-19 was a crude message for his pandemic-denying base at home. But there was positivity in the manner the summit members spoke of the future. There was the expected noise on vaccine distri-bution, debt relief and the need to coordinate economic responses to the ailing world economy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s important intervention was to underline the need to put climate change front and centre of the global agenda. Over the next few G20 summits many of these abstractions need to be converted into concrete steps. The G20’s strength is its ability to bring to bear the attention and resources of the most-powerful governments on the most-difficult global issues. Ensuring the revival of cooperation over global financial architecture, supply chain stability and climate will be the task of future hosts, including India, which has moved its chairmanship to 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/planning-for-a-post-covid-world/story-XxsHbpEabWHpRqfnRNWmsN.html
