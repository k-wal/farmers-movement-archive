01-11-2020||News||The perils of an economic oligarchy, writes Kapil Sibal||We need a new economic model of development when dealing with natural resources. As a policy, governments have been allowing the private sector to exploit these resources for the greater public good. However, we are moving towards a unique form of crony capitalism. Significant public assets and resources are being cornered by key players, perceived to be close to those wielding power. We are becoming an economic oligarchy where natural resources, which are public assets, are monopolised by a few who, in turn, profit themselves and their political mentors.Without economic prosperity, the lives of those at the bottom of the pyramid cannot be uplifted. But this requires a model of development that gives space to all those who participate in various economic enterprises. Once resources percolate down, the animal spirits of entrepreneurship are unleashed. But this is unlikely if economic resources are concentrated in the hands of a few. What we see today is the widening disparity between the haves and have nots. The former comprise around 10% of the population out of which the richest 1% held 42.5% of the national wealth generated in 2019 — while the bottom 50% held a mere 2.8%. Similarly, the richest 10% of the population holds 74.3% of the total national wealth — while the remaining 90%, a mere 25.7%. According to an Oxfam report released in January, the richest 1% in India holds more than four times the wealth held by 953 million people who represent the bottom 70%. Around 800 million people in India earn less than ₹10,000 a month. This cannot possibly be the foundation of a successful economic model. What we need is a sector-wise strategy.Take, for example, the telecom sector that revolutionised communications and brought it to the doorsteps of almost a billion people. The sector is in debt of more than ₹4.4 lakh crore as of March 31, excluding Adjusted Gross Revenue dues. This year, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in economic sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel has been awarded to Paul R Milgrom and Robert B Wilson for improvements in auction theory and innovation of new auction formats. They analysed the criticisms levelled against auctions and pointed out that the auction design often leads to buyers overbidding to corner a resource without which their enterprises cannot survive. Such resources are raw material for them. This results in what is called winner’s curse. So, the key is to design auctions in such a way that the winner can earn revenues to discharge the entity’s debt obligations. Clearly, spectrum auctions in India were badly designed resulting in two key players controlling the market. The auction of coal blocks has not enthused bidders despite government claims that, with private sector participation, coal production will increase exponentially. In the process, the government also hoped that these auctions would be a source of substantial earnings for it. All these hopes have been belied. This has impacted power and other key sectors of the economy. Our indigenous production of coal is not enough to meet the demands of the market. With private enterprise not opting for coal blocks sought to be auctioned, importing coal at high cost is hurting the industry. India’s thermal coal imports have been rising since 2017, and were nearly 200 million tonnes in 2019 — an increase of 12.6% year on year.We must first determine the objective behind the distribution of natural resources, including minerals, air waves or other assets meant to serve the public. If the objective is to enrich the government, the results will be skewed and public interest will suffer. If land is auctioned at market price for hospitals and educational institutions, few will invest because the price of the asset will make the enterprise uneconomical.Of course, public assets cannot be distributed at throwaway prices since that too is against the public interest. What is needed is to create an economic model in which the government shares in the profits made by industry, as it continues to exploit public assets for public good. That is an objective governments must embrace when delineating policies allowing private enterprise to exploit public assets. Sharing profits with the government, as the enterprises continue to prosper, will have its own challenges. Outright auction of public assets based on ill-designed auctions will prove a death knell for industry.When dealing with each sector of the economy, the government must have a separate strategic plan to ensure that there is greater participation of those involved in the prosperity of the sector. The government will be confronted with issues related to technology and resources, but the key ultimately is to allow for innovation. In fact, most government resources should be best applied to creating innovative solutions in each sector by analysing its unique problems. Industry has to participate in this enterprise and governments must not view this with suspicion, nor should the architecture of government policies benefit just a few players.The time has come for the political system to become more robust and transparent. What is urgently needed is an economic model with a public purpose in terms of creating prosperity for those at the bottom of the economic and social ladder. At the moment, we live in a country which seems to have lost its way, a country obsessed with politics and aggrandisement of power; a country where private interest takes primacy over public good.Kapil Sibal is a former Union Cabinet minister and senior Congress leader The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-perils-of-an-economic-oligarchy/story-LkcK2p5dJqH74y5CwLu1YK.html
01-11-2020||News||The deepening of economic bond between India, UK | Opinion||As the world faces the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has never been more important for countries to come together — not just to recover, but to build back better and stronger. The United Kingdom (UK) and India are leading the charge. Our governments have just announced a series of initiatives across investment, trade, infrastructure and sustainable finance to drive growth and jobs for both countries.On October 28, UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, and finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, held the landmark 10th India-UK Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD), supported by regulators and senior industry leaders from both countries. It was a timely moment to look at future challenges, and also to reflect on progress: Since the first EFD in 2007, trade between the UK and India has more than doubled to nearly £24 billion in 2019. Our investment relationship now supports over half a million jobs in each other’s economies. The combined revenue of Indian companies in the UK has grown by 87% in the last five years. The UK is the second fastest growing G20 investor in India over the last 10 years; since 2000, British companies have invested nearly £22 billion. The UK is India’s second biggest research partner. It is easy to reel off figures, but these bear repeating — what they represent is truly impressive.The chancellor is well aware of the opportunities that the UK-India partnership presents, especially as the UK prepares for its G7 and COP-26 presidencies next year, and India hosts the G20 Summit in 2022. The UK and India are leading the global economic response to Covid-19, as co-authors of the G20 Action Plan. The ministers restated their commitment to work together as a force for good — in a relationship fit for the 21st century — not just with words, but with tangible action. We agreed an ambitious new partnership to share expertise on infrastructure finance and project delivery and another to scale up our cooperation on sustainable finance, to mobilise even greater green investment. As the need for building a resilient world becomes increasingly urgent, sustainable finance has particularly exciting potential. Our joint UK-India Green Growth Equity Fund, for example — announced at the last EFD — has already catalysed nearly £300m of investment to support green infrastructure projects in India. What does that mean in practice? Innovative companies, who know how to build in a sustainable way, now have access to reliable finance to grow their business and help clean up our world. We now have a chance to deepen this further — and the October 28 dialogue set the scene perfectly. As the world’s leading global financial centre, London is the perfect partner for New Delhi’s ambitious growth plans — including the delivery of India’s $1.5-trillion national infrastructure pipeline. Indian firms have raised £11.5 billion in masala, dollar and green bonds listed on the London Stock Exchange since 2016. A new strategic partnership on Gujarat International Finance Tec-City will accelerate the development of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s flagship international financial centre by sharing world-class UK regulatory expertise. Through our FinTech ties, the UK and India will aim to facilitate the flow of faster and cheaper remittances. And through a new financial markets dialogue, the chancellor and finance minister Sitharaman agreed to address regulatory barriers and enable the free flow of capital between the UK and India. The opportunities are huge — for example, in insurance where the ministers have agreed to explore ways to boost investment further. Through this raft of new initiatives and so much more besides — including joint investment of up to £8 million to lead pioneering research on Covid-19 — the UK and India are truly setting out a stretching economic agenda. One that I am confident will set us up for another prosperous 10 years — and for a 21st century partnership which leads the way on global recovery. After all, the stakes are high — but so is our ambition.Jan Thompson, OBE, is the UK’s Acting High Commissioner to India The views expressed are personalThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-deepening-of-economic-bond-between-india-uk/story-hJXnxPnfFlxF03UYGtpMOM.html

The cell will be set up at the ground floor of the Yeida’s main administrative building located in Greater Noida’s sector Omega-I. It has three floors with customer relation office and industry office on the ground floor. The move comes after the authority realised that the plot allottees have to face inconvenience during the process of getting the sublease agreement done.“We will start the facility from next week at our office so that plot allottees do not face any inconvenience in getting sublease done,” Arun Vir Singh, chief executive officer, Yeida, said on Saturday. In 2009, Yeida had allotted 21,000 residential plots in sectors 18 and 19. In the past nine years, the authority could not develop these sectors and most of the plot allottees are yet to obtain the possession. In the last one year, the authority has offered possession to 14,000 allottees and it is on way to offer possession to remaining 7,000 plot allottees, the officials said. According to the officials, the authority has said that if the plot allottees get the sublease deed done by December this year, they will not have to pay any extra penalty for delay in payment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yeida-to-set-up-dedicated-cell-for-registry-of-properties/story-djZBbGalwndhxBOTefmBHI.html
01-11-2020||Mumbai||Free walk-in Covid-19 testing at 244 spots in Mumbai from today||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Sunday said starting today (Monday), citizens will be able to avail free walk-in Covid-19 testing at 244 locations across the city as the civic body aims to increase tests to 24,000 daily before Diwali. The BMC said citizens will be able to test for free between 10am to 12 noon. Citizens can avail information on the nearest testing camp by calling on BMC’s helpline 1916 or visiting http://stopcoronavirus.mcgm.gov.in. Hindustan Times had reported first on Sunday that BMC is going to finalise a plan of free walk-in testing camps at multiple locations across the city. Civic officials said the plan was to have adequate testing facilities in a decentralised manner. Owing to this, the number of testing centres will go up to over 300 in the city. A total of 54 private laboratories are providing these tests, including home service. Since September, the BMC has been conducting between 8,000-15,000 Covid-19 tests on a daily basis, 30-40% of which comprises rapid antigen tests. Overall, more than 15.26 lakh tests have been conducted in the city and the overall positivity rate is around 16%. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “Free walk-in testing camps will help in increasing the number of tests as well as timely diagnosis.” The state Covid-19 task-force had also suggested that daily testing should be increased if more unlocking is happening.Furthermore, the BMC is also anticipating a surge in cases around the festival time and additionally, local trains starting for all citizens in the coming days. Meanwhile, according to BMC, initially, the facility of free testing will be available on a walk-in basis, and further on, after taking the response into account, an appointment system may be initiated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/free-walk-in-covid-19-testing-at-244-spots-in-mumbai-from-today/story-pxDquk9NZuF9mXoGrPKNXN.html

The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) has said that the share of stubble burning in pollution went to about 40% on Sunday, the season’s highest, which contributed majorly to the deteriorating air quality. On Sunday, the air quality index (AQI) values for Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida were recorded in higher ranges of ‘very poor’ and stood at 384, 388 and 384, respectively, as per data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). As per SAFAR, the previous highest share of stubble burning in air pollution in the national capital region was 36% on October 29. “In spite of improved wind conditions, air quality has not progressed as expected due to high stubble-related intrusion and trapping of pollutants during night time due to low wintertime boundary layer height. However, it has not deteriorated further due to continued favourable North-northwesterly boundary level wind direction. The highly favourable conditions for fire-related intrusion in Delhi expected to continue,” the SAFAR forecast said. As per the forecast, the SAFAR-synergised stubble fire counts over Punjab, Haryana, UP, Uttarakhand, and neighbouring areas impacting air stood at 3,216 on Saturday. “Stubble burning share in PM2.5 has increased and is estimated as 40% for today (Sunday), the highest of the season. A better ventilation condition is forecasted for the next two days... It is set to marginally deteriorate on 3rd November,” the SAFAR forecast further added. Meanwhile, officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) have predicted that favourable meteorological conditions will prevail for the next two-three days which will help speedy dispersal of pollutants. “It is expected that the pollution levels will not rise for the next two-three days as there will be wind speed which will help in dispersal of pollutants. On Sunday, the wind speed was about 18-21kmph during day time and temperature also went up to 30.8 degrees Celsius. It is likely to remain in the range of 30-31 degrees Celsius for the next three days and this will also help in dispersal of pollutants,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre. According to official statistics of the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory, there have been a total of 30,999 stubble fire incidents in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh from October 1 to October 30, with Punjab alone accounting for 27,088 of these. The stubble fire counts stood at 25,778 during the same period last year. Praveen Kumar, regional officer of UP pollution control board (UPPCB) at Noida said that they are focussing more on local pollution sources. “We are focussing to maintain enforcement and curb the local pollution sources. We are maintaining strict vigil for such sources and trying to increase our activities to curb pollution,” he added. In Greater Noida, only monitoring station at Knowledge Park V spiked to ‘severe’ category on Sunday, while none of the four stations in Noida went to ‘severe’ category. In Ghaziabad, the monitoring station at Loni went to the ‘severe’ category on Sunday, besides the one at Sanjay Nagar. “Till now, we had only the Loni station which frequently went to ‘sever’ category. On Sunday, Sanjay Nagar monitoring station also went to ‘severe’ category. We are monitoring all four stations and taking appropriate measures at Sanjay Nagar. The overall AQI in Ghaziabad deteriorated due to 40% contribution of stubble burning. We are trying to keep in check the local factors as well,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UPPCB, Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/season-s-all-time-high-stubble-burning-contribution-affects-air-quality-of-noida-ghaziabad/story-ypZXSMI4OB2cDvrH1lKF1N.html

Taxpayers have been issued notices,” said RK Chaudhary, assistant excise and taxation commissioner.GSTR-3B is a monthly summary return filed by a taxpayer by the 20th of next month. GSTR-1 is a monthly or quarterly return filed by taxpayers to disclose details of their outward supplies for the month, along with their tax liability. Reconciliation between the two ensures that no invoice is omitted or recorded more than once and a taxpayer arrives at an accurate amount of output tax payable.GST dept steps up checking of e-way billsThe Chandigarh GST department in order to plug evasion of tax has also stepped up its roadside checking and inspection of e-way bills. The department has imposed and recovered a penalty of ₹34 lakh in October, said Chaudhary. The GSTIN (good and service tax identification number) of 542 taxpayers who were generating e-way bills, but did not file their GSTR-3B returns for December 2019 and January 2020 have been blocked by a computerised system. The blocking of e-way bills has restarted from October 15 and applicable on those taxpayers whose turnover is more than ₹5 crore.The department has calculated an interest to the tune of ₹13.24 crore on late payment of voluntary taxes for years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 by taxpayers. This interest amount has been calculated on the net tax liability after allowing input tax credit and the department has initiated recovery proceedings by issuing statutory notices to the taxpayers for deposit of interest on late payment of voluntary taxes.The GST department has accomplished 100% returns compliance in the years 2017-18, 2018-19, 99.97% in 2019-20 and 94.65% in the current financial year 2020-2021(up to September 30), which is highest in India, Chaudhary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/100-notices-issued-for-55-crore-suspected-gst-evasion-in-chandigarh/story-LGPLEk9FMZqDubGLWDEm3N.html
01-11-2020||Chandigarh||PU syndicate meeting not held for three months in a row||After the senate polls of Panjab University were deferred in August, the varsity’s syndicate has not met for the third month in a row.The last meeting of syndicate, which is the executive body of PU, was held in July. As a tradition of PU, its executive body meets once in a month. Although vice-chancellor Raj Kumar had called an emergent meeting of syndicate in an online mode twice in September, the members refused to attend the same and instead demanded a physical syndicate meet.On Friday, the syndicate members again wrote to V-C, urging him to call the meeting of syndicate to ensure that the functioning of the university did not suffer. With the end of term of PU senate, the syndicate remains the highest executive body of the university and its meeting remains key for the smooth functioning of the varsity. According to the PU calendar, the executive government of the university will be vested in the syndicate, which has powers to consider and make recommendations to the senate as it deems fit in the matters that include appointment of officers of Class A, affiliation and disaffiliation of colleges, recommendations of the board of finance relating to annual budget, supplementary grants, and others.The calendar also grants power to syndicate to pass orders on various university matters, including those related to colleges, academic council, faculties, and sanction proposals of new expenditure up to a particular limit. However, as no meeting was held over the last three months, many important matters are still pending including the reservation roster for recruitment of teachers. Syndicate member Navdeep Goyal said, “When the governing body will not meet, no policy decisions can be taken.”The recommendations of the board of finance are tabled in syndicate for consideration before the final approval from the senate. Last year, the board meeting was held in August and the budget was taken up by syndicate in October. “Generally, the budget estimates are finalised in July/September each year. University’s budget estimates for 2021-22 would be delayed and it may create a crisis in timely release of grants and delay other financial needs of the university,” said Rajat Sandhir, who is a member of the finance board.Syndicate member Rabindra Nath Sharma said, “This is an unfortunate scenario and if the senate is not there, the vice-chancellor should call the syndicate meeting so that all the pending issues will be taken up.”PU vice-chancellor Raj Kumar, meanwhile, refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-syndicate-meeting-not-held-for-three-months-in-a-row/story-RXup3ZeuRHhMeG6uwKr6IP.html
01-11-2020||Mumbai||After 8 years’ wait, Diva man gets stolen gold chains back from Kalyan GRP||Sandip Ghag, a 31-year-old resident of Diva who lost two gold chains in a theft in 2012, got lucky after eight years when Kalyan Government Railway Police (GRP) returned his gold chains worth ₹70,000, as per present market value, on Sunday. “I was speechless when I realised that finally my hard-earned gold chains will be returned to me. One week ago, one of the policemen had come to my place asking me to take the chains. However, I could not go as I was not keeping well. On Sunday I finally received it,” said Ghag. He added, “I had completely forgotten about the chain as there was no hope. Currently, my mother is sick and I have to arrange money for her treatment. I am sure the chains will help. I always believed that hard-earned money will return in some or the other; and it is proved now.” The theft took place at Kalyan railway tracks in 2012 when Ghag was heading to Kalyan for a job. He was hit by stone by the thief and suffered injuries in the incident. A case was registered on the same day and the police initiated a search. While GRP managed to nab the thief, the recovered gold chains were stuck in court trials. “Several such recovered items are often not returned due to lack of follow up. We have recently taken up such cases and are trying to reach out to the complainants. In Ghag’s case, his phone number had changed and there was no follow-up by officers as well,” said Shardul Walmiki, senior police inspector, Kalyan GRP. He added, “We will be returning more such recovered items in the coming days by putting in all the efforts to reach out to the complainants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-8-years-wait-diva-man-gets-stolen-gold-chains-back-from-kalyan-grp/story-cU4TPis1WpsXhW2lRknmeN.html
01-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Officials hope of a higher turnout in schools this week||NOIDA: With the response coming from the schools in Gautam Budh Nagar district, it is expected that more students will attend school in person this week, district education officials said. The turnout in private schools and government schools has been recorded 15% and 30% respectively, ever since the state government allowed schools to open for classes 9 to 12 from October 19. Neeraj Pandey, the Gautam Budh Nagar district inspector of schools (DIOS), said that initially, the response from parents in sending their children to schools was lukewarm but the situation is improving. “So far, the turnout in private CBSE schools in the district is less than 15%. But we hope that it will be doubled this week, given as parents have started showing interest in sending their children back to school. I hope that from this week, the student turnout will at least be double than what we are seeing, in private schools,” he said.When contacted, Kamini Bhashin, the principal of DPS Noida, said the school has already started classes for students of Class 9 to 12. “Though the attendance is not very encouraging, we have decided to start the practical classes, particularly for classes 10 and 12, from Monday as they have to take their Board examinations next year. The school has also decided to conduct a full-fledged examination, which will be different from the regular pattern, enlisting the participation and cooperation of the parents at home and the teachers at school,” she said.She further said that the objective of the exam is to gauge the students’ understanding of concepts and to give them an exposure to writing three-hour long papers at one go.“We see parents as co-partners in the child’s education and hence solicit their active support in executing the exam in the safety of your homes. We would like to share the exam plan with them. The exams will commence from November 23, in which the entire syllabus will be evaluated. Examinations are about confidentiality, so parents are requested to create a new e-mail id, which would be used exclusively to share the question paper, and ensure their ward has no access to the password. The new id has to be shared with the home room teachers (HRTs),” she said.On the other hand, Renu Singh, the principal of Amity school (Noida), said the school has not yet started in-person lessons for class 9 to 12. “The parents’ response is very cold. We are waiting for a better response. Only then will we start in person lessons for them,” she said.Meanwhile, parents also believe that after Diwali, the turnout of students will increase in the schools. Anchal Vohra of sector 77, said that a lot of parents in his society have agreed to send their children back for in-person classes in schools. “They need to be there for practicals. We’ll send our children to school after Diwali,” he said.Echoing similar views, Sushmita Singh of Sector 25 (Noida), said: “Online classes can only enhance their academic credentials. But in-person classes are needed for their overall development, we have decided to send our children to school once Diwali is over,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-officials-hope-of-a-higher-turnout-in-schools-this-week/story-v7549Zc2ROgmKax0GsBU9O.html
01-11-2020||Delhi||Online HSRP bookings resume in Delhi||Online bookings of high-security registration plates (HSRP) and colour-coded stickers for vehicles resumed on Sunday, with an additional provision for doorstep delivery that is currently available for applicants only in a handful of localities in east and west Delhi districts.On September 23, the Delhi government had issued a public notice asking vehicle owners to avail HSRP and colour-coded stickers at the earliest in order to avoid being penalised under existing laws but it did not mention any deadline in the notice. But on October 1, Delhi Transport minister Kailash Gahlot had directed for stopping the online booking last month after complaints were received from vehicle owners about delays and issues in logging on the registration portal.“Around 3,000 bookings are targeted every day up to Diwali. If the service from suppliers of HSRP and colour-coded stickers and dealers are found to be satisfactory, the bookings will be raised after the festival break,” said an official in the government’s transport department.On Sunday, the doorstep delivery provision was made available by booking service providers for applicants who are residents of Mayur Vihar, PatparGanj,Anand Vihar, Laxmi Nagar, Janakpuri, Rajouri Garden, PunjabiBagh and Kirti Nagar, said an official, adding that more localities will be added in the list over the next two weeks. There are around 3.2 million vehicles in Delhi – both commercial and private – which are supposed to have high-security registration plates. They include around 1.1 million four-wheelers, 1.9 million two-wheelers and the rest include auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, buses, trucks, etc. The rule applies largely to vehicles registered before April 1, 2019, as most newer vehicles (registered after April 1, 2019) come equipped with HSRPs and stickers, said the transport official.About 350 fitters are being roped in for home delivery and affixation of number plates. The home delivery charges have been decided in consultation with Delhi government and at Rs 125 for two-wheelers and Rs 250 for four wheelers, in addition to the usual fee for HSRP, said a spokesperson of Rosmerta Safety Systems Private Limited – one of the three authorised suppliers of HSRP in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/online-hsrp-bookings-resume-in-delhi/story-lZupO7lvq1L4XTGuEhYigJ.html
01-11-2020||City||Islamic centre’s signage defaced, FIR registered||New Delhi: Alleged members of the Hindu Sena defaced the signage outside the India Islamic Cultural Centre (IICC) on Sunday, police said, adding an FIR has been registered suo-motu. Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said an FIR was registered at the Tughlaq Road police station against unknown persons under Section 3 of the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 2007. “A police team spotted the defaced signage while patrolling the neighbourhood on Sunday morning. There is no CCTV camera installed around the board. The name of a right-wing organisation is mentioned on the objectionable poster pasted on the signage. We will probe the involvement of its members,” said the officer.Earlier in the day, Hindu Sena released a statement owning up the responsibility for the act. Photographs of the defaced board went viral on social media on Sunday. Hindu Sena chief Vishnu Gupta said that in the morning he learnt that some members of their organisation had defaced the signage during a protest at the India Islamic Cultural Centre on Sunday morning. “Muslims in cities like Bhopal and Mumbai have been protesting against the France government’s response to Islamic terrorism. This has been happening despite our Prime Minister and our people extending support to France at this hour. We believe that members of the IICC should have come out with a statement condemning the protests in India. Since they did not, it is clear that they too were supporting the protest,” he said. Referring to the defacement, SM Khan, vice president of IICC, said the incident was unfortunate. “It was an unfortunate incident and we brought it to the notice of local authorities. Our board will meet to decide on the course of legal action. IICC is a place which believes in inter-faith dialogue, deliberation and promotes national integrity. To say we support any act of terror is ridiculous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/islamic-centre-s-signage-defaced-fir-registered/story-HHtmJeLPsgUuYpjH5K3kqN.html
01-11-2020||City||‘Special measures’ to ensure DU internal exams finish before semester tests||New Delhi: To ensure that internal assessment and practicals for the academic session 2020-21 are conducted before the semester theory exams scheduled in December, Delhi University’s exam department on Saturday asked principals, deans and heads of department to adhere to “special measures” devised for the same.The notice lists guidelines for the internal assessment and practicals of the current second- and third-year students. The undergraduate admissions are currently underway and the session for first-years is slated to begin November 18.Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said, “As per the academic calendar released by University Grants Commission (UGC), the classes for first-year students will begin on November 18 and their semester exams will be conducted in March. Since the remaining exams (for other years) are being conducted in December, they (university) will chalk out a plan for the assessment of first-year students accordingly.”“Instead of the three existing components of internal assessment viz Class Tests, Tutorial Test, and Attendance, only one component defined i.e internal assignments maybe carried out for the current semester for this examination, except SOL as a special measure due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” Dean (Examinations) said in the notice. These assignments will be conducted online and students will be asked to submit via email in the defined time.For undergraduate (UG) practical exams the teachers will give assignments based on practical syllabus while for the postgraduate (PG) practical exams, the evaluation will be in “100% continuous evaluation mode.”Viva-voce, moot courts, and oral exams will be conducted through Skype or other online teaching platforms. For internship or apprenticeship mandatory for completion of degree in most professional or technical courses, the students can take up online internships and the period of internship can be reduced by clubbing it with assignments.“In the present scenario, appropriate measures have to be adopted to facilitate the UG/PG students pursuing projects and dissertation. Accordingly, review-based/secondary data-based projects or software driven projects shall be accepted by the Faculty/Department/College instead of laboratory-based experiments or field survey based assignments to these students,” Dean (Exams) said in the guidelines.Payal Mago, principal of Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences, said, “After the Covid-19 lockdown struck in March, the previous academic session saw similar guidelines being implemented for internal assessment of existing students. However, this is not for first-year students since we are yet to see if their entire semester will be fully online or a hybrid mode if they are allowed to attend offline classes at some point later.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/special-measures-to-ensure-du-internal-exams-finish-before-semester-tests/story-b5vhZpt4Nu2NHk8WTzO4tN.html

But apart from playing on their home turf, the local golfers will have an advantage of competing in the in-house weekly prize money events for the last four months. With lockdown forcing the professional golfers to stay away from the competition since mid-March, the Chandigarh Golf Club started its own in-house weekly prize money tournament to give the professional golfers a feel of the competitive circuit. An entry fee and a small prize money for the top-five finishers added more thrill to the event. “It (referring to an in-house weekly tournament) was like playing a round of proper competition. We faced the same amount of pressure we felt while playing in any pro event. No one can afford to take a shot lightly or for granted. Everyone played his best and winning has always been a pride,” says India’s one of the most successful professional golfers, Jeev Milkha Singh. The club initiated a weekly tournament, every Wednesday, from mid-June. A one-day event, with 18 holes, has been played in a team scramble format. A professional golfer paired up with an amateur and both the team members tee off. After every shot, the best ball is chosen. “The idea basically evolved out of lockdown to provide competition to professionals, who were absolutely lacking any competitive golf. Besides that, the advantage of amateur being paired up with professionals provides them the invaluable experience and opportunity to learn the sport from a close quarter with the best names in the country,” says Sandeep Singh Sandhu (Bobby), CGC president. “Because of the format (team scramble), it became a very competitive field and there was a sense of competition in every shot. The scores for a round have even touched 10-12 under.”Every in-house weekly event saw 50 to 60 entries with the names like Jeev Milkha Singh, Ajeetesh Sandhu, Harinder Gupta, Karandeep Kochhar, Adil Bedi, and Akshay Sharma playing regularly. Even current golfing sensations Shubhankar Sharma and Gaganjeet Bhullar played a couple of Wednesday events before heading to take part in the European circuit. With all the players chipping in ₹1,000 each as an entry fee, the money collected has been distributed among the top-five pairs. The winning pairs (top-five) cannot play with the same partners for the next three weeks. “Though the prize money is only for a token, it increases the competition level and offers a fair amount of pressure. Everyone wants to win,” says Jeev. “Chandigarh golfers will be in advantage when the circuit starts on November 4. They will be ready to deal with the competition pressure. From my experience, I can say that even the world’s top golfers come under pressure and it has a bearing on their performance when they are playing in competition after a gap of six to seven months, unless one is used to the same type of feeling and playing in the same environment. Because as a human being, we need time to adapt,” he added.“Since mid-March, we are out of competition and only a couple of Indian pros are eligible to play in the ongoing European circuit. So, for the larger community of pro golfers, these weekly pro events were the only option to stay tuned with competitive golf and sense the same environment as we do during the pro events,” says Akshay Sharma, who finished top-five twice in the weekly tournaments. About the resumption of pro circuitThe Indian professional circuit is resuming with back-to-back tournaments in Panchkula and Chandigarh. The tour is opening with Tata Steel PGTI Players Championship presented by Panchkula Golf Club from November 4 to 7. The first two rounds will be played simultaneously at Panchkula and Chandigarh golf courses, while the third and fourth round will be played in Panchkula. The next four-round event presented by Chandigarh Golf Club will start from November 9. The venue format for the first two rounds remains the same, while the third and fourth round will be played in Chandigarh. Both the events carry prize money of ₹30 lakh each. “Most of the things remain the same, except for reporting an hour before the tea off timing and submitting a report of Covid-19 test done not before 72 hours of the practice round (November 2). Only the golfers with negative reports will be allowed to participate,” says Akshay, whose negative report makes him eligible to play in both the tournaments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-house-weekly-prize-money-tourneys-gear-up-local-golfers-for-pro-circuit/story-l1a0OGytaeB9L9y7HsiSNN.html
01-11-2020||Noida||Covid-19: Owing to festive season, Ghaziabad tests service providers to gauge possibility of second wave||Ghaziabad: In the first three days of focussed testing for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease taken up by the district health department, teams have found positive cases among groups of those working as auto-drivers, beauticians and staff at sweets’ shops, and have advised people to take all precautions while going out to markets during the festival season.The focussed testing drive was directed from October 29 to November 12 in all districts in Uttar Pradesh in order to control any probable second wave of Covid-19, and to detect clusters of cases which may result due to mixing of people in markets, etc in the festive season.According to the records of the health department, a comprehensive testing of auto drivers was taken up at Vijay Nagar, Sahibabad, Ambedkar Road, Mohan Nagar, and near the Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area. Four people of the 1,005 people tested through rapid antigen kits were found positive. The reports of another set of 350 people who were tested with the RT-PCR method are awaited.Likewise, during the focussed sampling drive on October 30, in which beauticians and mehendi artistes, and staff of beauty parlours were tested in markets and malls in Raj Nagar Extension, Vasundhara, Indirapuram, Kaushambi and Raj Nagar, etc., five persons were found positive out of a total of 1,037 tested through rapid antigen kits. The results for another set of 369 samples tested through the RT-PCR method are awaited. Another set of 1,034 tests, conducted through rapid antigen kits, were administered at Raj Nagar Extension, Vijay Nagar, Sahibabad Site IV, Indirapuram, Modinagar and Govindpuram, of which six persons were found positive. The RT-PCR test reports of another 370 persons from this group are awaited.“Each day we are targeting a different set of people in order to know how many of them have Covid-19 and can pass it on to others if undetected. Since there will be a lot of movement in markets in the coming days owing to festivals, it is important that such groups are tested and positive persons are isolated or sent for treatment,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. Under this initiative, the health department is taking up 1,300 samples per day from focussed groups which also include people like vendors, cycle-rickshaw drivers, shopkeepers and milkmen, etc.The 1,300 tests are included in the daily testing target and samples are collected at collection centres as well as locations identified with the help of traders’ associations.“On our part, we have issued strict directions to our members to observe all safety and precautionary measures as there is overcrowding in markets these days. However, the authorities need to put in place enforcement measures against erring customers as we have no such power. We can only make appeals,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti, Indirapuram – a traders’ association. Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association, Ghaziabad, said: “In times of Covid-19 and high pollution levels, wearing of face mask is a must, besides adherence to social distancing. The present situation is volatile as it may increase infection among masses. So, all precautions must be observed. Preferably, customers may avoid over crowded markets and order items online. Instead of several members of the same family going out together, shoppers may restrict it to only one two from a family venturing out.”Meanwhile, the district officials said they are gearing up for any probable surge in Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad, in the wake of the recent spike in Delhi. “If there is any surge in Covid-19 cases in November in Ghaziabad, we have stock of medicines for about 1,000 patients. For now, we have been given a target of 3,100 tests per day and it will be increased to 4,000 in November. If need be we will enhance testing up to 6,000 per day. For better surveillance, we have plans to increase the number of surveillance teams from 861 at present to 1,000,” district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said in a statement. “Residents are advised to follow all Covid-19 protocols and take up all precautions such as wearing masks and observing social distancing in order to protect themselves in busy places like markets. Focussed testing is going on to find positive cases from the different targeted groups,” he added. He further said that proper arrangements are being put in place for L1 category Covid beds, ventilators, high flow nasal cannula and other equipment in anticipation of any probable surge in Covid-19 cases in the district in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-19-owing-to-festive-season-ghaziabad-tests-service-providers-to-gauge-possibility-of-second-wave/story-0swCcBxY0qQXjOvhZAlAaI.html
01-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad: Residents suffer as RT-PCR test reports getting delayed||Ghaziabad: It has been about two-and-a-half months since the new RT-PCR laboratory got initiated at MMG District Hospital in Ghaziabad, but it is yet to cater to all the samples for Covid-19 testing taken up by the district health department. In such a scenario, people are suffering as they have to wait for more than five days to get their test reports. Usually, it takes about 24 to 48 hours to deliver a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result.The RT-PCR laboratory was inaugurated on August 15, and has now reached the testing capacity of about 500 samples per day. According to officials, the district health department is collecting about 1,500-2,000 samples daily for RT-PCR tests. However, only about 400 samples are sent to MMG hospital while the rest are sent to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Noida. “I got myself tested on Wednesday (October 28) and yet to receive the test report. Initially, I had fever and other Covid symptoms and decided to get myself tested. But I am taking all precautions,” said a resident of Vaishali who wished not to be named. A resident of Shastri Nagar, who tested Covid-19 positive and completed home isolation on October 24, decided to go for RT-PCR test in order to be sure about the health status before attending office. “I took up rapid antigen test at the MMG hospital and it turned negative. So, it was followed with an RT-PCR test whose report I received after five days on October 29,” the patient said. The delayed test reports in several cases have raised concerns about spread of infection as the person who got himself/herself tested could be attending to office, meeting friends or even moving about in public places. Health officials admitted that delays were taking place. “Of about 1500-2000 RT-PCR samples a day, we are sending only 400 samples to MMG Hospital. The laboratory at MMG hospital at present can conduct only 500 tests per day. Overall, there may be some delay in getting several test reports, and a team of officers is inquiring the reason,” said an officer from the district health department, on condition of anonymity. “As regards to people who are waiting for test reports, we will advise them to take all precautions and remain in home quarantine till they receive their reports,” the officer added. If all the RT-PCR tests of Ghaziabad are taken up by the laboratory at MMG hospital, residents will be able to get their test reports within 24 hours. Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent of MMG hospital, said that they have sufficient manpower but are testing only 500 samples per day. “It is because we are still in need of an RNA-extractor machine. Once we get it, we will be able to ramp up testing. Initially, we started with 50 tests and now are conducting 500 tests per day for the last 10 days,” he added. Authorities at GIMS said that they are overburdened. “We generally provide test reports in 24 hours. Although we have an official capacity to conduct 2,000 tests, we are conducting about 3,000 tests per day. Sometimes, the burden of testing is high. Besides, about 5% samples are also repeated for further testing,” Brig (retd) Rakesh Gupta, director of GIMS, said. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, however, said that the test reports’ issues were streamlined in the district. “If the residents have any complaints about the delayed test reports, we will get these checked up on case-to-case basis. If any issues emerge, we will take rectification measures and see to it that all issues are resolved,” Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-residents-suffer-as-rt-pcr-test-reports-getting-delayed/story-O9cNnns4DfSVigCK1fqRFL.html

Since his haemoglobin level fell, the actor had to undergo blood transfusion. Chatterjee’s overall condition was not good and the doctors said he was losing ground. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award winner was admitted on October 6 after he tested positive for Covid-19. Chatterjee tested negative for Covid-19 on October 14 but his neurological system was affected by Covid encephalopathy. “We conducted CT angiography to detect the exact location of the bleeding. We have found that. Since a dye had to be used for the angiography we had to do a dialysis to filter out the contrast media. This CT angiography was done to find out the location of the bleeding and had nothing to do with the heart,” Dr Arindam Kar, head of the team of doctors treating Chatterjee, said on Sunday night. “We tried to seal the bleeding. It was somewhat successful but is yet to be fully successful. We will look into the matter tomorrow (Monday) and figure out how to completely contain the bleeding. But due to the entire situation, his level of consciousness is still the same. His organ functions are holding on,” said Dr Kar.Also read: ‘Woman with self-respect will die if raped’ - Kerala Congress chief’s shocker “His electrolytes have stabilized. His urea and creatinine levels have stabilized. This is his 26th day in the hospital. For an 85- year-old man, with so much of comorbidity and background disease coupled with non-improvement of level of consciousness due to Covid encephalopathy, it is not a very good news. With every passing day we are losing ground,” said Dr Kar. Chatterjee’s condition drastically deteriorated over the past week. The noted actor has been in a drowsy state since last Monday. Millions of people in Bengal and beyond have been praying for Chatterjee’s recovery ever since he was admitted. In a bid to offer a holistic treatment, the doctors initially made Chatterjee listen to music and literature of his choice. He even communicated with his daughter Poulomi Basu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/losing-ground-veteran-actor-soumitra-chatterjee-s-condition-worsens-say-doctors/story-1zBgzrwBGYgHhRxCtXbUSK.html

In a statement issued here, Dewan said that the ₹20,000 crore economic package promised by the Centre has not seen the light of the day; what to talk of fulfilling a promise. “The central government’s decision is bound to break the backbone of industry,” he added. Dewan said suspension of freight was not only affecting the import, but also exports as the industry was unable to produce in the absence of raw material. “Industries are facing huge losses which will have adverse repercussions on the entire economy, so the central government must review its decision at the earliest,” he added. Yogesh Sagar, president, Mohali Industrialists Association, said, “It is indeed a very tough time for the industry. Labour shortage, Covid impact, financial difficulties and on top of that, a ban on the movement of goods trains. Exporters are foreseeing order cancellations and penalties on failure to deliver goods coupled with credibility loss.” He said, “It is expected to be a Black Diwali this season. The Covid-hit labourers looking for Diwali bonus now fear losing jobs.” Sewing machine spare parts manufacturer Bahadur Singh from Bahadur Udyog and Jaswinder Singh Saini from National Steel Industries also resented shortage of coal for foundries and goods rake being stuck up in Ambala. “Right now, we are managing with our inventories and materials,” said AR Chaudhary from AV Fabrications, who was irked over non-arrival of orders from an iron ore in Chattisgarh. We have been forced to buy raw material at “premium price” from the local markets, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/suspension-of-freight-trains-bound-to-break-backbone-of-punjab-industry/story-9LRpaRiE0aMKauvrAEbb9H.html
01-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 death rate among Mumbai’s cancer patients stands at 9.8%: Tata Memorial Hospital||Even though the death rate for Covid-19 in Mumbai is 3.9%, the fatality rate among cancer patients co-infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus is as high as 9.8% owing to their compromised immunity, according to data shared by Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), Parel. In Mumbai, since the outbreak of the pandemic, a total of 257,497 cancer patients contracted Covid-19, of which 10,293 succumbed to the infection. TMH, the leading cancer hospital in India which receives 70,000 cancer patients every year, has treated 1,140 cancer patients with Covid-19 co-infection between March and October, of which 112 died of the infection. Due to their treatment, cancer patients become immunologically weak, which increases their chances of contracting the viral disease, said oncologists. “Among immunocompromised patients, the body’s white blood cells, which fight infections, become low or don’t function. This fails the body to fight the infections effectively. This makes cancer patients, especially those who are on active chemotherapy, most vulnerable to the infection,” said Dr CS Pramesh, director, TMH. “The infection and mortality rate are the highest among cancer patients above the age of 50. If they have other co-morbidities, their infection becomes deadlier,” he added. Patients who are undergoing active treatment for cancer are presumably at higher risk than those who are in remission. “Active cancer patients have to be extra cautious due to their low immunity. Since March, we have treated 141 Covid-19 positive patients with cancer. Of them, five have succumbed to the infection,” said Akash Aanand, assistant medical superintendent of Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital, unit of TMH, Varanasi. A study, ‘COVID-19 prevalence and mortality in patients with cancer and the effect of primary tumour subtype and patient demographics: a prospective cohort’, published by the Lancet shows that the mortality rate is 30.6%. The researchers conducted the study on 1,044 cancer patients with co-infection at the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP) cohort between March 18 and May 8. Of them, 316 patients died. Oncologists said fatality rate in India is lower than developed countries as the consumption of smokeless tobacco is limited. “In India, the consumption of gutkha is more than western countries where cigarettes are more common. In comparison to the US, UK, where the death rate ranges from 15-30%, we can save co-infected patients more,” said Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi, deputy director, centre for cancer epidemiology at TMH. Dr Chaturvedi has also been overseeing the treatment of Covid-19 cancer patients at the NSCI jumbo centre and has so far treated over 500 co-infected patients. As per city oncologists, patients with haematological malignancies, when cancer affects the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes, are more vulnerable. “Patients with haematological malignancies are at highest risk. Their cancers directly affect their immune system. Thus, they fail to fight with the virus. Also, it has been observed that during therapies that it can cause severe myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression which reduces the production of blood cells) and lymphodepletion (destruction of lymphocytes and T cells),” said Dr S Chandrakala, haematologist, King Edward Memorial, Parel. “Studies have shown that patients with solid organ tumours have lower death rates,” she added. During the initial days of the lockdown, cancer services were largely disrupted which affected clinical research, diagnosis and delivery of treatment. In the first three months between March and May, the overall footfall of cancer patients decreased by almost 50%, according to oncologists. For instance, during April and May, TMH saw only 45% patients (60-70). The numbers are rising again and between August and September, the hospital got 150 new patients daily. Of these, 10-12 have co-infected patients. Before Covid-19, TMH would get over 200 patients a day. Lockdown travails Dr Neha Choudhary, 23-year-old, a medical student at Jaipur developed a large cancer tumour mass in her chest around her heart and lungs. It was making her breathless. She needed surgery immediately as chemotherapies also didn’t prove effective. But due to the lockdown, she couldn’t travel to Mumbai to get operated upon and had to wait for three months until June. Dr Anil Sanganeria, a surgical oncologist at Saifee Hospital, who operated upon her, said, “It was a common story of all cancer patients during lockdown. If it had not been removed, it would have caused her a life-threatening suffocation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-death-rate-among-mumbai-s-cancer-patients-stands-at-9-8-tata-memorial-hospital/story-vp6l1ppcX3pr2ju1cgMVqI.html

The accused, Sunil Tambe, and the victim, Sudhir, lived together at Khar Danda. Sudhir’s wife Anjali in her statement to police said, “The incident took place on October 18 when Sudhir, who had a handicap and did not go out for work, was shouting at his mother.” She said, “Around 10.50pm Tambe came home drunk. When he saw Sudhir shouting, he asked him why he was not amicable with others at home and why was it necessary for him to fight all the time.” Gajanan Kabdule, senior inspector from Khar police station, said, “After this both of them started arguing, during which Tambe picked up a grinding stone and warned that if Sudhir doesn’t listen to him and stop shouting, he will hit him with the stone.” “Sudhir did not listen and told Tambe to go ahead and hit him. After warning several times, Tambe smashed the grinding stone on Sudhir’s head. Sudhir started bleeding and was taken to Cooper Hospital,” Kabdule said.

01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Control inflating food prices: Himachal CPI (M)||Accusing the state and central governments of failing to curb the increasing inflation in the country, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders on Sunday demanded that the state government immediately withdraw the hiked prices and take concrete steps to curb the rising prices of food items in the market. A statement issued by the CPI (M) says the government has not been able to provide any relief to the public during the last seven months and has instead hiked the rates of petrol, diesel, ration, electricity, water, school and examination fee, property tax to name a few, which has put a huge financial burden on the general public.CPI (M) leader Sanjay Chauhan said that due to the government’s neglect, the prices of food items, including potatoes, onions, oil, vegetables and pulses, were at an all-time high but the government was not taking any appropriate steps to curb it. “Since the lockdown was imposed, millions of people have lost their jobs and employment and are facing economic and financial crisis. Recently, the state government hiked the rates of installing electricity meters and electricity connections and also granted permission to private schools to charge full fees, instead of charging only tuition fees. The policies of the Centre and state are only benefiting the corporate houses and capitalists due to which economic condition of our country is in a bad shape and GDP is at an all-time low,” he said.“If the government does not comply with these demands, then our party will mobilise the people against these anti-people policies and will launch a movement,” said Chauhan.CPI (M) has also demanded that the government provide ₹7,500 per month and 10 kg ration per person free of charge to all those outside the purview of income tax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/control-inflating-food-prices-himachal-cpi-m/story-EyRHO5qMlWnfEiVMPMdOVK.html

The arrested accused include 171 male and female patrons, two owners, three managers, a cashier and 19 workers employed in the pub, bar and cafe. The raid was conducted at 12.50am based on specific information received by deputy commissioner of police Dr Raju Bhujbal (enforcement). “A police team in civil clothes was sent to verify the complaint and found that music and dancing was going on inside the pub and the patrons were not maintaining social distancing,” said Dr Bhujbal. “In the bar and café, alcohol was served to the customers and the number of patrons was more than 50% seating capacity,” said DCP Dr Bhujbal. Restaurants and bars are currently allowed to operate at 50% seating capacity. The state government has been easing restrictions, which were imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19, in a phased manner and has also extended the ongoing lockdown restrictions till November 30.

01-11-2020||City||Capital adds 5,664 new Covid cases, 51 more deaths||New Delhi: The Capital on Sunday recorded 5,664 new cases of Covid-19 and 51 fatality, taking the toll to 6,562, as per state government’s daily health bulletin.So far, 392,370 people have contracted Covid-19 in the Capital, of whom 352,635 have recovered, the bulletin said.With 44,623 total tests recorded on Sunday, the positivity rate shot up to 12.69% — up from an average of 5.3% recorded for the week ending October 8. The positivity rate stood at 11.42% on Saturday.The case trajectory in Delhi shows three distinct surges. The first started in mid-June, and peaked when the seven-day average of daily cases, also known as the case trajectory, touched around 3,400 in the last week of June. This dropped to about 1,000 a day by the end of July. It remained in that range for a month, and the second surge started towards the end of August, rising till the middle of September, when average daily cases touched 4,174Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said on Sunday, “In Delhi, the contact-tracing strategy was revised around two weeks ago. Currently, more than 15 contacts are being tested for every Covid-19 positive case, as against six to seven contacts per case till two weeks ago. The aggressive strategy is bringing out more cases in terms of numbers.”“As far as preparations are concerned, last month, we added 1,000 ICU beds. Another order pertaining to reservation of 80% ICU beds in private hospitals for covid-19 cases is pending in court. At this point of time, people must wear masks and treat it like a vaccine till a real vaccine is available,” Jain added.On Sunday evening, 6,561 of the 15,783 Covid-19 general beds and 2,086 of 3,158 ICU beds were occupied across hospitals in the city, government records showed.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said, “The increased positivity rate indicates high transmission rate of the virus at this point. To some extent it also indicates that the government is currently testing a greater proportion of high-risk individuals, which include close contacts of Covid-19 positive cases. People should not let their guards down. They should strictly wear masks and maintain social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/capital-adds-5-664-new-covid-cases-51-more-deaths/story-SDg2n1efuO3Msf3KZCPFoJ.html

01-11-2020||Mumbai||Use ₹1.5 lakh fine from guilty couple for treatment of Covid-19 patients: Bombay HC to Latur district collector||The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently directed the Latur district collector to spend the ₹1.5 lakh fine deposited by a couple for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The couple was asked to pay the fine after the two were found guilty of forging dates on the birth certificates of their children as they were contesting local body elections. The court had observed that as the couple had shown scant regard for the law and had manipulated not only the certificates but also officials, they did not deserve to be pardoned and should deposit the fine amount with the court which would then be given to the district collector. A single judge bench of justice Ravindra V Ghuge, while hearing the application of the couple through advocate Suresh P Pandav, was informed that the couple was asked to pay the fine in March. However, in view of Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, they could not undertake inter-district travel and were unable to arrange and deposit the amount. In its earlier order, the court had ordered the disqualification of the couple from contesting any election for having more than two children after the cut-off date. Additional divisional commissioner disqualified the woman petitioner from her duty after the authority concluded that records of the two biological children (twins) born to the couple have been suppressed by the couple. As per a judgement of the full bench of the HC, the maximum number of children to be eligible for contesting zilla parishad and panchayat samiti polls was two and the cut-off for having more children was September 12, 2000. When the previous case against the couple had been heard in March, the single bench of justice Mangesh Patil had noted that the woman’s husband had approached the registrar of birth to obtain five birth certificates on a single day and it was ‘apparent’ that manipulations were done by him. While the first three children were shown born with a gap of two years each in 1994, 1996 and 1998, the twins were shown to be born in December, 2000 instead of their actual birth date of June 24, 2006. In light of the above, the court had refused the pardon request of the couple. “There appears to be mens rea (criminal intent) and a systematic planning in what has been done. It would be a mockery of law and justice to pardon such litigants, who have not only abused the process of law, but have shown scant respect for the majesty of law and have manipulated even government officials.” After observing that the twins were born to the couple in 2006, the court had disqualified the couple from contesting elections. The court also initiated criminal action against the couple and disciplinary action against the official who issued five birth certificates to petitioner’s husband and had directed the couple to pay a fine of ₹1 lakh with an additional fine of ₹50,000 for disobedience of court directions. In the present hearing, the couple submitted that the demand draft for the fine amount was ready and they were willing to deposit it with the HC registry. However, government lawyer RB Bagul opposed the application contending that the intention of application was to not obey the earlier court order and hence action should be initiated against the couple. After hearing the submissions, justice Ghuge allowed the application and directed them to submit the demand draft to the court registry as expeditiously as possible and directed the registrar to transfer the whole amount to Latur district collector. The district collector has been directed to utilise the same for the treatment of Covid-19 patients and disposed of the plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/use-1-5-lakh-fine-from-guilty-couple-for-treatment-of-covid-19-patients-bombay-hc-to-latur-district-collector/story-0E4Iq6BAuUn71oPId25mJN.html

01-11-2020||Mumbai||50,000 first-year junior college students from Maharashtra enrol for online classes||Nearly 50,000 students from the state have registered for free online classes for first-year junior college (FYJC) organised by the Maharashtra education department, which were started on Monday. With FYJC admissions still unable to restart due to the stay on Maratha quota in jobs and education, the education department decided to start online classes for students, irrespective of their admission status. “Until colleges begin, students can attend these lectures which will be held by expert teachers in each subject. We are hoping the numbers rise as more students get to know about the initiative,” said Dinkar Patil, director of secondary education. Students who wish to join the online classes can register on the department’s portal – covid19.scertmaha.ac.in/eleventh – and will later receive details about the time table and schedule for classes. All the classes will also be made available on YouTube Live, stated the education department. As of Sunday evening, nearly 9,500 students from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) had registered for the online classes. The education department has roped in several expert teachers to conduct these classes. Most registrations that have come so far are from students in the Science stream, followed by Commerce and Arts. Teachers, however, said that the online classes cannot be a solution for the admission limbo. “Students who are in FYJC are new to college, and especially in streams like Arts where every subject is new to them, they need to be taught with individual attention. Also, some students are not clear on which stream to choose and often wait for cut-offs before deciding. What classes will they attend?” asked the teacher from a suburban college.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/50-000-first-year-junior-college-students-from-maharashtra-enrol-for-online-classes/story-V7rzFXAsF1jXWxxeh3DG0O.html
01-11-2020||Mumbai||Fatality rate among senior citizens still a concern, reveals data from Mumbai civic body||While the overall Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) has come down below 4% to 3.97% as of Friday, the fatality rate for patients aged above 60 still remains a concern as it is not coming down yet, shows data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s dashboard. The age wise fatality rate for age groups above 60 is between 8% and 18%.The highest fatality rate is in the age group above 80 years. According to BMC data, of 10,218 deaths in Mumbai, more than 85% (8,731) deaths are aged above 50. The data further indicates that though maximum cases are from the younger age group (between 20 and 40 years), higher fatality remains to be from those aged above 60. According to the data, fatality rate for the age group of 60 to 69 is 8.51% followed by 12.87% for 70 to 79 age group, 17.64% for 80 to 89 age group, and 18.39% for those aged above 90, as of October 30. However, fatality rate of all the age groups has improved when the above data is compared with data from July. This also helped bring down the overall fatality rate from 5.5 % in August to 4.5% in September 20, and below 4% on October 31. BMC attributes this dip in fatality rate to its ‘Mission Save Lives’ launched in June to bring down the city’s CFR. On June 30, the civic body launched a nine-point strategy called ‘Mission Save Lives’ after the city’s fatality rate had touched 5.8% on June 29. The plan included an audit of every death, video surveillance of every critical and serious case, and mandatory video conferencing or telephonic meeting twice a day to review every serious case at the hands of senior doctors, among other things. Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant, said, “The reason why the age group of over 60 continues to have higher fatalities is because of the comorbidity factor. Most of those aged above 60 have hypertension or diabetes, and when these patients report late or not report the symptoms of Covid-19 at all, there is death. The focus has to be on senior citizens whenever the vaccine arrives, considering the data is clear about who needs it first.” One of the key factors that resulted in bringing down CFR was to increase testing in the city, and subsequently from July 7, BMC liberalised its testing policy by allowing any citizen to get tested. Also, starting Monday, BMC is going to organise 244 daily testing camps for two hours wherein citizens can walk in and get tested for free. The citizens can call 1916 and get the location of their nearest testing camp. The testing camps will be operating between 10am to 12noon. Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC, said, “We are increasing daily testing by organising free testing camps. This will help us control the spread until a vaccine is found.” Earlier, on Friday BMC had said that one cannot say there will not be any surge in Covid-19 cases keeping in mind the unlocking measures, and the fact that local trains are expected to start for all citizens in coming days, along with Diwali. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 taskforce, on Friday had told HT, “The spread and overall situation will increase with more testing. We need to do more testing with more unlocking. BMC has been conducting tests to its full capacity, and they will increase their capacity in the coming days.” As of October 30, BMC has conducted a 15.26 lakh tests with a positivity rate of 16.80%. Meanwhile, on Sunday, the city reported 908 new Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 258,405 while 25 new deaths took toll to 10,318. Till Sunday, 229,025 patients have been discharged in Mumbai. The city’s discharge rate is 88.63%. There are 18,522 active cases in the city and the fatality rate is 3.99%. One hot spot that has shown signs of drastic improvement is Dharavi which recorded only four new cases on Sunday. Dharavi’s tally is 3,551, of which 3,139 have been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fatality-rate-among-senior-citizens-still-a-concern-reveals-data-from-mumbai-civic-body/story-cmnSFMXt1E1kedLUSyeUiK.html
01-11-2020||Mumbai||Air quality worsens in Mumbai; BKC, Malad record ‘very poor’ AQI||The city recorded a spike in air pollution on Sunday, with two locations recording ‘very poor’ air quality.The pollutant-measuring indicator – air quality index (AQI) – shot up to 156 (moderate) for PM2.5 pollutant (particulate matter that can enter the lungs and cause ailments), according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). This is the worst AQI since before the Covid-19 lockdown in March. On Saturday, the AQI was 111 (moderate), and on March 19, it was 130 (moderate). On March 17, the AQI was 272 (poor), and on March 18 it was 172 (moderate).On Sunday, of the 10 locations where AQI is monitored and predicted, Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and Malad recorded ‘very poor’ AQI at 325 and 301, respectively. Mazgaon (156), Chembur (139), and Navi Mumbai (121), all recorded ‘moderate’ AQI, while the remaining areas recorded ‘satisfactory’ levels.SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. An AQI of 97 (satisfactory) has been predicted for Monday.Researchers said air quality worsened due to falling temperatures. “The increase in air pollution can be attributed to the change in meteorological conditions, with the minimum temperature dropping below the normal mark in Mumbai during early hours of the day. This is allowing pollutants to be suspended close to the surface. However, human-induced factors such as vehicular pollution are aggravating levels in areas like BKC and Malad,” said Gufran Beig, project director, SAFAR. He added that levels are expected to remain in the ‘moderate’ category for the next week and may further deteriorate if temperatures continue to drop.On Sunday, the concentration for PM10 (larger coarser particles) was 122 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³), against the safe limit of 100μg/m³ for 24 hours. PM2.5 levels were 68μg/m³ against the safe limit of 60μg/m³ for the 24-hour mark.

It was the 15th consecutive day when less than 10,000 cases were recorded. After a steady decrease over the past weeks, the number of active cases slightly increased to 125,109, which means that at present, 7.43% of patients are receiving treatment at various hospitals and Covid-19 care centres in the state.On Sunday, the state death toll breached the 44,000 mark with 113 casualties reported in the last 24 hours. The toll stood at 44,024, health officials said.As the state has been recording a downward trend in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, it has also recorded a slight drop in related deaths. In the last week of October, 759 mortalities were reported, as opposed to the previous week when 1,187 deaths were reported.In early October, it took three days for the death count to increase by 1,000. It has now stretched to nine days as the state crossed the 43,000-mark of Covid deaths on October 23. Maharashtra crossed the 42,000-mark on October 18, 41,000 deaths on October 15, 40,000 deaths on October 10, 39,000 deaths on October 7, 38,000 deaths on October 4 and 39,000 deaths on October 1, according to statistics by the state health department.Despite a decline in cases, the number of deaths has not reduced in the same ratio. As a result, the case fatality rate (CFR) is yet to come down. Maharashtra has maintained second position in the country, after Punjab, with a CFR of 2.61%. The CFR of Punjab was 3.14% (with 4,203 deaths) till Saturday, according to the information shared by the state medical education department.Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state-appointed task force for the clinical management of critical patients said that the number of deaths in the first 24 to 48 hours of testing positive has come down but they have yet to confirm if the deaths occurring in the second or third week have reduced.“There is a bimodal pattern for Covid-19 deaths. In the first pattern, patients die within the first 24 to 48 hours, or they succumb to the illness in the second or third week. As per our observation, the number of deaths occurring in the first pattern has declined, but for the second pattern, we need to wait for a week or more to examine if there is a drop. If there is a drop proportionate to the cases, then we can say that the deaths from the second pattern are also going down. But if not, then we need to make sure that comorbid patients are taken care, and secondary infection problems in patients, if any, have to be recognised,” said Dr Pandit, who is also the director, critical care at Fortis Hospital, Mulund.Mumbai continues to record the highest number of cases in the state, with 908 fresh infections reported on Sunday. The case count now stands at 258,405. The number of active cases in the city reduced to 18,522 and the city’s toll reached 10,318 after 25 casualties were reported on Sunday.Pune city contributed the second-highest number of daily infections in the state with 346 cases, taking its tally to 172,575.Pune district recorded 278 cases, pushing its case count to 77,492.The state has completed 90 lakh Covid-19 tests with 57,468 conducted on Sunday.

01-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram abandons caution despite Covid surge||Social distancing and wearing masks seem to have taken a back seat for city residents, who are crowding shopping areas, buses, parks and other parts of the city without taking necessary precautions to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The number of Covid-19 cases has surged drastically over the last few days, with the active case count currently at 3,707, as of Sunday. The district also reported a record single-day spike in cases — 529 new cases on Sunday — since the outbreak of the pandemic. In the last 10 days, the positivity rate of Gurugram has remained at about 12%, higher than the positivity rate recorded in August and September.Studies show that preventive measures, such as maintaining six feet distance and mask discipline, are important to practice as the virus spreads when an infected person talks, sneezes or coughs. Even an asymptomatic Covid-19 patient can equally spread infection.Despite the only solutions to handle pandemic, photos captured by HT show many, without masks, crowding the Khandsa wholesale market. Visitors to the Leisure Valley Park in Sector 29 were also captured on lens walking close to one another, without wearing masks.Similarly, the situation of local buses and in city markets reflect the current attitude of city residents towards the pandemic.According to the health department officials, behavioural change is required to slow down Covid-19 cases. “Visit any market in the evening and one can see people are no longer scared of the coronavirus. Cases will continue to rise as more people are moving out due to festival shopping or work,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.The precautionary norms for Covid-19 are self-regulatory, said Vinay Yadav, district secretary, Haryana Agriculture Marketing Board (HAMB), in charge of Khandsa mandi. “Social distancing and masks cannot be enforced upon anyone, especially in wholesale markets like Khandsa. The department has not issued any challan till now, owing to the rush in the market. The majority of the people coming to Khandsa are least careful about masks and social distancing even if our teams try to explain (importance of norms) to them.”With markets witnessing a spurt in footfall due to the festive season, those running shops and trade associations said that people are only cautious to avoid being penalised for not wearing masks, and that most of them are not concerned about the virus.Tej Singh, president, Vyapar Kendra association, said, “People are callous in wearing mask and maintaining physical distance. There is no fear among them unless they see police issuing challans for not wearing masks. Since people are actively coming to market for festival shopping, we have told the shopkeepers to practice safety norms. It is, however, difficult to keep an eye on everyone.”The president Udyog Vihar phase 1 market association, Harinder Rana, agreed with Singh. “There has been no social distancing in markets. Some are defiant in wearing masks. But nothing can be said to them.”The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) has issued about 30,000 fines for mask violation, of which 12,000 fines were issued from August till October. Almost Rs 15 lakh has been collected in challans, according to MCG officials, but people still continue to flout norms.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they are issuing fines of Rs 500 to those found not wearing a facemask. Each station house officer has been directed to ensure there should be no gathering of more than 50 people in areas under their jurisdiction. “Awareness campaigns are going on in all the sectors through resident welfare association members and we are appealing to the residents not to move without masks and to maintain social distancing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-abandons-caution-despite-covid-surge/story-XQHGQAwMEGK0CrFf2nbDQJ.html

01-11-2020||Mumbai||40-year-old dupes government official of ₹61 lakh after promising medical seat for daughter, held in Mumbai||A 40-year-old man was arrested on October 30 by the airport police at Vile Parle on Sunday for allegedly duping a government official of ₹61.25 lakh on the pretext of getting his daughter an admission to a medical college in Pune. According to the police, the official’s 18-year-old daughter was seeking admission to a medical college for the MBBS course. Though she had appeared for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) exam, she was unable to secure a seat owing to low scores. “Her father came in a contact with the accused, Sudip Syama Chakrabarty, who promised the official that he has good contacts in reputed colleges. They then later met at Vile Parle, where Chakrabarty asked for ₹30 lakh as a token amount so that the admission process could be initiated,” said an officer from the airport police station. The accused later asked the government official on various pretexts for the admissions and until September, he had taken a total amount of ₹61.25. However, there was no progress in the admission process of the aspirant, the officer said. “The official later searched for the accused’s name on the internet and discovered a news article in which a man with the same was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police for duping several students, collectively to the tune of ₹1 crore, by promising them seats in medical colleges. The official then approached the police,” the officer said. Following the official’s complaint, the police registered a case under sections 419 (punishment for cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 120 (B) [punishment of criminal conspiracy], and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 66 (C) [punishment for identity theft], and 66 (D) [punishment for cheating by personation by using computer resource] of Information Technology Act. The police traced Chakrabarty to Versova and arrested him. He was produced before a local court, which remanded him in police custody till November 2. The police are looking for two of his accomplices. “Chakrabarty is a history-sheeter and there are more than eight cases of cheating registered against him at Goregaon, Oshiwara and Bangur Nagar stations in Mumbai as well as at Kothrud (Pune) and Hanehalli (Karnataka) police stations and the Jammu and Kashmir crime branch.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/40-year-old-dupes-government-official-of-61-lakh-after-promising-medical-seat-for-daughter-held-in-mumbai/story-fxiFfWdnusiQKY9lwLrPgI.html

01-11-2020||Gurugram||Online classes for college students to start from November 2||The state higher education department plans to start online classes for college students from November 2, while physical classroom sessions may start from November 16 in a staggered manner, said officials on Saturday. Last month, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had shared a revised academic calendar in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. As per the amended calendar proposed by UGC, the new academic session of 2020-21 may commence from November 1 for first-year students. Haryana’s academic calendar is expected to be on the lines of the proposed UGC calender. Hemant Verma, deputy director (coordination), higher education department, said that while online classes were already taking places in some colleges across the state, formal classes as per the revised academic calendar will start from November 2. “The academic schedule had to be modified this year to incorporate the delays that were caused due to the pandemic. Currently, admissions are underway in higher education institutes in all states. Results of some examinations are also awaited due to which the commencement of the academic session might take some time,” said Verma. He said while online classes would start from November 2, physical classes would take place in a phased manner, as part of which students facing queries will be able to visit colleges and universities post-Diwali. “We can expect the regular classes to start from November 16. The semester is expected to continue until March next year. The second semester might start in April and continue till August,” said Verma Pooja Khullar, principal Dronacharya college, said that while classes through EDUSAT had been initiated earlier, formal online classes were yet to be started as per the academic calendar. “We are expecting colleges to open from November 16. With the pandemic disrupting the normal academic calendar, adjustments needed to be made to complete the semester. Whenever physical classroom sessions are initiated, they will take place in a staggered manner. Classes may take place in batches on two days,” said Khullar.She said while the schedule for online classes had not been shared so far, some teachers have already been conducting online classes. “Some teachers have uploaded lecture videos on YouTube. Students have also been responding to these classes, especially at the post-graduate level,” said Khullar. Classes at the undergraduate level are yet to take off for all courses. Due to the ongoing admission formalities, not all staff members had been able to conduct online classes.“Hundreds of students are coming for open counselling due to which even the teaching staff has been put on duty. We have appointed staff members to keep a check on discipline and enforcement of social distancing rules. Once the counselling and subsequent admission formalities are over, the staff will be in a position to create a structured lesson plans for online classes,” said Khullar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/online-classes-for-college-students-to-start-from-november-2/story-KBjrJleZDk1M6hbwEEt2WN.html
01-11-2020||Gurugram||26 people arrested for betting on IPL match||Twenty six men were arrested from different residential areas of Gurugram late on Saturday evening in police raids for running a betting racket involving an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket match. Six others managed to escape, said the police. The raids were conducted after the police received a tip-off regarding this online betting racket. Since the start of the festival season and the beginning of the IPL tournament, the police have come down heavily on various betting rackets operating in the city. Since the beginning of the tournament last month, separate raids have been conducted at 24 different locations across the city. These include Manesar, Sohna Road, Badshshpur, DLF phases 1 and 4, Palam Vihar, Sushant Lok , South City 1 and 2, and sectors 56, 57, 45, 107, 51 and 69. All the suspects have been booked under relevant sections of the Public Gambling Act. The alleged bookmakers had been on the police radar since the IPL began on September 19.On Saturday, the crime branch of Gurugram Police received a tip-off about bookmakers, operating from different areas, who had taken bets on a match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). The police formed raiding teams and arrested the suspects, while they were taking bets over the phone during the match. Six mobile phones, a notebook, a laptop and a pen were recovered from their possession. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that typically, such betting takes place whenever a domestic or international sports league is underway. This year, the start of several sporting tournaments, which usually take place during the summer months, was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. With sports returning to television, networks of illegal betting operations, have once again become operational. In most cases of betting, the modus operandi is the largely the same, said police officials. Typically during a live match, the suspects are connected to a live line where one of their ‘contacts’ is physically present at the match location. He informs them about the odds over phone. The ‘local’ bookmaker takes bets from the punters — people who place bets. There is an entire chain of bookmakers who communicate over the phone. The odds keep changing as the match progresses. Sangwan said, “We are cracking down on all such illegal operations and more arrests are likely. The probe so far has found that these bookmakers take bets on all such sporting activities. They mostly use encrypted communication and have contact with fellow bookmakers at different locations. We are trying to crackdown on the whole network.” “Since betting is a bailable offence, several accused return to gambling after they are released. It is yet to be established if the accused in these 10 cases have a common link or they were running independent operations. Ten separate FIRs have been registered at respective police stations,” said Sangwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/26-people-arrested-for-betting-on-ipl-match/story-X4lToKyzmLaqeoityuCEVM.html

The CM inaugurated the flyover through video conferencing from Karnal. Speaking on the occasion, Khattar said with the opening of this flyover, one more step has been taken towards making Gurugram free from traffic congestion.Khattar said that this three-lane flyover has been constructed at a cost of about ₹52 crore and will provide relief to both the residents of Gurugram and commuters coming from outside. “This will help in preventing traffic congestion and facilitate U-turn for vehicles coming from Delhi and travelling towards Jaipur. It will also prevent vehicles coming from the side of DLF Cyber City or Ambience Mall from accidentally moving towards Udyog Vihar or Delhi. Besides, it will also help in reducing pollution and saving time of commuters,” said Khattar.Citing various steps taken by the state and Central governments, Khattar said issues of congestion and traffic jams at Iffco Chowk, Signature Tower and Rajeev Chowk have been resolved by constructing underpasses and improving road intersections on NH-48. Similarly, the flyover at Hero Honda Chowk has also helped it to make congestion-free. Likewise, this U-turn flyover will also make Shankar Chowk free from traffic snarls. Khattar added that a four-lane U-turn underpass is also being constructed on NH- 48 near Ambience Mall, which is at the final stages of its construction. The total estimated cost of these projects — the U-turn flyover and the underpass near Ambience Mall— is approximately ₹122 crore. Out of these two, the flyover has been completed at a cost of about ₹52 crore. The cost of the entire project is being borne by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the state government in a 75:25 ratio. During the e-inauguration, NHAI project director Shashi Bhushan said that the flyover is 675 metres in length and 12.5 metres in width. He added that despite the challenge of Covid-19 lockdown, the construction of this flyover has been completed within the stipulated time period of 18 months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-cm-inaugurates-u-turn-flyover-at-shankar-chowk/story-T6DtGqAal7ST8rZV3anzKL.html
01-11-2020||Gurugram||Three, including Bhondsi inmates, arrested for supplying drugs||The police on Saturday night arrested three men, including two Bhondsi Jail inmates, for allegedly supplying drugs to the jail warder for over three months, said the police. According to the police, the suspects were identified as Inderjeet alias Churri, Deepak alias Deepu, and Pradeep alias Doctor of Rewari. The police said Inderjeet and Deepak are already lodged inside Bhondsi Jail for supplying drugs and mobile phones and were taken on production remand by the police on Saturday. Pradeep was arrested from Rewari. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the suspects were involved in selling drugs and mobiles to the inmates inside the Bhondsi Jail through Prem Chand, the jail warder, who is already behind the bars. “Last month, we had arrested two people including the jail warder. We recovered 110 grams of sulfa and 24 grams of smack in a packet from their possession,” he said. Sangwan said that one of the inmates, identified as Deepak alias Deepu, is lodged inside Bhondsi Jail for over 10 cases of loot, drugs , assault and smuggle of mobile phones. “Deepu had contacted his brother, Dharambeer alias Mota of Rewari, via a mobile phone from Bhondsi Jail to request for drugs through the jail warder. He had arranged for the drugs to be sent to his brother through one Ankit Kumar. However, the jail warder was caught before he could enter the jail premises and the consignment was recovered,” he said. Sangwan said the crime investigation unit of DLF Phase-4 was keeping a close watch on the jail warder after the arrest of 53-year-old deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of Bhondsi Jail in July for allegedly smuggling drugs and supplying SIM cards to inmates over the last two years. A raid party was formed, and the police recovered 240 grams of sulfa and 11 SIM cards from his government accommodation in Bhondsi. “Chand was posted inside the jail premises 10 days ago. Earlier, he was posted in the surveillance room to monitor CCTV cameras but was transferred due to a change of staff to keep a close watch on inmates and their movements,” said Sangwan. The police said smuggling of drugs, mobile phones and SIM cards is increasing inside jail premises, and various means are being adapted for the purpose. The inmates plan crimes under the influence of drugs and connect with their aides outside the jail to execute criminal activities, such as extortion, murder, loot and dacoity. Sangwan said inmates contact their close aides outside the jail through mobile phones and order drugs, for which they coordinate with jail officials. “Smuggling of drugs inside jail premises has increased in recent times. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, inmates are being produced to courts through video conferencing and are, therefore, unable to get drugs during their court visits.Further, visitors are also not allowed inside the jail premises any longer, forcing inmates to look for alternate means for their supply of drugs,” he said. The police have arrested six people so far in this case, three of whom have been produced before the local court and sent to judicial custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/three-including-bhondsi-inmates-arrested-for-supplying-drugs/story-tRe2bH4KLlcc5NlVhhjf8J.html
01-11-2020||Gurugram||MCG seeks land from developers in lieu of revenue roads||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) in a survey has found that there are 47 revenue roads being occupied by private developers across the city. The MCG has now initiated the process of sending notices to builders to give land amounting to the same monetary value to the MCG, in exchange for “legally” taking over revenue roads or else face legal action.Last month, during an MCG House meeting, the agenda allowing the exchange of MCG’s revenue roads with the land of private builders, amounting to the same monetary value was approved. Following this, the MCG initiated the survey to identify revenue roads occupied by builders across Gurugram, more than 12 years after its formation.The issue regarding revenue roads is a long-standing one. Originally built with the aim of providing connectivity between villages and agriculture fields, such stretches have been completely engulfed by private townships, condominiums or gated societies over time.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the city urbanised significantly, resulting in village land being sold to private builders and revenue roads being occupied from all sides and becoming redundant.As per MCG officials, during their survey, they found most of such stretches located next to urban villages, with each of them having a high real estate value.“From the survey, we have details of each and every revenue road in the city. MCG joint commissioners, in their respective jurisdictions, have sent notices to private developers on at least two occasions. We will be issuing another notice, the third one, after which we will initiate necessary action as per the law to reclaim revenue roads from builders,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG.MCG has already received a proposal from private builders to take over their land in Garhi Harsaru, in exchange for the civic body’s revenue roads in Sihi and Ghata villages respectively.With developers or resident welfare associations (RWAs) unable to “legally” barricade or fence revenue roads, such stretches also become a matter of security concern in several residential areas.“Revenue roads have been a major issue in the city, not only for builders but for residents as well. While we want such stretches to be transferred to private builders, we want the MCG to put a clause with private developers that they cannot charge any collection fees from residents in any regard, both for the taking over process or for any future construction on such stretches as these are being developed much later than residential projects have been built,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Gurgaon Citizens Council, an umbrella body for all RWAs in the city.Although the MCG House approved the land exchange policy only last month, it was in March 2018 that the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB) issued a notification allowing the exchange of revenue roads for private land of the same value. A month later, MCG also wanted to introduce this policy, with internal discussions on the matter taking place among officials. However, it largely remained on paper and never came to fruition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-seeks-land-from-developers-in-lieu-of-revenue-roads/story-Pc9zBX2qYhFa0zjQrDKS2L.html
01-11-2020||Gurugram||DTCP seeks applications to licence affordable housing projects||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has started seeking applications for licencing real estate projects under the affordable housing category. The department issued a notice on October 27 and has given one month to interested developers, who want to develop affordable housing projects. The development follows the decision of Haryana government to increase the area earmarked for affordable projects to almost double of what was available earlier. The state government in August had increased the area available for affordable category from 15 to 30 acres. As per a rough estimate by the department, around 1,500 acres of land would be available for affordable housing in Manesar alone, which would make space for an additional 40,000 to 50,000 flats. Developers whose applications were rejected earlier would also be considered again if the deficiencies are rectified. As per the Haryana government norms, affordable housing licence can be given for a minimum of five acres and the size of the apartment is to be fixed between 28 square metres (330 sq ft) and 60 square metres (645 sq ft).The affordable housing policy was launched by the Haryana government in 2013 to promote low-cost housing and make it accessible to the lower-middle class. The price at which these plots can be sold is fixed at ₹4,000 per sq ft.“The affordable housing sector has been attracting lot of developers and this is the reason the state government has changed area norms. More houses in the affordable segment will give more option to buyers to purchase houses at a reasonable price. This is a positive move of the state government,” said RS Bhath, district town planner, enforcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-seeks-applications-to-licence-affordable-housing-projects/story-xbaub8Od35tenxnVmpAZCM.html
01-11-2020||City||Bathinda doc improvises implant for breast cancer survivors||Bathinda To help women patients overcome emotional challenges of post-mastectomy or surgical removal of the breast, oncological surgeon Dr Parvinder Singh has improvised a breast prosthesis (artificial body part). Posted at the Advanced Cancer Institute (ACI), the only state-run institute dedicated to cancer treatment in the state, the doctor has already distributed 70 of these to survivors of breast cancer.Made from simple foam and fabric, he got the prosthesis stitched from a local tailor. “An external silicon prosthesis costs about Rs 10,000 and most patients at ACI cannot afford it. It is also heavy and leads to perspiration and irritation. Cloth-based prosthesis is comfortable and will give confidence to breast cancer survivors,” he said. ACI medical superintendent Dr Deepak Arora credits his surgeon colleague with taking a proactive social initiative. “Apart from the trauma accompanying the diagnosis of cancer, the pain, scars and side-effect of treatment is an emotional and challenging time for survivors and patients. Most of our patients hail from the rural background or are from economically marginalised sections. They cannot afford external or internal breast implants,” said Arora.Dr Parvinder learnt about this possibility from a US-based voluntary organisation ‘Knitted Knockers’ that tipped him about handmade breast prosthesis for women during a professional webinar.“To suit their cold climate, Knitted Knockers were knitting wool-based prosthesis. After getting complimentary samples from the US, I discussed the concept with my mother and wife. Finally, the idea of an inexpensive fabric-based prosthesis took shape. I took the assistance of a tailor to make about 150 prostheses from cloth. This is softer, lighter, washable and more comfortable than silicon,” said Dr Parvinder.He added, “If a doctor has to decide between a complete or partial removal of the breast, it impacts a woman emotionally. In our male-dominated society, breast implant or external prosthesis does not even become a point of discussion in most cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bathinda-doc-improvises-implant-for-breast-cancer-survivors/story-9CJuoVmn0QxpYfSncCm46N.html

Sunday’s reading was, however, an improvement from the previous day’s AQI reading of 358 in the same category. The level of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 — the city’s primary pollutant — was 360.52µg/m³ on Sunday, as per the data recorded by CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. As per the CPCB’s classification, an AQI reading between 301 to 400 is categorised as ‘very poor’ and can lead to breathlessness and respiratory illnesses in cases of prolonged exposure. According to the early air quality warning system for the National Capital Region (NCR), the air quality is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday. The air quality is expected to deteriorate marginally but nonetheless remain in the ‘very poor’ category on Tuesday as well. As per the warning system, a significantly large number of fire counts were observed over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Sunday during the daytime, which is likely to impact the air quality over Delhi/NCR. However, a higher wind speed and better ventilation index were favourable for dispersal of pollutants till Monday. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional weather forecasting centre, said that air quality has improved due to a higher wind speed over the past few days and better air could prevail till Monday.On Sunday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 29 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was recorded at 11 degrees Celsius, roughly five degrees below the normal and a degree below Saturday’s minimum temperature. Both the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to be in a similar range on Monday. Clear skies during the day with fog and mist in the morning are expected to prevail this week, as per the IMD’s weekly forecast. “The fall in minimum temperature will continue as we move into November and the winter sets in. The sky is also clear due to which there is a cooling effect,” said Srivastava||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-air-still-very-poor-minimum-temperature-dips-five-degrees-below-normal/story-HEXPUYxHKTrpT6KU8KSdOO.html
01-11-2020||City||3 booked for duping Mumbai-based woman of ₹13 lakh by promising to cure her daughter’s illness through rituals||Mumbai A 70-year-old from Mazagaon was cheated of ₹13 lakh by three men from Uttar Pradesh (UP) who duped her on the pretext of curing her mentally ill daughter by performing rituals in an ashram. The Sewri police are on the lookout for the three men. According to the police, the complainant’s 43-year-old daughter has been undergoing treatment for the illness for the past 25 years. The complainant has been exploring all possible options for the treatment of her daughter and had performed several kinds of pujas for her daughter to get cured. She used to thus often get phone calls from priests, said the police. Last year in November, the complainant received a call from a man, identified as Krishnanand Shastri. He told the complainant that he works in a UP-based ashram, where many people suffering from several serious illnesses were cured. Shashtri told the complainant that he knew about her daughter’s illness and offered to provide cure for it by reciting prayers and performing a special puja at the ashram. The complainant agreed and in December 2019, Shastri asked her to pay ₹5,000 for the puja. She transferred the money into his bank account, stated the police complaint filed by the woman. Later, Shastri began calling her frequently and under the pretext of conducting rituals asked her to deposit money in his account, the police said. Seeing no progress in her daughter’s condition, the woman began raising suspicion about Shastri. When he called her the next time, she refused to pay him. He then threatened her and said that if she stops the puja abruptly, her daughter would end her life and her family would face several serious problems. Worried about the consequences, the woman continued transferring the money into Shastri’s account, the complaint stated. This year in April, the woman received a call from a man named Vinod Kumar who informed her that he was the man who was calling for so many months by posing as Shashtri. He also told the complainant that he was doing so at the behest of two people – Abhishek Pandey and Prashant Pandey – who have been duping her under the pretext of performing puja for her daughter’s illness, said the police. The woman then filed a police complaint, following which a first information report (FIR) under sections 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 3 of Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and Other Inhuman, Unwholesome and Aghori Practices and Witchcraft Act, 2013 was filed against Pandey and Prashant. “We suspect that someone known to the family may have helped the fraudsters in learning about the illness of the complainant’s daughter. We are in the process of obtaining the details of the transactions and will try to locate the suspects based on the information provided by the bank,” an officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-booked-for-duping-mumbai-based-woman-of-13-lakh-by-promising-to-cure-her-daughter-s-illness-through-rituals/story-tMqEvkDRGcELfdp1F5uUuI.html
01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Citing winter, Chandigarh MC puts off road recarpeting work again||Work to begin after March next year; earlier, the civic body had postponed it due to Covid-induced lockdown and monsoon After Covid-19 lockdown and monsoon, the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) has hit another hurdle in starting road repair and recarpeting works in the city—the onset of winters.MC officials say they will now be able to start road repairs for the current financial year (2020-2021) only by the end of February or March, when the winter season ends. The civic body has not even finished last year’s pending works, worth Rs 23 crore, the deadline for which has now been revised to November-end. Speaking at the general house meeting on October 29, MC commissioner KK Yadav stated that MC would complete the pending road works from the previous years. “But for this year’s road recarpeting, work will start after winter season ends. MC will prioritise road recarpeting as per the condition of a road.” He also directed the MC engineering department officials to consult councillors while making the priority list of roads which require urgent repairs. Even with funds, MC can’t complete workThe delay in road recarpeting comes even though the UT administration has allocated dedicated funds for the work. The MC had floated 13 tenders worth ₹40 crore in June but failed to get any bidders. It re-invited the applications by floating the tenders again in July. The tendering process is still going on.“The delay in road recarpeting work is not because of paucity of funds. Earlier, the tender couldn’t be floated because of the pandemic outbreak Later when the lockdown was eased and the work from previous years for resumed the monsoon hit the city. While MC has now started road repair works pending from the last year, the allotment of tenders for this year’s road work is still under process. Even if these are allotted, the work is unlikely to start till February/March 2021,” said an MC official.Of around, Rs 33 crore allocated last year for financial year 2019-2020, the MC has completed works worth Rs 10 crore while works worth Rs 23 crore are still outstanding. The MC plans to complete this by November-end.Questioning the way the MC is approaching the road recparting work in the city, Vinod Vashisht, convener of the City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations (CFORWO),said, “While dilapidated roads in the city are not being repaired, the MC has taken up the recarpeting of paid parking areas. Similarly, roads in good conditions are being repaired. Also, roads repaired only a few months back have already started to break.”Criticising the MC for its failure to complete road repair works, Hitesh Puri, chairman, Chandigarh Resident Association Welfare Federation, said, “Generally, MC officials give excuse that they don’t have funds but in this case, they have abundant funds and still can’t finish the work. They should at least complete the repair of V6 roads.”105 roads to get attentionIn the current financial year, as many as 105 major and minor city roads will get the MC’s attention, officials said. On 61 roads, major recarpeting will be undertaken, while 44 roads will undergo repair and maintenance. Widening of some existing roads will also be carried out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/citing-winter-mc-puts-off-road-recarpeting-work-again/story-pOq1ObDZjvWB2HL0WOrudN.html

01-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 pandemic to hit Centre’s ambitious regional connectivity scheme Udan||Udan, or Udey Desh Ka Aam Naagarik (Udan, let the common man fly), was launched by the civil aviation ministry in October 2016 with the objectives of connecting Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities and the hinterland with the metros, making air travel affordable, improving regional connectivity and developing regional airports.Four years on, the ambitious initiative has made little headway in achieving its objectives because of tardy implementation and the lackadaisical attitude of state governments and hit now by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic that has curtailed flights to 45-to-60% of their pre-outbreak levels.Even so, the aviation ministry went ahead and announced 78 new Udan routes in late August. Data from the Airports Authority of India (AAI) accessed by HT show that only one-third — 285 of 766 — routes opened to Udan operators earlier are operational. AAI is overseeing the implementation of the scheme. For instance, in Maharashtra, only 28 of the 48 routes had been made operational until February. With airlines currently struggling to fly at their full capacity even on profit-making routes in the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, Udan is likely to take a worse hit, officials said.“It will take a minimum of two years for passenger traffic under the scheme to go back to the pre-Covid level. There are routes such as Belgaum-Chennai that were witnessing good passenger traffic and are now facing issues, which implies that confidence-building measures are required,” said a senior AAI official, requesting anonymity.-Airlines like SpiceJet, Alliance Air, Air Odisha, Air Deccan, Pawan Hans, Trujet, Zoom Air and IndiGo are the airline’s that participated in UDAN. Few UDAn routes include: Delhi- Shimla- Delhi, Mumbai- Kandla-Mumbai, Jaipur- Jaisalmer- Jaipur, Delhi- Pathankot- Delhi, Pantanagar- Dehradun- Pantnagar, Hubli- Chennai- Hubli, Hyderabad- Nasik- Hyderabad, Cochin- Kannur- Cochin, Pithoragarh- Hindan- Pithoragarh, Allahabad- Pune- Allahabad, Amritsar- Jaipur- Amritsar, Gwalior- Bengaluru- Gwalior, Guwahati- Dimapur- Guwahati, Rajahmundry- Vishakhapatnam- RajahmundryAfter Udan was announced in October 2016, the first flight under the initiative took off in April 2017. Fares for flights were capped at ₹2,500 per hour. Airlines were asked to offer half their seats at discounted rates. In return, the government offered a subsidy or viability gap funding -- the difference between the cost of operations and the return earned -- to airlines. To be sure, Udan has had problems right from its inception, Covid-19 is only the latest blow. The official cited above said: “Even before the pandemic hit India, few airlines participated in Udan. Before Covid-19, airlines did not have adequate aircraft in their fleet for regional routes. With the pandemic, both the aircraft manufacturing industry and their deliveries have been impacted, leading to a shortage of planes which will not be resolved anytime soon.”Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, operated flights to only 64 of its total 200 (around 35%) Udan routes before the pandemic. Chief operating officer CS Subbiah said it would take a long time to get back to pre-Covid operations.“For Alliance Air, 70% of our pre-Covid Udan flights have commenced after domestic operations resumed. The rest is yet to start, mostly due to restricted air movements and different mandatory quarantine rules in various states which is an issue. Though the number of passengers wanting to travel these days has reduced, the situation is better than what it was in June,” said Subbiah.In Phase 1 of Udan, 128 routes were allotted to the airlines. Another 325 routes were opened up in January 2018. In the third phase, 235 routes were announced in January 2019, and 78 new routes were announced on August 27 this year under the fourth phase. These routes are spread over mainly the northeast, hilly areas and islands, thereby also adding helicopters and seaplanes.According to the ministry of civil aviation, 285 routes connecting 45 airports and three heliports had been operationalised until September 29, 2020. These include 10 seaplane routes too.Experts say Udan also suffered because of the shutting down of a few airlines in addition to infrastructural issues such as land acquisitions and delays in construction of runways and terminal buildings at regional airport sites. Air Odisha and Jet Airways, for instance, have been grounded. Similarly, airlines such as Air Deccan and Zoom Air failed to operationalise most of the routes they won. SpiceJet is yet to commence operations on two seaplane routes it won.Acceptance by and involvement of all state governments is required for successful implementation of Udan, said Kinjal Shah, vice-president at ICRA, a rating company.“As long as state governments are in compliance and in acceptance of the scheme, success rates are higher. But like in past, in cases where it is otherwise, the success rates of the schemes are limited because not all do want to participate in those subsidies etc.,” said Shah.She added, “The pandemic is also adding to the situation. Currently, profit-making routes, too, are struggling. It will take more than a year for the situation to stabilise, but it would depend on the state governments’ involvement. ”There has also been a delay in commencing flights from many airports such as Solapur, Kolhapur and Sindhudurg. Although work on the infrastructure at Solapur airport has been completed, operations have not begun after the AAI detected a chimney obstructing the flight path. AAI had, in 2018, written to the Maharashtra government to sort out the issue, which hasn’t been fixed yet.Requesting anonymity, a senior official of an airline that had to pause its flights under Udan said: “Government policies are not aligned to support the complex nature of the scheme. Besides, infrastructure is absent in many airports in addition to unrealistic regulations.”Subbiah of Alliance Air said the non-availability of landing slots and congestion at major Indian airports also hindered Udan operations.“The scheme will see much slower growth in the coming two years due to Covid-19. This is because normal domestic operations (too) are facing poor numbers of passengers and running in losses due to the pandemic. Similarly, no funds are being generated under the scheme currently. The government has no money to utilise for Udan,” said an aviation consultant, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-pandemic-to-hit-centre-s-ambitious-regional-connectivity-scheme-udan/story-z8MvtHmkSilxKdZqJqcccK.html

01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Infighting in Himachal BJP: Dhawala to approach Jai Ram over dissolution of Jawalamukhi unit||A day after the Himachal BJP chief Suresh Kashyap dissolved the party’s Jawalamukhi block citing acts of dissidence, leaders owing allegiance to senior legislator and former minister Ramesh Dhawala have called the action ‘arbitrary’ and accused the state party chief of acting on behest of organisational secretary Pawan Rana. Kahyap had divested the party’s district vice-president Kuldeep Sharma and secretary Joginder Kaushal, block president Chaman Lal Pundhir, Dehra Yuva Morcha district president Nitin Thakur and state co-spokesperson Rakesh Thakur of their titles and responsibilities. Infighting between the party’s influential organisational secretary Pawan Rana and former minister Ramesh Dhawala had prompted the party to dismantle the Jawalamukhi block. Both Rana and Dhawala have been at loggerheads over local issues and organisational matters ever since the formation of the BJP government. Dhawala was instrumental in formation of the BJP- Himachal Vikas Congress (HVP) alliance government in 1998. Dhawala, who was an independent candidate, had enabled the BJP to topple the Virbhadra Singh-led Congress government. Dhawala had been keenly vying for cabinet berth but the party ignored his claims when BJP gained majority in 2017. Dhawala’s supporters have blamed Rana for hampering his prospects. Dhawala was appointed chairperson of the finance commission but he has been unhappy with chief minister Jai Ram Thakur and has repeatedly blamed Rana, who also hails from Jawalamukhi, for interfering in his constituency and organisation matters. Dhawala supporters allege that Congressmen were being given preference in both organisation and constituency. Dhawala has been minister twice in the Prem Kumar Dhumal–led -BJP government, while Rana has been the party’s organisational secretary for nine years and is largely credited for strengthening the organisational structure along with party’s former chief Satpal Singh Satti. Dhawala described the action as one-sided. “The action was one-sided action. I will meet the CM. Let’s see what happens this time,’ said Dhawala, adding that he had met the CM numerous times to apprise him of his grievances. The party high-command had taken serious note of the two warring leaders in Jawalamukhi and had sought a report on the matter from the state party unit and had directed Suresh Kashyap to act as they believed that indiscipline in the party was detrimental for its image.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/infighting-in-himachal-bjp-dhawala-to-approach-jai-ram-over-dissolution-of-jawalamukhi-unit/story-ssuOVskRMeNWTNvno0RkvN.html

01-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra political parties express support to Marathi speaking people at Belgaum, border areas||Political parties in Maharashtra have expressed support to the Marathi-speaking population in Belgaum and border areas who want the merger of that region in the state. Senior ministers from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Sunday sported black ribbons on the occasion of Karnataka foundation day and offered support to the Marathi speaking people. November 1 is the foundation day of Karnataka which is observed as the black day by the Marathi speaking population. The areas like Belgaum, Karwar, Bidar and many villages were merged with Karnataka on November 1, 1956, despite huge opposition from the Marathi-speaking locals who were in majority. Shiv Sena leader and urban development minister Eknath Shinde addressed Shiv Sena workers of Belgaum saying their struggle will soon bear fruit. “Belgaum will soon become a part of Maharashtra,” said Shinde. He also released black balloons at Thane to express solidarity to the border people. Water resources minister and Nationalist Party Leader (NCP) leader Jayant Patil who sported black ribbon rued that Karnataka government was suppressing the voice of the people despite the case pending in the Supreme Court. “We are with them with the Maratha speaking people in all the possible ways. Despite a case is going on in the Supreme Court, the Karnataka government have not stopped their oppression. To oppose injustice and their persecution, we have sported black bands today,” Patil said. Congress minister Satej Patil said that Samyukta Maharashtra movement will only be completed after these border areas are merged with Maharashtra. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was also not far away from expressing support to this struggle. “The border areas need to be merged with Maharashtra as it is a justified demand,” said state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-political-parties-express-support-to-marathi-speaking-people-at-belgaum-border-areas/story-ZNZWJHRosLYugsDat6CMRI.html
01-11-2020||City||Industries to come up over 500 acres in Mohali’s Sector 101||GMADA begins process to acquire land in Manuli and Durali villages under new land pooling policy for industrial development After the Punjab cabinet gave its nod to a new land pooling policy for industrial development, Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has begun the process to acquire 500 acres of land in Sector 101. “We have started the process of acquiring the land from two villages – Manuli and Durali – of Mohali district to develop industrial plots of 550 square yards and 1,100 square yards,” said asenior GMADA official, who wished not to be named.The department has started the process to get approvals under Section 4 (publication of preliminary notification and powers of officers thereupon) of the Land Acquisition Act, which will be done within a week’s time, said the official, adding that the entire process will be completed by March next year.Earlier, land pooling was limited to residential housing schemes. On July 22, the state government introduced the new policy, wherein against every acre of land, the owner will get 1,100 square yards of industrial plots and 200 square yards of developed commercial plot, excluding parking, in lieu of cash compensation. As per the new policy, the validity of the sahuliyat certificate, through which owners opting for land pooling can avail themselves of certain benefits during the purchase of equivalent value of land, would be counted from the date of allotment of plot. Earlier, the validity was two years from the date of announcement of the award. The certificate entitles a land owner to get exemption from stamp duty besides other benefits and privileges when he purchases agricultural land with the sale proceeds from the developed plots that he gets under land pooling. The move is in response to the demand of land owners that the validity be applied from the date that they are offered physical possession of plots, on the grounds that only when basic infrastructure is laid does a plot fetch its potential value. Yogesh Sagar, president, Mohali Industries Association, said the new land pooling scheme will promote industrial sector in the region. “But besides giving industrial plots to land owners under the scheme, GMADA should come up with a concessional price for the existing industry,” he said. GMADA has acquired 4, 484 acres of land from 2001 to 2017. Of this, 2, 145 acres has been acquired through the land pooling policy, which was introduced in 2008 and amended from time to time. The authority is currently facing the risk of paying enhanced compensation of nearly ₹9, 700 crore as per the decisions of the first reference appeal in the courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/industries-to-come-up-over-500-acres-in-mohali-s-sector-101/story-Fq1XO9hBBXsPG2CK6MAxWL.html
01-11-2020||Mumbai||Three app-based cab service drivers arrested for duping customers in Mumbai||The Mumbai crime branch arrested three app-based cab drivers for allegedly duping customers by using an older version of the app. Police said during the ride the accused switched off and switched on their GPS for some time, which interpreted that the destination has changed by increasing the kilometres. Once the kilometres increased, the fare also increased in the bill, said a police officer.After getting a tip-off, officers of the unit one of the crime branch deployed his two officers in the civil clothes at the international airport. During the inquiry, the drivers and vehicles were identified and they mostly accept the long distances ride especially to Panvel, Kamothe and Kalamboli area in Navi Mumbai.“The officer booked an app-based cab for Panvel and the driver switched off the GPS for some times and later switched on. The driver did twice on the way due to which the kilometres increased from around 44 to 64.9 kilometres and fare which showed while booking 964 was increased 1,560,” said police inspector Vinayak Mer of the crime branch unit one. During the inquiry, the accused said there are at least 50 drivers who are operating with an old version of the app and cheating customers. We have been conducting a further inquiry to trace other drivers, added Mer.“The accused are allegedly using an older version of the app-based cab service app which was easy to manipulate to hiked fares. The latest version of the app does not allow this kind of manipulation,” said Mer. Such malpractices increased few kilometres due to which fare shoots in the bill, added Mer. We cannot reveal the name of the accused now because other drivers will get alert and they can destroy their phones and app which will be evidence in further inquiry. The accused have been arrested under the charges of cheating, said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/three-app-based-cab-service-drivers-arrested-for-duping-customers-in-mumbai/story-nmOaaGXxtrijEL4HBQCFPN.html

While the health department blames the MC for not carrying out fogging operations effectively, the civic body says that residents are to be blamed for not following government guidelines on checking the spread of the disease.District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh said the only way to control dengue is by intensifying fogging operations and increasing the challan on people violating government guidelines. Both these measures have to be implemented by the civic body.” He added that deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma had conducted a meeting on Saturday and sought details on the measures being taken to curb the spread of the vector-borne disease.He said that 18 people tested positive for dengue on Sunday, taking the district’s tally to 1,489, while 2,078 more are suspected to have caught the disease. Of the total 1,489, as many as 1,145 are from Ludhiana city while 305 are from other districts who tested positive here. Thirty-nine patients are from other states, said Dr Ramesh. He added that 18 health teams have been deployed to conduct house-to-house survey to check accumulation of water and larvae breeding.Meanwhile, health department officials, on the condition of anonymity, said that they had shared locations of at least 1,000 dengue cases but the civic body has issued only 186 challans against violators so far. On the other hand, Dr Vipan Malhotra, health officer of the civic body, said that the department has issued 206 challans.“Due to some technical snag, I could not update the list (of 1,000 dengue cases). There are 14 big fogging machines which are used in the wards every day. Besides, there are 95 handheld machines which have been given to all councillors for targeted fogging,” said Dr Malhotra.He further added that the civic body and health department could not visit all places so people should cooperate and act responsibly. “They should not let fresh water accumulate in pots, tanks and other materials so that we can curb the spread of dengue,” stressed Dr Malhotra.Earlier on October 8, a 33-year-old resident, Angad Singh Ahuja, had died of multiple organ failure after contracting dengue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dengue-cases-in-ludhiana-cross-1-400-mark-health-dept-mc-pass-the-buck/story-20lrW1arTayxk1nDU9hU3J.html
01-11-2020||Mumbai||UP men promise Mumbai woman to cure her mentally ill daughter, dupes her of Rs 13 lakh||A senior citizen from Mazgaon was cheated of Rs 13 lakh by three Uttar Pradesh men who promised to cure her mentally ill daughter by performing a special puja in an ashram. The Sewri police officials have begun an investigation in the case. The complainant, Shobha Shetty, 70, has a 43-year-old daughter suffering from mental illness and has been undergoing treatment for 25 years. The police said that Shetty has been exploring all possible options for the treatment of her daughter. She has immense faith in religion and had been performing various kinds of pujas for the well-being of her daughter. Due to this, she often received phone calls from pujaris offering pujas to cure her daughter. According to the Sewri police, in November 2019, Shetty received a call from one Krishnanand Shastri. He told her that he works in a UP-based Vishwamitra Seva Pvt Ltd Ashram. In the Ashram, many people with serious illnesses were cured. Shashtri told Shetty that he knew about her daughter’s illness and offered to cure the same by reciting prayers and performing a special puja at the ashram. Also read: Delhi records 5,664 new infections, case positivity rate 12.69%Shetty trusted him and requested him to perform puja and offer prayers. As Shashtri also told her that the performing of puja will be chargeable, in December 2019 she paid the first fee of around Rs 5,000 and transferred it in the bank account of Shashtri, as per the complaint. Later, Shastri would call her frequently and, under the pretext of conducting rituals, would ask her to deposit money in his account, the police said. Seeing no progress in her daughter’s condition, Shetty started feeling suspicious. When she refused to pay him, he threatened her saying her daughter will commit suicide if the rituals are stopped midway and the family will face serious problems. Shetty, therefore, continued transferring him money, the complainant states. In April this year, the woman received a call from one Vinod Kumar who informed her that he is the man who was calling her posing as Shashtri. He told her that he was doing so on the instructions of two people - Abhishek Pandey and Prashant Pandey - who have been duping her under the pretext of performing puja for her daughter’s illness. The two bank accounts she transferred money to belonged to the two, an officer said. Shocked, Shetty then registered a complaint with Sewri police recently. The police have registered an FIR under sections 420 (cheating) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 3 of Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and Other Inhuman, Unwholesome and Aghori Practices and Witchcraft Act 2013. “There is a possibility that someone known to the family has tipped of fraudsters about the prolonged illness of Shetty’s daughter. We are in the process of obtaining details of the transactions and would try to locate the suspects based on the information provided by the bank,” an officer, requesting anonymity, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/up-men-promise-mumbai-woman-to-cure-her-mentally-ill-daughter-dupes-her-of-rs-13-lakh/story-fKqshYSdL91pRgIU6K7WSN.html

01-11-2020||City||High fatality rate a concern as Panchkula fears second Covid wave in festive season||The high Covid fatality rate in Panchkula, when compared to Haryana, remains a concern for the district health authorities, which are fearing a second wave of infection during the ongoing festive season. The fatality rate stands at 1.59%, while the state average is 1.06% and the national is 1.49%. Even in the last week’s weekly Covid-19 status report (till October 25), Panchkula (1.6%) had second-highest fatality rate among districts, after Fatehabad and Jind (1.9%). Panchkula recorded only two deaths till July 31 after the first infection was reported in March. While 18 people died in August, September saw a surge in both cases and deaths, with 66 casualties reported. It was followed by 27 deaths in October. Another fatality reported on Sunday (November 1) has taken the toll to 114.“Panchkula’s fatality rate has been pretty high as compared to other districts, but we are working to contain it,” said Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon.Dr Kaur cited the absence of a medical college in close proximity as one of the main reasons. “We have tied up with the Maulana medical college, but it is not suitable for emergency cases as it is too far from Panchkula. Also during the pandemic, Chandigarh stopped taking patients from Haryana.”The health department coordinated with three tertiary level private hospitals in the city and got readied 61 ICU beds for emergency. Also, 15 ICU beds were arranged at the civil hospital, Sector 6, which had none before the pandemic.“We got 15 ICU beds, but did not have experts for tertiary (critical) care. As there is no medical college in the city and private hospitals got overburdened with patients from across the region, we were left struggling for beds on some days,” said Dr Kaur.12 more ICU beds added With festive season posing the danger of second wave, the health department is on its toes.“We have added 12 more ICU beds at the civil hospital and are planning to speak to the PGIMER to take referrals in case of any emergency,” said Dr Kaur, adding that now the staff is more skilled.Also, the stress is on sensitising people and conducting home-to-home surveys to identify symptomatic cases. “Early admission and treatment will be the key to prevent any second wave. With the support of tertiary care hospitals, we will try our best to contain fatalities,” said the civil surgeon.Stating that the pandemic has come as a wake-up call, Dr Kaur said Panchkula needs at least two more hospitals to cater to its increasing population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/high-fatality-rate-a-concern-as-panchkula-fears-second-covid-wave-in-festive-season/story-ODD3XfDyHFeUzDz09rVyNO.html

01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Government schools in Chandigarh reopen for Classes 9 to 12||After remaining open for academic consultations for over a month, Chandigarh’s 93 government schools will begin regular classroom teaching for Classes 9 to 12 from Monday. Schools have remained closed since March this year due to the Covid pandemic, though online classes have been going on.To prevent congestion, classes will be organised in two batches, the first from 9am to 11:30am for Classes 10 and 12, and the second from 12pm to 2:30pm for Classes 9 and 11. Students will need to submit the consent of their parents, and attendance won’t be compulsory. Online classes will continue to remain the preferred medium of teaching. Earlier, the education department had reopened schools for Classes 9 to 12 on September 21, for students to clear their doubts on fixed days every week. However, attendance remained very low. Now, the education department expects at least 20% attendance in the regular classes, with higher numbers expected in schools situated in peripheral areas.Private schools not to open, for nowMeanwhile, private schools will remain closed for the time being. HS Mamik, president, Independent School Association, said private schools will conduct a fresh survey from November 2 to find how many parents are willing to send their children. Private schools had reported very poor footfall during academic consultations. “If the number crosses 50%, we will consider reopening schools. Otherwise, we will continue with online classes only. It will be difficult for teachers to take both physical and online classes,” he said.Education department to create 1,000 more seats in Class 11The education department will be creating around 1,000 more seats in Class 11. “After the third counselling, around 1,000 students, who had completed Class 10 from government schools but could not score well, are still left to get admissions,” said Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director school education. “We will create more seats in Class 11 to accommodate them.” The seats will be created in the humanities stream, which majority of the students want to pursue, and only those government school students who had participated in all three counsellings will be eligible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/government-schools-in-chandigarh-reopen-for-classes-9-to-12/story-UoSydvuPhl6keHxWOnetnL.html

It was good news for multiplex and theatre owners, who had been demanding that it was time for the curtains to go up and also for moviegoers to return to the big-screen experience. However, no new films were released on Sunday and are also not expected to release anytime soon. At Silver Arc Mall on Ferozepur Road, the management had to cancel the morning and afternoon shows after no bookings were made. “However, people showed up to enquire about the films and their timings,” said an employee working at the multiplex.He said as no new movie had been released, so they screened three old Punjabi movies on the first day. Ajay Nayar, director, FMI Limited and Silver Arc Mall, said the government’s decision of reopening the multiplexes and cinemas with 50% occupancy had brought cheer to moviegoers during the festive season.“Cinema halls and multiplexes were shut for over eight months. Currently, people are not aware of the opening of cinemas and as they will get to know they will start booking shows,” said Nayar. He was quick to add that all mandatory Covid guidelines were being followed and special emphasis was being laid on wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. “Multi-screen cinemas are huge crowd pullers. As the government has allowed reopening of multiplex and single-screen cinemas, we are expecting more business,” said the proprietors of another shopping mall. Residents meanwhile are eager for new releases. “We are regular moviegoers. Since April, we could not watch a movie in theatre. We are looking forward to catching the latest flick soon,” said Jaskirat Singh of Gurdev Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cinemas-reopen-in-ludhiana-but-wait-for-new-releases-to-continue/story-S9D9TQFw4ReMO0DJzH3c1K.html

The agenda of the meeting was the recent hike in water charges by the municipal corporation; regularisation of need-based changes made in Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) dwelling units; shifting of Dadu Majra garbage dumping ground and, the privatisation of the electricity department.Chairman Hitesh Puri said that bodies like MC weren’t serving the city but rather their self-interests.“We have institutions such as the CHB and the MC, but what are they doing for the city? The city would be better off without them,” he said. Rajat Malhotra, general secretary, Crawfed, spoke about the regularisation of need-based changes made in CHB dwelling units by allowing one-time general amnesty. He urged member of parliament Kirron Kher and BJP Chandigarh unit president Arun Sood to intervene and resolve the ongoing issue.Anish Garg, chief spokesperson, Crawfed, said that any permission regarding the use of parks that are maintained by RWAs/contractors should be sought from them before the MC.Major (retd) DP Singh, patron of Crawfed, spoke regarding the regularisation of street vendors and said, “Some vendors are selling vegetables and fruits above the rates fixed by the market committee. Action should be taken against them.”Speaking about the smart watches worn by the civic body staff, Surinder Sharma, vice-chairman, Crawfed, said these watches are being used in three-four cities across India and are giving desired results. He suggested that the MC staff should wear them without any fear and not raise any irrelevant issues.Puri also took up the issue of privatisation of the electricity department in Chandigarh. He said there was no need to privatise the department as it was already running in profit and residents were getting an adequate supply of electricity.He added that he, along with 15 members of Crawfed, will meet MC commissioner KK Yadav to discuss the issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-rwa-apex-body-slams-authorities-over-burning-issues/story-38jtMgRcv1hBCMacDfrpLP.html
01-11-2020||City||Eight vehicle robberies in October put Ludhiana police in a tizzy||Even as robbers struck eight times in October, snatching residents’ two- and four-wheelers at gunpoint, police continue to grope in the dark about the criminals behind these cases.In an average of two robberies per week in the district, residents lost seven two-wheelers and one car to robbers.In all cases, the accused assaulted the victims and drove away their vehicles, often containing other belongings and cash. While police are apprehensive of the robbers misusing these vehicles for bigger crimes by installing fake number plates and also sometimes changing the colour of the vehicles, they remain clueless about the gangs behind these incidents and have managed to solve only one of the eight cases.The motorcycle recovered belonged to Tibba road resident Rajinder Kumar, who was targeted on October 2. According to Rajinder, he works as a cutter master in a hosiery factory and had bought the motorcycle on a monthly instalments. After he lost his motorcycle to robbers, he could not have thought of buying another vehicle due to his meagre earnings. But, luck favoured him and the police managed to recover his motorcycle.“I used to commute to work in autos after my motorcycle was stolen,” he said.Similarly, police in September had recovered a scooter stolen in May, but its appearance was completely changed. Pankaj Bansal of Naulakha Road was robbed of his brown scooter on May 19. A case in this regard was registered at the Division Number 2 police station. The police had recovered the scooter on September 23, but found that the vehicle’s number plate was changed and its colour was switched to white.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said in such cases, police lodge the FIRs immediately, so that the vehicles were not be misused in another crime. “Police have found involvement of local criminals in such crimes as they need to meet their need for drugs,” he added.Robbers having a field dayOctober 29: Two men robbed a Machhiwara resident of his motorcycle and mobile phone at Kohara-Machhiwara roadOctober 29: Four men snatched a farm labourer’s motorcycle in Kaunke Khosa villageOctober 28: An elderly man was robbed of his scooter, cash and mobile phone while he was visiting his plot in Mani Shah Colony near Alamgir villageOctober 23: Two miscreants robbed a Samrala resident of his brand new Hyundai Aura car at gunpoint near his house.

01-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: Financial constraints of family due to pandemic driving schoolchildren to work||The coronavirus pandemic has forced many children studying in government schools into child labour. Many children of Classes 9 to 12 have refused to attend school and decided to continue with online classes post lockdown to support their families. The Covid-19 outbreak has resulted in a potential income loss to families forcing children to help them earn a livelihood. Consequently, children engaged in work do not wish to return back to schools even after many of them have reopened on October 19.In the last four months, children aged between 14 years to 18 years have started working and earning Rs 3,500 to Rs 6,000 per month. Principals of government schools have stated that children have been working in factories, shops, selling vegetables and earning money to support their families. Parental unemployment due to economic shocks has led children to step in to provide support, they said. Teachers have also confirmed that very few students attend online classes as a majority of them are engaged in work. Many school-going children were found working at shops in Ghumar Mandi, Chaura Bazaar, Model Town.Sunil Kumar, 15, has been working in a factory since June to earn a livelihood. When his school reopened on October 19, Sunil decided to continue work in order to survive. He said, “My parents were working as labourers in a factory and both lost their jobs during the lockdown. I was forced to sell vegetables for two months in order to survive. I am unable to attend classes on a daily basis as I have to go to work.”While 17-year-old student, Inderjot Singh, a student of Government Senior Secondary School, Multipurpose, was forced to work at a chemist shop for the last four months due to financial constraints. Being a non-medical student, it is tough for him to manage both studies and work. Singh said, “To support my family, I started working for nine hours a day, so to cope up with the syllabus take help from my friends as I am unable to attend online classes during the day.”Government Senior Secondary School, Multipurpose, has 2,949 students studying in Classes 9 to 12 and only 80 are attending school. As per sources, many students are working in Chaura Bazaar and have not been able to attend the classes physically and online. Principal, Navdeep Romana, said, “Teachers are making sure that students are attending online classes. Few teachers are taking classes after 8 pm so that children do not miss classes.”Government Senior Secondary School, Dhandari Khurd, has 540 students studying in Classes 9 to 12 of which 68 are attending the school. Principal Ujjalveer Singh, said, “Many students prefer attending online classes as they are working during the day due to financial constraints.”Requesting anonymity, a teacher at a government school said, “Of the total 68 students, 14 are attending online classes and four are coming to school regularly. The remaining students are not regular with online classes as over 15 of them are working to support their families.”District education officer, secondary, Swaranjit Kaur, said, “I am aware that many students are engaged in work and do not attend online classes. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, children and their families are facing a tough time due to which many of them are forced to work and are not attending school.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-financial-constraints-of-family-due-to-pandemic-driving-schoolchildren-to-work/story-CtVUnT172w3nbmDPamuEqN.html

The missing boy’s father, Kabir Hussain, 39, said, “It was a long nightmare for us. For nearly 14 months we had no clue about his whereabouts. We thought that he might have been killed or died in a mishap.” Hussain, a truck driver, lives in Mohra Bachai, a remote area of Poonch district. The boy was 11 when he had fled the madrasa where he studied with his elder brother.” Hussain said, “I had sent my sons to Zubaidia Madrasa from where my son fled because Maulana Shahid Iqbal brutally beat him up for not learning the lesson. His legs and arms were held by four students on the directions of the maulana while he beat him up with a bamboo stick.” He alleged that the marks of the beating were still visible on the boy’s body. “I read about Childline in a newspaper and approached them hoping that they could find my son. Subsequently, things started falling in place. They made a video of mine and uploaded it on social media forums and a TV channel with their contact numbers,” he said. Subzar Ahmad of Childline Poonch said, “It was a tough road for us but we finally succeeded in tracing him with the help of Child Line Ahmedabad and brought him back to Poonch on October 28 where district commissioner Rahul Yadav handed the child to his family.” “The boy did not return to his family because he was scared that he would be reprimanded by them for running away from the madrasa,” he said.

01-11-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh by-polls: Campaign comes to end after bitter play of words||Election campaign across as many as 28 legislative assembly constituencies going to by-polls in Madhya Pradesh on November 3 came to an end on Sunday evening, as per officials. The polls will decide the fate of the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the state. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan government needs to win 8 seats to get to the majority mark of 115 in the 230-member state assembly, thus, retain power if it doesn’t have to be dependent on the support of non-Congress political parties’ and independent MLAs. Presently, one seat in the assembly is lying vacant. There are as many as 355 candidates, including 22 woman candidates, contesting the by-polls. More than 63.5 lakh voters are expected to exercise franchise on November 3. The candidates include 25 such who resigned from the state assembly and later joined the BJP earlier this year. The campaign saw a bitter fight mainly between the ruling party BJP and the Opposition Congress with a good number of complaints being lodged with the Election Commission on the use of alleged unparliamentary language or objectionable remarks being made by political leaders against their rivals. While the EC deprived state Congress president Kamal Nath of his star campaigner status a couple of days back for his “Kya item hai ye” remark against woman and child development minister Imrati Devi, the constitutional body debarred higher education minister Mohan Yadav and Imrati Devi from holding and addressing any public meeting for a day on Saturday and Sunday. Also read: Bihar polls - High stakes for NDA, Grand Alliance in 2nd phase, campaigning endsSimilarly, the Commission warned BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya and BJP candidate from Anuppur constituency Bisahulal Singh while it issued notices to BJP candidate Girraj Dandotia, BJP MLA Usha Thakur and Congress leaders Sajjan Singh Verma and Acharya Pramod Krishnan on complaints that they used objectionable remarks during their meetings. It was during the campaign that the Madhya Pradesh High Court’s Gwalior bench, in its interim order dated October 20, expressed its displeasure over the conduct of politicians in the context of Covid-19 situation in the state and banned physical public meetings, subject to availability of possibility of virtual campaign, in 9 districts under its jurisdiction, which includes 8 districts in Gwalior-Chambal region. The Supreme Court later granted stay on the execution of the order. Through its earlier interim order, the high court ordered lodging of FIR against Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar and state Congress president Kamal Nath for violations of Covid-19 protocol. Mythological characters like Ravana, Kans, Mareech, Shakuni were used as adjectives by the leaders for their rivals apart from several diatribes hurled against each other as the campaign gained momentum. Social activist in Bhind, Sanjeev Barua, said, “It is unfortunate that whenever elections are held casteism and controversies decide the fate of elections and the real issues like those on development are hardly raised by the political parties.” Another social worker from Gwalior, Umesh Vashishth, said, “For Gwalior-Chambal, the poor sex ratio is a major problem but none of political parties or politicians talk on this issue or any other issue related to women and children in the region.” Jayant Singh Tomar, head of journalism department in a university, is contesting the by-polls and said, “It appears the real issues are deliberately suppressed by the political parties to ensure that they don’t have to answer the people as to what they have done in the name of development. Hence, unemployment, poor sex ratio, malnutrition, etc., never become issues in the elections.” On the last day of the campaign on Sunday, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan held roadshows and addressed election meetings in Biaora, Agar, Suwasra and Hatpipaliya constituencies, all in Malwa region. Similarly, senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia addressed election meetings in Mehagaon, Bhander, Karaira and Ashok Nagar constituencies in the Gwalior-Chambal region, his home turf. State Congress president Kamal Nath held a roadshow in Morena before addressing a meeting and later addressed party workers in Gwalior. Addressing the public meeting in Ashok Nagar, Scindia said, “The crowd in meetings show the BJP is going to achieve a massive victory in the by-polls.” He said, “I don’t aspire for chair and positions. Scindia family has never been in politics for the sake of power. We have always taken politics as a responsibility to secure the bright future of people.” Chouhan in his meetings said, “I am committed to rebuilding Madhya Pradesh and make it self-reliance (Atmnirbhar) to make people’s lives better and bring a new ray of brightness in the life of my sons and daughters in the state.” State Congress president Kamal Nath said in Gwalior, “People are eager to teach a lesson to those who betrayed the voters by resigning from the state assembly and later imposing by-polls on people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-by-polls-campaign-comes-to-end-after-bitter-play-of-words/story-TAQOIWl0h1cqCcl1S9KYRM.html
01-11-2020||Pune||4 districts have passed Covid-19 peak: state health department||A trend analysis of four districts in western Maharashtra shows a decline in the number of Covid-19 cases. However, the peak period of the virus, as evidenced by the data (see graphic) has been different for each of the districts. The case fatality rate of each of these four districts – Satara, Sangli, Solapur and Kolhapur - is higher than the state average. State officials, however, believe that the Covid-19 infection has peaked in these districts . Satish Pawar, director, state health department, said, “All the four districts have surpassed their peaks, which was somewhere in September - either in the beginning or in the middle. None of the districts saw an explosion of cases like Pune and Mumbai because of multiple reasons; because of the population density in these two major cities. Also, the number of cases being detected in the beginning was directly linked to the population density of a city or district, and later, with the floating population leaving Mumbai and returning to their native places, the infection spread instead of being concentrated in one city.” Satara has recorded a recovery rate of 87.65%; a case fatality rate of 2.9%; and as of Sunday, the district has recorded 47,753 Covid-19 of which, 4,484 is the active case count. Satara saw its peak with respect to the highest number of active Covid-19 cases on September 17, with nine thousand cases. Since then, cases have been on a decline. Sangli recorded a recovery rate of 90.61% and a case fatality rate of 3.2%. As of Sunday, the district recorded 46,965 Covid-19 cases, of which 2,866 are active cases. Sangli reported its peak of active cases on September 19, with 10,000 cases. Since then, the curve has been irregular, but overall, on the decline. Solapur reported a recovery rate of 89.28% and a case fatality rate of 3.2%. As of Sunday, the district reported 44,193 Covid-19 cases, of which 3,288 are active cases. The district saw its peak September 26, with 7,835 active cases. Since then, numbers have been declining. Kolhapur has reported a recovery rate of 94.04% and case fatality rate of 3.4%. The total number of Covid-19 cases went up to 47,300, of which 1,207 are active cases. Kolhapur saw its peak on September 9, with 10,000 active cases. Dr Pawar further added, “Also, as Mumbai bore the brunt of being densely populated, the infection spread widely during the initial months. Health experts were caught off guard which helped other districts to learn from the mistakes with regards to treatment protocol and management of beds.” Saurabh Rao, divisional commissioner for Pune division, which encompasses these four districts, said, “Western Maharashtra and specifically these districts got affected in the initial months of the pandemic. Now, for the past three-four weeks the situation is getting better. We did see Satara report an alarming positivity rate which has gone down to below 15% since the past 10 days. Solapur has also stabilised and brought down its positivity rate to below 15% over the past two months. It was one of the worst affected districts and the administration and the medical faculties had come under heavy criticism. Kolhapur and Sangli have also seen the same journey.” With respect to a higher case fatality rate, Rao agreed that these nearby districts are heavily dependent on Pune for critical health care. He said, “The reasons for higher case fatality rate are late detection and declaration of Covid-19 cases and a difficulty in access to the medical facilities. We did see people travel to Pune for critical care or get delayed access to health care from these districts which contributed to a higher death number.” He did say that the population density in these districts played a key role as the spread of infection, containment, liveability index, dwelling units size and category play a crucial role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/4-districts-have-passed-covid-19-peak-state-health-department/story-GV8qlVculibQglU94ERsyJ.html
01-11-2020||Business||With worsening AQI, air purifier sales soar in country||With the overall air quality in various parts, particularly Delhi NCR, in the country fluctuating between ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ categories, air purifier makers are logging as much as 50 per cent rise in sale numbers and expecting the momentum to gain more traction during winters. The air purifier segment, which was earlier limited to select pockets of top metro cities, is firming its foothold in smaller cities, and online channels are emerging as a key facilitator to meet the consumer demand in such places. Though air purifier as a segment is very small but it has increased in size over the last three years, and the vertical is expected to grow by another 50 per cent in 2020.“The onset of winters, smog situation in various parts of the country and the current concerns around air normally raise the alarm around deteriorating air quality and indoor air pollution. An air purifier makes the most sense now, owing to the alarming levels of increasing air pollution in major cities around the country,” Eureka Forbes Managing Director and CEO Marzin R Shroff said. Kent RO Systems chairman and managing director Mahesh Gupta said the company has already seen a 50 per cent spike in sales this season as compared to last year and is expecting this momentum to continue till the end of winters. Air purifier sales peak only when consumers see pollution rising to a dangerous level, he said adding that increased media coverage of poor air quality has led to consumer awareness, thereby resulting in more sales.“We have seen that in the past four years, there has been a sudden surge in air purifiers demand during the smog situation in Delhi.The onset of winter only further deteriorates the air quality and acts as a catalyst to push the sales for air purifiers,” said Gupta. Now a basic air purifier that simply cleans the air with the touch of a few buttons is coming packed with features such as real-time, wifi-enabled control systems.Companies have developed Internet of Things(IoT) enabled room air purifiers with multi-layers of purification filters and can be controlled from the comfort of a smartphone. Air purifier manufacturer Dyson said that air purifiers come in various shapes and sizes, remove different kinds of air pollutants in homes, come with an array of specifications, and offer different features.“Selecting the right kind of air purifier, tested for real homes, can help in creating a healthy home environment indoors”, said a Dyson spokesperson. Earlier, the sale of air purifier was just restricted to the metro cities, however, now makers are also getting demand from small cities and towns.“Air purifiers are no longer a luxury but have become a necessity as per the alarming increase in the nation’s air pollution levels,” Eureka Forbes’ Shroff said. According to Kent RO Systems’ Gupta, earlier 70 per cent sale of air purifiers used to be limited to Delhi NCR, however this year it has seen a surge in demand from other cities also. “Air purifier segment is not just restricted to the Delhi-NCR region, but there is a demand from neighbouring states and cities including Chandigarh, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, as also from various regions of Haryana,” he said. EY Partner and National Leader, Consumer Products and Retail, Pinakiranjan Mishra said air quality in India is rapidly deteriorating, especially in Delhi, Mumbai, Gujarat,Tamil Nadu and other metros.“The demand for air purifiers in India is expected to grow rapidly due to continuous air quality deterioration, growing knowledge of air purifiers, coupled with rising health consciousness among consumers. At the same time, increasing awareness of the effects of indoor pollution is creating demand in the residential and institutional sectors for air purifiers,” he said. Expressing similar views, AirOK Technologies Founder and CEO Deekshith Vara Prasad said: “This season has indeed been a phenomenal one for us for four reasons. The foremost factor is that the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the sensitivity of people to the menace of air pollution. People no longer think twice before buying an air purifier as it has become a necessity now.” The current market size of the domestic air purifier segment is estimated to be around Rs 200 crore annually, with several companies including Eureka Forbes, Dyson, Kent, Sharp, Panasonic, Philips etc competing, as it is a sunrise segment. According to TechSci Research report, market for air purifiers in India is projected to grow at a Compound annual growth rate(CAGR) of around 40 per cent during 2015-20.The category has increased in size over the last three years, and in 2020, and it is expected to grow by another 50 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/with-worsening-aqi-air-purifier-sales-soar-in-country/story-K9xLFbFaPiSbAMx6iyofaM.html

Also, Central Govt has created a fund of Rs 1 lakh crores for agriculture infrastructure for our farmers: Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an election rally in Samastipur.Prime Minister lashed out at Mahagathbandhan and accused them of making every move in politics for personal and family benefits.“On one side, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is committed to democracy, and on the other side is ‘Parivar Tantra Gathbandhan’ for purely personal benefits. NDA government stands for ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas,” Prime Minister said while addressing his second rally of the day in Samastipur on Sunday.Continuing his jibe on this line he further criticised the Congress party for not remembering or paying tribute to Sardar Patel.“Sardar Patel was a great patriot and belonged to everyone, but Congress has limited itself to a family that they didn’t remember him on his birth anniversary yesterday,” PM Modi further said.While lauding NDA’s efforts for the betterment of poor and marginalised people, the prime minister attacked the Mahagathbandhan once again.“They are not concerned with poor’s problems. During elections, they start playing the ‘poor’ cards, but after the election, they see their families only. (Chunav me Gareeb-Gareeb ka mala japne lagye hain, chunav ke baad sirf apna parivar dikhayi deta hai),” PM Modi added.“Bihar is the holy land which gave a lesson of democracy to the world. This is the holy land from where the seed of democracy sprouted. Look at the map of the country, on one side, NDA is committed to democracy, and on the other side is ‘parivar tantra gathbandhan’. NDA government is for ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’. What have these family-run political parties given you? They made big houses for themselves, bought luxurious cars for themselves. They gave tickets to people of their own family. But have any relative of Nitish Kumar reached Rajya Sabha? People who work for Democracy give an opportunity to every citizen,” the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister further stated that the indications from the first phase show that NDA is making a clean sweep in Bihar.”We have talked to the political pundits and some journalists and everyone believes that in the first phase NDA is making a clean sweep. If today all trends are pointing towards the victory of NDA, that is because of our mothers and sisters who are ensuring a victory of our government and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar,” the Prime Minister earlier said at Chhapra.He also thanked the people who showed up at the rally amid Covid-19 restrictions and said it is a clear indication of the results of the assembly election.The first phase of Bihar assembly elections to 71 seats was held on October 28. The remaining 172 assembly constituencies of the 243-member assembly will go to polls on November 3 and November 7.The elections for the second phase of polls for 94 assembly constituencies will be held on November 3 and the results are scheduled to be announced on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/pm-modi-announces-1000-farmer-producer-organisations-in-bihar-poll-rally/story-R07tQHgESZCBjwI8qw4ZvI.html
01-11-2020||Election:||PM Modi slams Opposition in Bihar, calls them ‘parivar tantra gathbandhan’||Continuing his attack on opposition parties in Bihar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday termed them as ‘parivar tantra gathbandhan’ at his second rally in Samastipur and added that on the one side NDA is committed to democracy it is facing family-run political parties on the other side. “Bihar is the holy land which gave a lesson of democracy to the world. This is the holy land from where the seed of democracy sprouted. Look at the map of the country, on one side, NDA is committed to democracy, and on the other side is ‘parivar tantra gathbandhan’.

The Prime Minister continued his attack on the opposition and said that the people like Nitish Kumar and himself, who work for democracy, live for the betterment of others and not their families. Without taking anyone’s name, PM Modi termed the opposition leader as the “price of jungle raj” and further alleged that the Congress party has shrunk to just one family.“You see the prince of jungle raj regularly. Congress has also limited itself to just one family. Wasn’t Sardar Patel a leader of Congress? Yet the party had trouble remembering him on his birth anniversary,” he said.The Prime Minister further stated that the indications from the first phase show that NDA is making a clean sweep in Bihar.“We have talked to the political pundits and some journalists and everyone believes that in the first phase NDA is making a clean sweep.

01-11-2020||Election:||War of words between LJP, JD(U); Chirag says CM’s party playing truant with BJP||This time around, the voters in Bihar are in a fix while deciding who is with whom. As the assembly election reaches its climax, the confusion is only confounding with the LJP accusing the JD(U) of playing truant with the BJP and the JD(U) blaming the LJP of being hand in glove with the RJD. Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan on Sunday hinted at the internecine battle within the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and exhorted the LJP cadres to vote for the BJP wherever the LJP has not fielded its candidates. In a tweet, posted almost around the same time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was completing his third leg of Bihar campaigning in Bihar, Chirag said, “Nitish Kumar and his leaders are trying to damage the prospects of the BJP on the seats it is contesting. Wherever LJP is not contesting, I appeal to all Bihar people to stand by BJP candidates. Give your blessings to LJP-BJP for a Nitish Kumar-free Bihar #ImpossibleNitish.” Chirag also attached a newspaper clip in which Bihar deputy CM Sushil Kumar accused Bhalpur JD(U) MP Ajay Mandal of resorting to anti-NDA activities. Also read: Nitish will quit NDA after polls, to challenge Modi in 2024 - Chirag PaswanHitherto, Chirag was accused of playing as the B-team of the BJP to harm the prospects of the JD(U) and the LJP leader himself never hid his aversion for Nitish Kumar and liking for PM Narendra Modi. However, there was always a lurking fear that the LJP’s gameplan of reducing the size of the JD(U) might end up increasing the size of the RJD. “It was always considered a double-edged sword as political planning can vary from people’s planning. The way BJP has been batting for Nitish Kumar goes in contrast to the LJP’s posturing which has only added to the confusion for the electorate,” said political analyst NK Choudhary. During the day, Chirag had also tweeted a newspaper clip on income tax raids on contractors involved with Bihar’s ‘nal-jal’ yojana, one of the seven resolves of the chief minister and one which has been under attack for corruption by the LJP and RJD alike, and termed it the “biggest scam”. The JD(U), on the other hand, hit back at Chirag Paswan, accusing him of being hand in glove with the RJD leader Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav and playing ‘dirty politics’. “The DNA of both the leaders matches and that is why he is openly talking in the language of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. By questioning ‘7 Resolves’, he is also questioning his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, who as minister also endorsed it. The ‘Chirag’ will also extinguish like the lantern in Bihar and he will lose all the assembly seats under his own Lok Sabha constituency,” said JD(U) spokesman and minister Neeraj Kumar. JD(U) general secretary and minister Sanjay Jha said that by his actions and baseless allegations, Chirag was fast losing relevance in the eyes of the people and he would realize it when his party would perform miserably in the election. Earlier, Chirag had attacked both JD(U) and RJD for their job offers at the time of election despite having ruled for 15 years each in Bihar. “In the last five years, the government could not even fill the vacant sanctioned posts and now they are giving lollypop of jobs. The LJP will fill all the sanctioned posts and clear the decks for investment,” he said, posting a clip of his vision document.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/war-of-words-between-ljp-jd-u-chirag-says-cm-s-party-playing-truant-with-bjp/story-zQwkR36nxSKv6giy2Gm3jP.html
01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Ballabhgarh: Stone pelting injures police on Delhi-Agra highway||Ten Faridabad police personnel were injured on Sunday when a group of youths allegedly pelted stones at them and tried to indulge in vandalism after being asked to vacate the Delhi-Agra national highway that they had blocked in Haryana’s Ballabhgarh, police said.Police used mild force to disperse the group and the highway, which was blocked for a few minutes, was then cleared.The incident took place just around the time a “Mahapanchayat” was being held in nearby Dussehra grounds in Ballabhgarh.The “Mahapanchayat” was organised by various social organisations to demand justice for 21-year-old college student Nikita, who was shot dead outside her college in Ballabhgarh on Monday allegedly by a man who had been pressuring her to marry him. Three men, including the main accused Tausif, were later arrested in the case.Police said the group of youths who had also reached close to the site where the “Mahapanchayat” was going on suddenly started gathering at the highway and blocked it.The protesting youth were demanding capital punishment for the accused involved in Nikita’s killing. Some among them later started pelting stones at the police when they were asked not to block the highway.Police said the organisers of the “Mahapanchayat” told them they did not know who the youths were.Faridabad Police Commissioner O P Singh told PTI over phone that 10 policemen were injured as stones were hurled at them.“Thirty of them have been rounded up. The situation was immediately brought under control,” Singh said.He said during questioning it was found that a majority of the 30 had come from places outside Faridabad district including Gurugram, Mewat, Palwal, Delhi and Noida.Some of the youths were carrying lathis and stones as well and had come with a “pre-planned intention to vitiate the atmosphere”, police said.“The intention looked to disturb peace and harmony. We are investigating if there was any conspiracy angle involved,” Singh said.“The highway was blocked by protesters for a few minutes and the road was cleared soon,” Singh said.Heavy police force was already deployed in the area in view of the “Mahapanchayat”.Asked about various protests which have been held by different outfits against Nikita’s killings, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who was interacting with reporters in Karnal, said, “Everyone has a right to hold protest in a peaceful manner. But no one should take law and order into one’s hands… If anyone tries to disturb the law and order situation, he will be dealt strictly as per law”.Meanwhile, the ‘Mahapanchayat’ decided to accord “martyr” status to Nikita and sought exemplary punishment for the accused.“Despite grave pressure put on her by the main accused to marry him and convert to Islam, she outright refused and even sacrificed herself. The ‘Sarv Samaj’ (mahapanchayat) gave her martyr status.“Further, the Mahapanchayat decided to organise a “Shradhanjali Sabha” on November 8 in her memory. We have demanded that the case should be tried by a fast track court. The woman’s family should be given compensation by the government and provided police security,” a member of the “Mahapanchayat” told reporters in Ballabhgarh.Nikita, a BCom final-year student, had come out of her college after appearing in an exam on Monday afternoon when she was shot dead outside the place in Ballabhgarh allegedly by the man who had been forcing her to marry him, according to police.Police have so far arrested three people in connection with the case. Tausif and Rehan were nabbed on Tuesday, while Ajaru was held on Thursday.A Special Investigation Team has been set up to carry out the probe.Notably, some Hindu outfits have alleged that the main accused in the case had been putting pressure on the young woman for marriage and had also asked her to convert to Islam.The woman’s family has claimed that Tausif had harassed her two years ago and had compelled her to convert to Islam in order to marry him, which she had refused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ballabhgarh-stone-pelting-injures-police-on-delhi-agra-highway/story-w6GduZlahOZTGYruBmWIgP.html

The polling in 94 seats, spread over 17 districts mostly in north Bihar, Patna and Kosi belt, will be held on November 3. In total, 1,463 candidates are in the fray of which 1,316 candidates are male, 146 female and one from transgender community. The total number of voters in the second phase is 2.86 crore of which 1.50 crore are males, 1.35 crore are females and 980 from the third gender. For the ruling NDA, comprising the BJP –JD(U) along with smaller allies like HAM(S) and VIP, the second phase is crucial as the BJP alone is fighting in 46 seats, JD(U) 43 seats and the VIP on five seats. In the opposition camp, the RJD is contesting 56 seats, Congress 24, CPI-ML (liberation) six while the CPI and the CPM are contesting four seats each. As per reports, the BJP contesting 46 seats is in direct contest with the RJD in 27 seats and with Congress in 12 while the JD(U) contesting 43 seats is in direct contest with RJD in 25 seats and with Congress in 12 seats. In rest of the seats, there are also contests among candidates put by Left parties and also alliances like the LJP and the Grand Secular Democratic Front led by RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha. Also read: ‘Lantern raj vs LED bulb’ - PM Modi takes on Opposition in Motihari rallyIn the 2015 assembly polls, the Mahagatbandhan, which had the JD(U) as part of the RJD-Congress combine, had won 70 out of 94 seats going to polls in the second phase this time. The BJP-led NDA had won 20 seats while the LJP had won two seats. Among the prominent candidates whose fate would be decided in the second phase of polls include RJD’s chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Prasad Yadav contesting from Raghopur in Vaisali, former minister Tej Pratap Yadav contesting from Hasanpur in Samastipur, former minister Alok Kumar Mehta contesting from Ujiarpur, and several ministers in the state government. In Patna, the major contestants in the fray in the second phase of polling include road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav who is seeking re-election from Patna Saheb seat for the seventh time. Yadav is pitted against Praveen Kushwaha of the Congress. Altogether 13 candidates are in the fray from Patna Sahib seat. In Kumhrar, the contest is locked between sitting BJP MLA Arun Sinha and RJD’s Dharmendra Chandrawansi while in Danapur, again the contest is between BJP sitting MLA Asha Devi and RJD’s Ritlal Yadav. In Bankipore, the contest is between BJP’s sitting MLA Nitin Navin and Congress’s Luv Sinha, son of cine star-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha. In Darbhanga, five assembly seats that will go to polls in the second phase on November 3, a contest will be seen between parties sans any contestants in the fray directly from the BJP. Although on two of the five seats, allotted to Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), the BJP has fielded its functionaries- Swarna Singh from Gaura Bauram and Mishrilal Yadav from Alinagar seat respectively. In 2015 elections, JD-U’s Madan Sahni had won Gaura Bauram seat while RJD heavyweight Abdul Bari Siddiqui trounced BJP’s Mishrilal Yadav in Alinagar. Apart from Gaura Bauram, JD-U’s candidates Shashi Bhushan Hazari from Kusheshwar Asthan (SC) and Sunil Choudhary from Benipur had defeated their rival candidates while contesting the polls in alliance with party’s erstwhile coalition partners - RJD and Congress combine. As of now, three of the five seats, Kusheshwar Asthan, Gaura Bauram and Benipur are, thus, represented by JD-U MLAs whereas, Darbhanga (rural) and Alinagar constituencies are represented by RJD MLAs - Lalit Kumar Yadav and Abdul Bari Siddiqui respectively.

Siddiqui was replaced by a Brahmin candidate. Vinod Mishra is RJD’s new choice from Alinagar seat. Meanwhile, the JD(U) has shifted sitting MLA Madan Sahni from Gaura Bauram to Bahadurpur. The VIP has, on the other hand, fielded Swarna Singh in Gaura Bauram against RJD’s Afzal Ali Khan. Swarna Singh is the daughter-in-law of BJP MLC Sunil Singh who passed away a couple of months ago following Covid-19 infection. In Benipur, the constituency was wrested by JD-U’s Sunil Chaudhary in 2015 polls. This time, the party has fielded Binay Kumar Chaudhary against Congress candidate Mithilesh Choudhary.

01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana govt considering legal provisions against ‘love jihad’: Khattar||A day after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced his government will bring a law against “love jihad”, his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar said his government is also considering legal provisions against it to ensure “the guilty cannot escape”. Citing the recent murder of a student in Faridabad’s Ballabhgarh, Khattar said the incident is being linked to “love jihad”. Last week, a 21-year-old student, Nikita, was shot dead outside her college in Ballabhgarh. The victim’s father alleged that the accused was pressuring her to convert to Islam in order to marry him. The Haryana government has set up a three-member Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the case. Speaking to reporters in Karnal, Khattar said, “This (Ballabhgarh) incident needs to be strongly condemned. It is being seen linked with the love jihad issue. The Centre and the state government are looking into this issue and legal advice is being taken so that such incidents are not repeated. Legal provisions are being contemplated so that the guilty cannot escape and no innocent person is punished.” Earlier in the day, Haryana home minister Anil Vij tweeted the state government “is contemplating a law against love jihad”.Reiterating that the state government is concerned about the murder, Vij said attempts are being made for religious conversion across the country through “love-jihad”. “In the Faridabad case too, the family has alleged that the accused had mounted pressure for religious conversion. This is not acceptable and therefore we will have to think about it,” Vij tweeted. He said, “We will discuss this issue with all political parties and public after which a decision will be taken.” Vij said the SIT set up to investigate the murder will also probe the conversion angle and if there is a conspiracy regarding religious conversion via ‘love-jihad” in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-govt-considering-legal-provisions-against-love-jihad-khattar/story-Wfx4dmZv4XlfzWqKWqge1O.html
01-11-2020||City||Watch out! Police cameras keeping an eye on traffic violators in Ludhiana||Cracking the whip on commuters disregarding traffic rules, the traffic police have resumed sending e-challans to the violators.These challans are issued with the help of hi-tech cameras equipped with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), red-light violation detectors (RLVD) and night vision.Currently, this system is installed at six locations – Old Session Chowk, Hero Bakery Chowk on Pakhowal Road, Mini-Secretariat crossing, Durga Mata Mandir Chowk near Jagraon Bridge, Dholewal Chowk and Chhatri Chowk (the intersection near HDFC bank on Mall Road).According to traffic police personnel, they daily issue up to 150 e- challans, which are sent to their postal addresses of the violators.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, traffic) Gurdev Singh said the CCTVs helped the police monitor the traffic flow and penalise violations without pressing in manpower on the roads. “Pictures of the violation are sent to the traffic offenders along with the challan. Thereon, they have one month from the date of issue of challan to make the payment,” he added.The fine can be paid at the nearest Saanjh Kendra or online at www.ludhianapolice.in. Payments can be made using credit card, debit card or net banking by using the ‘e-challan payment’ link on the website.Among the most common violations, the ACP said, were not stopping behind zebra crossing and jumping the red light. “When they don’t spot a traffic cop deployed nearby, commuters tend to not follow the zebra crossing rule and don’t stop when the traffic light is red. Both offences are punishable with a fine of Rs 1,000 under the new Motor Vehicles Act,” the official added.“During the lockdown due to the Coronavirus outbreak, the entire police department was busy imposing the curfew and handling other Covid duties. Therefore, police had stopped issuing e-challans. However, post lockdown, vehicular traffic has resumed at full scale. So, we have started issuing e-challans as well,” the ACP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/watch-out-police-cameras-keeping-an-eye-on-traffic-violators-in-ludhiana/story-9T34ZVQGVyBiGT03wLAhuN.html

The golden card distribution campaign would cover 6,709 villages across 29 districts. On this occasion, Adityanath inaugurated a Culture and DST Lab and National Tuberculosis Eradication Program at BRD Medical College Gorakhpur. “The infant mortality is a challenge for all of us, although the situation is better than before. Consistent vaccination is a crucial aspect of the Prime Minister’s Ayushman Bharat Yojana,” he said. The UP Chief Minister lauded the health officials and medical teams across the state for their contribution in “containing” the coronavirus crisis. He further urged them to focus on eradicating TB from the state. “If we go by our plan and work persistently, Uttar Pradesh will be free of TB by 2025,” the Chief Minister said.Earlier, Dr Harsh Vardhan, Union Minister for Health and Welfare, during his meeting with ministers of Member Nations of WHO, Heads, and Representatives of UN Agencies, had also said that India has accorded high priority for ending tuberculosis by 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/yogi-adityanath-launches-tb-vaccination-campaign-in-uttar-pradesh-aims-to-eradicate-disease-by-2025/story-p343II7GLDZJbXKQhihpHK.html

01-11-2020||City||Political parties wrap up campaigns for Baroda bypoll||The campaigning for the Baroda bypoll ended on Sunday with political parties making last efforts to woo voters of the rural constituency at public meetings and roadshows.The Baroda assembly, which fell vacant after the demise of Congress MLA Sri Krishan Hooda, will go to poll on November 3.The head-to-head contest between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress is in the offing for the Baroda bypoll. While the BJP has fielded Olympian wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, who lost by about 4,800 votes to Hooda in 2019 assembly election, the Congress has put its money on a newcomer, Indu Raj Narwal, a former member of Sonepat zila parishad. Hooda takes out roadshows The last day of the campaign was dominated by leader of opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and his Rajya Sabha MP son Deepender Hooda, who took out separate roadshows in the constituency.Addressing a gathering at Baroda village, Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the actual election will begin after completion of the campaign. “You (workers) should distribute your duties and inform me after seeing any suspected person in your village. The government will make all efforts to woo the voters but you will have to give your duties at night. The voters of Baroda will give a referendum to this arrogant government. This fight is to reach Chandigarh and Baroda voters will form their own government. I want to assure you that no one can snatch the steering wheel from me,” Hooda said.Deepender Singh Hooda said people are eagerly waiting to oust the BJP-JJP from the Baroda seat and then from Haryana. “The BJP-JJP has dragged the state into unemployment, corruption and crime. The youth are waiting for jobs and farmers are forced to sell their produce below the minimum support price (MSP). The price of tomato has reached the highest in past one decade,” he added.Door to door campaign for saffron partyThe saffron party’s campaign revolved around party nominee Yogeshwar Dutt, who launched a door to door campaign in the constituency. “ I urge all voters to give me belated birthday blessing on the polling day. I am very confident of winning the election on development issues of the BJP and my personal achievements. I am a wrestler and I have no caste,” he said.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his deputy Dushyant Chautala did not participate on the last day of campaigning.Meanwhile, INLD general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala and party supremo OP Chautala also participated in a door to door campaign to support their party candidate on the last day. However, the party nominee Joginder Singh Malik interacted with voters at various villages. The Loktantra Suraksha party chief Raj Kumar Saini addressed village-level meetings. The election campaign turned ugly at Rabda village of the constituency on Saturday evening as a liquor contractor was killed with sharp-edged weapons after a dispute over distribution by another group. Members of a group also opened fire at rivals resulting in injuries to three persons of the same village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/political-parties-wrap-up-campaigns-for-baroda-bypoll/story-K1xrGwRbuIJ2qV3TXFhTdI.html

Building a sustainable infrastructure, the snow leopard conservation centre aims to give employment to the local population through different avenues like the cafeteria, souvenir shop, guides for research work from local communities, among others. The project aims to secure livelihoods, conservation, sustainable use and restoration of high range Himalayan ecosystems. The conservation centre will be built at Lanka, near Bhaironghati bridge in Uttarkashi district, a bordering district. Sandeep Kumar, divisional forest officer (DFO) of Uttarkashi forest division said that the Snow Leopard Conservation Centre is being developed as a centre of excellence with orientation for conservation which will cater to different avenues like local employment, tourism opportunities and facilitate research. “This centre will help in controlling local tourism through the museums-spread information about all flora-fauna of the snow leopard landscape and use the ecological set-up for scientists to research about the landscape through which we plan to give employment to the local population,” said Kumar. Also read: Hizbul Muhajideen’s top terrorist Saifullah killed in encounter in KashmirThe senior forest official said that any researcher working in the area will need help from locals as the terrain and the landscape is extremely remote and known well by the locals. “We will encourage the locals from the adjacent eight villages to work as integrated guides. Locals from the bordering villages like Harsil, Mukhwa and others will be trained as conservation guides for trekking, bird-watching as they are accustomed to the local climate and know the flora-fauna well,” added Kumar. Professor Anne Feenstra, the main architect working on the project, said that the conservation centre is pro-ecology, pro-local and pro-people. “Local craftsmen will be involved in the construction, nature guides will be recruited locally for future training expeditions. It will also showcase the local architectural styles and designs along with making it earthquake resistant. Moreover, no trees will be cut for this project and only those trees which have been damaged in landslides will be used, making it pro-ecology,” said Prof Feenstra. He further elaborated that the design will follow the contours of the mountainous land with no cutting and is based on utilising passive solar energy (using the morning sun to warm up the spaces inside the building given the altitude of over 9,000 feet). The Centre has further been designed with double glazing and thermal insulation to reduce the carbon footprint of the buildings. In August this year, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, along with the state forest minister and officials from the forest department, took a meeting in this regard. Rawat had then said special efforts should be made to conserve and increase the number of snow leopards in the state. “Areas, where snow leopards have been seen in the last few years, should be identified by the forest department in collaboration with local people and military forces. Snow leopards should be estimated in these areas by making grids. The conservation of snow leopards and other wildlife in the area will give a boost to winter tourism in the state,” said Rawat. The snow leopard is a ‘Schedule I’ animal under the Wildlife Protection Act of India and is listed as “endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The animal faces many threats to its existence due to poaching and habitat destruction. It inhabits the Himalayas at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 metres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-govt-trying-to-generate-jobs-via-country-s-first-snow-leopard-conservation-centre/story-NlkYlAhpVTBd4WiaJOGSkI.html

He came to power in Bihar after a long political battle with RJD chief Lalu Prasad. A few years later, he snapped ties with the BJP, an old ally and ended up forging an alliance with his arch rival,” he told a news channel.Paswan, whose late father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, joined the NDA ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, recalled “criticisms heaped on (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi” by Kumar, who had been opposed to his then Gujarat counterpart.“Fancying himself as a potential challenger to the prime minister nationally, Kumar, with Lalu Prasad by his side, spewed so much venom against Modi in the assembly polls held just five years ago. It took him just two years to dump Lalu and return to the NDA,” he said with a hint of sarcasm.“Mark my words, he has been very caustic against Lalu Prasad during his election campaign, but given his disposition he may once again cross over, try to form the next government with the Grand Alliance, and even try to project himself as an alternative to Modi in 2024,” Paswan, who is the MP from Jamui, said.Earlier, the LJP chief addressed a press conference where he repeated the allegations of corruption in ‘saat nishchay’ (seven resolves) which included, among other things, schemes for bringing piped water to every household and fortifying alleys and ditches with concrete.Also Read | ‘When government is run by leaders that respect women, it shows,’ Congress takes swipe at UP, Bihar“Corruption in these schemes ought to be thoroughly probed and we must not be surprised if the complicity of the chief minister himself comes to the fore,” he added.The LJP has fielded its candidates in over 140 seats of the 243-strong assembly, mostly against those fighting on a JD(U) ticket. Paswan’s party has shied away from taking on the BJP in most of the 110 seats being contested by the saffron party.It has also made an exception in the JD(U)’s case at Hassanpur, where interestingly, it is being felt that the LJP wants to help Tej Pratap Yadav, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad’s elder son, who is pitted against the sitting MLA belonging to the chief minister’s party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/nitish-will-quit-nda-after-assembly-polls-try-to-challenge-modi-in-2024-says-chirag-paswan/story-vkttF3BabsOZ8q5X0Tw5YI.html
01-11-2020||Election:||Bihar polls: With sharp attack on Opposition, PM Modi’s message is loud and clear||From family to fiefdom and ‘jungle raj’ to ‘double yuvraj’, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sharp and pointed in his attack on the Opposition, equating Bihar’s political situation with that of Uttar Pradesh in 2017. The message to the voters was loud and clear – Bihar is heading for a result that UP witnessed when the hype over ‘double yuvraj’ (his indication was towards the duo of Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi) was busted and the BJP swept in the biggest ever electoral victory. PM Modi’s confidence that the NDA was set to sweep election yet again in Bihar is understandable as two crucial phases of polling remain and the Opposition, buoyed by youth’s response to RJD spearhead Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav’s 10-lakh job offer, and LJP chief Chirag Paswan’s relentless attack on Nitish Kumar, sniffs a chance. The promise of jobs remains the biggest shaker in this election, though what impact it will ultimately have will be known only after the election results are out. For Tejashwi, the election has already been a big opportunity to evolve into a leader and he seems to be enjoying the moment, trying to match every attack with a counter-attack and addressing a record number of rallies day after day, sticking to his blueprint of raising the economic issues despite questions being raised about their feasibility. Pointing to PM’s reference to double-engine government in Bihar to propel its growth, Tejaswhi wasted no time in hitting back - “But the PM did not throw light on why the unemployment rate jumped to 46.6 percent in Bihar despite double engine, why there is migration from every second house in the state and why Bihar fares poorly in education and remains high in crime rate,” he added. Also read: ‘Don’t forget those who questioned existence of Ram,’ says PM ModiLJP chief Chirag Paswan, too, found the opportunity just right to train his guns on chief minister Nitish Kumar, with a news clip about income tax raids on contractors involved with Bihar’s ‘nal-jal’ yojana, one of the ‘seven resolves’ of the chief minister and one which has been under attack for corruption. “Thanks to the IT department on behalf of the people of Bihar for exposing the corruption in the jal-nal yojana and bringing it before the people. Seven resolves remains one of the biggest scams since independence,” he tweeted, as the PM launched a scathing attack on the RJD’s 15-year rule to remind the people about the “horror tales of abduction and crime”. Chirag also had a dig at Nitish Kumar, saying the PM had to take the reins of election in his hand, as he had realized that nobody would vote for the CM. “The PM is putting a lot of effort as he knows it is all up to him,” said Chirag, who is also campaigning hard after fielding candidates against all the JD(U) candidates even while swearing in the name of PM Modi. Chirag reiterated that defeating Nitish Kumar would be the victory of Bihar. Chirag, at his rally in Alauli in Khagaria, also played the emotional card, reminding people that it was the first time he was there without his father. A large number of people gathered to listen to him. Khagaria is the native district of late Ram Vilas Paswan. Political analyst Prof NK Choudhary said that the pressure was clearly on Nitish Kumar for the first time from all sides and it is getting reflected. “The Opposition has won the perception battle and the PM, who would have anyway campaigned the way he often does, knows it and therefore he is shielding Nitish Kumar. Perception battle does not mean the Opposition can pull through, but it has certainly put enormous pressure on Nitish Kumar by raising some pertinent issues concerning his governance model and economy,” he added.

What was once considered a one-sided battle has certainly generated a lot of interest due to the manoeuvrings of two young leaders and tested the veterans,” he added. Analyst Professor Ajay Jha said that the situation in Bihar was different from UP and therefore PM’s confidence could be misplaced. “Nobody knows how far Tejashwi will go this time, but it is a fact that Nitish Kumar is at the receiving end from all sides. Batting vigorously for Nitish Kumar, against whom a fatigue factor has set in, may not serve the purpose for the BJP this time,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-polls-with-sharp-attack-on-opposition-pm-modi-s-message-is-loud-and-clear/story-PqumETvX4bv80ZxSVFEPFO.html

We are sure everyone will back the CM’s initiative to develop and beautify the Darjeeling hills, in the interest of its people,” a TMC leader said.The Binay Tamang faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, currently enjoying political control over Darjeeling, has vowed not to allow Gurung to enter the Hills.“The people of the Hills don’t want him to return as it would mean days of strike and violence. They want peace,” Thapa, who is also a senior GJM leader of the Tamang faction, had said earlier.According to sources, Gurung, who had been in hiding for three years, is now watching the situation closely and is expecting the state government to drop charges of murder and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/mamata-banerjee-likely-to-meet-gorkha-janmukti-morcha-leader-binoy-tamang/story-NfLzww7Gvdf5kLJL77jWcJ.html
01-11-2020||Pune||Indian Medical Association writes to PMO on tweaked Covid-19 vaccination guidelines||The Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra chapter, has alleged a biased treatment meted out to private hospitals by the state government, which the IMA alleges has tweaked the Covid-19 vaccination guidelines issued by the central government. The health ministry recently stated that the vaccine introduction will span over multiple groups, sequentially, starting with healthcare workers. However, the guidelines issued by the state mentions that private hospitals ‘registered with the district’ will be eligible. The IMA alleges that the central government does not mention any such clause. The association has said that this will lead to the exclusion of multiple doctors from privately-run hospitals, clinics, pathology clinics, X-ray and sonography clinics. The district health offices across the state are now in the process of collecting this database for vaccination against the infection whenever the vaccine is available for administering. Alleging this bias, the IMA has now written to the PMO since earlier the association has said that multiple letters to the chief minister’s office had gone unanswered. The letter states, “The central government finalised to set up a database for this purpose and published a booklet of guidelines in this regard. In these guidelines on page no. 6 and 7, what kind of doctors will get the vaccination has been mentioned in very simple language. This includes all government and private hospitals, government doctors, as well as all health workers in private clinics, day OPDs and polyclinics. The central government has planned to vaccinate all these health workers on a priority basis. The central government, then, directed all the states to collect the information accordingly. Accordingly, the Hon’ble health secretary of the Government of Maharashtra sent an official letter, on October 23, to all district collectors, municipal commissioners and divisional commissioners. However, the Hon’ble health secretary of Maharashtra changed the guidelines given by the central government. In that letter, by changing point no. 8b, the words ‘registered with the district’ were introduced in parenthesis, while enumerating the private medical facilities. In a subsequent meeting with all the district collectors, Hon’ble health secretary of Maharashtra directed that only the doctors and medical staff of the hospitals registered under the Bombay Nursing Home Act should be registered. This has led to the exclusion of doctors from privately-run hospitals, clinics, pathology clinics, X-ray and sonography clinics.”Dr Avinash Bhondwe said, “Along with government doctors, private medical professionals have also played a key role in treating patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. Of the 61 private doctors who died of coronavirus in Maharashtra, the number of general practitioners and private clinic owners was higher. Yet, we feel that they have been left out for the reason known only to the state government. There are 25,000 hospitals in Maharashtra and one lakh allopathic doctors registered with the Maharashtra Medical Council. There are another 1.2 lakh doctors of AYUSH and so, totally around 2.2 lakh, who have been kept outside the vaccination priority.”Dr Bhagwan Pawar, district health officer, who has been nominated to organise the database from both private and government hospitals, said, “We have about 233 government facilities which are eligible as healthcare workers and 12,166 private facilities. We have distributed the template that we received from the state government to all the private and government hospitals. We have got the responses from 216 government facilities and over 3,385 private hospitals. Since the form is an exhaustive one, we send back the ones which are incomplete, we have over a week’s time to get all the information and we will be able to get it.”Dr Pawar also added that the forms have been sent to all the clinics including the sonography and even X-ray clinics and will send all the necessary information to the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ima-writes-to-pmo-on-tweaked-covid-19-vaccination-guidelines/story-Rd1HjmBpvNmH9VkUJNjp6I.html
01-11-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Pune residents share how they plan to tackle Covid-19’s second wave||The administration is taking steps like increasing hospital beds and strengthening health infra to contain the spread of the possible second wave of Covid-19, an unpredictable virus with no vaccine in sight. Readers share what steps as responsible citizens residents should take during the festive season, a possible period of mass gathering and neglect of prevention norms, to check the virus spread Avoid public gatherings at all cost Keeping the festive season in mind, residents should definitely avoid gatherings and instead enjoy at home with loved ones. Taking preventive measures and abiding by laws will definitely help all of us to remain healthy and safe in our homes. Extensive testing and contact tracing of possible cases is the main requirement. Moreover, the administration needs to ensure that rules are strictly followed in containment zones. All these precautions should be needed to overcome the crisis. A massive awareness campaign should be undertaken which includes wearing a proper mask, personal hygiene practice, social distancing, and a ban on public gathering in temples and other places. Lastly, the government should ensure compliance on the reopening of public places, including public transport. Kamna Dinesh Gandhe Social distance is the key According to the media, the numbers have been declining due to hot weather, but are expected to rise again in December. There are some things that need to be considered to prevent the possible second wave as stated by the visiting central government’s team. Festivals will take place in cities and the number of people traveling to their hometowns will increase. Public need to follow precautionary measures, along with administrative efforts, during the festive month. Diwali is just a few days away and guidelines prepared by the Union health ministry must be followed. As winter approaches, it is time for residents to take proper care. It is a critical time for the health system. Further care is required. At present, it is safe to greet with clasped hands. Avoid large gatherings. Maintain social etiquette. To reduce the risk of infection, keep a distance of at least one meter. Keep a safe distance even when you are at home or in office. When you return, take off your slippers, take a hot bath and wash your clothes. If you notice any symptoms, contact a doctor immediately and keep yourself away from others in the house. Suvarna Hitendra Deolankar Government needs to create awareness Firstly, we must accept that the second wave of Covid-19 is a reality being experienced by many countries like France and Germany which are back under lockdown. The second wave is reported to have already reached our neighbour Pakistan. As we all may remember that while reading initial news of the infection in Wuhan and Italy, the “it won’t happen here” syndrome now doesn’t hold good for any part of the world when it comes to coronavirus. The same goes for the second wave. With the unlocking underway, many are unaware or complacent of the fact that this deadly virus can make a quick comeback if we let down our guards. Because of the festive season and winter, the government needs to create urgent public awareness through the media about the second wave. It must be done in a manner that it educates the masses preparing them in case of the eventuality, but without causing fear or anxiety. With people fully aware, it is no more only the government’s responsibility to deal with this unpredictable virus. Hereafter, the public has an equal or more responsibility to keep the virus away which, even with no medicine, can be done with social distancing and sanitisation protocol. Our ethical conduct over the next few months of festivities will show whether we really have learned any lessons from the destructive first wave or not. Dhairyashil Vandekar Can’t let the guard down during festivities Festive season witnesses large gatherings in specified locations for religious worship, fairs, rallies, exhibitions, cultural functions, and processions lasting for a day or weeks together. To prevent the spread of the Covid-19 infection, it is important that citizens act responsibly while enjoying festivities. Citizens must avoid the following acts - not wearing a mask or wearing a mask improperly, not maintaining social distancing, activities which may create unclean or unhygienic conditions or affect public health and safety at the event venue. The citizens must comply with following respiratory etiquettes, self-monitoring of health by all and reporting any illnesses, citizens should ensure physical distancing at the event venue and follow specific markings on the floor made by the venue administration, citizens should ensure guidelines of queue management inside and outside the premises, while participating in mass events. Citizens should not touch statues, idols, holy books while visiting religious places and citizens volunteering in community kitchens, langars, annadan at the event venue should follow physical distancing norms while preparing and distributing food. Taking precaution is the best remedy. Deepika Fernandes - Shewale Backing the administration a must We are now more prepared mentally and socially for the apprehension of a second Covid-19 wave. Even if the administration is working round the clock to bring the situation under control, which fortunately with great difficulty they have in Maharashtra, I think as citizens, we need to be more reasonable in our conduct. We all know the do’s and don’ts of Covid-19. We must extend our support to the administration by avoiding mass gatherings, avoiding the burning of firecrackers, avoiding all ways by which there can be community spread of the virus. Covid-19 affects the lungs, so we need to be responsible and think about the senior citizens, positive patients, and those with poor immunity, as it could further worsen the situation for us. It is a difficult phase for us, but we have very little or no option in hand as the vaccine is still in the developing stage. Covid warriors are fighting to save lives tirelessly for the past so many months, I think as citizens we have to respond to the efforts of these Covid warriors by at least following all the norms laid down for us and taking good care of ourselves. Sheetal Lokhande Waghchoure Govt must strictly enforce guidelines We are aware of the weak Indian healthcare system and that the larger portion of healthcare facilities is largely concentrated in private hand and mostly in urban areas. As per the report, the Covid-19 pandemic is spreading in the rural parts of Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal. Based on the current number, India is not producing enough doctors and during the pandemic, India faced a huge shortage of medical staff. The WHO report prescribes a doctor-to-patient ratio of 1:1,000, but India has 1:1,596 which means for every 1,000 seeking medical help there is less than one doctor. The situation is going to worsen in the coming days in rural areas. Now that India is struggling with the current situation and there is an expert prediction of a second wave of Covid-19, the Indian government should now strictly adhere to the pandemic protocol. The government should look seriously into the following terms and condition such as strictly banning social gathering in festivals, concentrate on strengthening the healthcare system for early detections, containment of disease and patients. The government should also focus on the need of the hour while building the healthcare system. The production of PPE and medical product should increase with respect to the current situation, especially in rural areas.

01-11-2020||Pune||Laxmi road in Pune brightens up with customers ahead of Diwali||Laxmi road, one of Pune’s most frequented shopping destinations, had been bereft of customers over the last few months due to the lockdown, but with Diwali two weeks from now, shoppers are making a beeline at their favourite shops. Festive shopping, however, has made a comeback with caution.“It is good to see people walking into the store and buy items, but they are being very cautious. Right now, more youngsters and women come into our stores,” said Rajesh Parwani, owner, HyFashion, a popular shop for readymade garments.“We opened our shops in April, but there were no customers. With Diwali round the corner, we are happy to see people walking into the store and shopping. We are not allowing customers to try on the garments and if they want to exchange, then the clothes are kept aside for 48 hours and then brought to the racks, but generally people come with an idea of their sizes,” added Parwani.Swapna Divekar, a resident of Pimple Saudagar, who was accompanied by her daughter to Laxmi road, said, “We are happy to be here at Laxmi road for shopping and though we are afraid of coming into the city, we have decided to quickly get into one store, shop and return. I wouldn’t want to roam around.”According to the Federation of Trade Associations of Pune (FTAP), secretary, Mahendra Pitaliya, “Business has not picked up despite Diwali being round the corner. There is only 30 to 40 per cent business in shops on Laxmi road. We have given strict instructions to all shopkeepers that no entry should be given to those without a mask and everyone has to have a sanitiser and a thermal scanner at the entrance. We have also tested every employee of each shop on Laxmi road and they have tested negative, but we are all very careful while dealing with customers.” Though there are several customers on the road, not all are ready to go inside shops. “I decided to visit one shop, which had less crowd. I came to buy blouse pieces. I really appreciate that even small shops have kept sanitisers and masks are also on sale,” said K Vijaya, who had travelled from Nigdi to Laxmi road.Tushar Dave, owner of Kum Kum Matching centre, said, “I have a small shop and initially I was allowing only one person inside, but now two persons can enter my shop at a time. The best thing is that family members on their own stay outside the store and help maintain social distancing.”While the shoppers slowly trickle into the shops, not everyone is doing good business. Amar Dresses, who deal in men’s clothes have been waiting for more customers to come in. “The business is slow. We are only selling 10 per cent of our products, said the owner refusing to divulge his name.“Though there are people on the road, reviving the original glory of shopping on Laxmi road, however, customers are not buying so much. Sale of shoes has only been 20 per cent of my entire stock,” said Ram Misal, who runs a shoe shop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/laxmi-road-in-pune-brightens-up-with-customers-ahead-of-diwali/story-ZZPOfwwohgQVEeYCGZ2bLN.html

01-11-2020||Pune||Dams full but demand for tankers on the rise in Pune||Despite Pune getting enough rain for the last three years, the number of tankers are on the rise in the city after every monsoon. The city has received adequate rainfall and there is enough storage in the Khadakwasla reservoir. Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) water department head Aniruddha Pawaskar said, “I need to check the exact number of tankers but the reason behind the increasing number of tankers is mainly population. Mainly the population in those areas in which the city is getting water supply with low pressure.” One of the officers on the condition of anonymity said that mainly tankers are increased in areas like Kondhwa, Nagar road, Dhayari. These areas are getting less water, but tankers have also increased in city areas which is a little shocking. The officer said the main reason for this year might be due to lockdown. The entire population stayed home. Due to hygiene reasons, there might be an increase in water usage in residential areas. PMC official said on anonymity that it is accepted that the tanker use is increasing during the summer but despite having a rainy season, the tankers are increasing in the city which points out that the city needs to execute an equal water scheme 24x7 with speed. Another PMC official from the water department said, “Earlier there were allegations of PMC and builders being hand in glove and using potable water for construction activity. But this year, due to lockdown, there was no construction activity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/dams-full-but-demand-for-tankers-on-the-rise-in-pune/story-yDyl2Wd4cbMZ36SO7KrZJI.html
01-11-2020||Pune||Pune receives decade’s highest rainfall in Oct 2020||Pune has received the highest rainfall of the decade in October 2020. The city registered a record 312.4mm rainfall last month, according to the data shared by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The second highest rainfall was received in 2010 wherein 262.99 mm rainfall was recorded while the third highest decadal rainfall was reported in 2019 when 235.5 mm rainfall was recorded at the observatory. Also, Pune received the highest rainfall in a single day on October 14 at 112.1 mm this year. The previous highest was on May 13, 2015 when Pune recorded 103mm on a single day. Pune district, along with Mumbai, was placed on “yellow alert” in October on 13th, 14th and 15th by IMD following very heavy rains and thunderstorm. A red alert was issued for districts like Kolhapur, Satara, Sindhudurg and Osmanabad while Ratnagiri, Sangli, Solapur, Parbhani and Beed had an orange alert. Weather experts have also termed global warming and climate change as influential factors which impacted the rainfall scenario in the country and the state during monsoon 2020. Weather scientists also said that due to a change in weather pattern due to climate change, intense and heavy rainfall has been reported instead of the traditional pattern of steady rains. City environmentalists believe that large-scale destruction of human lives and property has been reported during the last two years of monsoon due to factors like rising temperatures and extreme rainfall. Similarly, rapid urbanisation and construction in the flood line areas of rivers crossing the city along with dumping of concrete in nallahs has led to disastrous situation in the city during the spell of current monsoon. In June, Pune district was battered with widespread rain as cyclone Nisarga hit the western parts of the state such as Pune, Maval, Mulshi and Velhe. Other areas like Satara, Kolhapur and Sangli also witnessed rains during June. Cyclone Nisarga made landfall in the state’s Raigad district. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune said, “Pune has received more than normal rainfall due to cyclonic rain due to Nisarga, good moisture incursion and again prevalence of thunderstorm and low-pressure conditions brought heavy rainfall.” For the past three consecutive years, Pune has been receiving more than normal rainfall in June. In 2017, the normal rainfall recorded was 207 mm, 2018 recorded 148mm, 2019 recorded 194 mm.

01-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi Police constable, friend held over firing in road rage case||A Delhi Police constable and his friend were arrested on Saturday in connection with the firing over an alleged road rage incident in which a private bank manager was shot at in front of his three friends. The accused constable’s service pistol was allegedly used by his friend to fire the shot.The incident occurred at Baba Haridas Nagar in south-west Delhi on Thursday night, the police said on Sunday morning.Police officials probing the case said that the bullet was fired by Rajesh, who was identified by his first name, the friend of constable Surender, who was posted at the Jahangirpuri police station. The injured bank manager, Laxman Bhandari, and his three friends did not know the accused or Surender was a police constable since he was not in uniform, when the road rage incident occurred, the officials said.“The involvement of a policeman emerged in the case after the doctors who operated upon Bhandari found that he was shot at by a pistol that had a 9 millimetre (mm) bore. Usually, policemen use this kind of pistol. The investigating team scanned the footage of closed circuit TV (CCTV) cameras installed at the crime spot and identified Srurender and Rajesh. Investigators questioned Suernder and arrested him along with Rajesh after ascertaining their involvement in the crime,” said one of the police officials, who did not want to be named.Santosh Kumar Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), Delhi Police, said: “It was a road rage incident. Surender has been arrested along with his friend (Rajesh) for the crime. He was returning home after duty and wasn’t in uniform at the time of the incident.”A case of attempt to murder under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at the Baba Haridas Nagar police station. The service pistol used in the crime was also seized. The case was registered following the complaint of Bhandari’s friend Rahul, one of the eyewitnesses of the road rage incident.Rahul in his complaint told the police that on Thursday night, he had partied with his friends – Bhandari, Dinesh and Keshav -- at Najafgarh in outer Delhi. Dinesh and Keshav left on their motorcycle after the party, while Rahul and Bhandari left on another two-wheeler, the police said. On the way, two men in a car stopped Dinesh and Keshav and asked them to lift an allegedly inebriated person lying on the road along with his motorcycle. Dinesh and Keshav refused to help the allegedly inebriated person, which led to a heated argument. Dinesh called Rahul and informed him about the quarrel. Rahul and Bhandari arrived at the spot to help their friends, said the official, quoted above.“Soon, the altercation turned violent. Surender took out his service pistol and handed it over to Rajesh, who fired a bullet. The bullet hit Bhandari’s abdomen and he slumped on the road. Surender and Rajesh fled from the spot, instead of taking Bhandari to an adjoining hospital,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-police-constable-friend-held-over-firing-in-road-rage-case/story-ceLWP5Rrn5CAjl8CJoYYsM.html
01-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi teen develops app to help those with autism spectrum disorder communicate||A Class 12 student of a Delhi school has developed “We Can Express”, a mobile-based application for people suffering from autism spectrum disorder that will help them interact and communicate easily and also provide a platform to manage a user’s daily schedule using unique images and icons. Shruti Kakar, the 17-year-old developer who studies in Springdales School, Dhaula Kuan, came up with an idea to develop this app a year ago while volunteering for the inclusive education centre at her school. “I developed the app for people with the disability or inability to communicate verbally. I had met a boy my age some couple of years ago at my mother’s clinic who suffered from mild autism spectrum disorder. It was my first interaction with someone who had this condition. Last year, I volunteered at my school’s inclusive education centre and mentored a child with the condition,” Kakar said.Autism spectrum disorder is among the most common behavioural disorders in children.It took Kakar a year to develop the application. It is fairly simple to use once one signs up. The first step is to download the app. Then one needs to create customised speech icons, and next, the app can be used to communicate.“I researched in detail on what these people like, what colours and images they are comfortable with before working on the app. It is an easy-to-use application, and some users in the spectrum who have difficulty in putting thoughts to words may find it easier to use pictures to communicate and express themselves,” she said.“The visual schedule feature is a great tool for the user to complete daily, basic tasks like self-care, visiting a barber etc.,” said Kakar.The app is available both on Google Play store and App Store for download.The app is already being used at a few places with positive feedback.“It’s being used primarily in schools as we want children to be familiar with its use. Also, it is easier for children to adapt to a new technology. We are in touch with various special needs schools and hope to make them use this app. I have conducted webinars for feedback and made changes accordingly, like including icons related to Covid-19 pandemic that has masks etc.,” she said.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly one in 10 people has a mental health condition globally. And yet, more than a quarter of the world’s population live in a country where there is less than one psychiatrist for every 100,000 people. Experts in the field say apps like these may not solve everyone’s problems but are definitely a step in the right direction for people with autism spectrum disorder since they have problems in communicating verbally. “Since we are far from getting a cure for autism spectrum disorder, it helps to add even little, little things into the treatment basket that can make their life easy. Communication is an issue and these apps help in solving that problem. So the more mediums we have the better,” said Pulkit Sharma, a Delhi-based consultant clinical psychologist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-teen-develops-app-to-help-those-with-autism-spectrum-disorder-communicate/story-YKYpfJWjQTiV5oZGeOR9HI.html
01-11-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal paying price for TMC govt’s avoidable confrontation with Centre: Governor||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday said people of the state are “paying price for an avoidable confrontation” between the Centre and the Trinamool Congress dispensation here. The Centre and the states are two wheels of development, and there has to be “cooperative federalism and united action” to help the people, he told reporters here.“The pandemic has exposed the state of the health infrastructure in West Bengal. It could have been good if the state had adopted the Ayushman Bharat scheme of the Centre...Unfortunately, people of the state are paying price for lack of far-sightedness and an avoidable confrontation,” he said.Under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana, the Centre had deposited Rs 12,000 directly into the bank account of every farmer of the country, except West Bengal, the governor said. Dhankhar, who has been at odds with the government since assuming charge in West Bengal, said a total of Rs 92,000 crore has been distributed by the Centre under the programme but the farmers of the state have been deprived of such benefit.“This is a result of wrong policy, inaction and confrontation with the Centre,” the governor said, adding that he had taken up this matter with the state government and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Read more: West Bengal govt writes to railways for resuming suburban train services“After 21 months (from the inception of the scheme), she has written a letter to the Centre asking it to send the money to the state government for distribution among the farmers. Why the state government wants to act as an intermediary. The money is going directly to the farmers. It is not a good culture,” he said. Dhankhar also criticised the state government for “rising” crime against women in the state.“I have taken to Twitter to sensitise people against such crime,” he added. The governor is on a month-long tour of Darjeeling from Sunday. Dhankhar said the purpose of his visit to north Bengal is to assess “the ground realities”.The governor’s tour of Darjeeling comes in the backdrop of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha supremo Bimal Gurung announcing his party’s exit from the NDA and pledging support to the Trinamool Congress in the next year’s assembly elections. Speaking on GJM leader Bimal Gurung, who had recently made a dramatic public appearance in Kolkata after being on the run for three years following charges of murder and cases under the stringent UAPA, Dhankhar said, “a fugitive of the law is also a fugitive of the society”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-paying-price-for-tmc-govt-s-avoidable-confrontation-with-centre-governor/story-MEuyEQ8AghNtyyQS5rpvYK.html
01-11-2020||Gurugram||MCG survey to identify city’s dangerous buildings||On the directions of the Haryana Human Rights Commission (HHRC), the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) will be conducting a survey to identify all the dangerous buildings in the city, nearly 18 months after the collapse of two buildings. The MCG has set a 15-day deadline to complete this task.In January last year, a building collapsed in Ullawas village, claiming the lives of seven people; three months later another building collapsed in Sector 13. No injuries were reported in that incident.After the incidents, the MCG was directed both by the district administration and the Punjab and Haryana High Court (HC) to initiate a survey to identify all the dangerous buildings in the city that are unfit for human habitation. However, no steps were taken by the civic body in this regard as per the internal order issued by MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh earlier this week.According to MCG officials privy to the matter, Singh had attended a hearing before the HHRC bench last week in Chandigarh regarding the matter. In his order — a copy of which is in the possession of Hindustan Times — Singh stated that taking cognisance of the collapse of two buildings last year, HHRC has directed the MCG to submit a detailed report regarding the buildings that have not been constructed as per the building bye-laws and the safety parameters and can, therefore, be considered to be “dangerous to human habitation.”“In compliance with the orders issued by HHRC, a survey of all dangerous buildings is to be conducted and an action taken report (ATR) be prepared and submitted before HHRC for their perusal. The (MCG) executive engineers (XENs) are not sensitive to this serious problem and have not taken any step to identify the dangerous structures in their respective area so far. The matter relates to the danger to human lives, so needs utmost attention and real sensitivity(sic),” excerpts from Singh’s internal office order stated.Singh also appointed Satywan Singh, superintending engineer (SE), as the nodal officer for the survey and directed all executive engineers to support him in the matter. The SE would be preparing all reports in the matter and appearing before HHRC as MCG’s representative, the order further stated.Satywan Singh, on Wednesday evening, issued an order, to all eight executive engineers of the civic body to identify all the dangerous buildings in their respective areas within 15 days, failing which the matter could be treated as non-compliance with the orders of HC as well as those of the HHRC and “attract strict disciplinary action”.“The matter is of great public interest as it directly deals with their safety and well-being. Orders have been sent to all executive engineers to survey their respective areas so that a report can be formulated at the earliest that would help us create a database of all the unsafe structures in the city,” said Satywan.He further said that based on the report, the MCG would be directing building owners of all unsafe buildings to ensure that all occupants vacate their structures immediately, failing which the civic body would have to initiate action on its own.“We do not want a repeat of Ullawas or that of the four-storey building which tilted in Sector 46 due to heavy rains in August this year. In the latter, we had to scramble our resources at the penultimate moment and move the occupants to safety. By creating a database, we want to identify unsafe structures that can either be repaired or demolished. We want to give occupants of such structures a notice in advance so that the corrective measures can be taken and lives can be saved,” said Satywan. On January 24 last year, a newly constructed three-storey building collapsed in Ullawas village in Sector 61. The building had been built six months prior to the incident, and the building owner was adding an additional floor at the time. The lintel for the fourth-floor was erected a day before the incident leading to the weakening of the building’s structural stability and its ultimate collapse. On April 12, 2019, an under-construction basement in Sector 13 resulted in the base of the adjoining one-storey building, a cosmetic shop, to weaken and collapse. The cosmetic shop owner had closed his shop just 15 minutes before the incident. No injuries were reported in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-survey-to-identify-city-s-dangerous-buildings/story-b0iJzGwLTOckqBnbsoaJmO.html

There is no need for agitation and we hope the government will meet its promises,” Himmat Singh Gujjar, leader of Gujjar faction said, whose delegation met Rajasthan Minister Raghu Sharma on Saturday.One of the important agreements is that Rs 5 lakh assistance will be given to the families of three deceased during Gujjar agitation, Kailash Gujjar, Man Singh Gujjar and Badri Gujjar and municipal jobs to one member each of their families. On October 18, Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla had given an ultimatum to the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan to accept their demands, including reservation in jobs and education as a ‘most backward class’ (MBC), or face large-scale agitation beginning November 1.Bainsla had made this announcement at a Gujjar Mahapanchayat in Bharatpur which was called to decide the future course of action if their demands are not met. The agitation over reservation for the community was from November 1. Ahead of the agitation, mobile internet services were suspended in Karauli, Bharatpur, Jaipur and Sawai Madhopur. Additional police forces were also put on alert to deal with any law and order situation. Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti leader Vijay Bainsla had said, “From November 1, the movement will start in Pilupura because the government is not accepting our demands for the past two years.” He said the community was left with no option as the state government ignored their demands. He added that the Rajasthan government should get the Gujjar reservation included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, fill the backlog of vacancies and give the benefit of five per cent reservation to the Most Backward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/gujjar-body-rajasthan-cabinet-sub-panel-agree-on-14-points-stir-called-off/story-terS4sD8XabbrpKed5yCZM.html

01-11-2020||Delhi||As cases rise, Covid hospitalisations increase in Delhi: Govt data||The occupancy of beds assigned for the patients of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the national capital is increasing, with 264 beds occupied in the past 24 hours in various Covid-19 hospitals in the city.The number of patients put on ventilator also went up, with 14 more ventilator beds having been occupied on Sunday, shows the Delhi government’s data.“In our hospital, at least the beds are in great demand; and if some patient needs it (a bed) urgently, then it might not be possible to get it,” said Dr Neeraj Jain, head, department of respiratory medicine, Ganga Ram Hospital. On Friday, 6,126 beds and 774 ventilators were occupied as compared to 6,000 beds and 765 ventilators occupied on Thursday. On Saturday, a total of 6,195 Covid beds and 783 ventilator beds were occupied. According to the government data cited above, the counts on Sunday stood at 6,459 and 797, respectively.HT has reported that the Delhi government plans to add about 5,000 more dedicated beds to be able to handle up to 12,000 daily cases of Covid-19.For four days in a row till Friday, new Covid-19 cases in Delhi set single-day records, with a rising positivity rate indicating that the Capital is possibly entering the third and worst wave yet of the outbreak. On Saturday, Delhi reported 5,062 new Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate jumped to 11.42%.Doctors fear the situation is only going to get worse in coming weeks, with the demand of hospital beds likely to increase.“It is that time of the year when we anyway start seeing an increased patient load of other respiratory illnesses such as aggravated asthma, secondary bacterial lung infections etc. because of the drop in temperature and air pollution, and this year there is also Covid to deal with,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, pulmonary medicine department, Apollo Hospital.However, the silver lining being that India is losing fewer patients to the viral disease, with country’s Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR), the proportion of people who die of a disease among total number of patients diagnosed with the disease, having dropped below 1.5%. The death rate is on a decline, shows central government data.“We are managing serious cases in a far better way now that we know what therapies work. Steroids, and anticoagulants (blood thinners), for example, work really well. Not all serious patients need to be put on a ventilator as was being done earlier but oxygen therapy given in a proper way is good enough,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head, pulmonary medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/as-cases-rise-covid-hospitalisations-increase-in-delhi-govt-data/story-gABl9L6V29T8bcbXYlTYaI.html
01-11-2020||Chandigarh||J&K govt annuls Roshni Act, to retrieve land within six months||The Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to annul all land dealing under the Roshni Act, three weeks after the Jammu and Kashmir high court declared it unconstitutional and unsustainable. The principal secretary, revenue, was on Saturday asked to retrieve all such land and remove encroachments within six months. The Jammu and Kashmir State Lands (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act was enacted in 2001 with the twin objective of generating resources for financing power projects and conferment of proprietary rights to the occupants of the state land. The scheme initially envisaged conferment of proprietary rights of about 20.55 lakh kanals to the occupants of which only 15.85% land was approved for vesting of ownership rights. Against the anticipated revenue from such occupants, the revenue actually generated was meagre. Besides, there were allegations of the legislation being misused by influential persons, leading to its being challenged before the high court. PLAN TO RETRIEVE LARGE TRACTS OF STATE LAND “It is hereby ordered that the principal secretary to government, revenue department, shall pass an order declaring all actions taken under the Jammu and Kashmir State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001, as amended from time to time, and rules made there under as void ab-initio,” stated an order issued by the Jammu and Kashmir department of law, justice and parliamentary affairs, with the lieutenant governor’s approval. “The principal secretary, revenue, shall work out a plan to retrieve large tracts of state land in a time-bound manner and work out modalities to evict encroachers from such state land within six months besides planning the handling of money received for these lands after annulment,” an official spokesman said in the statement. DETAILS OF ENCROACHERS TO BE ON OFFICIAL WEBSITE The spokesman said that the principal secretary, revenue, shall ensure information regarding district-wise state land as on January 1, 2001, are compiled and posted on the official website and the NIC website with details of the state land that was in illegal and unauthorised occupation of person(s)/entities with full identity of encroachers and particulars of the land. He said that complete identities of all influential persons, including ministers, legislators, bureaucrats, government officials, police officers, businessmen, their relatives or persons holding benami for them, who have derived benefit under the Roshni Act, 2001, or Roshni Rules, 2007, will be revealed. “The action shall be completed within a month,” the spokesman said, adding that the divisional commissioners of Jammu and Kashmir shall place on record before the high court district-wise details of the encroached state land not covered by the Roshni Act, rules, scheme which continues to be under illegal occupation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-govt-annuls-roshni-act-to-retrieve-land-within-six-months/story-9MANx6bWfX2IdBuZ2IcRGP.html
01-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi wakes up to chilly morning, temperature dips to 11.4°C||It was a chilly morning in Delhi on Sunday with the minimum temperature dropping to 11.4 degrees Celsius, five degrees below normal. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that there will be fog and mist in the morning which will clear later in the day.On Saturday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory -- considered the official reading for the city -- was 30.8 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was 13 degrees Celsius, three degrees below the season’s normal.This October was the coldest in 58 years. “As we move into November we can expect a further fall in night temperatures,” Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, said. Meanwhile, Delhi’s air quality remained in the “very poor category” with an AQI (Air quality index) of 367, according to the data recorded by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at 7 am. This is the same as the average 24-hour AQI on Saturday. Scientists said air quality is unlikely to improve on Sunday.On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI between 301 and 400 is considered very poor and could have serious health impacts, especially on those working outdoors and children.According to the air quality early warning system under the ministry of earth sciences, the air quality will continue to be in the “very poor” category on November 1 and 2. “The unusual increase in fire counts is observed over Punjab (approx 4,266 fire counts) yesterday (October 30), which is highest of this season and impacted the air quality over Delhi/NCR. Higher wind speed and better ventilation index are favourable for improvement in air quality,” it said on Saturday.Farm fires contributed to 32% of PM 2.5 (particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 micrometres) load in Delhi on Saturday. Ambala, Baghpat, Bahadurgarh, Bhiwadi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurugram and other places in northwest India also recorded very poor air quality on Sunday morning.IMD scientists said while the average wind speed during Saturday touched 18kmph, it did not clean up the air as expected.On Friday and Saturday, the number of crop stubble burning incidents spotted in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana was the highest this season so far, which could have contributed to the air continuing to remain critical.“As per IMD’s satellite monitoring on Friday, in Punjab alone, there were 4,266 farm fire spots, while in Haryana there were 155 farm fires. On Saturday, too, the number of red dots, denoting fires, were over 3,000. Even though we had good wind speed and better ventilation index, the direction of the wind was from north-west, which brought with it smoke from the fires,” VK Soni, head of IMD’s Environment Monitoring Research Centre, said.He said the wind speed is expected to remain high on Sunday, which will keep the AQI levels in the upper ends of the “very poor” zone..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-wakes-up-to-chilly-morning-temperature-dips-to-11-7-c/story-gIHUim2aPq2GXnugL20ZTP.html
01-11-2020||Ranchi||Sedition case filed against Jharkhand BJP chief for trying to ‘destabilise’ state govt||A sedition case was registered in bypoll-bound Dumka against Jharkhand BJP chief and Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash on Saturday for allegedly trying to destabilise the JMM-Congress-RJD government in the state, police said. The BJP leader had on Friday said in a press conference that the saffron party will form the government in the state in the next two-three months.Prakash, on the other hand, dared the state government to arrest him within 24 hours. Based on a complaint lodged by Congress’s Dumka district chief Shyamal Kishore Singh, a case under Sections 124A (punishment for sedition), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) was registered with Dumka police station against Prakash for allegedly trying to destabilise the Jharkhand government, SP Amber Lakra said.The statements of all persons concerned will be recorded and a thorough investigation will be conducted. The future course of action will depend on the probe, he said. “I am prepared to get arrested. If the Hemant Soren government has guts, it must arrest me within 24 hours,” Prakash told PTI.He said the state government is taking “provocative illegal action” as it’s frustrated sensing its imminent defeat in the November 3 byelections to Dumka and Bermo seats. “The FIR lodged by the Congress and the JMM shows they don’t have faith in the Election Commission. If they had any complaint against my press conference, they should have gone to the commission. Instead, they used police power to influence the byelections,” the BJP leader said.JMM general secretary and chief spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya said, “We have ousted the BJP from power in Jharkhand and its rule in Bihar will also end soon.” “We will not let the BJP murder democracy and destabilise an elected government,” he added. Bhattacharya had also gone to the police station with Congress leaders to ensure that the FIR was registered against Prakash.In Hemant Soren’s home turf Dumka, his younger brother Basant Soren is pitted against former cabinet minister Lois Marandi of the BJP. It is expected to be a straight fight between BJP’s Yogeshwar Mahato and Anup Singh of the Congress in Bermo seat in Bokaro district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/sedition-case-filed-against-jharkhand-bjp-chief-for-trying-to-destabilise-state-govt/story-wqqLS1lQMvQor8khX0ReZI.html
01-11-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal govt writes to railways for resuming suburban train services||The West Bengal government has written to the Eastern Railway (ER) seeking discussions for plying of a few pairs of suburban trains daily observing the Covid-19 regulations.“GOWB is concerned to see the use of unquiet means to disperse passengers in need at railway platforms and has written a letter to railway authorities for discussions towards plying of a few pairs of trains..,” the state home department said in a tweet.“In the morning and afternoon hours for general commuters at large on observance of physical distancing norms and public health protocol,” it said in a series of tweets and shared the letter written by Home Secretary H K Dwivedi to the ER general manager.A letter by the government to the Eastern Railway general manager Suneet Sharma read, “Government of West Bengal has all along been keen to maintain/resume normal transportation services for all sections of the society. As you are kindly aware, our skylines are open for national and international flights, our assistance has been rendered for movement of special trains in, from and to the state. Our buses are giving robust public services to commuters at large.“In the meantime, you have since resumed suburban train services. It is painful to notice that you are running these trains for your staffs only, while many other sections of governmental service providers and members of the society at large are denied these services,” the letter said. Noting that the state government has helped the railway authorities to run metro trains peacefully and efficiently, the home secretary urged the Eastern Railways to run a few pair of suburban trains daily.“Indeed, rather than taking resort (resorting) to unquiet means, we could and discuss how a few pairs of trains could be run locally in the morning and in the afternoon hours to serve the general commuters at large,” read the letter written by Additional Chief Secretary H K Dwivedi. The decision to write to Eastern Railways came in the backdrop of violence at Howrah station after the railway police chased away some commuters as they tried to break open the locked gate of the Howrah-Burdwan Staff Special Train at the station on Saturday.A spokesman of Eastern Railway said some of the commuters boarded the train which was meant for railway employees during the Covid-19 time as regular train services are yet to resume. However, as these commuters were forced to disembark by the railway police, they regrouped and tried to break open the gates to board the compartments again, he said.The commuters, numbering around hundred, were then chased away by a joint team of the Government Railway Police and Railway Protection Force from the platform, the spokesman said. The commuters, however, alleged the railway police resorted to unprovoked lathi charge on them and herded them away from the station platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-govt-writes-to-railways-for-resuming-suburban-train-services/story-ONcxZKQ8mzAwsyzHz8FUIP.html
01-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi plans infra for up to 12,000 Covid-19 cases in a day||The Delhi government plans to add about 5,000 more dedicated beds to be able to handle up to 12,000 daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), documents prepared to augment the health care infrastructure show amid an alarming surge in infections in the national Capital.For four days in a row till Friday, new Covid-19 cases in Delhi set single-day records, with a rising positivity rate indicating that the Capital is possibly entering the third and worst wave yet of the outbreak. On Saturday, Delhi reported 5,062 new Covid-19 cases and the positivity rate jumped to 11.42%.Also Read: Centre plans to brief diplomatic corps on efforts to develop Covid-19 vaccinesThe plan to ramp up the number of beds to 20,604 by adding 4,891 additional beds in about two weeks has been prepared by the Delhi government’s health and family welfare department on the basis of projections made by an expert panel headed by Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul. The Delhi government’s document, seen by HT, said that the panel projected the “worst-case scenario” in which the number of daily Covid-19 cases in Delhi could hit about 12,000 by the last week of November. The surge has primarily been projected on the basis of increased activity during the festival season.  Amid the worrying surge in cases in Delhi and the onset of the winter season, the Union home ministry has called a special review meeting with Delhi government officials on Monday to check the spiralling of infections, people familiar with the matter told HT on Friday. With 5,891 new cases on Friday, Delhi set a new record for the highest single-day new infections for the fourth day in a row. On Saturday, the total number of cases in the Capital stood at 386,706.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, however, ruled out the possibility of imposing new restrictions or a lockdown in the city to control the Covid-19 outbreak. “The virus is at the community transmission stage. When a city is in the community transmission stage, it is impossible to wipe out the spread of infection with any form of lockdown. Also, it will probably take 2-3 months more for the Covid-19 vaccine to arrive here. So, till then, mask is the only vaccine and the Delhi government is conducting an intensive awareness campaign on this. Enforcement agencies have also been asked to intensify the crackdown against violators of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” Jain said. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “The planned escalation includes 1,558 additional beds in Delhi government hospitals, 1,092 additional beds in central government hospitals and 2,241 additional beds in private hospitals. The anticipated enhancement of beds in the private hospitals would be subject to the outcome of pending litigation in the Delhi high court as well as on need basis,” said the document, which has been presented to Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) chairperson, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, and vice-chairperson and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal apart from the expert committee led by Dr Paul.The Delhi health minister said that as of Saturday, the Capital had over 9,400 Covid-19 beds vacant, including 445 intensive care unit (ICU) beds with ventilators and 691 ICU beds without ventilators. When asked about the need for more ICU beds, especially those with ventilators or oxygen support, an official said that these will get a boost in the coming days as the central government has sanctioned setting up of PSA oxygen concentrators in eight Delhi government hospitals. “And this is just the first phase, more will be installed later. This will be a big boost for infrastructure set-up of oxygen facilities in Delhi. In the last DDMA meeting held on October 23, Dr Paul had suggested enhancing the efforts for quarantining contacts till they are confirmed negative for Covid-19. He also advised to further increase the number of contacts traced per positive case. Districts have been asked to enquire with each positive case if they had recently engaged in any group activity and if so, they must be tracked, tested and quarantined until tested negative,” the senior official from the health department said on condition of anonymity.While the government’s response to an RTI showed that till September 30, it tracked only around two contacts per Covid-19 case in the city, the same was taken up to 13 per case during the month of October, the health official added.“Special emphasis continues to be given to the home isolation strategy and only four deaths in the last 3.5 months among home isolation cases have taken place. Moreover, the number of deaths within 72 hours of hospitalisation has also been reduced from 57.37% in June to 26.5% in October… The percentage of active cases within containment zones has increased from 15-20% earlier to 35% now,” read a document compiled by the DDMA on October 29.Dr T Jacob John, retired professor of clinical virology at the Christian Medical College, Vellore, said Delhi faces the additional load of people moving in and out of the city on a daily basis. “Delhi is a mixed pot. It has 20 million people living within the city, which is equivalent to a country and on top of that there are several lakhs of people from other cities who commute through the Capital every day. So, it is natural that Delhi will continue to face the brunt of multiple waves of Covid-19 cases. But, this nature of the city also makes it equally impossible for the city to bring back the restrictions that were once in place... It also appears that the virus has now become more infectious, but at the same time it also appears that its severity has somewhat reduced resulting in a lower mortality rate...,” said John.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-plans-infra-for-up-to-12-000-covid-19-cases-in-a-day/story-t9MoMKA7SeXAc0NiiUbZxK.html
01-11-2020||Chandigarh||No MBBS classes at Mohali medical college this year too as regulator denies approval||MBBS classes at the Dr BR Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences, Mohali, will not start this year as well with the National Medical Commission (erstwhile Medical Council of India) denying the permission to the college for the same, citing certain shortcomings. This is the second consecutive year when the medical education regulatory body rejected the nod for starting the classes despite the state government’s tall claims. An official said the commission has raised objections over incomplete construction work and tardy process of hiring the teaching and non-teaching staff. “October 15 was the deadline for getting the permission to start the classes for this session. But the commission had some objections even as we have started hiring of teaching and non-teaching staff besides meeting other infrastructure-related requirements,” said Punjab medical education minister OP Soni “We will make renewed efforts to get the classes start in the next academic year,” he claimed. In March this year, the government had constituted a board for the college with an aim to start the classes from this session. Earlier, the medical education department had planned to start the classes from August this year but that was delayed as it failed to complete all formalities due to Covid-19, an official said. The Rs 300-crore project was sanctioned in 2012 during the previous Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) government under the Central-state partnership with funding in the ratio of 60:40. The Punjab government had finalised the site of the existing civil hospital in Phase 6, Mohali, to set up the institute which will start with 100 MBBS seats and will be eventually upgraded to 220 seats. The state government had also announced funding of Rs 157 crore for the construction of the college in its 2020-21 financial budget. Last year as well, the state government made several efforts to start the college with 100 seats but shortcomings were pointed out by the then MCI during an inspection. This will be the fourth government-run medical college in Punjab with the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot, being the last that was set up in 1973.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-mbbs-classes-at-mohali-medical-college-this-year-too-as-regulator-denies-approval/story-1LbT9Jq2Teo0CvjJtQE25L.html
01-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi records traffic surge from pre-lockdown levels||The streets of the national capital are experiencing about 10% heavier vehicular traffic compared to the levels recorded before the lockdown necessitated by Covid-19 pandemic in March, according to traffic estimates, with experts suggesting that curtailed public transport and fear of infections could largely to be the reasons behind the surge.Records of the Delhi traffic police’s control room show that compared to Delhi’s peak hour vehicular volume in the month of March — before the Centre clamped a nationwide lockdown to control the rising cases of Covid-19 — there has been a nearly 10% increase in overall traffic in September and October. This development comes even as visits to markets and recreational hubs are lower compared to last year’s festival season, according to data from Google’s community mobility trends.  Another senior traffic police official said on condition of anonymity that the estimate incr-ease of 10% was calculated from the traffic volume recorded at major roads of the Capital. “We take some 50 busiest roads from across the city and assess the average volume there. It is an estimate,” he added. Another traffic official said: “One of the primary reasons behind this surge in traffic is that even though the public transport modes such as the Delhi Metro have resumed operations, many former users who have their private vehicles still prefer to use them. With the number of cases still on the rise, private vehicles seem to be a more reliable option for commuters who have that option.”At the ITO intersection, which is considered one of the busiest stretches in the city, the peak hour vehicular volume in the month of March was 350,000 a day. In September, however, with several offices in the area calling back employees after stay-at-home measures due to the pandemic, the traffic volume shot up to 600,000 a day during peak hours.The vehicular volume estimates are recorded by the control room in the first week of every month to determine the number of vehicles crossing an area during the rush hours (8am-11am and 5pm-8pm).At south Delhi’s Rao Tula Ram Marg signal, the traffic volume increased from 60,000-80,000 in the month of March to around 100,000 in September. An upward trend in vehicular traffic has also been observed in arterial roads such as the Rajouri Garden main signal, where the traffic volume has gone up from 125,000 before the lockdown to 220,000 in September. In another busy west Delhi area, Uttam Nagar main crossing (near the bus depot), traffic movement has gone up from 110,000 to 185,000 during peak rush hour. The official quoted above said that while the estimates for October were yet to be analysed completely, the department observed that the traffic around markets and shopping centres has reduced in comparison to the festival season from previous years. Google’s community mobility data shows a similar trend. The tool tracks the number and length of visits people make to certain kinds of places compared to a baseline. According to this data, in October, there was a reduction in traffic volume around retail and recreational hubs, parks and workplaces. However, there has been a spike of 3-10% in the vehicular movement around residential areas, supermarkets and pharmacies. There has also been a reduction of nearly 15% in traffic around public transport pick-up points. Experts said that this could be indicative of low footfalls for modes of public transport. A survey released by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in May showed that the use of private vehicles was expected to increase and the ridership of Delhi Metro and public buses would reduce in the coming months. “The government will be facing the challenge of restoring commuters’ faith in public transport modes. Even after the Metro is opened for people, a person who owns a car will prefer travelling in the safe confines of their own vehicle, instead of travelling in the Metro with hundreds of people where the chances of catching the coronavirus infection is more,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), CSE.Some experts also feel that in the months immediately after the reopening of schools, and with more offices calling employees back to work, there could be another spike in traffic volume. “People are slowly getting back to their normal lives but they are also wary of crowds, if they have the means. The number of cases is still on the rise and we do not know when we will see a reduction in the number of cases. But once schools and other institutions are also opened, we will surely see a surge in traffic jams,” said Madhusudhan Krishnamoorthy, transportation and road safety expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-records-traffic-surge-from-pre-lockdown-levels/story-7cYuH46IyWVJHQOwRDfzIK.html
01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana: 1 dead, 3 injured in clash over liquor in poll-bound Baroda||A 34-year-old liquor contractor was killed with sharp- edged weapons as dispute over distribution of booze between two groups turned ugly at Rabda village falling under Sonepat’s Baroda constituency on Saturday. Members of a group also opened fire at rivals resulting in injuries to three persons of the same village, said police.The Baroda bypoll is scheduled for November 3. The deceased has been identified as Rashiya. Sandeep Kumar, Umesh and Aman, who received bullet injuries, are undergoing treatment at the Post-graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak. Their condition is stated to be critical. Azad Kumar, an eyewitness, said trouble started when Rashiya’s brother exchanged heated words with Sandeep’s cousin Bharu over distribution of liquor. “Baljeet asked Bharu not to distribute liquor to woo voters. Around 8.30 pm, a group of 10 to 12 persons, led by Rashiya, came in a car and two bikes and fired shots at Sandeep, Aman and Umesh. The trio retaliated, and in the violent scuffle, Rashiya was killed,” he added.A villager, pleading anonymity, said the deceased had come out of jail recently and the injured persons are supporters of a political party. Sonepat SP Jashandeep Randawa, however, said: “This seems to be a fallout of rivalry between two groups. All angles will be probed.” As tension prevailed in village, heavy police force was deployed to thwart any law and order problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-1-dead-3-injured-in-clash-over-liquor-in-poll-bound-baroda/story-ONmMifl9FGSnjrSh78oVHJ.html

01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Elect my candidate, this govt will fall: OP Chautala||Former Haryana chief minister and Indian National Lok Dal supremo Om Prakash Chautala on Saturday said that the BJP-JJP government will fall if his party, Indian National Lok Dal, wins the Baroda bypoll.Addressing a rally at Baroda village, Chautala also promised ₹5,400 old-age pension when his party is in power. He said the constituency has 54 villages and Haryana will complete its 54 years of formation on November 1. “I promise old-age pension of ₹5,400 per month when my party is voted to power. I will fight against the BJP and Congress till my last breath. If you elect my candidate, the BJP-JJP government will fall,” he said.Bhim Army chief extends support to INLDChautala was accompanied by Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who also addressed the rally in support of INLD candidate Joginder Singh Malik. Azad said the BJP government was determined to destroy the poor and farming community.“Chhotu Ram had said that we would have to stand by our community. You all belong to the farming community and you should sow a good seed (Abhay Singh) in politics. Abhay is the only leader who can improve the condition of the state after becoming the chief minister. The Congress had also created hurdles for former Prime Minister Charan Singh,” he said.INLD general secretary Abhay Singh Chautala slammed both the BJP and the Congress. “The Union government brought three laws to destroy farmers. The then United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had also brought anti-farmer bills but they failed to pass them as their alliance partners opposed them. Deepender Hooda had also supported the laws introduced by the UPA government in 2012 and, now, he is opposing these laws. Then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi had also opposed the bills which were tabled by the UPA and, now, when he is the Prime Minister, he brought these bills to destroy the farming community,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/elect-my-candidate-this-govt-will-fall-op-chautala/story-pFVovafstOQIl636oOAjEN.html

My native village falls under the Meham constituency which is adjacent to the Baroda constituency. If you elect our candidate, I will bring more developmental projects to the constituency,” he said.Dushyant said Hooda claimed that no one could snatch the steering wheel from him. “I want to tell Hooda sahib that the Congress has given steering wheel to Randeep Singh Surjewala. He (Hooda) and his son have no respect in the Congress,” Dushyant said, adding that during Hooda’s government farmers were given ₹2-3 cheques for crop loss.Reacting sharply to the allegations, Hooda said chief minister and others on his side are obsessed with attacking him. “The CM and his ministers do not have any work to show and no plan to share. The ruling party is trying to get votes by talking about non-issues and making personal comments against me. The people of Baroda have made up their mind to defeat the BJP-JJP by a huge margin,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khattar-targets-hooda-at-baroda-rallies/story-nCyNcNvGH2Al2uRdVxuiMP.html
01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Dust, garbage burning adding most to poor air quality in Yamunanagar||As the pollution level rises in the region, stubble burning appears not to be the only reason behind the toxic air in Yamunanagar. The city has recorded fewer active fire locations (AFLs), 355, as on Wednesday, compared to 872 of Karnal and 756 of Kurukshetra, but its Air Quality Index (AQI) oscillated between “poor” and “very poor” this week. Experts feel that dust is major contributor to the air pollution in Yamunanagar. Regional officer of the Haryana Pollution Control Board Nirmal Kashyap said dust due to poor condition of roads polluted the air to such levels. “Our AQI measuring device is at the busiest intersection near Gobind Pura and we have observed that factors other than stubble burning are behind the poor air quality,” he said.Shyam Lal Dhiman, who owns a furniture outlet near Kamani Chowk, said a few days ago he saw a fire engine sprinkling water along the road. “But, was it a one-time activity? The dust is a permanent feature, but no one cares,” he said.A tea seller near the Woman Police Station on the Workshop Road said only one side of the road was carpeted outside his shop.Presence of industrial units across the Jagadhri-Yamunanagar twin towns associated with popular businesses such as plywood, mica, aluminium, utensils etc. also emit pollutants in the atmosphere. Kashyap said owners of the industrial units don’t follow guidelines. Nirmal Chauhan, a councillor of the municipal corporation, held the civic body responsible. She said the garbage burning was going on unabated in many areas. “Garbage is on fire for days at a site which is not even a designated dumping ground and the civic body doesn’t care,” Chauhan said. MC commissioner Dharamveer Singh said the corporation sprinkles water in areas prone to dust problem and the garbage fire was doused when brought to the notice of the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dust-garbage-burning-adding-most-to-poor-air-quality-in-yamunanagar/story-9HBIpzkurA0OHLJyHZafAI.html

01-11-2020||Mumbai||Radio school catches up in Thane Zilla Parishad||With online learning being inaccessible to most tribal students or those from distant villages, the Thane Zilla Parishad (ZP) has begun imparting education through radios.The ZP and an NGO, Pratham, started the ‘School outside the School’ initiative in several tribal padas in Thane district since two weeks.Here, the students are taught through radio channels while lessons are also recorded on mobile application that could be accessed by students whenever they get access to the phone.Many students from the interiors of Thane district are devoid of online education as they do not own a smartphone or have merely one phone among many siblings.At present, the ZP teachers guide the students whenever they visit the village, but they cannot reach every student.Education through radio started in tribal hamlets of Bhiwandi and Murbad two weeks ago and will soon be implemented in Shahpur.Smitin Brid, 40, founder of this programme, said, “We first send a message of various concepts to the volunteers who read it out to the students or note it on a common village blackboard. The next day, the concept is explained to the students and their parents through an hour-long radio programme broadcast from Nagpur’s All India Radio centre. The programme is either broadcast through loudspeakers or at a common meeting place in the village.”He added that they also answer two calls per session wherein the students are given an activity or a problem to solve while the speaker guides their parents on how they can help.Brid added, “We give them simple ideas closer to their day-to-day life like how a mother can draw animals in the grains to teach art to the students or how an electrician father can teach his child to change light bulbs and the concept behind it.”The parents are also asked to record how their child narrates a chapter or recites tables.Hemlata Sasane Thane, a volunteer helping ZP in this project, said, “We have received several messages in which we have broadcast the best ones on the show. This project will involve parents, villagers and social workers who also get trained automatically in how to teach children when there is no teacher. Also, we have started recording these sessions and uploading them on YouTube so that our social workers can later show it to the tribal students.”Sheshrav Bade, education officer of Zilla Parishad, added, “We have gathered a huge team for this project. The team comprises every area’s education officer, every Taluka officer, every Gramvikas department officer, Sarpanch, social worker, anganwadi workers as well as two volunteers from every village who have a phone. We have received good responses from the Sarpanch of Gram Panchayat. An SMS on the concepts is shared to the Sarpanch or volunteers and it reaches the children. In some villages, black wall is painted and on it, the education message is written and then children note down the information.”Bade said that the volunteers ensure that every hamlet has a phone though which they can tune into the programme and children can gather at one place. “Some Sarpanch of the villages have suggested that the programme could be broadcast through loudspeakers in the village shrines. In the places that have power issues, we ensure we use our social workers who have Android phones and the recorded sessions could be watched on YouTube,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/radio-school-catches-up-in-thane-zilla-parishad/story-CXoffw3JG5lu6JPkjaQYqK.html
01-11-2020||Mumbai||Free WiFi in two villages of Thane district ensure uninterrupted online classes||Two villages in Thane district have provided free WiFi to students and made arrangements for them to access it so that they do not miss online classes during the lockdown. The initiative was taken as most children in the villages did not have a good internet connection to attend classes.The common router is installed in Vehlonde and Dalkhan villages in Shahpur Taluka, Thane district.Jithesh Vishe, deputy Sarpanch, Vehlonde village, said, “We had set up WiFi, CCTV and speakers across the village in 2014 itself. During the pandemic, we made use of the speakers to make announcements. The CCTV cameras were helpful to know if social distancing was followed and the WiFi was a boon for the students to continue their studies. Most of our villages come under forest land and hence we have more of tribal population. Not everyone has the privilege of smartphones. Hence, we make use of the digitalised classroom where a few children from tribal villages come together to take notes.”Vehlonde village, which does not have a single Covid case, is situated near Tansa river, around 45km from Kalyan.In Dalkhan village, situated more than 60km from Kalyan, WiFi routers have been arranged in various parts so that the children could study from their homes and maintain social distancing during the lockdown.“There are some areas where a handful of students come together to study and help each other if they have doubts or need any help during the online classes. Some families do not have smartphones. They share with others of their same age, thus indulging in group study,” said Bhagwan Mokashi, Sarpanch (additional charge), Dalkhan Village.“Our teacher lives in a different village and it is not possible for her to travel all the way during the lockdown. So, she comes online at a stipulated time. We all gather around the phone, put it on speaker and follow her instructions daily. Initially, we had certain connectivity issues but since the WiFi has been set up, we can attend classes regularly and from our homes itself,” said Atharva Munde, a Class 4 student at Zilla Parishad School, Thane.Dr Rupali Satpute, chief executive officer (additional charge), Thane Zilla Parishad, said, “Within Thane district, there are various such initiatives taken by the village Panchayat to provide better facilities. We appreciate such efforts and also use it as a motivation for others to follow suit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/free-wifi-in-two-villages-of-thane-district-ensure-uninterrupted-online-classes/story-WfZK2F06U0yncXOp56ITTK.html
01-11-2020||Mumbai||3 men armed with gun rob auto driver in Navi Mumbai, 1 nabbed||A 30-year-old man and his two accomplices, one of whom was armed with a pistol, allegedly barged into an auto rickshaw driver’s home and robbed him of cash and valuables early on Friday. The Rabale police have arrested the accused while two others are at large.The complainant, Sanjay Singh, 25, was alone at his Ghansoli apartment in Sector 16 when at around 2 am on Friday, he heard a knock at his door. When Singh opened, a man was pointing a gun at Singh’s chest. Threatening to kill him if he raised an alarm, the gun-wielding man entered the apartment.Singh told police that he then noticed the armed man was accompanied by Sagar Dhone, who is known to him. Singh had lent ₹15,000 to Dhone two years ago which the latter had not returned.Dhone threatened Singh that if he went to the police station to complain, he would throw him off the terrace of the four-storeyed building. The duo was joined by another accused soon after which Dhone allegedly stole ₹20,000 from Singh’s cupboard.The men also bundled a computer, a phone and a few other belongings in a bedsheet and left after locking Singh in the room.Singh sought his neighbour’s help to unlock the door. He then approached the Rabale police, where a case of armed robbery was registered against the trio including Dhone.“After registering the case, we nabbed Dhone from Airoli the same day. He has at least 10 previous criminal records against him including cases of attempt-to-murder and assault. He has been remanded in the police custody for four days,” said Ankush Chintaman, assistant inspector at Rabale police station.Police said Dhone has cases in both Navi Mumbai and Mumbai. While officials have not recovered the weapon, they are on the lookout for his accomplices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-men-armed-with-gun-rob-auto-driver-in-navi-mumbai-1-nabbed/story-oWSdZGz2z6jdon0KRYJNwI.html

01-11-2020||Gurugram||Hospital rape: No conclusive evidence in case against staffer, cops plan to quash FIR||Police on Saturday said they were planning to initiate the process of quashing the first information report (FIR) against an outsourced staffer of Fortis Hospital booked for allegedly raping a 21-year-old tuberculosis patient in the intensive care unit. A one-page statement of the woman was recorded in the hospital on Saturday and she contradicted the details of her complaint before her legal counsel, the board of doctors and her father, police said. The patient was taken off ventilator support on late Friday evening. Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police (headquarters), who was appointed nodal officer for the case on Saturday morning, said the victim first raised fingers at the hospital’s outsourced staff and on Saturday said she was raped by the X-Ray team. “She stated that a woman and two men had taken her for an X-Ray in the basement and told her that she was pregnant and she thought she was raped but her X-Ray was conducted through a portable machine inside the ICU in the presence of woman staff. The teams were questioned and they said they had asked her if she was pregnant before the X-Ray and had used a technical term ‘intubate’ which she presumed was intimate. Also, the team had mentioned another word ‘exposure’ which she mistook as expose. Her allegations were found to be incorrect and she gave contradictory statements and said that she is not sure if she was sexually assaulted,” she said. Kundu said they found no truth in any of her allegations written in a three-page note handed over to them by her father on Tuesday, following which the case was registered. The victim changed her statement and said she did not remember anything clearly, police said. “The victim through a handwritten note had conveyed to her father that she was raped and she was pregnant. But the dates mentioned in the complaint and written by the victim did not match with her admission in the hospital. She had also stated that no food was provided to her for two days whereas she was continuously on ventilator support and glucose drips and was facing severe breathing issues. Her medical examination was conducted by a board of doctors and she was not found to be pregnant,” said Kundu. The victim will be given psychological therapy on Sunday and regular counselling sessions have been scheduled for her, said police. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said they have monitored the entire CCTV footage of more than 10 cameras on both the floors between October 21 and 27 but they did not find any foul play nor was the footage tampered. “We are further investigating the matter. There is no other evidence against the suspect named in the FIR nor his movements were located near the ICU. The FIR will be quashed against him once all the statements are recorded and the FSL report is submitted,” he said. The case is also being supervised by the Haryana State Commission for Women (HSCW) which took suo motu cognisance of the incident on Thursday and constituted an inquiry committee. Preeti Bhardwaj, vice-chairperson of HSCW, said they have requested a judicial magistrate to record the victim’s statement in the hospital. “We have requested the hospital management not to charge her during this period as the family and victim have undergone mental trauma. Being a tuberculosis patient she will need to undergo treatment for at least 12 months and we have requested the hospital to treat her for free. We are providing a psychological counsellor for the victim and she will be given therapies to recover from the trauma. The victim mistook technical terms and presumed that the staff was threatening her. I am satisfied with the civil hospital doctors’ report and the investigation conducted by the Gurugram police,” she said, adding that they have sought a detailed report of the case from police and the hospital before they quash the FIR. The management of the hospital said in a statement: “The patient came to the hospital in an extremely critical condition and we are glad to inform that with continuous efforts of our medical team, the patient is consistently improving, and she is stable now. Post today’s development, we understand that police has issued an update on this case. We continue to support the authorities to conclude the investigation. With 58% female staff, women’s dignity and safety is our utmost priority and we have acted in accordance with this ethos from the very start. We have full faith in our system and know that truth and justice will prevail.” On Thursday, the chief medical officer (CMO) of Gurugram Civil Hospital told Gurugram Police that a sexual assault could not be ruled out. The CMO did not comment on the matter on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hospital-rape-no-conclusive-evidence-in-case-against-staffer-cops-plan-to-quash-fir/story-ICu0tm9HUcLAJZrX0tphjL.html
01-11-2020||City||Gurugram reports highest single-day spike; tally close to 30,000 mark||Gurugram: The district on Saturday reported 498 new Covid -19 cases, the highest single-day spike so far. The surge raised total count of persons infected with Sars-CoV-2 virus in Gurugram to nearly 30,000, according to the district health bulletin. District health officials attributed the uptick in Covid-19 cases to the delay in updating the positive cases on the official portal by some private labs. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), said that notices have been served to these labs.With the uptick in new infections, the number of active cases has also surged to 3,522, the highest so far. On Saturday, two deaths were also reported, taking the Covid-19 toll to 212 in the district. The last time when the district had reported the highest single-day spike (421 new cases) was September 16.According to Yadav, action is being taken against the private labs that are showing delay in updating positive cases. “A few private labs are not timely uploading test results of Covid-19 patients on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal. We have served notices to three such labs which are collecting samples from hospitals as well as from homes,” said the CMO. He said that labs have been given two days to submit their response. “Sudden addition of numbers from last week disrupts the entire functioning. It drastically impacts the contact tracing and treating of patients. Overall, it impacts the positivity rate as infection spreads,” said Yadav. Notices have been served to Max Lab ( a unit of Max Hospital), Metropolis Healthcare Limited and MolQ Laboratory. “It was a one-time delay where a few reports were uploaded with a time lag of 24 hours. This is since a few of our data entry operators unfortunately fell ill to Covid-19 recently. The same has been shared as a written reply and conveyed to the authorities concerned,” said Max Lab in its official statement. A representative of the MolQ Laboratory said, “We are not aware of any notice issued by the health department. Once received, we will respond accordingly.” However, Metropolis Healthcare could not be contacted for comment despite several attempts.Since October 21, there has been a resurgence of daily infection, with the district reporting more than 300 positive cases every day. It reached a high of around 400 cases on a few days after October 22 onwards. For the past 10 days, the positivity rate of Gurugram is retained at around 12%, higher than positivity rate recorded in August and September.The health department data shows that there has been almost 30% increase in cases in the past 10 days (October 22-31) compared to the previous 10-day period from October 12 to 21. Experts said that cases will continue to rise due to callous approach of people in adhering to mask discipline and social distancing. Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine and public health, PGIMER-Chandigarh, said, “Unlocking has led to mixing of population. Covid-19 will continue to increase in cities with high density population, and where people are not behaving responsibly.” Covid-19 cases in Gurugram saw the first spike in May and then June. By mid-July, a steady drop in cases was noticed, with active cases reaching a count of 650 by August first week.

After spending days together in quarantine or in hospitals, it becomes difficult for many positive patients to visit such centres immediately after recovery. We are hoping for a better response over time.“The main aim of this centre is the physical and mental well-being of those who have recovered from Covid. As the virus affects the lungs and lowers the immunity, pulmonary physiotherapy to strengthen the lungs along with regular exercises and proper diet help revive one’s body. We have designated doctors for the same. They will guide those visiting the centre. Moreover, many find it difficult to cope up after being in isolation for long periods. We have counsellors who help such individuals as well,” added Murudkar.A helpline number 86573 97952 is also provided for those who need to make any appointment in Thane or for inquiries. On a daily basis, there are 10 to 15 such calls made on the helpline in Thane.Dr Pramod Patil, medical officer and in-charge of Post-Covid Centre, Thane, said, “Most people who visit regularly are for the yoga sessions, the various exercises focus on breathing and building one’s strength. Till now, we have mainly those between the age group of 40 and 60 years. They undergo weakness, complain of body pain, loss of appetite and chest pain.”Meanwhile, Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has also launched its helpline number - 88790 38566. The centre was inaugurated in the beginning of this week and the response is just picking up through word of mouth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/post-covid-care-centre-in-thane-gaining-momentum/story-ciZqEEbprZ0v1RPXd9JAaM.html
01-11-2020||Gurugram||High wind speeds help air quality improve marginally||The air quality in Gurugram remained in the ‘very poor’ category on Saturday, with the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) bulletin recording the air quality index (AQI) at 358. This, however, was a slight improvement from the previous day’s AQI of 367, in the same category. The level of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 — the city’s primary pollutant — was 360.52µg/m³ on Saturday, as per the data recorded at the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. As per the CPCB’s classification, an AQI reading between 301 to 400 is categorised as ‘very poor’ and can lead to breathlessness and respiratory illnesses in cases of prolonged exposure. According to the early air quality warning system for the National Capital Region (NCR), the air quality is likely to remain in the ‘very poor’ category on the weekend. The air quality is expected to improve but remain in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday as well. As per the warning system, an unusual increase in fire counts was observed over Punjab (approximately 4.266 counts) on Friday, which was causing an impact on the air quality. However, a higher wind speed and better ventilation index were favourable towards the improvement in air quality. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional weather forecasting centre, said that air quality was expected to improve further and stay better till Monday due to a higher wind speed. “Due to the same reason, we have seen improvement in the air quality over the past two days. When the wind speed is low, pollutants accumulate in the air due to poor dispersal,” said Srivastava. An average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants.On Saturday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 29.4, a degree below Friday’s 30.5 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was recorded at 12 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature is expected to fall by a degree and stay around 11 degrees Celsius on Sunday, as per the IMD’s forecast. Clear skies will prevail on Sunday, as per the IMD’s weekly forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/high-wind-speeds-help-air-quality-improve-marginally/story-C9L7zf6jipna8fGmtq0IXI.html

The civic body has decided to file FIR against people who are found chopping any tree without permission.Mahendra Konde, public relations officer of Navi Mumbai, said, “Trees maintain the balance of the environment. Hence, along with giving attention on tree plantation, it is necessary to keep a vigil on the trees being chopped as well and thus the corporation has decided to take this step.”In case of any developmental needs, the civic body would assess and give permission for the cutting of trees necessary.“It takes many years for a tree to grow. In the name of trimming, people cut roots and also damage the tree. Till now, we have only been filing a non-cognisable case against people cutting the tree illegally. Even trimming can be done only after our permission. Wherever trimming is required, we would do an assessment and then guide which portion should be trimmed as the growing portion of the tree needs to be protected,” Manoj Mahale, deputy municipal commissioner, NMMC, said.The person found cutting a tree without permission, would be booked under Maharashtra Prevention of Defacement of Property Act.“We would register a FIR when someone approaches us with a complaint by keeping NMMC in the loop,” a police officer from Zone I, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-civic-body-asks-police-to-keep-watch-on-illegal-cutting-of-trees/story-s4WBATHiiOr9KJqiZJRX4H.html

When the staff asked them not to shout they threatened them,” said Dr Gautam. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the family members along with other attendants violated the guidelines issued by both Central and state governments. “They have violated the directions that are required to be followed by the general public while availing the services of hospitals, doctors, female nurses and other staff members,” he said.

DTCP officials said that the notices were issued, along with a challan of Rs 20,000 each, for the violations after an inspection was conducted in the area. “We conducted an inspection in the area, and wherever construction material was lying in the open or pollution was caused due to the construction activities, penalties were imposed. A number of property owners were also issued warning to adhere to the pollution norms,” said RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement wing). The department also cancelled the occupation certificates (OCs) of two houses in Suncity after it was found that building plan violations were carried out after obtaining the certificates. “The violations were found during the inspection, so it was decided to cancel the OC. More houses will be checked for any such violations where OCs were issued,” he said. A team of enforcement officials, led by Bhath, also carried out an inspection of roads under construction in sectors 58 to 62 and found encroachments due to which the construction is facing problems. The inspection followed a decision by the authorities to ensure that all roadblocks to construction of roads are removed in the developing sectors. On Friday, Jitender Yadav, administrator, Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), had said that the authority will pay compensation to landowners and ensure impediments to road construction are removed by November 15. Bhath said that sector-wise inspections will be conducted, and they will make all efforts to remove illegal encroachments on these proposed or existing roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-dtcp-issues-notice-to-five-property-owners-in-dlf-phase-1-for-violation-of-pollution-norms/story-q55UDaDrML2ThSBlrSkzWI.html
01-11-2020||Delhi||700 nursing, paramedic staff of North Delhi Municipal Corporation threaten strike from Monday||At least 700 nursing and paramedical staffers of three hospitals — Kasturba Hospital, Hindu Rao Hospital and Rajan Babu TB Hospital. all run by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation — have threatened to go on an indefinite strike from Monday for non-payment of their salaries for the last 3-4 months.The representatives of nurses and paramedic staff unions at these hospitals have also announced that they will suspend emergency services during the strike. They said that they have already given a number of notices to the north corporation authorities regarding clearance of their pending salaries, which were not heeded, forcing them to go on a strike.Doctors of hospitals under north corporation had launched a similar strike on October 5 to demand clearing of their outstanding salary dues. The strike finally was called off on October 28 after the north corporation cleared the salary of doctors till September 2020 on October 28Nursing and paramedic staff of Kasturba Hospital have already been observing “three-hour pen-down strike” everyday since Thursday to oppose non-payment of their salaries for the last 3-4 months.“We have been working without salaries for three to four months. We have made a number of communications to the civic body regarding payment of our pending salaries, but to no avail. The civic authorities have left us no option but to go on an indefinite strike from Monday,” said BL Sharma, president Nurses Union of Kasturba Hospital .He added that during the strike, all services including registrations and admission of new patients, will be stopped and medicines will also not be distributed.The nursing and paramedic staff at Hindu Rao Hospital and Rajan Babu TB Hospital will also join the protest at the their respective hospitals from Monday.The North Corporation had on Tuesday cleared salaries of paramedic staff of hospitals under its jurisdiction till June 2020, while the wages of nursing staff were paid till July 2020. The doctors, on the other hand, had been paid their salary dues till September this year, which irked the nursing and paramedic staff across north municipality hospitals.Along with nurses, other health workers such as lab technicians, X-ray technicians, ward boys, hospital clerks and fourth class employees will also participate in the strike on Monday.“This implies that it will be a complete shutdown of hospitals. You cannot operate a hospital only with doctors. It is the nursing staff and other health workers who play an important role in keeping any hospital running. The civic body should treat all the staff members equally and shouldn’t be selective. They should clear pending salaries of all employees at the same time,” Sharma added.There are nearly 200 nursing and paramedical employees at Kasturba Hospital. At Hindu Rao Hospital the number of nursing and paramedical staff is around 350, while nearly 180 such employees work at Rajan Babu TB Hospital.“We will stop emergency services as well because it is time that the civic administration clears our pending salaries. Nurses at hospitals across north municipality have not been paid the salaries of August, September and October, while other paramedic employees have not been given their salary since June 2020. Everyone needs money to survive and non-payment of wages has started taking a toll on our lives ,” Indu Jamwal, president Hindu Rao Hospital Nurses Union, said.Jai Prakash, mayor of north corporation said that strike was not the solution to the problem, as employees should also understand that despite an acute financial crisis of the civic body, their salaries were still being given.“I appeal to the workers to not to go on a strike. There is a funds crunch in the corporation, but still we are releasing salaries to various departments one by one. We are making arrangements to pay salaries of the agitating employees as soon as possible. Their salaries of June and July was released on Tuesday. The remaining dues will also be cleared soon,” Prakash said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/700-nursing-paramedic-staff-of-north-corp-threaten-strike-from-monday/story-XOmC8pJSURZYL0aQYbacMM.html
01-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram rape: No conclusive evidence in case against hospital staff, cops plan to quash FIR||Police on Saturday said they were planning to initiate the process of quashing the first information report (FIR) against an outsourced staffer of Fortis Hospital booked for allegedly raping a 21-year-old tuberculosis patient in the intensive care unit. A one-page statement of the woman was recorded in the hospital on Saturday and she contradicted the details of her complaint before her legal counsel, the board of doctors and her father, police said. The patient was taken off ventilator support on late Friday evening. Usha Kundu, assistant commissioner of police (headquarters), who was appointed nodal officer for the case on Saturday morning, said the victim first raised fingers at the hospital’s outsourced staff and on Saturday said she was raped by the X-Ray team. “She stated that a woman and two men had taken her for an X-Ray in the basement and told her that she was pregnant and she thought she was raped but her X-Ray was conducted through a portable machine inside the ICU in the presence of woman staff. The teams were questioned and they said they had asked her if she was pregnant before the X-Ray and had used a technical term ‘intubate’ which she presumed was intimate. Also, the team had mentioned another word ‘exposure’ which she mistook as expose. Her allegations were found to be incorrect and she gave contradictory statements and said that she is not sure if she was sexually assaulted,” she said. Kundu said they found no truth in any of her allegations written in a three-page note handed over to them by her father on Tuesday, following which the case was registered. The victim changed her statement and said she did not remember anything clearly, police said. “The victim through a handwritten note had conveyed to her father that she was raped and she was pregnant. But the dates mentioned in the complaint and written by the victim did not match with her admission in the hospital. She had also stated that no food was provided to her for two days whereas she was continuously on ventilator support and glucose drips and was facing severe breathing issues. Her medical examination was conducted by a board of doctors and she was not found to be pregnant,” said Kundu. The victim will be given psychological therapy on Sunday and regular counselling sessions have been scheduled for her, said police. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said they have monitored the entire CCTV footage of more than 10 cameras on both the floors between October 21 and 27 but they did not find any foul play nor was the footage tampered. “We are further investigating the matter. There is no other evidence against the suspect named in the FIR nor his movements were located near the ICU. The FIR will be quashed against him once all the statements are recorded and the FSL report is submitted,” he said. The case is also being supervised by the Haryana State Commission for Women (HSCW) which took suo motu cognisance of the incident on Thursday and constituted an inquiry committee. Preeti Bhardwaj, vice-chairperson of HSCW, said they have requested a judicial magistrate to record the victim’s statement in the hospital. “We have requested the hospital management not to charge her during this period as the family and victim have undergone mental trauma. Being a tuberculosis patient she will need to undergo treatment for at least 12 months and we have requested the hospital to treat her for free. We are providing a psychological counsellor for the victim and she will be given therapies to recover from the trauma. The victim mistook technical terms and presumed that the staff was threatening her. I am satisfied with the civil hospital doctors’ report and the investigation conducted by the Gurugram police,” she said, adding that they have sought a detailed report of the case from police and the hospital before they quash the FIR. The management of the hospital said in a statement: “The patient came to the hospital in an extremely critical condition and we are glad to inform that with continuous efforts of our medical team, the patient is consistently improving, and she is stable now. Post today’s development, we understand that police has issued an update on this case. We continue to support the authorities to conclude the investigation. With 58% female staff, women’s dignity and safety is our utmost priority and we have acted in accordance with this ethos from the very start. We have full faith in our system and know that truth and justice will prevail.” On Thursday, the chief medical officer (CMO) of Gurugram Civil Hospital told Gurugram Police that a sexual assault could not be ruled out. The CMO did not comment on the matter on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/no-conclusive-evidence-in-case-against-fortis-hospital-staff-cops-plan-to-quash-fir/story-QqYGqlg6EdX3PgaEfxbZRK.html
01-11-2020||Delhi||Section of JNU students announce boycott of online classes, exams||A section of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students on Saturday announced that they will boycott online classes and exams until the administration resumed physical academic activities at the varsity. The move is in continuation of the ongoing students’ demand for the phased-wise return of all hostel residents and resumption of on-campus classes.The university on October 22 had announced that it will only reopen science schools and special centres in a phased manner from November 2 for final-year Ph.D. scholars and project staff, who require laboratory access. The students at the centre for French students at JNU’s School of Language, Literature, and Cultural studies on Saturday wrote to their chairperson saying, “A vast majority of the students are unable to attend online classes and remotely access online resources. Most of them belong to socio-economically marginalised backgrounds. They are being excluded for no fault of theirs. To avoid further academic loss it’s imperative for us to return to the university….we, hereby, collectively decide to boycott all the online classes and evaluation, which is merely a formality with no real learning.”Similarly, students of the centre for informal sector and labour studies at the school of social sciences released a statement demanding resumption of physical classes. “The academic loss has been enormous and we can no longer afford to miss out on classroom discussions, access to academic resources, research and other academic experiences...Hence, we request the phased return of all students along with the complete restoration of our hostel facilities,” the statement read.JNU has been physically closed since March 13 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and all classes since have moved online. While a majority of students have vacated their hostels following the university’s order in March, some had stayed due to the suspension of inter-state travel facilities brought about by the Covid-enforced lockdown. The students have been demanding a phased entry for research scholars on the campus since July. JNU Students’ Union President Aishe Ghosh said that more centres are likely to issue statements about their demands soon. “We want phased return of each and every student back to the campus. The students of all centres are conducting their general body class meetings and coming out with resolutions.”A senior university official said that all students cannot be allowed to return to the campus as of now. “It will take some time to allow students to return to their hostels. We have started with science students and others will also be allowed. But it will take time. Students should refrain from giving calls for boycotting online classes,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/section-of-jnu-students-announce-boycott-of-online-classes-exams/story-ZJv63UpNjFAII1cLCUWgFM.html
01-11-2020||Delhi||Coldest October in 58 years, but numerous farm fires keep Delhi air in ICU||This October was the coldest Delhi has experienced in 58 years, with the mean minimum temperature for the month settling at 17.2 degrees Celsius, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. The last time it was this cold at night in the national capital was in 1962, when the mean minimum temperature for October was 16.9 degrees Celsius, weather experts said.Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature -- the average of daily minimum temperatures through the month --of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, confirmed that this year, minimum temperatures in Delhi have been lower than normal. “The absence of cloud cover is a major reason for such low minimum temperatures. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downwards, warming the ground. Another reason is calm winds, which allow the formation of mist and fog,” Srivastava said. On Saturday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory -- considered the official reading for the city -- was 30.8 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature was 13 degrees Celsius, three degrees below the season’s normalBut despite high wind speed and favourable weather conditions, the national capital’s air quality continued to remain in the ‘very poor’ category on the air quality index (AQI). The AQI, as recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), on Saturday was 367 (very poor). This was only slightly better than the AQI of 374 on Friday, also in ‘very poor’ category. On a scale of 0 to 500, an AQI between 301 and 400 is considered very poor. IMD scientists said while the average wind speed during Saturday had touched 18kmph, it did not clean up the air as expected. VK Soni, head of IMD’s Environment Monitoring Research Centre, said looking at the high wind speed during the day, the forecast was that the AQI would improve and reach the ‘poor’ category (between 201 and 300). On Friday and Saturday, the number of stubble burning incidents spotted in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana was the highest this season so far, which could have contributed to the air continuing to remain critical.“As per IMD’s satellite monitoring on Friday, in Punjab alone there were 4,266 farm fire spots, while in Haryana there were 155 farm fires. On Saturday, too, the number of red dots, denoting fires, were over 3,000. Even though we had good wind speed and better ventilation index, the direction of the wind was from north-west, which brought with it smoke from the fires,” Soni said.He said the wind speed is expected to remain high on Sunday, which will keep the AQI levels in the upper ends of the ‘very poor’ zone. Union ministry’s System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) data showed that 3,471 farm fires were spotted over Punjab and Haryana, which accounted for 32% of Delhi’s PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 micrometres) levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/coldest-october-in-58-years-but-numerous-farm-fires-keep-delhi-air-in-icu/story-DGPewnEayRfm5m0esLTr8L.html
01-11-2020||Delhi||AAP rakes up pension dues of MCD employees, BJP hits back||Senior Aam Aadmi Party leader and MCD in-charge Durgesh Pathak on Saturday said that the BJP-ruled MCD should immediately release pension of 24,000 pensioners and should stop doing politics over this issue. He also said that the condition of the families of pensioners was very bad and they were being forced to take loans and fall back on their savings for survival. Pathak said that these people had also moved court to demand pension and on September 21 the Delhi high court had ordered the immediate release of pension to north corporation. Pathak claimed that despite HC’s order, the BJP-ruled municipal corporations did not release the pensions.“The BJP leaders have become so insensitive that they are only busy diverting the attention from real issues of the MCD and are only concerned about blaming the AAP government. I want to tell the BJP that you have run the MCD for the last 14 years. Now for just one year, handover the MCD to the AAP. I want to ensure that we present a different reality in front of them,” said Pathak. Replying to this, Delhi BJP spokesperson, Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the AAP was shedding “crocodile tears”. “If the AAP cares so much about the MCD pensioners, then it should ask the Kejriwal government to release all the pending funds to the civic bodies,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-rakes-up-pension-dues-of-mcd-employees-bjp-hits-back/story-sMOgi4ce0MncpQ2y6y4eRJ.html
01-11-2020||Delhi||From Sunday, DTC and cluster buses to run at full seating capacity||From Sunday, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses will operate at full seating capacity, but no passenger will be allowed to stand and travel, transport minister Kailash Gahlot said.The move, approved by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, is going to give a much-needed relief to commuters who have been facing a harrowing time with waiting time for buses sometimes going up to two hours and all social distancing norms being flouted at overcrowded stands. State-run buses in Delhi resumed services from May 18 as part of the gradual relaxation the nationwide lockdown imposed from March 25. But the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had restricted bus intake and mandated that only 20 passengers be allowed per bus, thereby reducing by half the passenger intake of the over 6,000 DTC and 600 cluster buses. In March, DTC and cluster buses together carried over 3.2 million passengers daily, which went down to 1.3 million in August, DTC data showed.“From Sunday, all seats on our DTC and cluster buses will be open for passengers to sit and travel. However, no one will be allowed to stand inside the bus or sit on the floor. Wearing masks will be mandatory for entry into the buses. Our conductor and civil defence volunteers will check this and also ensure social distancing,” Gahlot said. On Saturday evening, chief secretary Vijay Dev issued an order saying in case of any violation, “disciplinary proceedings” shall be initiated against the driver and the conductor of the bus, and responsibility shall be fixed of the depot manager concerned for the supervisory lapses.”A senior Delhi Metro official said there is no plan as of now to increase the passenger capacity on Metro trains.The minister added that interstate buses and interstate bus terminals will, in all likelihood, resume services from Monday. He said the transport department has prepared the standard operating procedures in this regard. When asked if the decision to lift restrictions was appropriate in view of Covid-19, health minister Satyendar Jain said a lockdown was no solution to the spread of infection. “If the passengers are wearing masks, then increasing the seating capacity on buses will not be a problem. If even one person is not wearing a mask, then having the restriction of just 20 passengers per bus will not work. So, rather than imposing restrictions, focus should be on ensuring that people wear masks. All other states are running buses at full capacity now,” said Jain.With the addition of the festive rush, crowded bus stops underscores a new worry in Delhi’s fight against Covid-19. Buses and the Metro are the two primary mass transit options available in a city of nearly 20 million. The DTC said allowing buses to run at full capacity will bring comfort to passengers and also help the corporation marginally inch towards pre-Covid revenue collection. Earnings through tickets for the DTC dropped by almost Rs167 crore during the months of March, April, May and June as compared to the same period in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/from-sunday-dtc-and-cluster-buses-to-run-at-full-seating-capacity/story-LSTiifu1USTvMDTvhORDgM.html
01-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai saw quietest Eid-e-Milad festivities since 2013, says NGO||This year, Eid-e-Milad celebrations in the city were the quietest since 2013, according to non-government organisation (NGO) Awaaz Foundation. On Saturday, Awaaz Foundation submitted its report to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray. Eid-e-Milad-un-Nabi celebrates the birth of Prophet Mohammed and was observed on Friday.On the day between 4.15pm and 5.30pm, Awaaz Foundation recorded noise levels at four locations and found celebrations to be loudest at 66.1 decibel (db), between Byculla bridge junction and Nagapada Circle in south Mumbai.The readings at the other three locations were between 52dB to 66.1dB, which is significantly lower than previous years. For example, the stretch between Sir JJ Hospital and Crawford Market recorded 52-55db noise. Due to the use of loudspeakers, readings in this region in 2018 was 105.3 dB in 2018; 105.2 dB in 2017; 111.5dB in 2016; 103.5 dB in 2015; 108.3 dB in 2014; and 104.5 dB in 2013. Awaaz Foundation did not record noise levels during Eid-e-Milad in 2019. Noise can affect the health and well-being of citizens and continuous exposure to levels above 80dB can lead to partial hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, residential areas should have a maximum noise level of 55dB in the day and 45dB at night. Continuous exposure to levels higher than 70dB can lead to hearing loss, and exposure to levels above that can lead to sensorineural hearing loss, which usually occurs suddenlyDuring previous years, noise from pedestrian traffic and motorcycles was high with people driving recklessly and blocking major roads, especially at Mohammed Ali Road.Activists said noise was much lower this year owing to only a single procession permitted in Byculla, which did not carry loudspeakers. “I followed it on foot as it passed through various areas between Byculla and Nagpada. Since vehicular traffic was blocked along the route (except for police vehicles) there was no traffic noise. Although there were crowds in some areas but there was no shouting,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener, Awaaz Foundation who submitted the noise report to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray.Abdulali added that the drop in noise was not just during Eid e Milad this year but followed a trend observed in other festivals including the Ganeshotsav and other celebrations as a silver lining of the pandemic. “The city demonstrated new ways to celebrate responsibly without loudspeakers across all religious and cultural celebrations this year. In the interest of controlling noise pollution and eliminating its consequent health hazards, I hope this trend continues for the years to come,” she said.The Mumbai police spokesperson deputy commissioner of police N Ambika said, “Noise abatement measures have been strictly implemented this year. The use of loudspeakers has been prohibited. Large crowds have been avoided during every festival in Mumbai this year and appropriate deployment of police personnel has been done to ensure physical distancing is maintained.”Members of the Haji Ali trust said circulars had been issued to groups carrying out processions to maintain decorum during the festival requesting sammelan - to celebrate peacefully and to not create noise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-saw-quietest-eid-e-milad-festivities-since-2013-says-ngo/story-pUdxMpP6A5VBa3xyUPmVUM.html

Therefore, the political, economic, cultural and social issues of the people belonging to the Dalit community as well as other minorities from the border region are extremely crucial for us,” Shinde and Bhujbal stated in their joint letter. “The black day will be observed on November 1 to demand the integration of Belgaum and its bordering areas with Maharashtra. The entire MVA cabinet will wear black ribbons to show support to the people in the bordering areas… We will raise the voice of the Marathi brothers in these areas and condemn oppression,” state minister from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Jayant Patil tweeted.Patil also asked NCP functionaries to sport black ribbons on Sunday, while Shinde has appealed to reporters and journalists in Maharashtra to wear them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/belgaum-issue-maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-ministers-to-observe-black-day/story-dgYyOAvEVpovvBQ98Y8yAJ.html
01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Dry spell to continue in Chandigarh, may worsen air quality||With no rain likely in the coming days and dry winds blowing in the region, the air quality index (AQI) in the city is likely to go up. Director of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) Surender Paul said, “The dry spell is likely to continue for at least the first two weeks of November, up to Diwali. The major sources of rain at this time are western disturbances, but no activity is being detected.”The normal amount of rain for the month of October is 22.2mm. In the last decade, however, very little to no rain has been recorded in October. This year saw no rain the whole month.Paul said winter was likely to be along normal lines this year and more details will be available in a long range forecast which will be issued by IMD in November.However, he said the AQI in the city could worsen especially if precautions were not taken on Diwali: “Even if there is light rain, it can clean the air of pollutants, but their concentration increases during long periods of dry weather. If crackers are burst like in the previous years, by the middle of the month the AQI can become worse.”Debendra Dalai, vice-president of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC), said, “This year the AQI has been considerably better owing to the lockdown. By November due to temperature inversion, AQI usually gets poorer, but this year there isn’t much difference in what the AQI is now and what it was a few weeks back.”He added that the department was working towards spreading awareness and keeping the AQI in the moderate bracket (up to 200) even after Diwali.The AQI in the city stayed between 120-130 on Saturday.The maximum temperature in the city went up from 30.7°C on Friday to 31.1°C on Saturday; the minimum temperature went up from 12.8°C on Friday to 14.1°C on Saturday. In the next three days, the maximum temperature will remain around 30°C and the minimum temperature will remain between 14°C and 15°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dry-spell-to-continue-in-chandigarh-may-worsen-air-quality/story-H5uOtTtltRGCsUVLdWHslJ.html

Advocate for the petitioners Ashish Chopra said, “Although it was spelt out in the advertisement that no candidate would be considered to have qualified the test if he/she commits more than 4% of mistakes during dictation test, but some candidates have been selected despite committing more than 4% mistakes which is evident from the result”.HC has sought a response from 11 candidates and the administration by December 3. On February 5, a grievance was raised with the HC administration seeking cancellation of the test, but to no avail, it was stated.Instructions as per the advertisement were not followed by those dictating the passage, which was dictated at a speed of 100 words per minute for five minutes; from the merit list it was clear that even in the case of selected candidates, mistakes exceeded the upper limit of 20 (4%), the court was told by the advocate.In all, 21 candidates were declared selected for the 33 posts on October 15, none were from the categories of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, backward classes, ex-servicemen and persons with disabilities, the petition stated.The petitioners have demanded that the list of selected candidates be quashed and the test reconducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/selection-of-stenographers-punjab-and-haryana-hc-puts-own-administration-on-notice-on-candidates-plea-for-retest/story-HFwG8OMfpC5mbzuOWrsjqK.html

In a late night order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev, the DDMA relaxed the cap on the number of guests to allow up to 200 persons in banquet halls or closed spaces for weddings. However, the restriction in the number of guests for funerals will continue to be 20. The DDMA also issued a set of standard operating procedure (SOP) for weddings and related functions in the city on Saturday. Click here for complete coronavirus coverageIn closed spaces, a maximum of 50% of hall capacity will be allowed, with a ceiling of 200 people. In open spaces or grounds, the number of guests permissible will be jointly fixed by the area district magistrate and DCP, the order stated.The order implied that if someone is planning a bigger wedding with more than 200 persons, then choosing an open space would be a better option since there is no specific cap on the number of people mentioned in the document. Wearing of face masks, maintaining social distancing, provision of thermal scanning and use of hand wash or sanitiser will be mandatory, it stated. The SoPs also stated that an individual will have not be nominated by the organiser as the nodal person to oversee all arrangements and coordination at the marriage venue. The name and contact of the nodal person should be displayed at the entry of the venue. All public utility areas such as food stalls, stage, DJ will have to be sanitised prior to the event. Common bins for disposal of face masks, multiple hand wash facilities, separate entry and exit gates, and not more than 50% of the capacity at a time in dining hall should be exercised, the order said. While only asymptomatic persons will be allowed, the rules also stated that entry of guests will have to be regulated at the venue to ensure that it does not exceed the upper limit at any time. For closed spaces, the air-conditioners should be set at temperature of 24-30 degree Celsius with a relative humidity of 40-70%. If someone falls ill, then the guest will have to be immediately isolated and be taken to the nearest medical facility or district officials should be contacted. The order maintained status quo for all other activities and added that the relaxations meant for the festive season shall continue.

01-11-2020||Pune||Pimpri-Chinchwad civic admin attributes reduced Covid-19 cases to My family, My responsibility initiative||My family, my responsibility (Maze Kutumbh, Mazi Jababdari) initiative has turned out to be a trump card for the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) as they have managed to reduce the number of Covid-19 cases in the twin township, according to the civic officials.As of October 31, PCMC has had 84,519 Covid-19 positive cases and 1,200 deaths have been recorded, as per the state health department report. The mortality rate of PCMC currently stands at 1.7 per cent.“Maze Kutumbh, Mazi Jababdari played a big role in bringing down the number of Covid-19 cases in PCMC. The initiative helped a lot in early detection and spreading awareness. People also gave a very good response to initiative,” said Shravan Hardikar, PCMC commissioner.On six days - October 14, 19, 25, 26, 27 and 31- zero virus-related deaths were recorded in PCMC. On the other days, the death rate did not exceed 20. On October 16, 17 deaths had been reported which has been the highest this month. This month’s data has provided much-needed relief to civic officials who believe that the spread of the virus is being contained.The first phase of the initiative took place between September 15 and October 10 and the second phase was conducted during October 14 -24. With Covid-19 cases declining every day, PCMC has decided to continue the initiative further.“Diwali is a much bigger festival than Navratri and is round the corner, so people need to continue following norms. PCMC is continuing to take precautionary measures, but the role of people will be very important in flattening the curve,” said Hardikar.With cases declining, PCMC has temporarily shut operating of jumbo Covid-19 care centre at Annasaheb Magar Stadium, Pimpri while operations at Balnagri, Bhosari Jumbo Covid-19 care facility is still functional.“Along with Annasaheb Magar Stadium we have reduced a few hospitals temporarily from the list of Covid hospitals. If the need arises, then jumbo facilities and other hospitals will be brought into use again,” added Hardikar.“The decline in the curve has been noticed across the state. We are following all the guidelines given by the state. If people continue to follow all guidelines, then cases will keep on reducing,” said Santosh Patil, additional commissioner.Dr Vijay Natarajan, chief executive officer at the Symbiosis hospital, said, “Maze Kutumbh, Mazi Jababdari, has helped increase the detection rate, but there is no scientific explanation to a lull which we are noticing in the cases right now. Looking at the overall world statistics, the second wave could be more severe, we need to be cautious going ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pcmc-admin-attributes-reduced-covid-19-cases-to-my-family-my-responsibility-initiative/story-lbZsTAkSgqKbsb612gyonJ.html
01-11-2020||World||US election fund-raising: Indian Americans among ‘bundlers’ for Biden||There are at least 21 Indian Americans among top fund-raisers for Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, according to a list released by his campaign on Saturday.These elite fund-raisers — called “bundlers” in American electoral politics — each collected $100,000 or more for the campaign, and they are different from individual donors.Indian Americans in the list of 817 over all included two-term Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, longtime Democratic activists, fund-raisers and strategists Ramesh Kapur, Shekar Narasimhan, Deven Parekh, Frank Islam, Swadesh Chatterjee, MR Rangaswami, Deepak Raj and Shefali Razdan Duggal.Also on the list were Biden’s former rivals for the Democratic presidential ticket Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senators Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar, filmmaker Jeffrey Katzenberg, tech billionaires Reid Hoffman Ron Conway, Governors Gretchen Whitmer and Tom Wolf of battleground states Michigan and Pennsylvania.The campaign did not disclose the personal contributions of those on the list, which was seen to have taken longer than other Democratic presidential nominees in the past.Biden has out-raised Republican President Donald Trump by a wide margin and is expected to become the first presidential nominee to gather $1 billion in campaign funds.His campaign had already raised $938 million by October 14, according to the Center for Responsible Politics, which tracks election finances. President Trump’s campaign had raised $596mn by the same date.The 2020 elections to the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives are expected to be most expensive yet, with total spending estimated to be around $14 bn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-fund-raising-indian-americans-among-bundlers-for-biden/story-77Q70tf2KgLT0gINgdXMyO.html
01-11-2020||World||For Donald Trump’s government immigration, visa agency frauds are key focus||The head of the agency handling citizenship and visa applications was surprised when he faced blowback for cutting a reference to the US being a “nation of immigrants” in its mission statement. The son of a Peruvian immigrant added language about “protecting Americans” instead.L. Francis Cissna argued that America is indisputably a nation of immigrants but that US Citizenship and Immigration Services’ mission statement wasn’t the place to say so. Joseph Edlow, who now oversees the agency, said he hasn’t thought about the 2018 kerfuffle, but it crystallized for many how the Trump administration has changed the government’s approach to legal immigration.USCIS, established with the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, is emphasizing fraud detection, enforcement and vetting those seeking to work, live or become US citizens. Applicants, attorneys and employees call it overkill, while immigration critics say it’s overdue. New Trump administration rules range from making asylum protections more difficult to get to disqualifying more low-income applicants from green cards.Processing times are longer, and the agency’s backlog of cases stands at 5 million. Making it tougher to get permission to live and work in America has had consequences for USCIS itself: its roughly $5 billion annual budget is funded almost entirely by application fees, which have dwindled with the stricter rules. Financial pressures mounted this summer as USCIS narrowly averted furloughs for 70% of its roughly 20,000 employees.Curbing legal immigration has been a priority for President Donald Trump as he’s reshaped the immigration system, arguably more than any predecessor. He’s thrilled supporters with an “America first” message and infuriated critics who call his signature domestic issue insular, xenophobic and even racist.Before the election, The Associated Press is examining several Trump immigration policies, including r estrictions on international students, a retreat from America’s humanitarian role, a virtual shutdown of asylum and now curbing legal immigration.Trump failed to get Congress to support cuts to the system of immigrants bringing over relatives, but Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, said moving to a more “merit based” system, based on skills, would be a priority if the president is reelected.Democrat Joe Biden offers a sharp contrast: preserve family-based immigration and “streamline” naturalization for green-card holders. He wants a path to citizenship for about 11 million people in the US illegally, which would require congressional support.Miller told the AP that USCIS was plagued by a “huge amount of fraud” and its workforce “came to see itself as a representative of the benefit-seeker rather than the representative of the American people.”“This administration has undertaken a thorough revamping of the agency to restore its congressional mission of ensuring that benefits are only awarded to those who are genuinely eligible under law and that, ensuring in admitting them, no harm is done to our economic or national security interests,” he said.Some critics say USCIS hasn’t provided enough evidence of widespread fraud. Even Louis D. Crocetti Jr., first director of USCIS’ anti-fraud unit who supports Trump’s policies and calls fraud common, says the agency should release more findings.“If you don’t do that, how can you really justify getting the millions of dollars and continuing your operation?” said Crocetti, who retired in 2011.The changes are evident in USCIS offices. Workers who decide on citizenship and permanent residency applications in the San Diego office saw their workload grow about 20% when officials ordered all applicants for employment-based green cards be interviewed.Edlow said the blanket interview requirement has been scrapped and whether such applicants are called in depends on the case.Workers are preparing for Trump’s rule that dramatically expands criteria for denying green cards to those receiving taxpayer-funded benefits. The US Supreme Court decided in a 5-4 vote in January that the policy could take effect, but the coronavirus put it on hold until September.Processing times for employment-based green cards jumped to 14.5 months in an 11-month period ending Aug. 31, up from 6.8 months in the 2016 fiscal year. For citizenship, it rose to 9.1 months from 5.6 months.An analysis of all visa categories by the American Immigration Lawyers Association found long waits doubled to 10 months in the 2019 fiscal year from five years earlier.Natividad Rodriguez, 85, has been waiting since July 2019 for a citizenship interview, the final step before the oath. The Chicago woman and Mexican native had hoped to vote this year.“We have been waiting a long time,” said daughter Ana Maria Fuentes, who helped her mother apply. “It’s too much time.”In their defense, administration officials note they approved more than 800,000 citizenship applications in fiscal 2019, the highest since 2008.But the administration also is trying to reduce applications. For example, USCIS last year started requiring that no spaces on forms be left blank, even if a question doesn’t apply, like a middle name. Agency officials say employees were taking too much time filling in incomplete applications.Blank spaces have led to rejections, attorneys say. An American Immigration Lawyers Association survey this year found nearly 200 examples nationwide. Applications also were rejected for writing “none” or “not applicable” instead of “N/A,” which most instructions said to use.The administration checks up on those who clear the hurdles. On a recent afternoon, all cubicles in the anti-fraud wing of the USCIS San Diego office were empty because its nine investigators were knocking on visa-holders’ doors, including one who raised flags because the spouse was living in Georgia.Nationwide, anti-fraud unit staffing has roughly doubled to about 2,000 under Trump, from less than 1,000. The unit projects 249,335 requests to investigate fraud in fiscal 2021, up from 119,424 in 2016. Edlow says checking if people are “actually married when they say they are” or are working at the job they listed is “an investment in the safety and security of this country.”As costs from anti-fraud work rose, agency revenue took a hit after Trump ended the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields young people from deportation, and Temporary Protected Status, given to 400,000 people escaping natural disasters and civil strife.Fiscal challenges came to a head in May when USCIS threatened furloughs to tackle a projected $1.2 billion shortfall. The agency didn’t need the money, Edlow said, because application fees rebounded more than expected as offices reopened in June from coronavirus shutdowns and contracts were reviewed for cost savings.USCIS has been without a Senate-confirmed director since Cissna left in May 2019 in a purge of Homeland Security leaders. Attorneys have challenged the legitimacy of acting Homeland Security leaders in a bid to block new USCIS rules, with mixed results.A judge in September halted a 20% average increase in visa and citizenship fees, saying in part that two top Homeland Security officials were appointed illegally. Edlow, USCIS deputy director of policy, has been running operations since February.While some agency employees support the focus on increased vetting, others say some changes are unnecessary and may discourage people from seeking legal status.“Our job is to keep the doors open but safely secured. The way that it is being administered now, it doesn’t seem like the doors are open,” said Gary Thurman, an employee in Missouri speaking as vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3928 South.Edlow said he’s focused on better training and technology, including a transition to electronic files.“Is it going to happen overnight? No, it’s not,” Edlow said. “I do want to get back to a point where we’re flush with money.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-donald-trump-s-government-immigration-visa-agency-frauds-are-key-focus/story-x2Mlke6u33nv49etLkLmpK.html

Now Imran Khan wants to hand over GB’s tourism sector to his friends but we will not him do so,” he added.The party chairman also asked the people of Gilgit-Baltistan to come out in numbers on November to decide their future.Zardari made the statement on Saturday while addressing a corner meeting in Gahkoch area of Ghizar district.Central PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira, Senator Karim Khawaja, Pir Syed Jalal Shah, Amjad Hussain Advocate and, Dr Aleem Arshad were also present.Meanwhile, despite the ongoing protests against the Pakistan Government over its decision to change the status of Gilgit-Baltistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday announced the granting of provisional-provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan, Geo News reported.Massive protests have been taking place against the Imran Khan-led government over the issue of Gilgit Baltistan.“One of the reasons for me coming to Gilgit-Baltistan is to announce that we have decided to grant Gilgit-Baltistan the provisional provincial status,” Khan said while speaking during his visit to Gilgit-Baltistan.This comes following Saudi Arabia removing Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan from Pakistan’s map.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilgit-baltistan-will-overwhelmingly-vote-against-imran-khan-asserts-bilawal-bhutto-zardari/story-I8JPFrn1fYs0KoAAPYZDeL.html
01-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Cuba has a big stake in US election after Trump’s trashing of detente||Pensioner Esperanza Chacón, 89, prays every day for Donald Trump to lose the US presidential election. Like many Cubans, her livelihood has been threatened by Trump’s tightening of the US trade embargo on the Communist-run island. Chacon’s son in Miami sends her the equivalent of $60 to $100 a month, to supplement her state pension worth just $12, but the Trump administration’s latest Cuba sanction, unveiled last month, looks set to cut off remittances.“He’s ending my ability to live and feed myself, at this age!” said Chacon.“So I’m praying every day he doesn’t win the elections.” Cuba has more at stake in the upcoming US election than most countries in Latin America as the Trump administration has focused much of its foreign policy in the region on measures aimed, it says, at bringing about democracy in the country and its socialist ally Venezuela.Trump unraveled a detente with Cuba started by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, that had fostered remittances and travel to the Caribbean isle, as well as foreign investment and the private sector.The Republican president reverted instead to a decades-old US policy of choking the one-party state’s already inefficient state-run economy to force reform.Democratic challenger Joe Biden - the vice president during Obama’s attempts to engage with Cuba - has promised to promptly reverse Trump policies that “have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights.”“The US election results are enormously important for Cuba because they will make the difference between continuing Trump’s policy of trying to starve Cuba into submission and Biden’s policy of restarting engagement,” said William LeoGrande, a Cuba expert and professor of government at Washington’s American University. The Trump administration has dealt blows to tourism, foreign investment, and Cuba’s energy supply by tightening restrictions on US travel, sanctioning oil shipments from Venezuela and activating a law allowing litigation against firms “trafficking” in expropriated properties, among other measures.“Most the people who stayed at our bed and breakfast were Americans so reservations were down some 40 to 50 percent by the time the pandemic hit,” said Jesus Manuel Rivero. His Casa Flamboyan B&B ranks No. 1 in Havana on Tripadvisor. Washington has also attacked Cuba’s medical missions in a campaign that saw its allies ousting them, hitting the country’s top source of hard currency. Trump says the Cuban government traffics in the doctors, keeping them in slave-like conditions. Havana has strongly denied the allegation. All this has worsened Cuba’s cash crunch. The embargo cost it a record $5.6 billion over the last year, the government has said, and exacerbated shortages of even basic goods like food.Under Trump, the reduction of the US embassy in Havana to skeletal staffing and closure of the consular office after diplomats complained of a mysterious illness has also made it tough for Cubans to get visas to visit their family in the United States.A Biden presidency would likely not only reverse Trump’s policies but also resume dialogue on matters of mutual interest like health and security that had fizzled out of late, said Emily Mendrala, who coordinated congressional discussions on Cuba policy during a stint in Obama’s National Security Council and now runs the Centre for Democracy in the Americas.Cuban dissidents, meanwhile, are divided over the US election. Some hope for a Biden win, saying engagement deprives their government of an excuse for its economic woes or repression. Others, like Jose Daniel Ferrer, leader of the island’s largest opposition group, the Patriotic Union of Cuba, say that too much leniency toward the Cuban government as - in his view - under Obama emboldens it to crack down as it wishes.“Whoever wins the Nov. 3 elections must listen to the calls for freedom of the Cuban people and other oppressed peoples,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-cuba-has-a-big-stake-in-us-election-after-trump-s-trashing-of-detente/story-UIWA1QZrx2nZRHCqzqejsK.html
01-11-2020||World||In George Floyd’s hometown, a season of protest ends at the polls||Dexter Faircloth walked the streets of Houston’s Third Ward, the historic Black neighbourhood where he was born and raised, shouting greetings and asking an urgent question.“Y’all vote?! Did you?” Faircloth, 35, hollered repeatedly at people, who smiled when they recognized him as he canvassed the area last weekend.Faircloth, a corporate trainer, says he has always been an advocate for his community. But that role became more urgent when his friend and Third Ward native, African-American George Floyd, died in May after a white Minneapolis police knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.The summer’s simmering anger and demands for justice that Floyd’s death ignited have transformed into huge voter turnout for Black Americans in some parts of the country. That is especially true of the Third Ward, where hopes for change have energized many in the final days of the race between President Donald Trump, a Republican, and Democratic rival Joe Biden.Early voting at the Third Ward’s three polling stations is up more than 650% compared to 2016 figures, according to data from the Harris County Clerk’s Office.“Look, man. Voting is not the end-all-be-all. It’s just the start,” Faircloth said. “But we’re telling people: ‘If you want change, this is how you begin to change things.’“The Third Ward, a patchwork of old wooden homes, bodegas, and barber shops with hand-painted storefronts less than a mile from downtown Houston’s skyscrapers, houses some of the city’s crown jewels for African-American culture, including Texas Southern University. Floyd, who played college football and basketball, was a mentor to neighbourhood boys and encouraged them with his optimism, Faircloth recalls. Third Ward residents were enraged by the brutal manner in which Floyd died, which was captured on video by a bystander. “Seeing that video was almost as if we were watching slaves being beaten in real life,” Faircloth said. “Instead of whips, the weapons were a knee and a badge.”Third Ward residents who knew Floyd best marched daily, as Black Lives Matter protests spread across the globe. In Houston, they were joined by Police Chief Art Acevedo, who told Reuters he remembers Faircloth and other young Black leaders from the Third Ward helping maintain the peace during protests.Floyd’s death was a tragic reminder that policing is not where it should be, Acevedo said. He recalls telling Third Ward residents, and others in Houston, that there’s not just one way to fix that problem. “We told people that it’s really important that they not just take to the streets, but that they take to the polls during the election,” he said.“Voting for George”Voters who Reuters spoke to in the Third Ward and nearby said they emerged from this summer’s protests not just more politically active, but also confident they can make their voices heard.“It feels like we’re in a new Civil Rights era,” said JD Fontenot, a pharmacy student at Texas Southern University.The world he and other young minorities are beginning to help shape feels like a mirror image of the days of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, he said, and voting is a first step.“The fact that our vote is directly linked to Black people’s freedom in America is on the minds of people right now,” Fontenot said.So is tension between Blacks and whites.“The racial injustice we are seeing right now, which had been subliminal but now spews forth in the open, is making it clear to the Black community that we have to come out and vote,” said daycare worker Veronica McClendon, 53, who was born and raised in the nearby Fifth Ward.Faircloth and two other members of the Alpha Phi Alpha Black fraternity - Carlos Pinkerton and Sheldon Hadnot - canvassed door-to-door in the Third Ward last weekend.When they spotted Arnetta Taylor outside her home, they wouldn’t take no for an answer. Dispelling her concerns about a missing voter registration card, they explained other forms of ID she could use and got her commitment to go to the polls.“Take my number and call me on Monday to make sure I voted! I’m 46-years-old and I’ve never voted in my life, but I will now,” Taylor said.She was clear about her motivation.“We’re voting for George,” she said. “We’re voting for Breonna Taylor, too. We’re voting for a lot of Black people that have been killed in this way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-george-floyd-s-hometown-a-season-of-protest-ends-at-the-polls/story-aNboe9ZNi8iIDaeo89c05J.html
01-11-2020||World||No terror angle in Halloween night stabbing attack in Canada: Police||Police in Canada said on Sunday there was no terror angle to the stabbing spree in Quebec in which two persons were killed and five others were injured.The suspect, a 24-year-old man, is in custody but has not been identified. Reports said he was dressed in medieval costume and armed with a “bladed weapon.”The incident occurred late Saturday night and the suspect was apprehended local law enforcement at approximately 1 am local time on Sunday. According to local media reports, the rampage occurred near the Chateau Frontenac, on rue des Ramparts in the city, close to the National Assembly area.Police said the suspect did not live in the city but was apparently from the suburbs of Montreal. The perpetrator of the horror on Halloween night “chose his victims at random,” police said, adding he was not associated with any terror organisation. While the city police’s anti-terror unit was involved in the investigation, it tweeted, “According to our initial information, there is no indication that the suspect may have acted on motives other than personal ones.”Given that Quebec is Canada’s Francophone province and practises the sort of laicite associated with France, there was speculation connecting the episode with recent terror attacks there, but that may be unfounded.The Service de police de la Ville de Québec, the city’s police department warned residents to avoid the Parliament Hill area and asked them to remain inside.“We still ask the citizens of Quebec City to stay inside with the doors locked because an investigation is still underway,” the department said in a tweet in French.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his dismay over the attack. “My heart breaks for the loved ones of the two people killed in last night’s horrific attack in Quebec City. I’m also wishing a full recovery to the injured,” he said.“We’re keeping you in our thoughts and will be there for you. To all the first responders, thank you for your critical work.”The premier of the province, François Legault, conveyed his shock in a tweet: “Quebec is waking up after a night of horror. Words fail me to describe such a tragedy. I offer my condolences to the loved ones of the victims.”Those injured in the incident were taken to a local hospital for treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-terror-angle-in-halloween-night-stabbing-attack-in-canada-police/story-znoVDy9bm6XIVwx6DaVxZI.html
01-11-2020||World||England’s lockdown may be extended beyond December||Less than a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a month-long lockdown for England, one of his top ministers and closest allies signalled the measures might have to be extended if they fail to contain the spread of the coronavirus.“It will get reviewed on December 2, but we’re always driven by what the data show,” Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said on Sky News’s Sophy Ridge show. “We will always take the decision in national interest based on the evidence, the best information that we have.”When pressed by Ridge on whether the restrictions could be extended if the data wasn’t good, Gove replied, “yes.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday announced that England would go into a second, partial lockdown as virus cases spike and government scientists warn the health system faces being overwhelmed. Total virus cases in the UK since the outbreak began have now passed 1 million and the country has suffered more than 46,000 fatalities, the highest death toll in Europe.“If we were to have a situation where we found our NHS overwhelmed, it will also have inevitable effects on our economy, on people’s overall confidence and their ability to go about their daily lives,” Gove said. “This is a protective step that we need to take that nobody relishes. We feel that there is no alternative.”Faced With Hard Science, Johnson Hopes Lockdown Saves ChristmasJohnson had for weeks sought to avoid further restrictions that the government worries will hurt the economy. Under the new measures essential shops will shut, alongside bars and restaurants, but schools will stay open in a bid to allow people to remain working. In a BBC interview, Gove indicated that the government may prefer to extend the lockdown rather than further disrupt the education system.The government also U-turned on its financial support policy, extending its furlough program, which had been due to end on Saturday, until the end of the new lockdown. That’s the fourth time officials have changed the nature of the replacement for furlough since a successor was announced in late September and Gove said it will be reviewed if the lockdown is extended.The dramatic steps mark an end to the tiered, localized approach the government had been taking to virus curbs, a strategy Gove said he hopes the nation will return to in December. It also comes after weeks during which Johnson said he wanted to avoid the “nuclear option” of nationwide restrictions, despite advice from scientists in September to introduce a shorter “circuit-breaker” lockdown coinciding with school holidays.The UK’s sluggishness in imposing new measures given the record surge in virus cases is likely to raise questions about why officials didn’t act earlier, while the move is also politically embarrassing for Johnson. It risks both upsetting his own rank-and-file lawmakers and vindicating opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer’s repeated calls for a temporary lockdown.“Three weeks ago we called for a circuit break,” Starmer said in a BBC interview. “At that stage the government rejected it out of hand, ridiculed it, now only to do precisely the same thing. But there’s a cost to that delay. The lockdown now will be longer, it can be harder. And there’s a very human cost to this.”Even the announcement was fraught, coming days earlier than expected due to a leak of the plan’s details following a meeting of just four senior ministers. That breach is now under investigation, Gove confirmed Sunday as he defended the decision.“The virus has proven to be more malignant in the way in which it spread than any of us had anticipated or feared,” Gove said. “The first thing is that the advice that we were receiving at the time indicated that a regional approach was entirely appropriate. It’s impossible to know definitively until the end of this pandemic which were the mistakes, and which were the missteps.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-s-lockdown-may-be-extended-beyond-december/story-u5ihXOflMYCTT4aYteCPzJ.html
01-11-2020||World||Analysis: Bidencare or Trumpcare? Health plans will affect US economy differently||Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden wants to expand the Affordable Care Act(ACA), President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare legislation.Republican President Donald Trump wants to end it altogether, and replace it with something that has yet to be defined. An ongoing debate over which approach is better for the economy is partly about price tags. Bidencare is forecast to increase federal healthcare spending by $2 trillion or more over 10 years. Trump’s approach is to hold federal spending stable or reduce it.Bidencare supporters emphasize the stimulative effects of government spending, especially in a period of economic distress, and the benefits of insuring more people in the middle of a pandemic. Those who prefer Trump’s approach say it would avoid debt or tax increases they say would drag on future economic growth.The United States has about 30 million people without health insurance now, down from about 46.5 million in 2010, when the ACA was passed. Bidencare would cut that figure by a further 15 million to 20 million, an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates. Trump isn’t expected to try to reduce that. Healthcare spending is equal to 17% of the US economy, far more than any other industrialized country, so the Trumpcare vs. Bidencare debate is no small economic matter. It’s further complicated by the fact that extra spending doesn’t translate to a healthier populace than other counties. “Improving healthcare performance is a critical part of strengthening America’s health, economy and fiscal future, and should be top a priority for the next president and Congress,” says Peterson Foundation CEO Michael Peterson.Bidencare focuses on lower-income Americans Bidencare would cover more Americans by increasing subsidized health insurance purchases through tax credits. It would also offer a “public option,” allowing anyone who wants it to buy in, even if their job offers private insurance. Lower-income families shut out of ACA’s expanded Medicaid eligibility because of where they live could get it premium-free. Any boost to health and financial stability is likely to be biggest for millions of low-income households, particularly Latino and Black families who have been particularly hard-hit during the pandemic.For these groups especially, says the University of Michigan School of Public Health’s Helen Levy, being able to accumulate assets “is really important if you think about supporting economic mobility.”Minorities get and die from Covid-19 at higher rates than whites, data shows. Some of that is probably because Blacks and Latinos are more likely to work in jobs that put them at higher risk of transmission. But even without Covid-19, minorities face higher rates of chronic disease and earlier death than whites. They also have lower rates of health insurance despite substantial gains since the advent of the ACA, a study by Kaiser Family Foundation shows. Biden said he would pay for his plan through higher taxes on the wealthy, and use the clout of expanded public insurance to keep down medical costs. Increasing the number of insured Americans could have positive economic consequences. There’s evidence that the uninsured who do get sick get care in expensive settings like the emergency room, says University of California, Los Angeles(UCLA) public health policy professor Gerald Kominski. That takes a toll on their financial health and, when they can’t pay, strains the finances of hospitals that provide their care, with taxpayers footing part of that bill as well. People in states where uninsured rates fell under Obamacare had fewer past-due debts, were less likely to use payday loans or file for bankruptcy, had better credit and were less likely to be evicted than those in states that did not expand Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. “The whole reason people should get insurance, from an economist’s perspective, is to protect them against catastrophic losses,” says University of Minnesota professor Sayeh Nikpay. Trumpcare less clear, but cheaper Trump tried and failed to get Congress to repeal the ACA in his first four-year term, and is likely to continue to it in some form during a second term. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a challenge to the law a week after Tuesday’s presidential election. A ruling to dismantle the ACA would put coverage of 21 million Americans in jeopardy, according to the Urban Institute, though most legal scholars don’t expect the court to do so. If it does, Trump hasn’t specified a plan to replace it. One blueprint may be the Health Care Choices Proposal, put together by conservative health policy experts at the Galen Institute and the Heritage Foundation. The plan would turn money now used for the ACA over to states to help people buy private health insurance and to provide coverage for low-income households. An analysis by the right-leaning nonprofit think tank American Action Forum found the proposal would lower premiums by 18% to 24%. The number of uninsured would remain steady. “The macroeconomic effects would be better than either current law or proposals to devote more public resources to the ACA,” says author Doug Badger. Reducing premiums, he said, would be the “best form of economic stimulus” because it would put money in the pockets of regular Americans.That analysis is disputed. Bidencare’s high price tag does worry Bipartisan Policy Center Senior Vice President William Hoagland, a former staffer to Republican lawmakers. But, he said, it’s worth paying for broader health insurance access, which he said would lead to a stronger economy. “I’m going to come down on the side that a healthy country, and a reduction in chronic conditions, improves productivity, and improving productivity increases economic growth,” he remarked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/analysis-bidencare-or-trumpcare-health-plans-will-affect-us-economy-differently/story-YElveDZRMK1Y7FWiN7itPP.html

Bloomberg reported on Friday that MHRA had also begun an accelerated review for the Covid-19 vaccine candidate from Pfizer Inc.AstraZeneca and Pfizer are among the front runners in the race to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, with the race also including Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Inc.Their vaccine candidates are in late stage trials, interim data from which are expected in the coming weeks.The British drug maker said on Monday its Covid-19 experimental vaccine produces an immune response in both old and young adults. The vaccine also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, it said.The novel coronavirus has killed more than 1.19 million people globally, damaged the world economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-starts-accelerated-review-for-astrazeneca-s-potential-covid-19-vaccine/story-mlSx5uTIeZTStiBoL3JafL.html
01-11-2020||World||White House goes after Dr Fauci for his Covid-19 death toll concerns||The White House slammed Anthony Fauci after the nation’s leading infectious disease expert ramped up criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, predicted in a Washington Post interview published Saturday night that the US is “in for a whole of of hurt” from the Covid-19 pandemic, and forecast a rising death toll over the winter.Fauci also said he has “real problems” with Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist who’s become President Donald Trump’s favored pandemic adviser in recent months.“It’s unacceptable and breaking with all norms for Dr. Fauci, a senior member of the President’s Coronavirus Taskforce and someone who has praised President Trump’s actions throughout this pandemic, to choose three days before an election to play politics,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.The White House attacked Fauci for giving credit to Democrat Joe Biden’s presidential campaign for “taking it seriously from a public health perspective.” Trump is “looking at it from a different perspective” that is “the economy and reopening the country,” Fauci told the Post.Deere said Fauci was “choosing to criticize the president in the media and make his political leanings known by praising the president’s opponent — exactly what the American people have come to expect from The Swamp.”230,000 DeathsTrump himself has increasingly taken aim at Fauci. The president last month labeled Fauci, 79, who is nonpartisan and has served in his role since 1984, a “Democrat,” but said he would keep him around because firing him would generate more controversy.The White House’s sharp criticism of Fauci could feed the notion that Trump is downplaying the pandemic, which has hurt the president’s standing among voters, according to opinion polls.More than 9.1 million people in the US have been infected by the coronavirus and over 230,000 people have died -- making the US the site of the worst recorded outbreak in the world. The nation had 99,000 cases on Friday, hitting a new daily record just four days before Election Day.Trump resumed massive rallies in the final stretch of the campaign, including five planned for Sunday alone, defying Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend Americans avoid large crowds.Fauci said in the interview that the country needed to make an “abrupt change” in abiding by public-health measures, or else the number of cases could reach more than 100,000 per day.High Alert”We’re in for a whole lot of hurt. It’s not a good situation,” Fauci told the Post. “All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.”“Dr. Fauci may have just admitted that he is afraid the cure will be worse than the disease and that unlike the president he has no confidence in the American people to make the best choice for themselves armed with CDC best practices,” Deere said.In the interview, Fauci also criticized Atlas for lacking the expertise necessary to give Trump informed advice. Atlas has invoked controversial theories about the coronavirus, such as claiming that much of the country is immune due to exposure to other viruses. Epidemiologists say there’s no evidence to support his claims.“He’s a smart guy who’s talking about things that I believe he doesn’t have any real insight or knowledge or experience in,” Fauci said of Atlas. “He keeps talking about things that when you dissect it out and parse it out, it doesn’t make any sense.”Atlas responded to Fauci Saturday night on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-goes-after-dr-fauci-for-his-covid-19-death-toll-concerns/story-rXWFSgJeLm5lgoshhbJYNJ.html

He got his final wish to slip away without any fuss.“It was no life for him. He was not able to express himself latterly.”Connery will be honoured in a private funeral ceremony, with a memorial event to be held later, according to a publicist. The actor, who was knighted in 2000, won numerous awards during his decades-spanning career encompassing an array of big-screen hits, including an Oscar, three Golden Globes and two Bafta awards.But it was his smooth, Scottish-accented portrayal of the suave licensed-to-kill spy 007 that earned him lasting worldwide fame and adoration.The first actor to utter the unforgettable “Bond, James Bond”, Connery made six official films as novelist Ian Fleming’s creation, giving what many still consider to be the definitive portrayal.Former 007 actor Pierce Brosnan joined the flood of weekend tributes to the Scottish actor, who he said “led the way for us all who followed in your iconic foot steps”.“You were my greatest James Bond as a boy, and as a man who became James Bond himself, you cast a long shadow of cinematic splendour that will live on forever,” Brosnan added.- ‘Model of a man’ -Connery, born in Edinburgh in 1930, married French artist Roquebrune in 1974, a year after he divorced first wife Diane Cilento.The couple first met in Morocco in 1970. They had lived outside his native Britain for decades, previously owning a home in the Spanish resort of Marbella and then in the Bahamas.In one of the last photographs said to have been taken of the 007 legend, and published by the Mail on Sunday, Connery can be seen clasping the hand of a smiling Roquebrune.The picture was taken on the pair’s 45th wedding anniversary on May 6, according to the paper.“He was gorgeous and we had a wonderful life together,” the Tunisian-born widow said.“He was a model of a man. It is going to be very hard without him, I know that. But it could not last for ever and he went peacefully.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sean-connery-s-widow-reveals-actor-suffered-from-dementia/story-fR8okt1BlIIjgi0LLcSS5L.html
01-11-2020||World||China to begin work on section of Sichuan-Tibet Railway near Indian border||China is all set to begin the construction of the strategic Sichuan-Tibet Railway between Ya’an in southwest Sichuan province and Linzhi in Tibet, close to the Indian border in Arunachal Pradesh, the official media reported. China Railway announced on Saturday the bidding results for the construction of two tunnels and one bridge, as well as the power supply project for the Ya’an-Linzhi section of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, indicating that construction of the project is about to begin.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway is the second such project in Tibet after the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. It will go through the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the world’s most geologically active areas, a report by the state-run China News reported.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway starts from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, and travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours, the report said.Linzhi, which is also known as Nyingchi, is located close to Arunachal Pradesh border.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Linzhi also has an airport, one of the five built by China in the Himalayan region.The newly-built Ya’an-Linzhi section runs 1,011 kilometres and includes 26 stations. Trains are expected to run at speeds between 120 and 200 km per hour, a staffer in charge of the project said.The total cost of the entire Sichuan-Tibet Railway project is around 319.8 billion yuan (USD 47.8 billion), Global Times reported.The Sichuan-Tibet railway is also of great significance in safeguarding national unity and maintaining border stability, the daily quoted Chinese experts as saying.“After the Sichuan-Tibet railway starts operation, Tibet will have more exchanges with other parts of the Chinese mainland. Strategically, China’s Tibetan region will have much stronger capabilities in material transportation and logistical supplies,” Lin Minwang, deputy director at the Center for South Asian Studies at Fudan University, said.Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University told the daily “If a scenario of a crisis happens at the China-India border, the railway will provide a great convenience for China’s delivery of strategic materials.” The Sichuan-Tibet Railway will not only accelerate and enhance the overall economic development of the Tibet region but will play an important role in safeguarding border stability, the daily’s report said.The construction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway is of strategic importance that benefits the overall development of Tibet, Xiong Kunxin, an ethnic studies professor at the Tibet University in Lhasa, said.As a major infrastructure project, the railway is set to improve transport that has hindered exchanges between the Tibet region and the rest of China, and could help transport advanced equipment and technologies from other places to Tibet, and bring local products out, Xiong said.Observers said the new railway line will put Tibet on a “fast track” to catch up with other more developed regions of China, the reports said.Both Sichuan and Tibet are rich in resources with their unique natural landscapes, huge mineral reserves, and a wide variety of medicinal herbs.After the completion of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, it is expected to greatly boost local tourism all along the line, it said.“It will also enhance person-to-person exchanges between different regions and ethnic groups, promote understanding and cultural integration,” Xiong said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-begin-work-on-section-of-sichuan-tibet-railway-near-indian-border/story-HbLgHBN0GY5G8p8DCSpIKM.html
01-11-2020||World||Chinese Communist Party aims complete military modernisation by 2027||The just-concluded key conclave of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) has finalised plans to build a fully modern military on par with the US by 2027, media reports here said.By the year 2027, which marks the centennial of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), China will build a fully modern military, a goal that is in alignment with the national strength and will fulfil the future national defence need, state-run Global Times quoted Chinese analysts as saying on Saturday.The Plenary session of the ruling CPC headed by President Xi Jinping which held a four-day meeting adopted his proposals for the formulation of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2035.While the 14th Five-Year plan envisages massive overhaul of the country’s domestic market to boost consumption in order to reduce China’s reliance on shrinking exports markets, the Vision 2035 visualises a long-term plan, reflecting the development vision of Xi including the military.Politically, Xi’s Vision 2035 plan sparked speculation that he could continue in power for the next 15 years.Xi, 67, has emerged as the CPC’s most powerful leader after its founder Mao Zedong, holding the posts of CPC General Secretary, head of the military besides the presidency with prospects of a life-long tenure.A constitutional amendment in 2018 has removed the two-five-year term limit for the President, which would enable Xi to continue in power for life. His second term as the president is due to end in 2022.According to the Communique of the fifth plenary session of the 19th CPC Central Committee released on Thursday, the country’s national defence capabilities and economic strength should be strengthened at the same time and reach the centennial goal of building a modern military by 2027.The meeting headed by Xi has set a new goal to turn the PLA into a modern military force by 2027, by which time, China aims to build an army on par with that of the US, the Hong Kong based South China Morning Post reported.With the centennial goal of building a modern military by 2027, China aims to develop the military with the capability to defend national sovereignty, safeguard against security threats posed by the hegemonism in western pacific region and protect overseas development interests as China’s overseas economic presence grows, Li Jie, a Beijing-based naval expert, told the Global Times.“The centennial goal is in line with national strength,” Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the tabloid.Hong Kong military analyst Song Zhongping told the Post that the new centennial goal can be interpreted as “putting the PLA as a leading modern force in the world, one that can be on par with the US army”.Sunfei Wu, deputy head of Hong Kong think tank Tianda Institute said this is the first time the Chinese leaders have included the military in such development goals. He said the goal was primarily targeted at Taiwan.“Basically, the target is to build PLA’s capability to match the US army by 2027, so It can effectively deter interference by the US Army around the Taiwan Strait,” he said.Julian Gewirtz, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council for Foreign Relation, said the inclusion of these longer-term goals was significant, “though it is hard to say it means Xi will definitely rule until then”.“It‘s important to note that this Plenum isn’t just discussing the next five-year plan,” he continued. “It’s also building out the vision for 2035, spanning greater technological self-reliance and other goals for economic and social development.Why 2035? The easy answer is that it’s the halfway point between the ‘two centenary goals’ of 2021 and 2049.“Whether or not Xi rules until 2035, this provides a medium-term frame for the actions under way, especially since the next several years will likely remain very challenging for China,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-communist-party-aims-complete-military-modernisation-by-2027/story-V6ltsi8znS5xCbKmCu50fK.html
01-11-2020||World||UK PM calls in army to roll out tests as lockdown looms||As England goes into Lockdown 2 from Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called in the army to help with rolling out a massive testing programme across the UK and believes that there is “realistic hope” of a vaccine for Covid-19 in the first quarter of 2021.The lockdown until December 2 is likely to be extended if it does not lead to lower incidence of the virus, deaths and hospital admissions, senior minister Michael Gove said on Sunday, as retail shops reported busy shopping for essential items before the start of lockdown.Johnson struck a note of optimism as he announced the lockdown: “I am optimistic that this will feel very different and better by the spring. It is not just that we have ever better medicine and therapies, and the realistic hope of a vaccine in the first quarter of next year”.“We now have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable and above all rapid turnaround tests; tests that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within ten to 15 minutes”.“And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests…The army has been brought in to work on the logistics and the programme will begin in a matter of days”, he said.Johnson’s lockdown announcement sparked another round of political jousting, with the opposition Labour reminding him that it had called for a lockdown weeks ago. Labour said it would support the relevant legislation for the second lockdown when it is put to vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday.Chancellor Rishi Sunak extended the furlough scheme for employees running since April for one more month, but business organisations lamented the impact the second lockdown would have on an already challenging environment that has led to major job losses and closures.Sunak said: “Over the past eight months of this crisis we have helped millions of people to continue to provide for their families. But now - along with many other countries around the world - we face a tough winter ahead”.“I have always said that we will do whatever it takes as the situation evolves. Now, as restrictions get tougher, we are taking steps to provide further financial support to protect jobs and businesses. These changes will provide a vital safety net for people across the UK”.Continuing the optimistic note, Johnson told people in a live telecast: “I can tell you tonight that the scientists may be unanimously gloomy about the immediate options.

We are not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April. It is less prohibitive and less restrictive. But from Thursday the basic message is the same: Stay at home. Protect the NHS.

01-11-2020||World||Joe Biden leads Donald Trump in key swing states before election: Report||Democratic nominee Joe Biden narrowly leads President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, Florida, and Arizona -- and by a wider margin in Wisconsin -- according to a set of New York Times/Siena College polls in those four critical swing states that together could decide the US presidential election.Click here for complete coverage of US elections 2020More than 92 million votes have already been cast ahead of the November 3 election, with the US poised for potentially record turnout amid deep partisan divisions and a global pandemic that short-circuited the US economy.The swing state polls found:The margin of error is 3.2 percentage points in Wisconsin and Florida; 3 points in Arizona and 2.4 points in Pennsylvania. The polls sampled more than 1,200 people in each state, and were conducted over a period ranging Oct 26 to Oct 31.Trump carried all four of these states narrowly in 2016, as he won the presidential election over Hillary Clinton despite falling short in the popular vote. Polls show Biden running better than Clinton did four years ago, though analysts say Trump still has a viable path to an election win.That path would likely require Trump winning at least two of the states in the Times polls released today, as well as several other states considered “toss ups” by nonpartisan election handicappers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-leads-donald-trump-in-key-swing-states-before-election-report/story-tTjqy6KTaSX9LopHCZ298K.html

They believe he may have spent time there after travelling from Lampedusa to Bari in early October on a ship used to quarantine migrants, judicial sources said.In Bari, he is believed to have been handed an expulsion order obliging him to leave Italy within a week, the judicial sources said. Investigators are looking into the possibility the suspected attacker stayed in the Sicilian town of Alcamo for a 10 day period, the sources added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/six-in-custody-over-nice-church-attack-in-france/story-KDgjscM6FcNwuV0N1EMmXN.html
01-11-2020||World||Thousands evacuated as super typhoon Goni makes landfall in Philippines||The world’s strongest storm this year killed at least four people and forced about 350,000 to flee their homes as it slammed into the eastern part of the Philippines early Sunday.Super Typhoon Goni brought “catastrophic violent winds” when it made landfall over Catanduanes province before dawn Sunday, before weakening as it crossed the main island of Luzon. It’s expected to be closest to the Philippine capital region late Sunday before exiting land the following day.“Goni is the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone” in history, said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections and co-founder of Weather Underground. The previous record was held by Super Typhoons Meranti and Haiyan, which hit the Philippines in 2016 and 2013 respectively.Goni’s maximum sustained winds have weakened to 175 kilometers an hour, while gusts slowed to 240 kilometers per hour after the typhoon’s third landfall in Quezon province at midday, down from 310 kilometers earlier Sunday, the Philippine weather bureau said in its latest report. Dozens of areas, including Metro Manila, have been placed under storm alert.There have been 347,000 people evacuated, according to Ricardo Jalad, executive director of the Philippines’ disaster risk-monitoring agency. Between 19 million to 31 million people could be affected by the storm, based on the population count in areas within its path, according to Mark Timbal, a spokesman at the Philippines’ disaster risk-monitoring agency.Authorities shut Manila’s international airport to aircraft for 24 hours from 10 a.m. local time, prompting Philippine Airlines and Cebu Air to cancel flights. Light railways in Manila suspended operations while Ayala Land Inc., one of the nation’s biggest builders, said all its shopping malls in Luzon are shut.Health Secretary Francisco Duque asked people to observe social-distancing measures in evacuation centers to prevent the spread of Covid-19. After Indonesia, the Philippines has the highest number of coronavirus infections in Southeast Asia.“The pandemic has made this much more complex, but we have been preparing for this situation,” Richard Gordon, a senator and chairman for Philippine Red Cross, said in a statement.At least four people died in Albay and the province was left without electricity as floods and debris destroyed dikes and washed away houses, Governor Al Francis Bichara said in an interview with DZBB radio. The storm also felled power lines in Quezon, where at least one person is missing, and damage to crops could reach one billion pesos ($21 million), said provincial Governor Danilo Suarez.The cyclone comes days after Typhoon Molave lashed the Southeast Asian nation, leaving at least 22 dead and causing a minimum of 1.8 billion pesos of damage to crops, before heading to Vietnam. Goni is following a similar route.An average of 20 cyclones pass through disaster-prone Philippines every year, which will likely complicate the nation’s fight against the coronavirus as hundreds of thousands of people are evacuated from typhoon-hit areas. In 2013, Haiyan struck the Southeast Asian nation and killed more than 6,300 people.Coconut, rice and corn plantations may suffer severe losses. Typhoon Goni could damage more than 928,000 hectares of land planted with rice and 58,431 hectares of corn, the Department of Agriculture estimates.The storm can have a “high humanitarian impact,” the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System said on its website, adding that nearly 50 million people are at risk.Another typhoon, Atsani, entered the Philippines on Sunday afternoon, the weather bureau said.The Philippines’ first catastrophe bond, which provides $150 million of tropical cyclone disaster insurance protection sourced from the capital markets, may be triggered, according to Artemis, which monitors catastrophe bonds, insurance-linked securities and weather risk markets.“The damage is extensive,” Christopher Dy-Liacco Flores, former mayor of Guinobatan town in Albay, said by Facebook Messenger. Flooding reached 16 feet deep. “Bridges have been washed away, flood control structures destroyed. Electric poles have fallen, roads destroyed and our agriculture is ruined.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-evacuated-as-super-typhoon-goni-makes-landfall-in-philippines/story-JOkohMSfMNtkyWAubBmlDJ.html

Current temporary changes to the congestion charge in central London and restrictions on free travel for those over 60 will remain in place, according to a TfL statement.TfL’s revenue fell 90% at the start of the first Covid-19 lockdown in March. England will start a second lockdown this week and the government has been encouraging those who can work from home to do so since September.Meanwhile, separate discussions on additional costs for the delayed Crossrail project are being progressed in parallel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/transport-for-london-to-receive-usd-2-3-billion-in-government-aid/story-7htqTsCvLFntytqMlmlteP.html
01-11-2020||World||Pope Francis requests patience, solidarity during pandemic times||Pope Francis called for patience and solidarity while criticizing those who complain about restrictive measures during the coronavirus pandemic, according to an interview published Sunday by Serbia-based Politika newspaper.He praised what he called urban heroes “who take responsibility toward others and look for a concrete solution so no one is left behind.”“On the other hand, we have an increase in numbers of those who mercilessly profited from the misfortune of others, those who think only about themselves, who protested or complained about certain restrictive measures, unable to accept that not everyone has the same abilities and resources to face the pandemic,” according to the Serbian-language transcript.“We don’t come out of the crisis the same, we can become better or worse, but never the same,” the pontiff was quoted as saying, warning that all crises can intensify existing injustices but they can also bring out the best in people.Countries trying to salvage their economies risk “forgetting that an authentic development must promote all people and human as a whole.”“We need change. The pandemic brought our organizational and developmental models into a crisis; it exposed many injustices, the troubling silence and social and health failures, subjecting a great number of our brothers to the processes of social exclusion and degradation,” the pope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-requests-patience-solidarity-during-pandemic-times/story-3vxAdxhiaPJAHWTOBvg14H.html

Search-and-rescue teams were working in nine toppled or damaged buildings in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city, but appeared to be finding more bodies Sunday than survivors.Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised the death toll Sunday in Izmir to 58. Two teenagers were killed Friday on Samos and at least 19 others were injured.There was some debate over the magnitude of the earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey rated it 7.0, while the Istanbul’s Kandilli Institute put it at 6.9 and Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (AFAD) said it measured 6.6.Ahmet Citim, 70, was pulled out of the rubble in the middle of the night and was hospitalized. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted that Citim said: “I never lost hope.” The minister visited the survivor and said he was doing well.The quake triggered a small tsunami that hit Samos and the Seferihisar district of Izmir, drowning one elderly woman. The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul, as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Hundreds of aftershocks followed. Turkey’s disaster agency said 920 people were injured in Turkey alone.Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said 26 badly damaged buildings would be demolished.“It’s not the earthquake that kills but buildings,” he added, repeating a common slogan.Turkey has a mix of older buildings and cheap or illegal construction, which can lead to serious damage and deaths when earthquakes hit. Regulations have been tightened in light of earthquakes to strengthen or demolish buildings and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities but it is not happening fast enough.Two destroyed apartment buildings in Izmir where much of the rescues are taking place had received reports of “decay” in 2012 and 2018, according to the municipal agency in charge of such certificates. Turkish media including the Hurriyet newspaper said one of the buildings, which was built in 1993, was at risk of earthquake damage because of its low quality concrete and the lack of reinforcements. However, the building continued to be occupied.Turkey’s justice minister said prosecutors had begun investigating several collapsed buildings and promised legal repercussions if experts identified neglect.AFAD said nearly 6,400 personnel had been activated for rescue work and hundreds of others for food distribution, emergency help and building damage control.Turkey is criss-crossed by fault lines and is prone to earthquakes. In 1999, two powerful quakes killed some 18,000 people in northwestern Turkey. Earthquakes are frequent in Greece as well.In a rare show of unity amid months of tense relations over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean, Greek and Turkish government officials have issued mutual messages of solidarity over the quake toll.The quake occurred as Turkey was already struggling with an economic downturn and the coronavirus pandemic. So far, Turkey has more than 10,000 confirmed virus deaths but some experts have accused the government of concealing the true impact of the virus with the way it counts infections.___Bilginsoy reported from Istanbul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/70-year-old-pulled-out-alive-in-turkey-as-earthquake-toll-hits-60/story-9sMXd3YWThjq4PoKkYFusM.html

Should those trials succeed a third stage with 30,000 volunteers is scheduled for April/May.“We are in the final stretch,” said Shmuel Shapira, Director General of the Israel Institute for Biological Research.The institute, which is overseen by the Defence Ministry, began animal trials for its “BriLife” vaccine in March and announced a week ago it had received regulatory approval to take it to the next stage.Shmuel Yitzhaki, head of the institute’s biology division, told Reuters that if all goes well the vaccine could reach the general population by the end of next summer.While the first batch of volunteers received the potential vaccine, around the country elementary students returned to school as a second nationwide lockdown comes to a gradual end.Restrictions in Israel, with a population of 9 million, are being slowly lifted following a steady decline in the rate of daily infections.First through fourth graders were the first to return to school on Sunday. Older kids are still learning from home.The government also approved the reopening in stages of businesses and recreational activities.The country reported 674 new cases on Friday - down from a peak of more than 9,000 several weeks ago.

01-11-2020||World||Imran Khan announces provincial status for Gilgit-Baltistan despite anger at home, opposition from India||Despite protests in the country and strong opposition from India, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday officially announced the provincial status of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), which New Delhi asserts is part of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Khan used the occasion to blame India for the Shia-Sunni sectarian violence in the country, saying “the most racist government” was in power there.New Delhi had strongly protested Pakistan’s move to make GB its fifth province and to hold legislative elections there later this month, asserting that Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of India, and Pakistan had “no locus standi on territories illegally and forcibly occupied it.”Khan said that his government had taken the decision to turn the region into a province, “keeping in mind the UN Security Council’s resolutions.”GB, formerly Northern Areas, was earlier governed, with only limited autonomy, by the “Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order of 2009”. Pakistan is facing strong domestic opposition from groups that accuse it of systematically exploiting GB of its resources and sharing no dividends with them. Any resistance is met with brutal government reprisal, with activists and leaders hounded, arrested and tortured.Maulana Fazlur Rehman, chief of Pakistan’s 11-party opposition alliance, the Pakistan Democratic Movement, is among opponents of Pakistan’s GB move. “A deal has been made over the blood of Kashmiris... Business is being done in the name of Kashmir diplomacy,” the cleric had said earlier and pledged “not to allow the partition of Kashmir”.In his speech on Sunday, Khan said he could not announce or talk about development packages for the newly carved province given the upcoming local elections.He said that special efforts were being taken to connect GB to the rest of Pakistan as the area had suffered due to poor connectivity.“You will see in the coming days, our development plans will go there [backward areas],” he said.Replying to criticism of the army by the opposition, Imran Khan said he could not stress enough the importance of a strong army for a nation’s security. “Pakistan is secure today because of its armed forces,” he said.“Our army is the main reason why we haven’t suffered the same fate as many other Muslim countries.”He praised the country’s intelligence agencies “for rendering ineffective India’s conspiracies to spread anarchy in the country.”(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-announces-provincial-status-for-gilgit-baltistan-despite-anger-at-home-opposition-from-india/story-589JQ9iMb9JlbS2Ix6ittN.html
01-11-2020||World||Europe’s coronavirus woes multiply with leaders drifting to lockdowns||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson became Europe’s latest leader to retreat from a no-lockdown pledge, faced with a virus pandemic that’s wreaking havoc on government plans and derailing an economic recovery.A one-month stay-at-home policy for all of England will take effect Thursday, with waivers for schools, universities and essential stores, Johnson said on Saturday as UK cases surpassed 1 million. Germany and France imposed similar partial shutdowns this week.Austria, Greece and Portugal followed the example of the European Union’s two big economic powers on Saturday with expanded shutdowns for November. Leaders across the region are seeking to beat back the virus surge before the end-of-year holiday season in Europe, where more than 215,000 have died and nearly 7 million have been infected.“Christmas is going to be different this year, perhaps very different,” Johnson told a news conference. “But it’s my sincere hope and belief that by taking tough action now, we can allow families across the country to be together.”Bars, restaurants, leisure facilities and cultural venues have to close in Germany starting Monday, while schools and most shops can remain open. France began its version of “lockdown lite” on Friday.Belgium is closing all non-essential stores and curtailing family visits to avoid crashing its health-care system. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, intent on avoiding a national lockdown, expanded economic aid for businesses and tightened restrictions in population centers.With protests multiplying and political unity fraying, officials had been trying to avoid the sweeping restrictions that plunged the continent into recession in the spring.Here’s the latest from the UK, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Greece, Portugal and Austria:UKJohnson announced a partial lockdown for England, seeking to contain a resurgent coronavirus outbreak that’s spreading faster than the government’s worst-case projections and threatening to strain the National Health Service.Furloughed workers will be eligible for state payments covering as much as 80% of wages through the new lockdown period, Johnson said, extending assistance that was due to end this weekend and be replaced by a less generous program.The lockdown will start on Thursday, pending a vote in Parliament, and last until at least early December, Johnson said.“We’re not going back to the full-scale lockdown of March and April,” he said. “The measures that I’ve outlined are less prohibitive, less restrictive. But I’m afraid from Thursday, the basic message is the same: stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”Cases in the UK, where pandemic policy is controlled separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, increased by almost 22,000 on Saturday. Britain’s Europe-leading death toll of more than 46,000 compares with about 36,600 deaths in France, which has a similar population.GermanyChancellor Angela Merkel and business leaders will discuss easing the burden on industry on Wednesday.“We need to do everything in our power to get the infection numbers under control” while protecting jobs, Merkel said in her weekly podcast.Merkel announced measures this week to severely limit movement, while keeping schools open and the economy ticking over. Germany is in a “dramatic situation,” with health-care services stretched close to the limit and authorities no longer able to track infections back to the source, Merkel said.If Germany waits until intensive care units are full, it will be too late, she said, warning of “four long and difficult winter months” ahead. More than 19,000 new cases were reported on Friday, the second-highest daily number yet.Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Friday the government still expects growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter.Merkel is struggling to retain control over the crisis. An address she made Thursday in parliament was repeatedly interrupted by heckling from opposition lawmakers as she condemned “lies and disinformation, conspiracy and hate.”FranceFrance’s goal is to limit the economic contraction to 15 per cent during the latest lockdown, about half of the 30% decline during the one that started in March, according to Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.That was caused in particular by a halt to construction work, while this time building sites and stores selling building materials will remain open, as well as government services handling permits.The new curbs were announced less than a week after France expanded a curfew to about two-thirds of the population.“The virus is circulating in France at a speed that even the most pessimistic forecast didn’t foresee,” President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday in an address to the nation.On Friday, France reported the most new deaths since April 20, the same day the first lockdown went into effect.ItalyItaly, which has been under a partial lockdown for the last week, could decide a ban on travel between regions and close shopping malls at weekends from Tuesday, local media reported Sunday. Milan, Naples, Genoa and Turin are among cities that could face harsher restrictions, with regional authorities empowered to impose “mini lockdowns,” according to Corriere della Sera and La Stampa.Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will speak to parliament on the virus situation on Monday, followed by an evening cabinet meeting that is expected to approve the new curbs.Hospitals risk collapsing in three weeks if the outbreak doesn’t slow down, according to a report by La Repubblica. Other potential measures under consideration include closing restaurants and bars altogether from their current 6:00 p.m. curfew, and making online classes compulsory from eighth grade. Conte said at an online forum Saturday that keeping schools open will be a challenge.Italy has already set an 11 p.m. curfew, curtailed operating hours for restaurants and bars, and shut down gyms, swimming pools and entertainment venues.Reported new cases exceeded 30,000 Saturday, with almost 300 dead.SpainA majority of Spain’s 17 regions have already closed their domestic borders or will do so this week, preventing non-essential travel.Targeted regional lockdowns will remain in force until after Nov. 9, and cover consecutive bank-holiday weekends, which would typically lead to massive flows of travelers moving across the country.Regional authorities have extraordinary powers to declare curbs on movement after Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced a state of emergency on Oct. 25. Spain this week reported more than 9,000 daily coronavirus infections on two consecutive days, the most since tracking started.GreeceResidents of Greece will face tighter restrictions during November, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said as the country recorded a record 2,056 new cases on Saturday.The country will be divided into high-risk and under-surveillance zones. In high-risk areas, including the capital Athens, restaurants, bars, cinemas, museums, theaters and gyms will close, though people will still be allowed to move among regions. Industry, schools, retail shops, hotels and hair salons will remain open nationwide. A nighttime curfew will start half an hour earlier at midnight, Mitsotakis said.PortugalPortugal extended restrictions to more regions, including its capital Lisbon, as the government tries to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic while keeping shops and restaurants open.Starting Nov. 4, restrictions that were already in place in three municipalities of northern Portugal will apply to a total of 121 districts that have reported more virus cases, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said at a press conference Saturday night in Lisbon. These locations are home to about 70% of Portugal’s population of 10 million, including the greater Lisbon and Oporto regions.Shops will have to close by 10 pm and restaurants by 10:30 pm. In addition, employees should work remotely when possible.AustriaAustrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz joined his peers in giving up on more-limited measures. A partial lockdown he unveiled Saturday is similar to neighboring Germany’s, with schools and non-essential stores open and restrictions on staying home applying only at night.Restaurants, cafes and hotels will close except for takeout and for business travelers. Gyms, cinemas and theaters will be shuttered. The rules take effect Tuesday through the end of November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-s-coronavirus-woes-multiply-with-leaders-drifting-to-lockdowns/story-RiAYm92NNMeLOB8yJRgVQN.html
01-11-2020||World||Pak PM Imran Khan gives provisional provincial status to Gilgit-Baltistan||The Pakistan government has given Gilgit-Baltistan “provisional provincial status”, Prime Minister Imran Khan announced on Sunday, adding another twist to the ongoing controversy over the region claimed by India as part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. Khan made the announcement while addressing a gathering in Gilgit to mark the so-called “independence day” of Gilgit-Baltistan. He also attacked the Indian government, accusing it of trying to foment unrest in Pakistan and creating a divide between the Shia and Sunni communities. “I want to greet the people of Gilgit-Baltistan today because we have decided that Gilgit-Baltistan will be given provisional provincial status, which was their demand for long,” Khan said, speaking in Urdu. “We have made this decision while keeping in mind the UN Security Council resolutions. We made the decision in between the UN Security Council resolutions But I know this was a long-standing demand of the youth here and I greet them today,” he said. He did not give further details or say when Gilgit-Baltistan would become Pakistan’s fifth province. Khan also said his government had a development package in mind for the region but that he couldn’t announce details because of the elections to be held on November 15. Khan highlighted the importance of a strong military for Pakistan in the face of what he described as a campaign by the Indian government to foment unrest across Pakistan and to create a split between the Sunni majority and Shia minority. He also said it was necessary for Pakistan to have a strong military in view of the oppression of the Kashmiri people by the Indian government following the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5 last year. He also accused the Indian government of oppressing the country’s Muslims through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). He praised Pakistan’s intelligence agencies for foiling what he said were India’s moves to create unrest at a time when opposition parties were making plans to discredit the military and judiciary. Khan particularly defended army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed from attacks by the opposition parties. Referring to PML-N leader Ayaz Sadiq’s remarks that Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, shot down in a dogfight during the military standoff triggered by the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019, was freed by Pakistan because of fears of an impending attack by India, Khan said the opposition leaders were “speaking like [Indian Prime Minister] Narendra Modi”. There was no immediate response to Khan’s remarks from Indian officials. When reports first emerged in September of Pakistan’s plans to make Gilgit-Baltistan that country’s fifth province, India had said such an action would have “no legal basis whatsoever” as the region had been militarily occupied. The Pakistan government plans to make the region a full-fledged province with constitutional rights such as representation in both houses of Parliament. The move reportedly has the backing of Pakistan’s powerful military establishment. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party is banking on the move to boost its chances in the elections. “Any action by Pakistan to alter the status of the militarily occupied so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’ has no legal basis whatsoever and is totally void ab-initio,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in September. The Pakistan government’s move comes two years after powers of the Islamabad-controlled council for Gilgit-Baltistan were transferred to a local assembly. In 2009, the Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order renamed the Northern Areas as Gilgit-Baltistan and the region was given province-like status but without representation in Parliament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-gives-provisional-provincial-status-to-gilgit-baltistan/story-O5mtkrQDQLh1VtSgF2yoaJ.html
01-11-2020||World||Donald Trump focused on feeding his ego, did not take Covid-19 pandemic seriously, says Barack Obama||Former US president Barack Obama has accused his successor Donald Trump of focusing on feeding his ego, saying he did not take the significant problem of the coronavirus pandemic seriously and had time to worry about other things.Click here for complete coverage of US elections 2020 Making a last pitch on Saturday to get his former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden elected as the next occupant of the White House, Obama during rallies in Michigan said Trump in the last four years has not shown any interest in helping any of his countrymen except himself. “President Trump is focused on feeding his ego, while the Democratic presidential candidate Biden focused on decency and empathy,” Obama said. Obama, who was the 44th US president, blasted Trump for his policies and rhetoric. “He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself or his friends or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show to give him the attention that he craves. But unfortunately, the rest of us have to live with the consequences,” he said. Obama was joined by Biden at both the Flint and Detroit rallies in Michigan, a battleground State. “I can tell you that the presidency doesn’t change who you are. It shows who are you. It reveals who you are. And for eight years, Joe was the last one in the room when I made a big decision,” he said. Obama praised 77-year-old Biden and said: “Biden is my brother. I love Joe Biden. And he will be a great president and he treats everyone with dignity and with respect”. “That sense of decency and empathy, the belief in hard work and family and faith, the belief that everyone counts, that is who Joe is and that is who he will be as president,” Obama said. Biden “made me a better president,” he added. “He has got the character and the experience to make us a better country. And he and Kamala (Harris) are going to be in the fight, not for themselves, but for every single one of us. And we sure can’t say that about the President we have got right now,” he said. Obama,59, alleged that Trump,74, is doing reality show in the White House. “You know when a country is going through a pandemic that’s not what you’re supposed to be worrying about,” he said. “And that’s the difference between Biden and Trump right there. Trump cares about feeding his ego. Joe cares about keeping you and your family safe. And he’s less interested in feeding his ego with having big crowds than he is making sure he’s not going around making more and more people sick. That’s what you should expect from a president,” he asserted. Also Read | Vote Donald Trump out of presidency; has divided, failed America: Joe Biden “What is his obsession, by the way, with crowd size? You notice that? This is the one measure he has of success. He’s still worried about his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine. It really bugged him. He’s still talking about that. Did nobody come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Is he traumatized? What’s with crowds?” he asked. “The lifeblood of a campaign is not rallies, it’s not TV ads, it is people willing to, you know, take a clipboard, talk to their neighbours and talk to their friends and talk to their co workers. Let folks know what the stakes are. And this kind of grassroots work and organising. Makes all the difference especially in an election, like this, where the stakes are so high,” Obama said. Obama said there was a need to revive the pandemic-hit economy again and it could be done well once Biden was elected. “We know that change is possible, but it’s not guaranteed. And if we care deeply about restoring a sense of decency to our federal government, a government that’s going to look out for ordinary people, that is gonna take this pandemic seriously and get on top of it so we can not only save lives, but also make our economy healthy again,” he said. “If we want a nation that is living up to its values, and its ideals so that, we set an example for the world. If we care about climate change and making sure that our criminal justice system is free of racial bias. Then we’re gonna have to work for it. And we’ve just got a few more days to make that happen,” he added. Obama said Biden understands his responsibilities. “And the other person who makes me hopeful is somebody I served with for eight years. Was in the room before I made any big decision, a person of character, a person of decency, a person of kindness. “A person who understands the solemn responsibilities you take on when you become president of the US, somebody who’s going to put you first. My friend, I could not be prouder to support him, and I could not be prouder. I hope in a few days to be able to call him Mr President,” Obama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-focused-on-feeding-his-ego-did-not-take-covid-19-pandemic-seriously-says-barack-obama/story-nO01DYcwkYwmCN5fakzMJM.html
01-11-2020||World||China starts once-a-decade census data collection exercise||Millions of census-takers began knocking on doors across China on Sunday for a once-a-decade head count of the world’s largest population that for the first time will use mobile apps to help crunch the massive numbers.Around seven million community workers and volunteers will drive the two-month data-collection effort, visiting homes ranging from residential skyscrapers in downtown Shanghai to remote Tibetan mountain villages.China conducts the census every ten years to determine population growth, movement patterns and other trends, using the findings to apportion resources for education, health, transportation, labour, elderly care and other services.The previous tally in 2010 counted 1,339,724,852 persons, an increase of 5.83 percent, or 73,899,804 people -- equal to adding more than the population of France over 10 years.Much of the attention on this year’s census -- expected to take two years to fully compile -- will focus on whether it indicates any population bump from China’s relaxation of its former “one-child policy”.The policy was introduced in the late 1970s to slow rapid population growth amid concerns over too many mouths to feed, but was relaxed four years ago to allow two children due to fears over China’s fast-ageing society and shrinking workforce.But the change has not yet resulted in a baby boom.The national birth rate last year was the slowest since the founding of Communist-ruled China in 1949, with many Chinese today choosing smaller families amid rising living costs.The government estimates the 2020 census could update the population to 1.42 billion, a 5.99 percent increase.A research institute affiliated with real estate giant Evergrande Group last week issued a study saying the government figure was an overestimate, and recommended that three children be allowed.“If adjustments are not made, it will seriously affect national rejuvenation and (China’s) rise as a great power,” the researchers said, citing two of the stated goals of powerful President Xi Jinping.‘Big Brother’ fearsThe study sparked a passionate online discussion, with many saying the real curbs on childbirth are rising costs and insufficient policy support for families.“Even a ten-child policy is useless until we create a society that is childbirth-friendly and childrearing-friendly,” said one widely “liked” comment on the WeChat platform of Chinese internet giant Tencent.Demographic experts have estimated it could take 15 years for the two-child policy to have any noticeable effect as other modern factors mitigate against rapid growth, including increasingly empowered Chinese women delaying or avoiding childbirth, and the slower population growth that comes with rising national affluence.Despite the door-to-door visits, most citizens are expected to enter their information via a smartphone app, adding to rising concerns about privacy protection.Vast amounts of Chinese economic activity and payments are handled through digital apps such as WeChat and its rival Alipay, offered by Alibaba-affiliated Ant Group.Many consumers accept the resulting surrender of data on their buying habits, travel, and other personal information as a small price to pay for digital conveniences. But others increasingly worry over privacy and data security, heightened further this year with China’s introduction of a nationwide system of digital “health codes” that score citizens on whether they pose a potential coronavirus threat and which must be shown to enter many public venues.The National Statistics Bureau, which oversees the census, vowed in May that all personal data gathered during the process will be kept strictly confidential and used for no other purpose than the census.The government in mid-October also separately unveiled a draft personal data protection law, which outlines stiff punishments for violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-starts-once-a-decade-census-data-collection-exercise/story-xqEaJt15HYuYU6G1THVasI.html
01-11-2020||World||Tropical Storm Eta expected to become hurricane by Monday||Forecasters expect the newly-formed Tropical Storm Eta to become a hurricane by Monday, shortly after the system formed in the Caribbean and tied the record for more named storms in a single Atlantic hurricane season.The system had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) early Sunday, the US National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. It was centered 205 miles (330 kilometers) south-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and 500 miles (805 kilometers) east of Cabo Gracias a Dios on the Nicaragua/Honduras border.Forecasters expect Eta to become a hurricane by Monday. The system is forecast to be near the northeastern coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras by Tuesday morning. A hurricane watch was issued for parts of both countries. Eta was moving west at about 15 mph (24 kph).Rainfall totals could reach 15 inches (38 centimeters) in parts of Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and the southern coast of Hispaniola by Thursday evening. Local amounts of up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) could fall in portions of Honduras and Nicaragua, forecasters said.Eta is the 28th named Atlantic storm this season, tying the 2005 record for named storms. However, this is the first time the Greek letter Eta is being used as a storm name because in 2005, after the season ended meteorologists went back and determined there was a storm that should have gotten a name, but didn’t.Hurricane season still has a month to go, ending November 30. And in 2005, Zeta formed in the end of December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-eta-expected-to-become-hurricane-by-monday/story-vvrMfKvqQLTzlIWmfQHm8O.html

Talking at a National Security Council meeting, she instructed the government to bolster self-defence capabilities and stabilise economic and social order, along with increased intelligence gathering, reported Taipei Times.“The nation should modernize its defense capabilities, upgrade its asymmetric combat capabilities, promote indigenous arms development, and reform its reserve forces to brace for Beijing’s military expansion and aggression,” said Tsai.She also instructed the council, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the US to maintain the support of both the Democratic Party, as well as the Republicans. Tsai advised the government to toe the line of Premier Su Tseng-chang who is working on Taiwan-US Economic and Commercial Dialogue, bilateral trade agreement, and negotiations with the US regarding the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in the light of Taiwan-US meetings about the TIFA that is suspended since 2017. “The Cabinet should take advantage of the Taiwan-US framework for strengthening basic infrastructure financing and market-building cooperation signed in September to promote supply chain cooperation in New Southbound Policy countries, as well as, Central and South American countries,” said Tsai at the council meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tsai-ing-wen-stresses-improved-relations-with-the-us/story-9cSICLuMrxvNTfYsDUH4XO.html

This comes following Saudi Arabia removing Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan from Pakistan’s map. Massive protests have been taking place against the Imran Khan-led government over the issue of Gilgit Baltistan.This announcement is likely to spark massive outrage as it will have much wider implications which will set the tone for exacerbating tensions, that is already being played out in the east along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the India-China border.On October 8, in Muzaffarabad city of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), a massive protest was organised by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front and Student Liberation Front against the government’s decision to make Gilgit-Baltistan a province. Political activists said that they will sacrifice themselves but will not let Pakistan alter the status of the region. People from Gilgit-Baltistan, who have been living in other Pakistani towns, have also taken to the streets against Islamabad’s arbitrary decision.Gilgit- Baltistan, earlier known as Northern Areas has been governed by the “Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order of 2009”, which established an electoral framework. Elections have been held in the region under the Order that provides for only limited autonomy.The people accuse Pakistan of systematically exploiting the region of its resources and sharing no dividends with them. Any resistance they say meets brutal government reprisal with activists and leaders hounded, arrested and tortured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-grants-provisional-provincial-status-to-gilgit-baltistan-amid-massive-protests/story-hTYjKQpKv5EqV97ocrGq5K.html

It was blowing west toward densely populated regions, including Manila, and rain-soaked provinces still recovering from a typhoon that hit a week ago and left at least 22 dead.There were initial reports of deaths, including a man who was reportedly pinned by a fallen tree in Albay province, but authorities said they were still verifying the details.About two hours after it blew ashore, the typhoon battered Albay with a slightly weaker sustained winds but more powerful gusts of 310 kph (193 mph), forecasters said.Diane Joco scrambled with her husband, parents, siblings and cousin out of their flimsy houses on stilts on the shores of Calauag town in Quezon province when the wind began to batter their wooden homes. Goni was forecast to hit parts of Quezon Sunday afternoon.Like many villagers, Joco and relatives decided not to evacuate and stayed in a neighbor’s sturdier house close to the coast to watch over their home.“We should be nearby to be able to repair any damage to our house quickly, otherwise it will fall apart and be blown away. We have no other house,” Joco told The Associated Press by phone. She suddenly yelled as she spoke, saying a part of the tin roof of her neighbor’s house was nearly ripped off by a frightening gust.Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara told a televised meeting of top disaster-response officials that at least two people died in his province while mudflows from Mayon volcano endangered some villagers. Other officials, however, said they were still checking those reports.Ricardo Jalad, who heads the government’s disaster-response agency, said the typhoon’s destructive force can cause major damage. “There are so many people who are really in vulnerable areas,” he said.The Philippine weather agency reinforced those concerns, saying that within the next 12 hours, people will experience “catastrophic violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall associated with the region of the eyewall and inner rain bands.”Residents have been warned of likely landslides, massive flooding, storm surges of up to 5 meters (16 feet) and powerful winds that can blow away shanties.One of the most powerful typhoons in the world this year, Goni has evoked memories of Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, which left more than 7,300 people dead and missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.Jalad said nearly a million people have been pre-emptively moved into emergency shelters. He warned of storm surges that could inundate coastal villages, including in Manila Bay.Forecasters said the typhoon’s eye may pass about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of metropolitan Manila, the sprawling capital of more than 13 million people, around nightfall on Sunday.Manila’s main airport was ordered shut down for 24 hours from Sunday to Monday and airlines canceled dozens of international and domestic flights. The military and national police, along with the coast guard, have been put on full alert.Hundreds of Covid-19 patients were moved to hospitals and hotels from tent quarantine centers, Jalad said. The war-like typhoon preparations will further strain government resources, which have been drained by months of coronavirus outbreaks. The Philippines has the second-largest number of confirmed infections in Southeast Asia.The Philippines is lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year. It’s also located in the so-called Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common and makes the poor Southeast Asian nation one of the world’s most disaster-prone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/super-typhoon-goni-batters-philippines-1-million-in-shelters/story-xbaCpg71OrubJa7ljYGVXL.html

The island nation has so far recorded 10,663 Covid-19 cases and 20 deaths due to the disease.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 Health Ministry spokesman Dr Jayaruwan Bandara on Saturday said the main PCR testing machine at the Base Hospital in Mulleriyawa that can test 500-1,000 samples daily broke down earlier this week. Foreign technical experts are rectifying the fault of the malfunctioning machine and it would resume operation soon. Sri Lanka possesses 25 PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) test machines, which can test 8,000 samples daily. However, the breakdown of the PCR machine at the Base Hospital has hindered the detection of Covid-19 patients. Over 26,000 tests have been carried out so far in this laboratory. The laboratory, dedicated for Covid-19 testing, was built at a cost Rs 246 million with assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).The breakdown has resulted in the backlog of 20,000 PCR tests by Thursday, with a delay of about five days to release test results. “There is a delay in test reports, but it does not mean that the process has come to a halt,” Bandara said. He said the country lacks a fully automated testing system. “All tests are being done manually, virus separation takes about three hours and it takes another two hours to analyse the report. Then the printing -- all these take time,” he said, explaining the reason for the delay. Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy here said on Saturday that technical experts, who were rushed to Lanka from China, have identified the technical fault of the malfunctioning PCR testing machine after a 10-hour operation. The experts concluded that the machine would able to resume operation on Monday. Bandara said the nationwide coronavirus tally crossing the 10,000-mark is an indicator that public needs to be more aware to practice health safety measures to avoid the pandemic being spread further. Two big clusters, detected last month, have reported over 7,000 cases so far, he said. Bandara ruled out a nationwide lockdown again and said the public must help themselves and others by restricting their movements. The 72-hour quarantine curfew imposed on Western province -- which is also home to the capital, Colombo -- will also end on Monday, he said. Sri Lanka imposed a three-month lockdown until the end of June, with authorities lifting the restrictions after declaring that there was no community transmission of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-faces-tough-time-due-to-breakdown-of-key-pcr-machine-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases/story-LUcsN9l7X7on7iUASEuT8H.html

After Covid-19 disease broke out last year and was termed a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March, pharma companies from around the world joined the race to be the first to bring out a vaccine.  Health officials too, have made forward-looking statements on the vaccine, but they have been less definitive that those made by pharma companies.Also Read: India’s daily Covid-19 count falls further, active cases remain below 6 lakhAccording to CNN, American physicist Dr Francis Collins, director of National Institutes of Health, told mediapersons that while he remains “cautiously optimistic” that the United States could have a Covid-19 vaccine authorised by the end of the year, there was a possibility that “it might take longer”.Top US infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci had on Thursday based his assumption that initial doses of effective and safe Covid-19 vaccine could be available by December-end on current projections from pharma giants Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc.Pfizer had for weeks said it would know by October whether the vaccine it was producing was effective or not, but on Tuesday, according to news agency AFP, CEO Albert Bourla said the company still had not reached key benchmarks in assessing vaccine efficacy.  “We could supply some 40 million doses in the US in 2020 if clinical testing proceeds as expected,” he added.Also Read: England to enter into new month-long lockdown as UK virus cases pass 1 millionIn another such example, Oxford researcher Dr Adrian Hill told CNN that the vaccine being developed by his university and British firm AstraZeneca would be out by September. ”My guess is July would be good. August more likely. Might be September,” he said. ”We’re aiming for September but hoping to finish before that,” he said. Phase 3 trials of the vaccine are currently underway. Meanwhile, Moderna says it is on track to report early data from a late-stage trial of its Covid-19 vaccine in November. The pharma company is developing a vaccine called mRNA and says it expects to produce 20 million doses by the end of next year 2021.Covid-19 cases have crossed the 46 million-mark worldwide, according to the real-time statistics provider website worldometer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-predictions-of-pharma-companies-that-didn-t-come-true/story-Grx5OHIUufS0WM0vLjOjjO.html
01-11-2020||World||Donald Trump signs order to protect hydraulic fracking||US President Donald Trump on Saturday announced that he has signed an order to protect the American energy industry and hydraulic fracturing.“Just signed an order to protect fracking and the oil and gas industry. This means jobs, low energy bills, and continued American energy independence! Sleepy Joe [Biden] would ban fracking and destroy American energy jobs! He has no clue!” Trump tweeted.Trump said that hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, has become “one of the great success stories of our time,” opening up new sources of inexpensive and reliable energy and producing more jobs for Americans. In a memorandum released by the White House, Trump said, “As a result of new technologies and my Administration’s continued push for energy independence, our country recently became a net energy exporter for the first time since 1952, as well as the leading producer of oil and natural gas in the world. We are no longer beholden to foreign countries upon which we had depended for decades for the survival of our way of life.” According to a report from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), the use of fracking and other innovations had lowered energy prices thus saving US consumers USD 203 billion per year, or USD 2,500 in annual savings for a family of four.“This memorandum sets forth policies related to protecting American jobs, economic opportunities, and national security by ensuring appropriate support of hydraulic fracturing and other innovative technologies for the use of domestic natural resources, including energy resources. In support of these policies, this memorandum directs certain officials to assess the potential effects of efforts to ban or restrict the use of such technologies,” the White House said.In the memorandum, Trump stated that the lower energy prices that are the result of fracking benefit mostly low-income households in the US as they spend a larger share of their income on energy bills. “The CEA estimated that greater productivity had reduced the domestic price of natural gas by 63 per cent as of 2018; had led to a 45 per cent decrease in the wholesale price of electricity; and had reduced the global price of oil by 10 per cent as of 2019,” Trump’s memorandum reads.Trump has been a strong supporter of the oil industry in the United States. This election year he has criticized his Democratic rival Joe Biden for wanting to ban fracking, Sputnik reported. Biden, in the last presidential debate, had said he would not ban fracking if elected, but later mentioned he would eventually like to make a transition from the oil industry to clean energy production.The US Presidential elections are to be held on November 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-signs-order-to-protect-hydraulic-fracking/story-wWQ9LrzLgHNjeXHQR2gOxJ.html

01-11-2020||World||Vote Donald Trump out of presidency; has divided, failed America: Joe Biden||Democratic Presidential candidate Joe Biden has urged the Americans to vote out President Donald Trump of presidency, alleging he has divided and failed the nation in the last four years. Trump, a Republican, is being challenged by Biden in the November 3 elections.“In three days, we can put an end to a presidency that has divided this nation. In three days, we can put an end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation. In three days, we can put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation,” Biden made in a passionate appeal at a drive in car rally in Detroit, Michigan, a battleground State.Biden said he was quite confident this time that Americans would vote Trump out of power. “Millions of Americans have already voted. Millions more will vote in the days ahead. And my message to you is simple: The power to change this country is in your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries. There is nothing that is going to stop the people of this nation from voting,” he said.Asserting that when America votes, America will be heard, Biden said that when America is heard, he believes the message is going to be loud and clear. “It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We’re done with the chaos. The tweets. The anger. The hate. The failure. The irresponsibility,” said the former vice president, launching a scathing attack against Trump.“We’ve got a lot of work to do. And if I’m elected your president, we’re going to do it. We’re going to act. We’re going to act to get Covid under control,” he said.Biden mocked at Trump, saying he was laughed by the world when spoke last time at the UN. “The President likes to portrays himself as a tough guy, a macho man. But when’s the last time you saw the President of the United States literally being laughed at by world leaders when he spoke at the United Nations? When’s the last time you saw a President of the United States being openly mocked by our allies at a NATO conference?” he asked.“And can you believe we have a President who acts like Vladimir Putin’s puppy? Putin put bounties on the heads of American soldiers serving in Afghanistan and Trump was too scared to challenge him. Donald Trump is not strong. He’s weak,” Biden charged.Alleging that Trump commands virtually no respect on the international stage, Biden said that this is a President who not only doesn’t understand sacrifice, he doesn’t understand the courage, the physical courage it takes to serve in uniform.Earlier in the day, he gave an identical speech in Flint, Michigan. “We have to vote to meet the climate crisis. Donald Trump calls it a hoax. I see it as jobs and health and safety,” he said. “The impacts of climate change too often fall disproportionately on communities of colour. We’ll make sure these communities benefit from hundreds of billions in federal investments in infrastructure and climate change. That will create local jobs to rebuild roads, fill the sidewalk cracks, install broadband, and create spaces to live, work, and play safely,” he added.Biden said that it makes a gigantic difference, once volunteering.“That’s how you win campaigns, every campaign that I’ve ever been in that I’ve won it’s been the folks who’ve been doing everything from making the phone calls, to sending out the petitions to knocking on doors...I mean you make a gigantic difference,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vote-donald-trump-out-of-presidency-has-divided-failed-america-joe-biden/story-ZtPHGcYaNrMLo4InCIQLHI.html
01-11-2020||World||President Trump protected US Constitution; can revive economy after pandemic, say his supporters||President Donald Trump has protected the US Constitution, ensured freedom of religion and expression of speech in America, his supporters in two adjoining battleground States of Ohio and Pennsylvania have said, emphasising that it is only him who can create jobs and revive the country’s economy after the pandemic.Many of the supporters, including a large number of women and small business owners, on Saturday argued that Trump is not influenced by anyone and has taken a strong stand against countries like China and Mexico to save America’s interest.“He is a Constitutional president. He just loves America. He did not have do this. He is a billionaire. He could have just retired and gone away. And instead, he is doing this all for us to keep us free,” Mexcine, a strong supporter of Trump, told PTI at the Pittsburgh-Butler Regional Airport, where Trump addressed one of his four rallies in Pennsylvania on Saturday.Trump, a Republican, is being challenged by his Democratic rival Joe Biden in the November 3 election.Mexine alleged that Biden has done nothing for the last 47 years, and puts fear into people instead of promise. “A lot of Americans don’t do well when they are frightened,” Mexcine said, adding that she would like President Trump to work towards keeping the country ‘more united’ and ‘keep doing what he is doing’ in the next term.Kane, another Trump supporter, said: “He has done so much for the country, while being in the office. Him being a billionaire, he just doesn’t have to do this. He cares about the country. He does not lie. He is not lying to us like the other side. And he values life. He is pro-life”.She disputed the argument on Trump’s tax return. “This job has nothing to do with his tax returns. He does not even take a salary being a president. He gives this to charity, she said. The New York Times had reported in September, claiming that the Republican leader paid USD 750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017, and also he avoided federal taxes for years. At the same time Kanne acknowledged that the country is divided more than it was four years ago. “I do not know why. I believe, it is the other side who is dividing it,” she alleged.Craig Roberts, who six months ago started a manufacturing job in rural Pennsylvania and says has created 17 jobs in the country, said that he is voting for Trump because of his policies on China that is bringing manufacturing jobs back. “We prefer Trump. One of the most important issue is that we are getting our supply chain out of China and into friendlier countries like India and Mexico and then back to the US,” he said.In the next term, Roberts wants President Trump to keep taxes low and get the supply chain back from China.Protection of religious rights and Christian values is the biggest issue for Chip, who attended Trump’s rally at Butler along with his wife. “Both are safe under Trump,” he said, explaining the reasons for his vote to the Republican incumbent. The president’s performance in the first term is “better than expected,” he said.“He is not your typical president, but seems to be getting things done,” he said, adding that the values and policies of Democratic presidential candidate Biden does not align with his believes.Sherrod, who came to the Trump rally with his wife and three kids, said that he is voting for Trump because he cares for freedom. “Freedom of speech. Freedom of religion,” he said, adding that the president offers him all the freedom that he wants. Biden is just “the opposite of that,” he said. “I think, he is all about power. That’s what I think about the Democratic party in power. Anything for power,” he said.Bruce Barns, who works in the service sector, said that he is worried that if the Democrats come to power, taxes are going to go up through the roof. His (Trump’s) first term has been really good, when you look at from the stand point of imports, trying to get jobs back home, and bringing the unemployment to a record low, pre-COVID-19,” Barns said.Reviving the country’s economy is the biggest thing done by Trump in the last three and half years. “I have more hours of work than before,” Eden said at an election rally in Youngstown, Ohio. “I do not want our country to be taken over by the Democrats,” he said.Mark McGrail, who does title searches for oil and gas industry in Ohio, said that prior to Covid-19, Trump created one of the best economy for the United States in the last 60 years. “The Biden-Harris ticket will kill the American economy. You look at the so-called Green New Deal. Energy is the life and blood of our country. And they tend to kill the energy sector of our economy,” Mark said in response to a question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-protected-us-constitution-can-revive-economy-after-pandemic-say-his-supporters/story-tD70zsKJrhWA5eDzrM76UN.html
01-11-2020||World||Donald Trump is a warrior; needs four more years as president: Ivanka||US President Donald Trump is a warrior and needs four more years in the White House, his daughter Ivanka Trump has said, asserting that he delivered more than his commitment to his countrymen. Addressing a large crowd on Saturday in Ohio, which is a battleground State for the November 3 presidential election, Ivanka said Trump has taken the US in the right direction in the last four years, including undoing the wrongs of his predecessors and political leadership for the past several decades. “Now more than ever America needs four more years of a warrior in the White House. My father fights so hard every single day for each of us. Now we have an opportunity to fight for him and fight for the future of this country,” she said. Trump, a Republican, is being challenged by his Democratic rival Joe Biden in the November 3 elections.Ivanka, the elder daughter of President Trump, is also a senior presidential advisor at the White House and has been playing an important role on issues like women, children, youths, jobs and unemployment. “With your help, your voice and your vote on November 3, we will win another historic victory and we will make America greater than ever before,” she said.Senator Robert Portman, who introduced Ivanka, described her as a superstar daughter of President Trump.“When I came to Washington, I quickly learned why the political establishment worked so hard to keep our president out of office. In the swamp, it is easy for politicians to survive, if they silence their convictions and if they skip the hard fights,” she said.“I was shocked to see just how many of these major challenges were kept unsolved so that they can campaign on the same issue in the next election. It’s really shocking. It happens all the time,” she said.Ivanka said the mission of Trump is to make America great again. “Trump did not come to Washington to win the praise of the Beltway elites. Donald Trump came to Washington for one reason, one reason only to make America great again,” she said.Ivanka, along with her brother Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump and sister Tiffney, has been aggressively campaigning in the battleground States seeking votes for her father. Like father and brother Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka has similar talking points, but connects with the audience very quickly, with short punch lines and interactive remarks.On Saturday, she asked for young kids in Halloween costumes. The moment she identified two young boys in the front rows dressed up in Halloween costumes, she asked them to join her on the stage. She chatted with the two for a few minutes and praised their dress. Later in her speech, she told the audience that she celebrated her birthday a day earlier on the road. The crowd immediately erupted in “Happy Birthday to You” song that lasted for about a minute.In her speech that lasted for about 35 minutes, she recognised several local entrepreneurs who have brought manufacturing back to Ohio and she spent an equal amount of time interacting with the several hundred people who had come to listen to her speech.“I’m sure there are some former Democrats here. I meet them across the country. Raise your hand… Look at that. The tent is growing,” she said. “The Democratic Party has a platform that lays out a plan to transform America into a socialist country,” she asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-is-a-warrior-needs-four-more-years-as-president-ivanka/story-nkdQDlQxX8ALTwUdmFMpzK.html
01-11-2020||World||Super Typhoon Goni makes landfall in Philippines||Super Typhoon Goni slammed into the Philippines Sunday with authorities warning of “catastrophic” conditions in the region expected to receive the hardest hit, where nearly a million people have been evacuated.The strongest typhoon of the year so far made landfall on Catanduanes Island at 4:50 am (2050 GMT Saturday) with maximum sustained wind speeds of 225 kilometres (140 miles) per hour, the state weather forecaster said.Over the next 12 hours, “catastrophic violent winds and intense to torrential rainfall” would be experienced in the Bicol region, which covers the southern end of the main island of Luzon and Catanduanes, it said.“This a particularly dangerous situation for these areas.”Goni -- which intensified into a “super” typhoon as it neared the Philippines -- comes a week after Typhoon Molave hit the same region of the natural disaster-prone archipelago.That storm killed 22 people and flooded low-lying villages and farmland, before crossing the South China Sea to Vietnam.“It looks like we will have really strong winds, increasing the chances of widespread flooding and landslides,” Mark Timbal, spokesman for the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, told local broadcaster ABS-CBN on Saturday.“Storm surges are imminent on our east coast. We are monitoring Mayon and Taal volcanoes for possible volcanic mud flows.”Civil Defense chief Ricardo Jalad said “almost a million” people had left their homes in the Bicol region.Authorities spent Saturday marshalling rescue vehicles, emergency response teams and relief goods before the storm’s arrival.There was a “high risk” of potentially life-threatening storm surges of more than three metres (10 feet) high along parts of the coast, which could inundate low-lying areas, it warned.A storm surge of up to three metres is also forecast for coastal areas of the capital Manila. Covid complicates evacuationsSchools which have been empty since the start of the coronavirus pandemic are being used as emergency shelters as are government-run evacuation centres and gymnasiums.“Evacuating people is more difficult at this time because of Covid-19,” Bicol regional civil defence spokesman Alexis Naz told AFP.Mary Ann Echague, 23, and her family fled their home in the coastal city of Legazpi to an inland primary school where they were sheltering in a classroom with several other families.“We fear the wrath of the typhoon,” said Echague, who was with her two children, parents and siblings. They had carried with them a portable stove, tinned meat, instant noodles, coffee, bread, blankets and pillows.“Each time we’re hit by a typhoon our house gets damaged, since it’s made of wood and galvanised iron roofing,” she said.“We have always managed. We find a way to get by.”Hundreds of people have been left stranded after the coastguard ordered ferries and fishing boats into port in expectation of rough seas throwing up 16-metre waves.Goni is expected to weaken as it crosses southern Luzon and enters the South China Sea early Monday, the state forecaster said.The Philippines is hit by an average of 20 storms and typhoons every year, which typically wipe out harvests, homes and infrastructure, keeping millions of people perennially poor.Its deadliest on record was Super Typhoon Haiyan, which unleashed giant waves on the central city of Tacloban and left more than 7,300 people dead or missing in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/super-typhoon-goni-makes-landfall-in-philippines/story-x5x0IoZWP6tH2QvQvvNvPM.html
01-11-2020||World||Barack Obama says Donald Trump failed to take pandemic, presidency seriously||Calling Joe Biden his “brother,” Barack Obama has accused Donald Trump of failing to take the coronavirus pandemic and the presidency seriously as Democrats leaned on America’s first Black president to energise Black voters in battleground Michigan on the final weekend of the 2020 campaign. Obama, the 44th president, and Biden, his vice president who wants to be the 46th, on Saturday held drive-in rallies in Flint and Detroit, predominantly Black cities where strong turnout will be essential to swing the longtime Democratic state to Biden’s column after Trump won it in 2016.The memories of Trump’s win in Michigan and the rest of the Upper Midwest are still searing in the minds of many Democrats during this closing stretch before Tuesday’s election. That leaves Biden in the position of holding a consistent lead in the national polls and an advantage in most battlegrounds, including Michigan, yet still facing anxiety it could all slip away.As of Saturday morning, nearly 90 million voters had already cast ballots nationwide, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Tens of millions more will vote by the time polls close on Tuesday night.Obama said he initially hoped “for the country’s sake” that Trump “might take the job seriously. He never has.” The former president, addressing voters in dozens of cars in a Flint high school parking lot, seized on Trump’s continued focus on the size of his campaign crowds.“Did no one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? Was he traumatized?” Obama mocked. “The country’s going through a pandemic. That’s not what you’re supposed to be worrying about.” Trump made an aggressive play for pivotal Pennsylvania, focusing largely on his white, working-class base. His first of four scheduled stops in Pennsylvania was in a small town in Bucks County on the eastern edge of the state.Repeating what has become a consistent part of his closing message, Trump raised baseless concerns about election fraud, pointing specifically at Philadelphia, a city whose large African American population is key to Biden’s fate in the state.“They say you have to be very, very careful — what happens in Philadelphia,” Trump charged. “Everybody has to watch.” The president also railed against a recent Supreme Court ruling that will allow Pennsylvania to count mail ballots received as many as three days after polls close. The extra time, Trump alleged without evidence, would allow for fraud and potentially deny him a win in the state. “What’s going on?” he asked during a late afternoon rally in Reading, Pennsylvania. “That was a very disappointing opinion, but I’ve had many disappointing opinions from the Supreme Court.” Several studies, including one commissioned by Trump himself, have failed to uncover any significant examples of election fraud. Good-government advocacy groups are concerned that the president’s repeated calls for his supporters to monitor the polls may lead to widespread voter intimidation. Republicans are betting that Trump can win a second term by driving up turnout among his strongest supporters — white, noncollege-educated men and rural voters — while limiting Biden’s advantage with Blacks and Latinos. Democrats in several swing states worry that voters of colour may not be excited enough about Biden to show up in the numbers they need.In Michigan, Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents the Flint area, said he had been pressing for a couple of months for Biden or Obama to visit the majority Black city where a water crisis that began in 2014 sickened the city’s residents, exposing stark racial inequities.“Showing up matters,” Kildee said. “The message is important, no question about it. But there’s a message implicit in showing up, especially in Flint. This is a community that has felt left behind many, many times and overlooked many, many times.” R&B legend Stevie Wonder was to perform in Detroit after Biden and Obama speak.Biden’s campaign announced it was sending Obama to Florida and Georgia on Monday. He is the campaign’s most valuable asset to help energize the nonwhite voters Democrats so badly need to defeat Trump. “Joe Biden is my brother. I love Joe Biden, and he will be a great president,” Obama said Saturday.The press for Michigan’s Black voters comes after voting was down roughly 15 per cent in Flint and Detroit four years ago — a combined 48,000-plus votes in a state Trump carried by about 10,700 votes. Overall, the Black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a presidential election, falling to 59.6 per cent in 2016 after reaching a record-high 66.6 per cent four years earlier, according to the Pew Research Center.Trump isn’t ceding Michigan to Biden. He visited Waterford Township, near Detroit, on Friday and held a rally in the state capital, Lansing, this past week, though the surging coronavirus cases are clouding his presidency.The worst week of the year, in terms of new infections, arrived with Election Day looming. More than 99,000 Americans reported new infections on Friday, a record high, according to Johns Hopkins University. Trump told Pennsylvania voters that his administration has done “an incredible job” dealing with the pandemic. He promised that the mass distribution of a vaccine was “just weeks away.”(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-says-donald-trump-failed-to-take-pandemic-presidency-seriously/story-LkkmU0yLqOo08C1yFNcK4L.html
01-11-2020||World||Donald Trump, Joe Biden barrel through key states on final weekend before vote||Donald Trump, challenger Joe Biden and their top surrogates were barreling through crucial states in the industrial Midwest and the coastal southeast on Saturday, in a frantic sprint to mobilize voters as they pressed their closing arguments with the US presidential election only days away.Using some of his most urgent language yet, Trump warned of “bedlam in our country” if no clear winner emerges quickly in the November 3 election, saying, without evidence, that it could take weeks to sort out a result and that “very bad things” could happen in the interim.Biden meantime told backers it was “time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home.”Underscoring the high stakes -- and the disruptive impact of the coronavirus pandemic -- a record 90 million early votes have already been cast, as the bruising contest heads toward the biggest turnout in at least a century. The virus has killed nearly 230,000 Americans, ravaged the world’s largest economy and was infecting record numbers of people across the US.Trump was focusing Saturday on the key battleground state of Pennsylvania -- “the state where the story of American independence began,” he said in the small city of Newtown, the first of four stops in that state amid a frenetic final sprint.Biden made his first joint appearance of the campaign with his former boss Barack Obama -- probably the most popular Democrat in the country -- in Flint, Michigan as they scramble to boost turnout in a state Trump carried by a razor-thin margin in 2016.Vice President Mike Pence, meantime, was campaigning in narrowly divided North Carolina while Biden’s running mate Kamala Harris was in Florida, another vitally important swing state.Pennsylvania has emerged as one of the top prizes this year. In his motorcade en route to rural Bucks County, the president passed hundreds of supporters holding up a forest of pro-Trump signs. The crowd then booed reporters in trailing vehicles.In remarks at an event there, Trump lashed out at Biden, saying he would shut down the state’s fossil-fuel industry.The president claimed credit for creating the “greatest economy in the history of this country -- the history of the world” -- while “foreign nations are in freefall.”Despite recent signs of recovery, however, millions remain jobless.And the race has been overshadowed by the surging pandemic, which had even sickened Trump and many members of his staff. More than 94,000 new infections were recorded Friday in the US -- another new high -- and total cases passed nine million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.In stark contrast to Trump, who has belittled mask-wearing by Biden and others, the Democrat has scrupulously followed the guidance of public health experts.After Biden and Obama appeared Saturday before a socially distanced drive-in rally in Flint, they made an unannounced stop in suburban Bloomfield Hills before heading later to Detroit to be joined by superstar singer Stevie Wonder. Biden leads in the state by nearly seven points, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls. The state’s 16 electoral votes could provide a sizable leap towards the 270 needed to win the White House. Trump, in eking out his 2016 victory, took advantage of low turnout rates among Michigan Blacks. As Biden campaigns with the nation’s first Black president, he clearly hopes to change that.Obama pulled few punches in Flint, saying 140,000 American lives would have been saved if the president had taken an approach to the pandemic similar to Canada’s. Trump, he added, was on course to be the first president in nearly a century to preside over a net job loss.Biden then took the stage to tear into Trump. “We’re done with the chaos, the tweets, the anger, the failure, the refusal to take any responsibility,” he said.The election takes place in a deeply divided country, with feelings so raw that gun sales have surged in some areas. Businesses in some cities, including Washington, are protectively boarding their windows, and police are preparing for the possibility of violence.Biden’s campaign announced he will address the nation on election night, after a vote that will undoubtedly leave millions bitterly disappointed, no matter who wins.Chasing every voteOn Friday the two candidates carried their battle to the American Midwest, barnstorming three heartland states each as they chased every last vote.Trump, who has long said the virus will “disappear,” remained defiant at rallies in Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. He again downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, saying, “If you get it, you’re going to get better, and then you’re going to be immune.”After a campaign largely muted by the pandemic, Biden has taken the offensive, pushing Trump onto the back foot in unexpected battlegrounds like Texas, a large, traditionally conservative bastion now seen as a toss-up.On Friday, the state reported that a staggering nine million residents had already voted, surpassing its 2016 total.Harris visited Texas Friday in a bid to turn the state Democratic for the first time since 1976.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-barrel-through-key-states-on-final-weekend-before-vote/story-RfmPfsTEU6cgI2NygzMEtL.html
01-11-2020||World||US officials warn close vote will fuel Russian disinformation||Russia will continue to use disinformation to attempt to meddle in US politics no matter who wins the presidential election, but a close result would intensify its efforts, current and former US officials warned.The Russian effort in a close contest would probably focus on casting doubt on the integrity of the vote, the officials said. US intelligence has assessed that Russia is working to undermine former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign.“If it is close, expect a lot of noise about voter fraud and miscounting. This will happen in any case, but the Russians will amplify it,” said James Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.One scenario troubling US officials is the possibility of simple, highly visible tactics that may create distrust about the integrity of the vote. For example, overwhelming state and local websites with traffic until they go offline -- a tactic known as distributed denial of service, or DDoS for short -- could create concern about the election’s integrity, which could be fanned on social media, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.A close election would probably exacerbate the problem. The US government has warned that if the vote count takes days, criminals and foreign actors might spread disinformation including “reports of voter suppression, cyber-attacks targeting election infrastructure, voter or ballot fraud or other problems intended to convince the public of the elections’ illegitimacy.”Bracing for DisinformationOfficials are bracing for disinformation in the aftermath of the election regardless of the outcome, but the intensity of Kremlin influence operations -- both in the days and the years that follow -- will depend on how the election plays out. A decisive victory on Nov. 3 for either candidate, however, means less fertile ground for Russia in the immediate aftermath of the election.Since 2016, other foreign powers have picked up Russian tactics. US intelligence is also warning that Iran and China are working to sway voters to advance their geopolitical goals. National Counterintelligence and Security Center Director William Evanina said in a July statement that Russia prefers Trump, while China and Iran prefer Biden.But Russia remains a primary concern for many US officials and security experts given its track record and its continued brazenness in trying to influence American politics.An easing up by Russian trolls is unlikely if President Donald Trump is re-elected. They haven’t been deterred from targeting the US with cyber tactics and amplifying disinformation online in his first term, even as social media companies have taken more steps to weed out foreign campaigns and domestic influence campaigns have grown in volume and influence, the experts say.Four years after Russian actors hacked into Democratic Party emails and waged an online campaign to help Trump and sow chaos, they have continued to try to influence the current campaign, probing state and local systems, spreading disinformation on social media and sending phishing emails to political targets, according to social media companies and government officials.‘Absolutely Clear’“I am absolutely clear that by the intelligence we have gathered, we have full confidence that the Russians are going after our elections,” said Trump’s former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in an Oct. 29 interview with CBS News. “They are doing it now. They are going to continue to do it.”Biden has promised a tougher stance on Russian election meddling, and if he wins, the Kremlin may have reason to rethink the level of aggression in its use of disinformation, experts say. Regardless of U.S. response, disinformation is too effective a tool for Russia to give up altogether anytime soon, they said.“It is asymmetrical warfare and super cheap for them,” said Darren Linvill, an associate professor at Clemson University and lead researcher in its Media Forensics Hub. The small cost of producing such attacks is virtually the only price Russia is currently paying for disinformation, he said.Michael Daniel, who coordinated cybersecurity for the Obama administration, also said Russia won’t see much downside in continuing to use influence operations “for the foreseeable future.”“A much tougher question is what it would take to persuade the Russians to stop or dramatically scale back this activity,” said Daniel, the president and chief executive officer of the Cyber Threat Alliance.Biden has said his responses to foreign election meddling may range from sanctions to cyber-attacks.“If Biden wins, the Russians will test him to see how much they can still get away with,” said Lewis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-warn-close-vote-will-fuel-russian-disinformation/story-XkRInbW7R9rDQG30QVYsaP.html
01-11-2020||World||England in lockdown 2 from Thursday; Covid-19 cases cross 1 million||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday announced another lockdown in England from Thursday until December 2 after expert modelling predicted a sharp rise in deaths by December if tougher action is not taken and the overall number of Covid-19 cases in the UK crossed one million.The main difference from the first lockdown in March is that schools and universities will be allowed to remain open. Non-essential retail, restaurants, pubs and other hospitality sectors will remain closed, besides other restrictions on travel and leisure.The basic message is to ‘stay home’.Johnson said: “No one wants to be imposing these kind of measures anywhere…Our hope was that by strong local action strong local leadership, we could get the rates of infection down, whether disease was surging and address the problem, thereby across the whole country”.“We’ve got to be humble in the face of nature, and in this country. Alas, as across much of Europe, the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst case scenario of our scientific advisors, whose models now suggests that unless we act, we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day, a peak of mortality, alas, bigger than the one we saw in April”.An official statement said on Saturday evening: “Between 31 January and 31 October 2020, there have been 1,011,660 people who have had a confirmed positive test result,” adding that there were 21,915 new cases and 326 deaths in the last 24 hours.The second lockdown has been announced for England, the largest and most populated constituent of the United Kingdom, with local lockdown and tighter restrictions already in place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scotland advised against travel to and from England.Latest modelling of deaths by experts from Imperial College London, University of Warwick, University of Cambridge and others predicted at least over 2,000 deaths per day – more than twice the peak earlier this year – by December, if another lockdown is not imposed. One of the models envisaged 4,000 deaths per day.The modelling, showed to Johnson and ministers on Friday, is said to have changed the government’s regional approach, which so far focused on a three-level alert system based on the number of cases at local levels, so that sectors of economy in areas with low cases could continue.The first lockdown, announced on March 23, led to a major fall in the number of new cases, deaths and hospital admissions. The development encouraged ministers to introduce the ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme in August, which now faces criticism for being partly responsible for the surge in cases.Other UK constituents are already under tougher local restrictions. Wales is under lockdown until November 9; Scotland’s new five-tiered system of restrictions will come into force on Monday; and in Northern Ireland, pubs and restaurants were closed for four weeks on October 16, with the exception of takeaways and deliveries.France, Belgium and Germany have already imposed tighter restrictions as the second wave of Covid-19 sweeps across Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-in-lockdown-2-from-thursday-covid-19-cases-cross-1-million/story-JpF71BUN86foEwW9dCoChN.html
01-11-2020||World||Early voting in US election tops 90 million||More than 90 million Americans have cast ballots in the US presidential election, according to a tally on Saturday from the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, setting the stage for the highest participation rate in over a century.The record-breaking pace, about 65% of the total turnout in 2016, reflects intense interest in the vote, in which incumbent Donald Trump, a Republican, is up against Democratic nominee Joe Biden, a former vice president.Huge numbers of people have voted by mail or at early in-person polling sites amid concerns about exposure to the coronavirus at busy Election Day voting places.Trump trails Biden in national opinion polls amid criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of Covid-19, which has killed nearly 229,000 people in the United States, with numbers of new infections once again breaking daily records as Election Day nears on Tuesday.Democrats hold a significant advantage in early voting due to their embrace of postal ballots, which Republicans have historically cast in large numbers but have shunned amid repeated and unfounded attacks by Trump, who says the system is prone to widespread fraud.Experts have predicted turnout will easily surpass the 138 million who voted in 2016. Only 47 million votes were submitted before Election Day four years ago.In 20 states that report party registration data, 19.9 million registered Democrats have already voted, compared with 13 million Republicans and 10.1 million with no party affiliation. The data does not show for whom the votes were cast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/early-voting-in-us-election-tops-90-million/story-7SnWiuC7B3dR6UyrZkG3uI.html
01-11-2020||World||US daily cases top record 100k; president Donald Trump turns ire at docs||Daily Covid-19 cases in the US hit a new global record of more than 100,000, pushing hospitals closer to the brink of capacity just four days ahead of the presidential election in which the pandemic is the top issue.Cases reached 100,233 on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, which is a new single-day record for the fifth time in the past 10 days for the US, surpassing the previous peak of 91,248 new infections posted a day earlier.It also represented the world’s highest national daily toll during the pandemic, exceeding India’s 24-hour record of 97,894 set in September. Total cases in the US topped 9 million, with more than 230,000 deaths.At an election rally on Friday, Trump alleged that doctors were getting paid more to attribute deaths to Covid-19 as opposed to other causes. “Our doctors get more money if someone dies from Covid,” he said in Michigan. His Democratic rival Joe Biden called out the president.“Did you hear what he said again today? He said that our doctors who are putting their lives on the line busting their necks, are making up deaths from Covid because they ’get more money’”.“Doctors and nurses go to work every day to save lives — they do their jobs,” Biden said.Deprived of big, raucous crowds due to Covid curbs, Trump delivered the shortest stump speech yet this cycle, around 21 minutes, to an audience of merely 250 people in Rochester, Minnesota. And he was not happy about it. “Your far-left Democrat attorney general, Keith Ellison, and your Democrat governor (Tim Walz) tried to shut down our rally, silence the people of Minnesota, and take away your freedom of assembly,” Trump told supporters. “They thought we would cancel—but I will never abandon Minnesota!”Trump lost Minnesota in the last election, but so narrowly that he has been tempted to seek a win there to offset vulnerabilities and potential reverses in his 2016 pathway to victory. But just four days from the close of polling on Tuesday, Trump is trailing Biden in the state by a wide margin of 8.1 percentage points at this time, in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls and by 4.7 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Trump is behind Biden countrywide, by 8.9 percentage points in the FiveThirtyEight weighted average of polls and by 7.9 points in the aggregated average of RealClearPolitics, which also has the former vice-president in the lead by 3.2 points in the top battleground states — Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona.Trump and Biden will be crisscrossing battleground states over the remaining four days, with more than 87 million Americans having voted already in person or by mail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-daily-cases-top-record-100k-president-donald-trump-turns-ire-at-docs/story-97J3l7Ua2CTZHkVKuid73H.html
01-11-2020||India||Odisha TV channel CFO arrested in land deal case; channel owners, Opposition cry foul||The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Odisha Police on Sunday arrested the chief financial officer (CFO) of a leading Odia TV channel over an allegation of land fraud triggering accusations of the government’s witchhunt against the channel.Manoranjan Sarangi, the CFO of OTV was picked up from his home in Bhubaneswar by EOW officials on Sunday morning and arrested after long interrogation in an alleged fraudulent land deal in Sarua, Khurda district. He was later forwarded to the court after a medical test at the Capital Hospital was conducted in the evening.A press release issued by the EOW said Odisha InfraTech Pvt Ltd, in which Sarangi was one of the directors, had purchased land belonging to scheduled caste persons circumventing rules/laws using forgery/cheating/intimidation and other dubious methods to cause losses to them. Sarangi has been charged under sections 420/423/467/468/471/120-B of Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with sections 3 (1) (g) (q) of SC & ST (Prevention Of Atrocities) Act.OTV channel is owned and operated by Jagi Mangat Panda, wife of BJP’s national vice-president and former MP Baijayant ‘Jay’ Panda, friend-turned-bete noire of Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik.Also read: India rejects Pak’s status to Gilgit-Baltistan, says it has no locus standiOTV’s operating officer Litisha Mangat said the CFO’s arrest was a sign of vendetta against the channel as everyone in Odisha is widely aware of the attacks on OTV. “Our channel has been fearless and persistent in reporting fact-based news much to their (government’s) displeasure. The 13 false cases filed against OTV in the last 2 months is manifestation of their rage against us. In some of the cases, the courts have granted interim bail. No surprise that they felt the need to fabricate something new.”In a statement issued last month, the Editors Guild of India had also condemned the Odisha government’s move against OTV. Early last month, senior OTV journalist Ramesh Rath was picked up by Keonjhar police in an alleged case of viral video involving BJD’s Keonjhar MP Chandrani Murmu. Rath later resigned from OTV.The OTV CFO’s arrest was condemned by the Congress and the BJP. Senior Congress MP Saptagiri Ulaka said the Odisha government seemed to be scared. “It’s a clear case of vendetta which is trying to curb the freedom of expression,” said Congress MP from Koraput, Saptagiri Ulaka. BJP MP from Bhubaneswar, Aparajita Sarangi also asked if the Odisha government is afraid or it wants to hide something. Senior BJP leader and Sundergarh MP, Jual Oram said, “The vindictive action against OTV is a dastardly attempt to throttle the voice of media in the state.”But BJD MP Amar Patnaik said though Odisha Land Reforms Act prohibits the purchase of SC land by non-SC people, Jay Panda used his unlettered driver, who happened to be an SC, to buy land at throwaway prices, who then sold these to his infra company as he (the driver) had a little too much of land. “What kind of society have we come to live in where the filthy rich are still impoverishing the poor of whatever little possession they have? Let’s all wake up and raise a chorus of revolt! The power has to be with the poor,” tweeted Patnaik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-tv-channel-cfo-arrested-in-land-deal-case-channel-owners-opposition-cry-foul/story-x19XENwyLIsqj8WUQUzVXO.html

Assam recorded 21 cases of sexual violence, followed by Manipur (18), Chattisgarh (17), Jammu and Kashmir (16), Tripura (14), Jharkhand (7), Meghalaya (6), Arunachal Pradesh (6), Odisha (5), Andhra Pradesh (3) and Maharashtra (1). A total of 224 females were victimized in the 114 cases with the highest number reported from Chattisgarh (92), followed by Assam (26), Manipur (21) and Jammu and Kashmir (20).

Also read: Jharkhand BJP chief charged with sedition after comment on Hemant Soren govtA total of 74 of the total victims were in the age group of 7 to 17 years and 156 (or 69.6 percent) of the victims were tribal women and girls, the list stated. It also mentioned that, as per official figures, a total of 9,448 people were killed in conflict areas during 2009 and 2019, including 3,747 in Left-wing extremism affected areas, 3,070 in northeast states and 2,631 in Jammu & Kashmir. The list was released on Saturday to mark the 20th year of adoption of Resolution 1325 by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) which calls upon all parties in armed conflicts to respect international law applicable to the rights and protection of females. Clause 11 of the resolution emphasises the responsibility of all states to “put an end to impunity and to prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes including those relating to sexual and other violence against women and girls”. The NCAT statement also mentioned acts of sexual violence against women committed by armed militant groups in the conflict-ridden areas but doesn’t provide any figure on such instances. The NCAT stated that the country needs to amend Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) as well as Section 6 of Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) to remove the requirement of prior sanction with respect to rape by a member of the armed forces deployed in a conflict-hit area in order to fully implement the UNSC Resolution 1325.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-records-highest-cases-of-sexual-violence-by-armed-forces-in-20-years-ngo/story-1xgc3y8MIIgHDh7SDIwhiN.html

I see that his movement is similar to Lalu Yadav. Tejaswi has included all the dons and criminal of Bihar in his party. Anant Singh, Rajaballabh Yadav, Rama Singh are all dons and they have preferred Rama Singh instead of veteran socialist leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh. Tejashwi Yadav’s tendencies show that he is not avoiding criminals, rapists.How would Bihar become if these people came to power, just imagine?”Singh, who is also the Lok Sabha MP from Arrah, attacked RJD and said that if that party is back in power in the state criminals will get a free run in Bihar.“The goons will come on the roads again and the process of snatching of vehicles will again increase in the state,” he remarked. He also questioned the inclusion of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (CPI-ML) in the Mahagathbandhan.“RJD has formed an alliance with CPI(ML). This party was called ‘Mundi Katwa’ by Lalu ji himself when he was the Chief Minister and now they have formed an alliance with that party. RJD is not worried about the state that is why they brought the murderer CPI(ML) in the alliance. Due to fear of CPI(ML) people did not leave home in Bhojpur after evenings in the past,” Singh said. Union Minister directly attacked RJD Leadership and said that these are the people who’re not worried about the welfare of Bihar.They are not worried about development, and are taking along criminal and killers in order to gain power at any cost. “I tell people in Bihar that they should vote for someone who is educated, honest, and has character. If they voted for a criminal, ones who are corrupt and characterless on the basis of caste then you should not complain that there is too much corruption or the road is very bad. Because you did not worry while voting. While voting you should worry about how Bihar should be and vote accordingly,” Singh added.The first phase of Bihar assembly elections to 71 seats was held on October 28. The remaining 172 assembly constituencies of the 243-member assembly will go to polls on November 3 and November 7.The elections for the second phase of polls for 94 assembly constituencies will be held on November 3 and the results are scheduled to be announced on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-misfortune-for-bihar-if-tejashwi-comes-to-power-rk-singh/story-oWUsYuH9Crqu79xkYcrtcJ.html

Besides, it has been conferred the status of marine sanctuary in view of turtles congregation.The sole objective of annual measures, that would remain effective till May 31, is to ensure the safety of marine animals during their breeding and mating season, said forest officials, adding that the ban has been clamped in accordance with Sections 2, 7, and 4 of Orissa Marine Fishing Regulation Act (OMFRA), 1982 and provisions of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.The fishing ban has been imposed along a specified coast of the sea comprising sea turtle congregation area and their buffer zones at the river mouths of Dhamara, Devi, and Rusikulya.The prohibition of this nature has been clamped as the turtles perish in larger numbers either by getting entangled in fishing nets or hit by fishing trawler’ propellers.It will be a multi-layered patrolling exercise involving the forest, fisheries, and marine police besides the coast guard personnel. To ensure effective patrolling, 61 on- shore camps and five off-shore camps have been set up. The armed police constabulary force will flank the forest and fisheries patrolling teams.“To ensure the safety of turtles, the prohibitory orders are being strictly enforced. The trawler operators have been cautioned not to venture into prohibited water zones. Any act of trespassing would invite punitive measures”, said Divisional Forest Officer, Rajnagar Mangrove (wildlife) Forest Division, Bikash Ranjan Dash.Around 10,666 fishermen families will be affected following the fishing ban. Therefore, to compensate for the loss of income avenues, the state government has decided to extend one-time livelihood assistance of Rs 7,500 to the affected fishermen families.Around 7.30 lakh Olive Ridley turtles had turned up for their annual sojourn for mass nesting in the 2019-20 nesting season. The female turtles had emerged from the sea to crawl on to the serene beach, dig pits to lay millions of eggs.The female turtles virtually invade the nesting beaches usually at the dead of the night for laying eggs, the phenomenon otherwise described as ‘arribada’. After indulgence in instinctive egg-laying, the turtles leave the nesting ground to stride into the deep sea water. Hatchlings emerge from these eggs after 45-60 days. It is a rare natural phenomenon where the babies grow without their mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/olive-ridley-conservation-odisha-govt-clamps-prohibition-on-sea-fishing-activity-at-3-river-mouths/story-O3XeyO9uY1mBDnLi2AAhNI.html

The temple as per the High Court directives is being restored to its original dome shape (Chhatri) from which its name has been derived.The Ganga temple, popularly known as Raja Man Singh Ki Chhatri, has not been renovated for the past several decades. It stands among a cluster of temples at Har-Ki-Pauri, as it is the only temple not whitewashed and is in cemented-brick form only.Chemical layering, filling, testing and cleaning work has been started by experts from Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH). The family whose ancestors were priests of Raja Man Singh and who manage the temple have given a go-ahead to ensure beautification, restoration of the original dome-shaped structure with an initial assessment of nearly Rs 60 lakh budget.Haridwar Roorkee Development Authority had also carried out an assessment of the four-century-old temple basement and structure during Ganga canal closure last year.A team of experts comprising Archaeological Survey of India, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee, and Central Building Research Institute had given a go-ahead to the construction of the dome structure in its feasibility report.Pallav Budhkar, member of the family whose ancestors were priests of Raja Man Singh, said that work has been initiated to ensure the temple restores its original umbrella-shaped top structure.Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha pointed out that in 1997 the Chhatri (elevated, dome-shaped or umbrella-shaped structure) atop the shrine was removed. “After the removal of the Chhatri, it became a raised concrete temple”, he said “Pilgrims and tourists used to make sure they pay obeisance at this temple; the same aura will get restored when it is restored to its original glory,” said local trader Tej Prakash.Devotees, as well as tourists, easily spot the Ganga temple and are surprised that such a historical temple is not in good shape. Even during Mahakumbh, Ardh Kumbh, Kanwar fairs and other VVIP dignitaries’ visit, Ganga Sabha and local administration cover this concrete-brick unfinished look of the Ganga temple by decorating it with decorative flowers to hide the dilapidated structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/restoration-of-uttarakhand-s-400-year-old-ganga-temple-begins/story-CnQf5X82xmdjF1JmvrL5ZO.html
01-11-2020||India||Jharkhand BJP chief charged with sedition after comment on Hemant Soren govt||A day after the Jharkhand police booked state BJP president Deepak Prakash for sedition and other charges, the leader on Sunday challenged the government to arrest him, stressing that he will not retract from his stand.Two days back in Dumka, Prakash had said that the incumbent government, led by Hemant Soren, would be unseated within two months and the next government would have a BJP chief minister. He had also warned few government officials not to misuse their powers to favour ruling party’s candidates in Dumka and Bermo bypolls, scheduled on November 3.Following Prakash’s comment, Dumka’s Congress district president Shyamal Kumar Singh had filed a complaint with the police, alleging that Prakash was trying to destabilise the elected government and intimidated government officials.Responding to the complaint, the Dumka police registered an FIR under Sections 124 A (sedition), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimation) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy).Speaking to the media here at the BJP’s headquarters, Prakash said, “I challenge the government to arrest me as I am still sticking to my stand. The incumbent government is bound to go due to internal dissensions. I will keep questioning the chief minister on public issues, no matter what may come. It’s my right.” मैं आज भी अपने बयान पर कायम हूँ, ये मेरी मातृभूमि है और यहाँ की सवा तीन करोड़ की जनता की सेवा करने का संकल्प मैंने लिया है. इससे पहले भी मैंने दमन के खिलाफ संघर्ष किया है लेकिन ये तो बैशाखी सरकार है1: @dprakashbjp pic.twitter.com/a2sPqqUMDeMeanwhile, chief minister Hemant Soren, also speaking to the media in Dumka, said, “BJP does not believe in democratic system. Like in other states, they are trying to define politics in a new way in which role of horse trading is vital. It becomes apparently clear by Prakash’s statement. What is running in his mind? If they have planned to topple the government, then this FIR against him would prove a strong tool to disclose their (BJP people) nefarious design.”Prakash took jibe over the functioning of the government and its machinery. He said, “The government invoked sedition charges against me, who always utter “Bharat Mata Ki Jai and Vandemataram”. A patriot has been made a traitor. See the functioning of the police. They invoke charges only after reading the complaint. But, in my case, the complainant had submitted in writing what charges (mentioning the IPC sections) should be invoked and the police acted on it.”The state BJP president also slammed chief minister Soren for giving a clean chit to Ranchi based social activist and an accused in Bhima-Koregaon violence case Sten Swami.Reading out a part of the NIA’s charge sheet in the case, Prakash said that the accused persons involved in this case had plans to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“They planned for procurement of M-4 rifles and four lakh bullets. It’s a 5000-page chargesheet. But, our CM didn’t care to read it and wait for the judicial decision and jumped on to give a clean chit to Swami,” he said.Prakash questioned why the CM kept silent when scores of hunger deaths and rape and murder incidents occurred in the state during lockdown period.He disclosed incidents before the media and said that he would keep questioning the CM for his failures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-bjp-chief-charged-with-sedition-after-comment-on-hemant-soren-govt/story-suFNvM0kcBr1vpmYW0axJO.html

On October 26, the number of active cases dropped to 6,53,717, indicating a downward trend which has continued throughout the week. On November 1, India’s total active caseload stands at 5,70,458. The number of active cases dropped below the six lakh-mark in this week nearly after three months.

Also Read: India’s daily Covid-19 count falls further, active cases remain below 6 lakhHowever, the trend can’t be found in Kerala and Delhi.

In this week, Kerala officially surpassed Maharashtra to report highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases.

The cap on the number of people attending wedding parties has also been relaxed ahead of the wedding season. Now 200 guests are allowed in Delhi weddings.Kerala has also opened beaches, parks and museums for tourists from November 1. The staggered unlocking of public places, facilities is not being blamed for contributing to the number of Covid-19 cases in either of the states. The sudden spike has been attributed to festive season in both Delhi and Kerala, pollution and the onset of winter being other two conducive factors in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/active-covid-19-cases-in-india-on-steady-decline-for-past-week-kerala-and-delhi-not-following-trend/story-NZ8nfZdITjx1xnb0arXfcK.html
01-11-2020||India||‘Woman with self-respect will die if raped’: Kerala Congress chief’s shocker||Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullapally Ramachandran triggered a controversy on Sunday when he made “anti-women comments” while criticising the Left Democratic Front (LDF). After uproar, the Congress leader soon offered an apology. “A woman with self-respect will die if she is raped or else try not to be sexually assaulted again. But every day she is telling she is raped by someone,” he said while launching the opposition United Democratic Front’s protest, seeking the resignation of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Mullapally made the offensive remarks while he was slamming the LDF for bringing up the solar scam case during the Congress regime to counter the criticism against it in the gold smuggling and drug cases. “The LDF has brought a sex worker as a desperate attempt to tell her tales. The CM’s blackmailing won’t work this time. One can understand when a woman is raped once but she says she is assaulted repeatedly. Nobody will believe her studded lies,” he said, without naming the woman in the solar scam case. The reference, however, was to the solar scam accused Saritha Nair. Just two days back, she is reported to have made a statement against former minister AP Anil Kumar. The solar scam relates to alleged fraud by Saritha and her second husband with the help of a few staff members of the then chief minister Oommen Chandy’s office. They promised unsuspecting customers imported solar panels. Once the scam surfaced, Chandy had to sack three of his aides and Kerala’s public relations director. After her arrest, she had raised sexual assault charges against many Congress leaders. Ramachandran apologised at the same venue after loud protests erupted, and the ruling CPI(M) and women organisations came out against the Congress leader. State Women Commission president MC Josephine said his words were in bad taste and the commission will take action against him. Congress leader Shanimol Usman and others also expressed displeasure over his remarks. This is not the first time he has landed in such a controversy. Earlier, he landed in another row after his ‘Covid Rani’ and ‘Nipah Rajkumari’ remarks against state health minister K K Shailaja. But he later said he used these epithets with good intention to expose the state’s failure on Covid-19 battlefront. “It shows his mindset. This is not the first time he is speaking against women. We would like to know the Congress president’s view about this,” said KK Shailaja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-with-self-respect-will-die-if-raped-kerala-congress-chief-s-shocker/story-yxldZZTfeg77yjz7plh2SJ.html

First is that of e-way bills, which indicates production, movement of goods and also consumption. In order to get e-way bills generated you have to produce things, you need to transport them, and then businesses have to receive and sell them. So it gives you an indication of business activity. This September, the growth in e-way bill was 10% compared to last year and this October the growth is about 21% year-on-year (y-o-y). The other statistics is of electronic invoice [e-invoice], for which we don’t have a y-o-y comparison as it started from October 1, 2020 only. However, on the first day it was about 8 lakh a day. Now, it has gone up and on October 30 it was more than 29 lakh a day. Similarly, if you see the GST collection figures, we had a positive 4% [annualised] growth in September 2020 at Rs 95,480 crore. The collections saw more than 10% growth in October this year at Rs 1 lakh 5 thousand crore compared to the same month last year, which definitely shows a pick-up in the economic activities. So, as far as the indirect tax is concerned, we have not only reached the last years’ level, but we have also gone beyond.Q) What is the position of direct taxes? So far, what are the direct tax collection figures?The total gross tax collection is down by 22%. It consists of corporate tax and also the personal income-tax. When we make comparison in corporate tax, we have to keep in mind that last year for the first six months, the corporate tax [rate] was at 30%. This year it is at 22%. There was also significant impact due to pandemic and lockdown for the first four-five months [of the current financial year]. Now, over the next few months, the situation will improve further. Eventually, if the indirect tax is doing well, we will see some positive impact of that on direct tax also. The gross direct tax collection [both corporate and personal income tax] in current financial year [till October] is Rs 5,05,000 crore. Last year [till October] it was Rs 6,41,000 crore. The gross corporate tax collection this financial year so far is Rs 2,65,000 crore compared to Rs 3,60,000 crore in the same period last year. Going forward, direct tax collection will also improve along with indirect taxes.Q) What are your plans to check tax evasion?We have taken necessary measures to update the system and follow data sharing consistently and use data analytics and artificial intelligence. This has helped us in augmenting revenue even in this difficult time of Covid-19. Today, the data of income-tax, customs and GST - all are being shared among themselves in real time on a continuous basis. Any asymmetry in data is red flagged by the system and evasion is caught. If anyone shows different turnover in GST and files different numbers in income-tax and different figures of customs, then they are automatically checked and caught.Q) Do you think another stimulus is required for faster growth recovery?The government has taken a series of measures since March this year. Various packages have been announced by the Union finance minister. Each time, we stepped in and intervened with relief or stimulus packages as per the need of the hour and the needs of the targeted group of populace, etc. And such packages need to be different to address the different requirements. We were constantly monitoring the ground situation and responded accordingly – as to which section of the society or which sector of the economy required support and in it what form. We acted accordingly.In the month of April, because of the lockdown, what was needed was cash in the hands of the vulnerable section of the society such as farmers and the Jan-Dhan account holders. We put the money in their hands, directly in their bank accounts. About 80 crore people were given free food grains per month, per family. Similarly, for MSMEs [micro, small and medium enterprises], Rs 3 lakh crore fund was provided for their working capital for which the government gave the guarantee and of which about Rs 2 lakh crore was already sanctioned. We also gave relief in taxation, by extending timelines, by deferred payments, by giving them TDS [tax deducted at source] relief. So measures were taken. Therefore, stimulus can’t be one size fits all or one size will fit at all times. So what we have to do is to continuously monitor and assess the situation and then come out with the response to address the needs of the hour appropriately as per the requirement of the segment of the economy. Our finance minister has already said that we are quite open and as and when any intervention or stimulus is needed we will not be left wanting.Q) So, will the stimulus be focused on demand generation this time?As we have done in the past few months, whichever sector of the economy or section of population needs stimulus or relief, we will do that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-stimulus-package-in-the-offing-finance-secretary-responds/story-44jjlJSJRDftsrQ0mw1fOJ.html

The ‘Koyla’ actor for the first time, shot in Lucknow for the film ‘The Prayag Raj’ being directed by Anish Sharon Khan. “My father was from Agra and it’s this Hindi connect that helped in my career.

Deepshikha plays actor Mukesh Tiwari wife in the film. “It’s a political drama and I’m playing a ‘dabangg’ wife of this politician.

Vangmun village council president Zosangliana received the two extortion notices signed by Md. D Bwskang, self-styled deputy collector of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Twipra Kingdom, that was led by the banned terrorist group National Liberation Front of Twipra ( NLFT) on October 23.

We are trying to verify the genuineness of the two notices, however, we have started our investigation,” officer-in-charge of Vangmun police station Shyamal Murasingh told reporters. According to the village council president, the notices demanded Rs 200 from each household.

The Madhya Pradesh government has raised the age from 40 to 60 years. In a series of tweets on Sunday, Nath accused the state government of reducing the retirement age of class IV government employees from 62 to 60 years. “Shivraj government’s decision to reduce the retirement age of class IV employees from 62 to 60 years amounts to cheating them. The decision is going to create a crisis for them,” he tweeted. “How will the government pay gratuity and pension to these employees when it’s not in a position to pay arrears to them?“Government has got exposed for its bad intentions before polling. BJP government should reconsider its decision, otherwise Congress will cancel such anti-employees decisions on being voted to power,” the former CM added.Defending the government, CM Chouhan underlined that no such decision has been taken to reduce the retirement age of the government employees. “Kamal Nath ji, how do you face yourself in the mirror every morning? You are spreading rumours on seeing imminent defeat in bypolls”, said CM Chouhan. He added, “Despite being a former chief minister you didn’t try to know before you tweeted that the notification issued by General Administration department (GAD) is concerning class IV employees appointed in ministers’ staff for a period till the ministers remain on their positions. In fact, their age limit to remain in the ministers’ staff has been extended from 40 to 60 years. The retirement age of class IV employees continues to remain 62.” The CM’s tweets were immediately followed by the GAD’s clarification issued on the notification, despite Sunday being the weekly holiday in the government. The department stated that the 18-40 age limit of the class IV employees appointed in ministers’ staff as per ministers’ wishes has been amended as 18-60 and that there is no change in the retirement age of the class IV employees of the state government. Later, Kamal Nath thanked the government while posting the GAD’s clarification on his Twitter account and said Congress always stood by the government employees. It would continue to fight to protect their rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamal-nath-vs-shivraj-chouhan-over-class-iv-employees-retirement-age/story-YctZQJbmrG1MmaHQCyBcqJ.html

The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM 2.5 pollution was 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday, the second highest this season so far.Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.Also read | Coldest October in 58 years, but numerous farm fires keep Delhi air in ICUNASA’s satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  SAFAR said air quality has not improved much despite improved ventilation due to high stubble-related intrusion and trapping of pollutants during night time due to low wintertime boundary layer height. “However, it has not deteriorated further despite favourable North-North-Westerly boundary level wind direction. The highly favourable conditions for fire-related intrusion in Delhi is expected to continue,” it said.SAFAR predicted better ventilation for the next two days but said the AQI is likely to improve only marginally, depending on farm fires. It is set to deteriorate slightly on November 3, it said.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 370 at 3 pm. The 24-hour average AQI was 367 on Saturday.

North Bengal also has some long-term issues, which will be solved constitutionally with a futuristic point of view,” said the governor who arrived in Siliguri on Saturday. He will spend one month at Darjeeling Raj Bhavan when he is expected to meet representatives from several political parties.Also expressing concern over the law and order situation in the state, he alleged that the government officials are working like political servants when they should work like public servants.“The law and order situation of the state has become a matter of concern. Political killings are happening every week. Figures of rape incidents have gone up. People are making bombs in open places. Moreover, the state DGP is not coming (to meet me) despite several calls (from Raj Bhavan),” the governor said during his interaction with media here.On the roles of Centre as well as the state, the governor said both are two wheels of development and it is their duty to work together for the betterment of the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-bengal-s-long-term-issues-too-will-be-solved-like-article-370-and-ram-mandir-jagdeep-dhankhar/story-KZpGkJtpGDP9c1xLYdrDIL.html

Cloning of Facebook profiles is one such tactic to retrieve information that has been rampant of late.Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has issued a letter raising an alarm about the cloning of their jawans’ Facebook profiles. “It has been observed that anti-social elements and people with malicious intent are using Facebook profile cloning to target vulnerable users. This scam is also being used to target security forces and extract confidential information,” the CRPF said in the recent letter issued to the jawans deployed in sensitive locations such as Jammu and Kashmir and red zones.Besides, CRPF’s social media team has also issued a “Manual on Social Media Cloning” and prepared a video to educate the jawans about how Facebook profile cloning is used to target security personnel, and how it can be prevented.According to a senior CRPF officer, there has been a series of complaints from jawans in the last few months about their friends and family members receiving a variety of requests from their cloned profiles. In one such case, friends of a jawan, deployed in a sensitive location, were asked to send details of his location, as “he was untraceable”. In most such cases, money was also demanded from the jawans’ family and friends.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crpf-warns-jawans-of-facebook-profile-cloning-to-extract-confidential-information/story-KFzePLjuI17NWAGfN8YYaN.html
01-11-2020||India||We backed independent in RS polls to expose BJP-BSP tacit understanding: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav has said that his party supported independent nominee Prakash Bajaj for the upcoming Rajya Sabha (RS) elections from Uttar Pradesh (UP) to expose what he called a “tacit understanding” between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).“We wanted voting in the RS polls to expose which party is aligning with whom,” he said. The former CM shared this comment with media persons on Saturday on the sidelines of an event held by the party on the birth anniversary of socialist leader Acharya Narendra Dev.“Those who are inspired by socialist ideals chose to support the independent candidate for the RS polls in a bid to underscore the fact that BSP is in cahoots with the BJP,” Yadav said.The SP chief said that the BJP could enter into an electoral understanding with any party of its choice, but such tacit deals needed to be exposed. Yadav hit out at the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in UP for its alleged failure to nurture the Gomti riverfront development project in Lucknow, which was initiated by his government that was in power between 2012 and 2017. Similarly, he singled out the lack of expansion of Lucknow Metro, which was also started by his government.Earlier on October 27, Prakash Bajaj (38), a lawyer, had queered the pitch for the upcoming RS polls, when he had filed nomination papers at the last moment. He was supported by 10 SP lawmakers. His entry into the electoral fray implied a contest in the RS polls, as there were 11 candidates for 10 vacant seats. The BJP fielded eight candidates and the SP and the BSP one each.Bajaj’s entry made BSP candidate Ramji Gautam’s prospects uncertain, as the party did not have the requisite 37 votes to secure an outright win. To make matters worse, seven BSP rebel legislators had met Yadav last week and thrown their lot behind the rival SP. Clarity emerged and Gautam’s winning chances brightened after the returning officer (RO) rejected Bajaj’s nomination last Thursday.On the same day, BSP president Mayawati suspended the seven rebel MLAs. She declared that her party would vote for any other political outfit, including the BJP, to ensure the SP is taught a lesson in the UP Legislative Council elections slated to be held in January.She also rued her decisions such as forging an alliance with the SP in last year’s parliament elections and withdrawing the 1995 guest house case against Yadav and his father and former UP CM Mulayam Singh Yadav.RS polls will be held on November 9 and the results will be announced on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-backed-independent-in-rs-polls-to-expose-bjp-bsp-tacit-understanding-akhilesh/story-kwyAsJP3zmYAmRJlqXJzHK.html

Officials said the operation to recapture the tigress was like a hide and seek game but they managed to tranquillize the animal within 24 hours of its escape. A team led by Dr Aurn Zacharia spotted the animal and tranquillized it. Officials said it was tired and would need some time to get out of the effect of the tranquillizer. State Forest Minister K Raju said a decision on the rehabilitation of the big cat will be taken after its recovery. Some experts want it to be released back into the wild but others want it to be shifted to a zoo. Officials said it will seek the advice of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). The tigress was trapped in Wayanad last week and brought to Neyyar for treatment and rehabilitation but broke the cage and escaped Saturday afternoon triggering enough panic in the area. Personnel of the rapid response team of the forest department guarded the park all night to prevent it from coming out of the park though it was fenced. The forest department was worried that in case the tigress escaped from the park it could head into a populated area near a lake adjoining the safari.The animal was trapped in Wayanad last week after it killed many domestic animals and triggered panic in the area. After it was captured, forest officials discovered that it was slightly injured and decided to shift it to Neyyar Safari Park for treatment. Meanwhile, the government has announced Rs 10 lakh relief to a tribal youth killed in elephant attack in Aralam Farm in Kannur, north Kerala on Saturday. Local people said he was the eighth person to be killed by an elephant this year. “An elephant herd had strayed and were staying in the fringe areas of the forest for some time. We will continue our efforts to push them into the deep forests,” the forest minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-cat-recaptured-24-hours-after-it-escaped-from-cage-in-kerala/story-RK0SvZvSFfSfSmiG8rZF1L.html

Without naming the Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Modi said that some parties were working for the welfare of their families instead of the development state. “Self-serving dynasts treat the state and government as their personal properties. No one from the families of Modi or Nitish Babu has reached the corridors of power,” the PM said in a speech in Samastipur. Addressing the people of 24 assembly constituencies from Chapra and 21 assembly seats from Samastipur, PM Modi said the high turnover in the first phase of Bihar assembly polls on October 28 had proved political pundits wrong. “The trends from the first phase of polls show the NDA is coming back to power again. It is clear that {chief minister} Nitish Kumar is all set to form government again,” said the PM. The second phase of elections on November 3 is crucial in the NDA’s quest to return to power. Out of the 94 seats going to the polls in the second phase, the BJP is contesting 46 and Nitish Kunar’s Janata Dal (United), or JD (U), 43. The remaining five seats are being contested by their smaller partners. In 2015, the JD (U) had won 30 of the seats that are up for grabs on November 3. This time, it has fielded 19 new faces; the fate of two ministers will be decided in the phase. For the BJP, the second phase is equally crucial in its quest to emerge as the single biggest party in the assembly . The party contested 29 seats in first phase and will contest 35 more in the third phase on November 7. Without taking the name of any political party, but in an oblique reference to the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) of the late Ram Vilas Paswan, Modi said efforts by some to create confusion in the minds of the voters had been nullified by the people of Bihar. LJP leader Chirag Paswan has pulled the party out of the NDA in Bihar, citing ideological differences with Nitish Kumar, while remaining in the alliance at the Centre “On one hand, you have a government with double engines {at the Centre and state}; on the other hand, there are two prince (referring to RJD lader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and Congress’s Rahul Gandhi). While the double engine government of Bihar is committed to the state’s development, the two princes are busy saving their thrones,” he added. “You must have seen 3-4 years ago during UP elections, double Yuvarajs there as well, climbed on top of the bus, wore black jackets and used to visit villages while waving,” he added in an apparent reference to the Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi. Targeting young voters who are seemingly distancing themselves from the present government, Modi asked women of the state to tell them about the situation that existed in Bihar 15 years ago. “First-time voters should remember how much effort it took to pull out the state out of this situation. Ask your mothers how they feared kidnappers...The lantern has only spread darkness,” he said, referring to the RJD’s election symbol. “I am sure that with your vote you will save Bihar from getting bimaar {sick} again,” the PM said. The PM said the government had opened up 30 passport centres, including one in Gopalganj, for those aspiring to go abroad, adding that now there was no need to travel all the way to Patna to secure a passport. The region has one of the populations employed in West Asia. “We have removed the language barrier by emphasizing the {importance of the} mother tongue as the medium of instruction in the new education policy,” he said. “The Bihar government laid special emphasis on providing electricity, water and road connectivity to people across the state,” Modi said, adding that the Centre had implemented railway projects worth Rs. 2,500 crore in the state. PM said that the BJP has decided to form 1,000 farmer producer organizations in Bihar. “Also, the central government has created a fund of ₹1 lakh crore for agriculture infrastructure for our farmers,” the PM said.With the biggest festival of Bihar, Chhath Puja, taking place after the election results are out on November 10, Modi appealed to the sentiments of women. “I want to tell the mothers in Bihar, your son in Delhi will make sure you celebrate Chhath Puja with pride. I won’t let your family sleep hungry at night. We have ensured free grains for the poor till Chhath puja,” he said Modi accused the opposition of politicising the February 14, 2019 Pulwama terror attack, which left 40 paramilitary troopers dead, and demoralising the armed forces. “The Pakistani admission has shown the real face of opposition,” he said in an apparent reference to an admission by a Pakistani politician that Pakistan had a hand in the attack. He paid rich tributes to the 20 Indian troops who died in a June 15 clash with Chinese soldiers in the Galwan valley in Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/self-serving-dynasts-treat-state-govt-as-personal-properties-modi-in-bihar/story-oKIxKV3HbqwKgC02T6lHKK.html

The service will begin on November 8, and booking of tickets will start from tomorrow,” he said.The Ropax ferry vehicle can transport up to 550 passengers, 30 trucks, seven smaller trucks, and 100 two- wheelers in one trip. It will be an all-weather service which will operate all 12 months irrespective of the weather conditions and high tide, Mandaviya said.“The coast of Saurashtra is full of potential. There are a number of cement, steel and ship breaking industries, with markets in south India. Through sea connectivity, distance and time can be saved, and such a service will play a big role in industrial development,” he said.This will be important to reduce road, railway congestion, reduce traffic accidents and control pollution,” he added.“We have identified, mapped and studied the potential of destinations across the 7500 km Indian sea coast and are going to start similar services on many destinations across the country,” the Union minister said.“On November 8, Modiji will also launch similar services in Kochi (in Kerala), one on the Brahmaputra river in Assam, and one joining the North East to Kolkata. A service connecting Karimganj in Assam over the Barak river to Bangladesh will also be launched,” he said.The new Ropax service in Gujarat comes after a Ro-Ro (roll on-roll off) ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej in Bharuch district, launched by the PM in October 2017, was suspended last year due to siltation and unavailability of adequate draft to carry the vessel.Mandaviya said the Ro-Ro service was affected due to siltation caused by flood in the Narmada river connecting the sea, and now only a small vessel requiring limited draft and carrying only passengers will operate between Ghogha and Dahej.“We cannot run Ro-Ro service between Dahej and Ghogha as there isn’t adequate draft, and de-siltation is not financially feasible...we will run small vessels between Ghogha and Dahej that require limited draft,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-ghogha-hazira-ropax-ferry-service-in-gujarat-on-november-8/story-VrDfxWUkF5ZBuZmbx3EeBI.html

One militant was also captured alive during the operation that was launched in the morning on a specific information, police said.

01-11-2020||India||Bengal governor targets Trinamool govt over Darjeeling’s fugitive leader||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Sunday targeted the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) government over the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha’s (GJM) fugitive leader Bimal Gurung, who had recently emerged from hiding after three years and offered support to chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Gurung, who had been on the run after Bengal government invoked the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, (UAPA) 1967 against him in three years ago, previously backed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which wrested the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat thrice in 2009, 2014 and 2019.The Gorkha leader had founded the GJM in 2007 and ensured a 104-day shutdown in the Darjeeling hills in 2017 in demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland for the ethnic minority Nepali-speaking people. He was charged under the UAPA, 1967 and various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) following the agitation. Dhankar spoke to the media persons in Siliguri – the biggest town in north Bengal – prior to his departure for his month-long stay at the British-era Raj Bhawan in Darjeeling town.He singled out the Banerjee-led administration for meeting Gurung, whom he obliquely referred to as a criminal. However, he stopped short of naming the GJM founder. His statement is significant because the TMC has welcomed Gurung’s decision to leave the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre and support Banerjee. “Those who think of destroying democracy have been destroyed invariably. No matter how big you are, no one is above law … A fugitive of law is a fugitive of society and must be uniformly treated. If anyone is not equal before the law, it is wrong. If I meet a wanted criminal, I shall be at fault,” said Dhankhar. Dhankhar said a prudent and pragmatic approach is needed to find a permanent political solution to the long-pending issues in the Darjeeling hills. He said he would try to understand the issues. The people from the Darjeeling hills have agitated for decades in demand for a separate state. The BJP had promised in its election manifestos that it would find a permanent political solution. “No matter how complex, complicated and emotive the problems are, they are not bigger than Article 370, more complicated than Ram temple and more emotive than the triple talaq issue. The solution should be found through a politically prudent and pragmatic approach,” said Dhankhar. Gautam Deb, Bengal minister for tourism, who belongs to Siliguri, said, “The governor should resign since he is working like a politician.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-targets-trinamool-govt-over-darjeeling-s-fugitive-leader/story-cevUt72WlQrhIjpt9TeFrK.html

Two separate first information reports (FIRs) have been registered at the Kuchaykot police station following the violent clashes between the party workers ahead of the second phase of the polls, slated to be held on Tuesday (November 3), and abduction of two persons, who were later released. The district administration deployed additional security forces to maintain law and order. Tension prevailed in the village on Sunday morning and the villagers remained indoors following the clashes, where six people sustained injuries, including one person whose condition is stated to be critical. The police are yet to make any arrest, despite two FIRs were registered. Congress supporters Pravin Kumar Dubey lodged the first FIR, where he alleged that the sitting JD (U) lawmaker from Kuchaykot, Amrendra Kumar alias Pappu Pandey, and his supporters attacked his house, thrashed people and abducted two persons — Nanhe Dubey and Rajiv Ranjan Dubey — from the village. Pravin also alleged that the MLA Pandey thrashed his wife Umrawati Devi, snatched her gold chain at gunpoint and threatened her with dire consequences. Ajay Dubey of the JD (U) lodged the second FIR, where he alleged that six people, including Pravin and Bhola Dubey, had attacked him while he was returning to Narayanpur from the nearest town in the district.Ashwini Kumar Tiwari, station house officer (SHO), Kuchaykot police station, said the incident occurred at around 10:30 pm, when both JD (U) and Congress workers were campaigning in Narayanpur village. A free-for-all ensued between the rival party supporters following an altercation. The SHO said that one of the abducted persons Rajiv Ranjan was rescued from the Chhapur village in the district, while Nanhe was released hours after the incident. Manoj Tiwrai, superintendent of police (SP), Gopalganj, said that an investigation into the fracas is in progress. One of the FIRs has named lawmaker Pandey, Ajay Dubey, Shyam Bihari Pandey, Shailesh Ojha, and six other unnamed people. Ojha heads the Bikrampur panchayat in the district.Congress workers have alleged that they retaliated after some JD (U) workers misbehaved with them. However, the rival JD (U) supporters have denied the allegation and claimed to have been attacked by the Congress workers. SP Tiwari said talks are on with village elders to restore peace and normalcy in Narayanpur and the law and order situation is under control, as no further untoward incident has been reported. MLA Pandey has been evading arrest since May after his name figured in a triple murder case.The third and last phase of 243-member Bihar legislative assembly elections will be held on Saturday (November 7).The election results will be announced on November 10. This is the first assembly election to be held amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jd-u-cong-workers-clash-in-bihar-2-firs-lodged/story-kMMM1qMlaKqdyE6bOQoz6I.html

They don’t have information. They don’t have any logic. They just want to oppose everything for politics. They are spreading fear and misinformation. They said NDA will do away with SC/ST reservation. But it is the NDA government which extended the reservation for 10 years.”“There was a time when people in Bihar were scared of coming out of a car showroom with their new car because they knew they will be looted.

Forest fires are generally reported in Uttarakhand from February to June with a peak usually in May and June. But despite the onset of winter in the state and even snowfall in higher reaches like the Kedarnath area, forest areas in places like Uttarkashi are reporting fires. Sandeep Kumar, divisional forest officer of Uttarkashi forest division said, “Around eight forest fire incidents have been reported in the past few days from the Ganga valley leading to the loss of nine hectares of forest. The forest fires are being reported due to dryness in the forests because of a lack of rainfall. Many ranges in the division last received rain in mid-August and forests have become dry now.” The official said that after repeated instances of forest fire, the department will soon start controlled burning in fire lines before heavy snowfall starts in the region. In the early hours of Sunday, forest fire was reported from parts of Yamuna valley in the district. Mayur Dixit, district magistrate of Uttarkashi district said, “Forest fire was reported from parts of Yamuna valley in the early hours of Sunday, which were brought under control by afternoon. To manage the fire, we had taken help from personnel from Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) along with the district disaster management team.” According to the records of the state forest department, 135 incidents of forest fire have been reported in the state till November 1 this year with 68.33 hectares of reserve forests being affected. Uttarakhand forests are prone to forest fires, with its vast forest cover especially that of tropical dry deciduous forest, subtropical pine forest. While some fires are caused by human activity, lightning and friction from falling rocks also spark forest fires. Over 44,554 hectares of forest area or an area of roughly 61,000 football grounds have been damaged in forest fires in Uttarakhand since its formation in 2000, accruing a loss of over Rs 185 lakh, according to the forest department’s reply to an RTI query recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-to-start-controlled-burning-in-uttarkashi-to-check-forest-fires/story-ZkjqO9al66yrlNsj4baVQP.html

The government only male tall claims of making Bihar self-reliant. But they never created any opportunity for women employment in the state,” the Congress tweeted from its official handle.  भाजपा-जदयू ठगबंधन चुनाव में 'बेटी बचाओ' के नारे लगाता है। लेकिन चुनाव में बेटियों को प्रताड़ित करने वालों को टिकट देकर चुनाव लड़वाता है। भाजपा-जदयू के दोहरेपन का जनता जवाब देगी। #महिला_विरोधी_नीतीश_मोदी pic.twitter.com/bI6esIxPAz When a govt is run by leaders that respect women, it shows. #महिला_विरोधी_नीतीश_मोदी pic.twitter.com/74CZEwmO5E“The Nitish Kumar government didn’t do anything to stop evil social practices like dowry in the state,” the Congress said.Click here for full coverage of Bihar Assembly Election 2020Comparing crime rates of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar with that of Punjab, the Congress said, “When a government is run by leaders that respect women, it shows.”According to the data that the party Congress tweeted, in 2018, there were 2,521 dowry deaths in Uttar Pradesh and 1,111 in Bihar.

Singh also rejected allegations of any hidden understanding with Paswan’s party, saying the BJP believes in fair politics and doesn’t play with the trust of the people.“Chirag and his party would have their own reasons for leaving the alliance. But I don’t think LJP would have any impact on the ruling BJP-JD(U) alliance in Bihar assembly polls. Our alliance will win the elections and form the next government in the state,” he said.When pointed out that Paswan in his election campaign was only attacking Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and not the BJP, Singh said, “Personal animosity is not good for healthy politics. It should be avoided and I myself also don’t practice such politics.” The former BJP president also termed as baseless the allegations of a hidden understanding between the BJP and the LJP. “BJP believes in fair politics and doesn’t play with the trust of the people,” he said.   Expressing concern over hate speeches and personal remarks being made against each other by leaders of all political parties, Singh said there is no place for hatred in healthy politics and elections should not be contested and won by spreading hatred among people. “I myself never resorted to such tactics,” he said.Read more: Army Chief Naravane’s Nepal visit to break ice, Oli wants Pancheshwar project revived “Bitterness, acidic remarks and personal attacks against each other in speeches should be avoided. It is not good for a healthy democracy. Rather, there should be discussion, debates and even arguments on issues of public interest,” he said.Singh, who has addressed more than a dozen political rallies in Bihar and is scheduled to address many rallies in the coming days, said the response he witnessed in his public meetings is highly indicative that the BJP-JD(U) alliance will win the elections in the state. “The alliance, in the Bihar assembly polls, will reap the benefits of effective implementation of the Central government’s welfare schemes. At the same time the state government under Nitish Kumar has also performed well and the people will vote for it,” he said.Singh, the seniormost minister in the central government, said the Modi dispensation “ended the crisis of credibility” in politics. “Modi government delivered on its promises and its track record establishes that. On the other hand the opposition, whether in Bihar or at the national level, lacks credibility as it always failed to fulfil its commitments,” he said.Watch: Bihar polls | ‘Double engine NDA govt pitted against oppn’s 2 Yuvaraj’: PM ModiOn Tejaswi Yadav’s rallies attracting huge crowds, Singh said the rallies of BJP leaders are also being attended by people in large numbers. “You yourself saw attendance in my rallies and you must have seen the massive crowds in Prime Minister Modi’s rallies. Public meetings organised by BJP are attracting huge crowds. It will be unfair to exaggerate about public meetings of one party and its leaders,” he said.Asked if the NDA was shrinking as some of its oldest constituents have left the ruling alliance, Singh said the alliance is still a “big united family”. Without naming any party, Singh said, “Those who left NDA moved out of the alliance for their respective reasons. In politics you never know when anyone can become your ally”.On whether the NDA’s doors were still open for its erstwhile allies, he said, “The NDA’s doors are always open for those who want to contribute in the development of India. But we cannot compromise on our development agenda and the core issues of our ideology”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hate-speeches-personal-remarks-by-leaders-not-good-for-healthy-democracy-rajnath-singh/story-Vkksfjl3jm5zBdXubqHzFO.html
01-11-2020||India||Covid-19 overhaulers experience skin problems, says study||A new analysis suggests that some patients with Covid-19 have persistent skin-related symptoms long after they recover from the initial infection.The findings, presented at the 29th Congress of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology by investigators at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), point to another burden experienced by so-called “long haulers” who get better but don’t seem to fully recover from Covid-19. For the analysis, researchers established an international registry for Covid-19 skin manifestations in April 2020, in collaboration with the International League of Dermatological Societies and the American Academy of Dermatology.Clinicians were contacted in June and August to update Covid-19 laboratory test results and the duration of patients’ Covid-19 skin symptoms. The team defined long haulers as anyone with skin symptoms of Covid-19 that persisted for at least 60 days. The team evaluated almost 1,000 cases of patients with skin manifestations of Covid-19. Among 224 total suspected cases and 90 laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 from 39 countries with information on symptom duration, the median duration of symptoms was 12 days.Rash-like morbilliform and urticarial eruptions lasted a median of seven days and four days, respectively, for patients with lab-confirmed Covid-19, with a maximum duration of 28 days. Papulosquamous eruptions, which are scaly papules and plaques, lasted a median of 20 days in lab-confirmed cases, with one confirmed long hauler eruption lasting 70 days. Pernio/chilblains, or redness and swelling of the feet and hands, commonly known as “Covid toes,” lasted a median of 15 days in patients with suspected Covid-19 and 10 days in lab-confirmed cases. Notably, six patients with pernio/chilblains were long haulers with toe symptoms lasting at least 60 days, with two lab-confirmed patients with Covid toes lasting longer than 130 days.“Our findings reveal a previously unreported subset of patients with long-standing skin symptoms from Covid-19, in particular those with Covid toes. This data adds to our knowledge about the long-term effects of Covid-19 in different organ systems. The skin is potentially a visible window into inflammation that could be going on in the body,” said senior author Esther E. Freeman, MD, PhD, director of Global Health Dermatology at MGH. “We encourage clinicians taking care of patients with Covid-19 to ask about and evaluate any skin symptoms. Health care providers can enter information into our registry to further our understanding of the dermatologic effects of Covid-19,” added Freeman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-overhaulers-experience-skin-problems-says-study/story-CHq66IJY0pGpdu7V7AHhbN.html
01-11-2020||India||Is Tamil Nadu hitting a Covid-19 plateau?||As new infections of Covid-19 dro p across the country, numbers from Tamil Nadu appear to stand out. While the majority of the country saw a mid-September peak, Tamil Nadu exhibited a curious trend. The seven-day average peaked in the state in the last week of July when it touched 6,803, and then settled on a long plateau between 6,100 and 5,500 till mid-October, and finally started to decline fast ending October with 2,627 cases a day on average. This in itself is not so surprising. What makes it so is that while cases dropped 61% in this period, testing increased by 18%. Between July 29 and October 31, the average daily tests have gone up from 62,986 to 74,199. Daily tests touched a peak of 90,049 for the week ending October 15. Put simply, since July 29, when the average daily cases peaked, Tamil Nadu has recorded first, a plateau and then, a decline, in the number of positive cases all the while keeping its testing relatively high. Its positivity rate — the fraction of tests that return positive — touched a peak of 12.5% in the first week of June (one out of every eight tests conducted that week came back positive). In the second week of October, it dropped below the 5% mark for the first time. In the last week of October, the positivity rate dropped further to 3.5% -- making it the only state among India’s 10 worst-hit regions (other than Uttar Pradesh) that has dropped below the 5% threshold. According to recommendations by the World Health Organization, if the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme drops below 5% for at least two weeks, it can be considered that the outbreak is under control in the region. Tamil Nadu is also one of the only states in the country uses the results of only Reverse Transcription Polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR kits and not the less accurate but faster antigen tests done by private labs. A rapid antigen test can miss as much as 50% infected patients, and thus a greater share of rapid antigen tests in a region may lead to a lower positivity rate there. Uttar Pradesh, which like Tamil Nadu, has dropped below the 5% mark largely relies on antigen tests. The Tamil Nadu health department, however, isn’t ready to make any grand claims yet. “There should be no room for complacency. We are near a place where we can either take a downturn or an upswing,” state health secretary J Radhakrishnan said, when asked whether the state has begun to plateau. “As a group of 37 districts we may present the picture of a plateau. But it is not a district-level plateau.” Testing strategy At present, 202 government and private laboratories test for the Sars-Cov-2 infection. Tamil Nadu has the capacity to test up to 120,000 to 125,000 swab samples per day. However, rather than fix a target of a specific number of tests that need to be conducted, the state has been drawing samples that are 10 times the average of the positive cases they record in any area, zone or district. This strategy was initially followed in Chennai and by July-end, it was rolled out to all districts. “This target is common sense,” Radhakrishnan said. Coimbatore district with the third highest caseload following Chennai and Chengalpattu is testing 18 times the case average. “Compared to other districts, we have always been testing in high numbers but sometime after May in a video meeting, the chief secretary [of Tamil Nadu K Shanmugam] announced that it is compulsory to test 10 people minimum for every one person who turns positive minimum,” Ramesh Kumar, deputy director of health services, Coimbatore, said. In Chennai, this testing is at least 12 to 13 times more than the average weekly positives, said Commissioner of Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) G Prakash. The capital city with the highest caseload in the state has been testing between 11,000-14,000 samples every day since June. “We have ramped up our capacity and we can take up to 21,000 tests per day across 47 labs (government and private),” Prakash said. “Right now, I don’t visualise a drastic need to increase testing as cases are stable and flattening. It’s a decision to be taken using availability of resources and utility of the outcome. We are confident these numbers are enough for now.” When asked whether increasing the number of tests could show more positive cases — and thus disprove the plateau theory conclusively — the civic chief disagreed. “For the sake of achieving targets, the system will catch hold of random subjects. It serves no purpose. If the scenario is prolonging we need to give micro focus on geographies of where we are testing,” Prakash said. “The state is testing from an administrative point of view which is acceptable,” says Dr Jacob John, retired professor and former director of the ICMR’s Centre of Advanced Research in Virology. “Decisions are made based on the previous week’s numbers so if your caseload is low, your contacts for testing will also be low. Testing the disease from a science of public health point of view will not work in India.” Is this a plateau? Experts said that a decreasing positivity rate could indicate that the virus is slowing down. “We can safely say that the growth rate is not worrisome and that is categorically evidenced with doubling time,” G. Prakash said. Doubling time is the number of days it takes for cases to double and is used as a measure of the rate of growing cases. A high doubling time indicates a reduced rate of growth. For Chennai, it went up from 63 days on August 3 to 110 days on October 9. “On an average Chennai’s doubling time is 93 days now because of the control systems in place and the population’s immunity,” Prakash said. In Tamil Nadu, the doubling time has increased from 17 days in mid-June to 23 days in mid-July, 37 days in mid-August, 59 days in mid-September and 73 days as of October 3. In the last week of October, the doubling rate in Tamil Nadu was 189 days, significantly better than national average of 122 days. After September’s unlockdown, Chennai has intensified testing vendors and shopkeepers in market places and employees of banks. “We crossed 100,000 tests in this section with a 4-5% positivity rate,” Prakash said. “One person has the possibility to affect thousands and become superspreaders, so we have controlled this section.” On ground Meanwhile Chennai continues its door-to-door surveillance, which it started in July. Fever camps (attended by more 3 million people from whom 173,000 swabs were drawn) were held in residential areas during the lockdown. These camps are now conducted in the evenings and at night. “The thinking is that people can transmit the virus from home to office and vice-versa,” Radhakrishnan said. In addition to the home quarantine and isolation monitoring system, Chennai still has containment zones, but the civic chief has left it up to the local sanitary officer to decide whether to quarantine an infected person’s home or their entire street depending on the movement of people. Chennai’s sero-survey in July-August reported that 2,673 people or 21.5% were found to have developed IgG antibodies to the virus making 80% of the population still susceptible. The second prevalence survey started a week ago in the city and will be carried out for the next two months. As of the second-last week of October, 6,389 blood samples were tested and 2,062 people presented IgG antibodies meaning 32.3% or one in three Chennaities were immune to the virus. The study is on-going. A private hospital in Chengalpet district told HT that the Covid-19 cases have gradually been declining. “I’ve shut down 2 out of 4 ICUs,” said the director of medical services of the hospital on condition of anonymity. “We used to have 200 cases all the time but since last week it has come down to 120 cases. We have to wait for at least two weeks to see we have flattened the curve,” the director said. “Unless all the districts simultaneously come down, our cases will not come down,” Radhakrishnan said “This pandemic is giving a mixed picture. All our calculations, projections and herd immunity have been proved wrong. Tamil Nadu has shown a dip in the last couple of days but it may go up. The numbers are not following our expectations,” Jacob John said.

Additionally, the requirement for travellers to home quarantine themselves for 14 days has also been removed.As per the latest standard operating procedure issued by the administration on October 30, all the other ‘Unlock’ instructions shall remain in place till November 30.The Vaishno Devi shrine located atop the Trikuta hills in Reasi district was reopened for the devotees after a five-month gap in August. It was shut for five months due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown. The shrine was reopened on August 16 with an initial cap of 2,000 pilgrims permitted in the premises per day, including 100 from outside Jammu and Kashmir as per the SOPs.The registration of devotees for the pilgrimage is still allowed only through online mode to avoid mass gathering of people at the yatra registration counters which could lead to the spread of the deadly Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19. The disease was declared a global pandemic in March by the World Health Organisation (WHO).For the ease of the devotees, accommodation facilities at the Bhawan, Katra, Ardhkuwari and Jammu are available. These facilities follow all the SOPs prescribed for Covid-19.Other facilities like battery-powered vehicles, helicopter services and passenger ropeway have also been set up by the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board for the convenience of devotees during the yatra (pilgrimage). However, they have to follow all the Covid-19 guidelines and social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-protocols-relaxed-15-000-pilgrims-can-now-visit-vaishno-devi-temple-every-day/story-TSZwLBabeY87ZM9IPEufsJ.html

01-11-2020||India||Risking being ‘BJP lite’ will end up making ‘Congress zero’: Shashi Tharoor||Secularism as principle and practice in India is in “danger” and the ruling dispensation may even try to remove the word from the Constitution, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said, but asserted that “forces of hatred” cannot alter the country’s secular character. Secularism is only a word and even if the government takes it out of the Constitution, it would still be a secular Constitution because of its basic structure, Tharoor told PTI in an interview on his new book ‘The Battle of Belonging’. He also asserted that the Congress party cannot risk trying to become ‘BJP Lite’ as it may end up making it ‘Congress Zero’ and said his party was not offering a watered-down version of the BJP’s political messaging and the spirit of Indian secularism was very much “alive and well” in the grand old party. Asked about his party being accused of peddling in soft Hindutva, Tharoor said he does recognise that there’s a very real and tangible concern for some liberal Indians over the issue, but asserted that “we in the Congress party are very clear that we cannot allow ourselves to become a BJP-lite”. “I have long argued that any attempt to emulate ‘Pepsi Lite’ by ‘BJP Lite’ will end up with us becoming like ‘Coke Zero’ -- that is, ‘Congress Zero’,” the former Union minister said.Read more: Army Chief Naravane’s Nepal visit to break ice, Oli wants Pancheshwar project revived “Congress is not BJP in any shape or form, and we should not attempt to be a lighter version of something we are not. Nor are we trying to, in my view,” he said. Underlining that the Congress makes a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, Tharoor said the Hinduism that “we respect is inclusive and non-judgemental”, whereas Hindutva is a political doctrine based on exclusion.“So we are not offering a watered-down version of the BJP’s political messaging: Rahul Gandhi has made it explicitly clear that, for all his avowing his personal Hinduism by going to temples, he does not support any form of Hindutva, neither soft nor hard,” the MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.Asked if the Congress needs to talk about secularism more often then it has been doing of late, Tharoor said he disagrees with the assertion that the Congress has not talked about secularism enough and the party on every opportunity has stressed its unshakeable commitment to secularism. On Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari’s recent dig at Chief Minister Uddhav Thackrey over secularism, the Congress leader said he did suggest that Koshyari should be given a different letterhead to express such ideas, rather than the official “Raj Bhavan notepaper”.On whether the word ‘secularism’ in the Constitution was in imminent danger, he said, “The word is only a word; but even if the government takes the word ‘secularism’ out of the Constitution, it is still a secular Constitution.” After all, freedom of worship, freedom to profess and propagate your religion, freedom of expression, minority rights, and equality of all citizens, are all part of the basic structure of the Constitution, and they can’t disappear by deleting a word, he asserted.Watch: ‘Pak minister admitted role in Pulwama attack’: Rajnath Singh hits out at opposition “The ruling dispensation may well try to do that: there is certainly a concerted effort to erode secularism and replace it with a sectarian way of being that offers no place to religious minorities in Indian society,” he said. “Secularism as principle and practice is in danger, but I do not see it falling anytime soon: India embodies tolerance and pluralism in its very essence, and I do not believe that forces of hatred can permanently overcome our fundamental secularism,” he said. However, Tharoor cautioned that people must not let their guards down and must continue to oppose such regressive ideas wherever they arise.Talking about the controversy over a Tanishq advertisement which showed an inter-faith marriage and had to be withdrawn after a social media backlash, Tharoor said it offered yet another illustration of how “reactionary and bigoted certain right-wing fringe elements” have become, even as the ruling dispensation was quick to distance itself from the episode. “But let us not forget that this is a Frankenstein’s monster that they have created, sustained through organised and vicious social media trolls, and it’s just one more reminder of the appalling power of the full-throated communal hatred that is so often unleashed in today’s India,” he said.“As I have said, if such people are so infuriated by Hindu-Muslim ‘ekatvam’, why not boycott the world’s longest-surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity: India itself?” he asked.On whether Hindutva had gained mass popularity, Tharoor said the BJP holds a commanding parliamentary majority, but it has worked overtime to suppress dissenting voices and in that sense, it is difficult to get an accurate gauge of support for Hindutva among ordinary Indians. Asked about Congress leader P Chidambaram’s recent remarks calling for the restoration of Article 370 and its criticism by the BJP, Tharoor said he has articulated his stand clearly within Parliament. “It’s not just an issue of abrogating 370 -– even (Jawaharlal) Nehru ji had said the provision was a temporary one. But the Constitution specifies how it is to be done,” he said. “So though it shouldn’t matter what side of the debate on Article 370 you stand on -- after all, differing voices are the lifeline of any democracy -- the manner in which it was implemented, the way our own fellow citizens were overnight clamped down upon by their own government, consciously and willfully disregarding the democratically enshrined rights guaranteed to all Indians, does not bode well for the future of the country,” he said. No political objective can justify the huge-scale abuse of the rights of Indian citizens in this manner, Tharoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/risking-being-bjp-lite-will-end-up-making-congress-zero-shashi-tharoor/story-uJS7yEMaNJtz7CYUaOxuOO.html
01-11-2020||India||Govt looks to set up 14 more water aerodromes for seaplane services||The government is looking to set up 14 more water aerodromes across the country after the successful launch of maiden seaplane service by Prime Minister Narendra Modi between the Statue of Unity near Kevadiya in Gujarat’s Narmada district and Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad. These will facilitate seaplane services on various routes including Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar, Assam, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand. “Development of 14 more water aerodromes is being planned pan India under RCS UDAN scheme. Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) had requested Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to conduct a hydrographic survey and later on requested assistance in setting up jetties for facilitating the passenger movement,” a Shipping Ministry official told PTI. Shipping Minister Mansukh Mandaviya last week told PTI that post the launch of seaplane service at Gujarat, regular services are being planned on various routes including in Guwahati, Andaman & Nicobar and Uttarakhand. “The potential locations include Tehri Dam in Uttarakhand, Guwahati riverfront and Umrangso reservoir in Assam, Khindsi Dam and Erai Dam in Maharashtra, Prakasam barrage in Andhra Pradesh, Minicoy and Kavaratti in Lakshadweep, Havelock, Neil, Long and Hutbay islands in Andaman & Nicobar and Dharoi and Shatrunjaya in Gujarat,” according to a Shipping Ministry document. IWAI has set up concrete jetties for the maiden seaplane project in Gujarat in record time, the official said and added IWAI has been entrusted for hydrographic survey, floating jetties and navigational buoys. Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL) had used differential global positioning system (DGPS) technology, essentially a system to provide provisional corrections to GPS signals to mark the runway and shallow water in Gujarat for landing of the seaplane in daylight visibility while provision has already been made over installed buoys for fixing automated navigation lights for operation during nights in future, the document mentioned. For the maiden seaplane service no-frills carrier SpiceJet has chartered a seaplane from the Maldives, the official said and added that more such seaplanes will be hired once services start at other places. These seaplanes will be Twin Otters. “From the Maldives to the Canadian North, the Twin Otter has proven itself as the largest-selling 14-passenger commuter airplane in the world for over 40 years. Its an un-pressurized, all-metal, high-wing, twin-turboprop aircraft and is certified in the Normal Category by the Canadian Department of Transportation,” a Shipping Ministry document mentioned. Prime Minister Modi on October 31 inaugurated India’s maiden seaplane service by boarding the twin-engine plane from pond-3 close to Sardar Sarovar Dam after taking part in the Ekta Diwas celebrations at the Statue of Unity on the occasion of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s 145th birth anniversary. The plane carrying Modi had landed on the waters of Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad in around 40 minutes after covering a distance of around 200 km. Floating jetties and water aerodrome buildings were built at the riverfront and at pond-3 near Sardar Sarovar Dam to enable passengers to board and alight from the plane. The service will be operated by SpiceJet’s fully-owned subsidiary, Spice Shuttle. Daily two flights will be operated on the Ahmedabad-Kevadiya route from Saturday, the company had said in a statement. The Gujarat government in July this year had cleared a proposal to enter into a tri-party agreement with Union Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports Authority of India (AAI) for the construction of four water aerodromes under the regional connectivity scheme for seaplane service. A water aerodrome or seaplane base is an area of open water used by seaplanes, float-planes and amphibious aircraft for landing and taking off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-looks-to-set-up-14-more-water-aerodromes-for-seaplane-services/story-t7DCdhZHM81EjCJS6dkM6K.html
01-11-2020||India||Agencies discuss informal channels for fast info sharing among nations to solve crimes||Increasing the role of informal channels such as direct cooperation between police and agencies of various countries, challenges in obtaining information from abroad and role of Interpol are among some of the key topics discussed by law enforcement agencies during the three-day long National Conference on Vigilance and Corruption last week, people familiar with the developments said.In a session chaired by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, government agencies discussed that the rising spectre of transnational crimes including cases of corruption with international linkages need close cooperation among international community for detection and collection of evidence in foreign jurisdictions.At least two officials who attended the conference said Indian agencies have been lately exchanging information with police forces or intelligence agencies of various countries on economic offenders, smugglers, cyber criminals and terrorists, and that the process needs further strengthening considering the volume of such cases going high every year. This was one of the key discussions during the conference.“The formal channel, which involves lot of permissions, takes a lot of time as any request of a police force goes through various bureaucratic stages including ministry of home affairs (MHA) and ministry of external affairs (MEA). Over the years, criminals have taken advantage of delayed information sharing and collection of evidence from foreign soil. For example, delay in responding to Letter Rogatories (judicial request sent to a foreign jurisdiction) takes years to get information,” said one of the officers cited above. “The informal channel helps solve the crimes faster and provides real time information on organized crimes. There should be more police to police direct contact,” said this officer.Law enforcement officers from all the states and Union Territories also discussed that there is a need for multi-disciplinary approach in forming “investigative teams” by involving bankers, chartered accountants, forensic analysts etc. to solve economic crimes, banks and securities frauds, ponzi schemes and cyber crimes, among others.Speaking at the conference, organised by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), agency director Rishi Kumar Shukla also talked about strengthening synergy among law enforcement agencies within India and for continuous capacity building through training. He stressed sustained action against corruption through speedy investigation and expeditious prosecution of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agencies-discuss-informal-channels-for-fast-info-sharing-among-nations-to-solve-crimes/story-ihpvu89TXWQnt4CUOyAX8L.html
01-11-2020||India||Army Chief Naravane’s Nepal visit to break ice, Oli wants Pancheshwar project revived||The results of 45 days of discreet back channel diplomacy with Kathmandu will be put to test this week when Indian Army Chief General M.M. Naravane calls upon Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and formally buries the orchestrated controversy over road construction via Lipulekh for pilgrimage to Mansarovar in Tibet. Gen Naravane will be formally conferred the title of Honorary Chief of Nepal Army by Bidya Devi Bhandari, President of Nepal, during his three-day visit beginning November 4.PM Oli is scheduled to meet Army chief in his capacity as Defence Minister after the investiture ceremony.Also Read: Nepal PM Oli sends a quiet message to India with a change in his cabinetThere are all indications that Gen Naravane will receive a red carpet treatment from Kathmandu as the Oli government wants to revive the Pancheshwar multi-purpose project on river Mahakali as well as other hydro-electric projects with India. According to official sources, the Pancheswar draft detailed project report is under discussion of the technical teams by two governments with 80 per cent of the outstanding issues resolved through mutual consultation. India’s SJVN is already constructing a 900 megawatt river Arun III project and another 900 MW Upper Karnali hydroelectric project by GMR is on steam with no issues raised from Kathmandu.As India firmly believes that Kalapani map controversy was a result of Nepal’s own domestic politics, it is willing to shake extended hand of friendship from Kathmandu and go above internal party wrangling to restore the age-old relationship between two close neighbours. Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself is interested in deepening ties with Nepal and has made it clear to all that Kathmandu has a special place with New Delhi irrespective of the party in power.In fact, India is considering a plan to contribute significantly in education, health and infrastructure development sectors in Nepal. The following can be done with Nepal:• Education: Even though India has invested significantly over the years, there is a desperate need for assisting Nepal in setting up schools and academic institutions. India could also cater to education facilities in the eastern and western regions of Nepal while extending a large number of scholarships to Himal region children to study in India.• Health: India can help Nepal by catering to health facilities in the form of specialised small hospitals for the remote northern areas. There needs to be intense engagement between physicians of both countries to bridge the deficiency of trained doctors in the Himalayan Republic as well as support for critical medicine supply from New Delhi.• Infrastructure: India and Nepal need to join hands to build road and bridges infrastructure in remote areas on a long term basis. China has already moved into this area and has constructed the ring road around Kathmandu. The two countries also need to jointly identify the points where the embankments have to be strengthened to prevent flooding of trans border rivers.• Water Shortage: India needs to share expertise with Nepal to remove serious drinking water shortages in high altitude areas.• Agriculture: India has been supplying fertilizers to Nepal but this has been halted with Kathmandu blaming New Delhi for not renewing an old agreement for such supplies. This issue needs to be sorted out on a priority basis as Kathmandu is looking towards China and Bangladesh to plug the gap.The two countries need to look at increased trans-border connectivity by enhancing the number of trading points on the border with immigration and customs facilities. Besides, India and Nepal could work together to develop Simikot and Nepalgunj airports, used by Indians for Mansarovar pilgrimage.While Gen Naravane’s visit is expected to break ice between two age old friends, one seriously hopes that it does not turn out to be a false dawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-naravane-s-nepal-visit-to-break-ice-oli-wants-pancheswar-project-revived/story-kkWBelaPBetwXglRJZpAAM.html
01-11-2020||India||Protests against railway expansion in Goa gather steam||Opposition to railway infrastructure projects in Goa has intensified with protesters now planning to hold an all night vigil after work on the resumption on a stretch of railway line double tracking. The candlelight vigil will begin at 10:30 pm on Sunday and will continue till 5am on Monday morning and has earned the support of opposition parties even as the Goa government has doubled down on its commitments with Chief Minister Pramod Sawant seeking to deny legitimacy to the protesters accusing them of being ‘from abroad’. ‘Goyant Kollso Naka’ (We don’t want coal in Goa), a collective group of activists has pledged to oppose the double tracking and earlier this week confronted officials at a site where work was ongoing in a bid to try and stop the work. The first flashpoint was at the level crossing at Nessai in the outskirts of Margao in South Goa after authorities. With the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, the agency that is executing the work and the South Goa Collector issuing permission to carry on with the work at a second railway crossing at Chandor another location in South Goa, leaders of the Goyant Kollso Naka have planned to lay siege on the work. In 2010, the Ministry of Railways sanctioned the doubling of the existing Hospet-Tinaighat-Vasco railway line in the states of Karnataka and Goa. The first phase between Hospet and Tinai ghat involved easier terrain atop the largely flat Deccan plateau and has already been completed. It’s the second phase between Tinaighat and Vasco da Gama that is currently being undertaken. The stretch involves three distinct sections -- the easternmost section that passes through wildlife sanctuaries crossing the steep slopes, raging rivers and the thick forests of the Western Ghats, a middle section involving easier terrain and the coastal stretch between Margao and Vasco that encounters densely populated areas where the project has run into land acquisition issues and opposition by residents living along the line. The middle section between Margao and Sanvordem has been taken up first and work is already underway. However, activists have alleged that when it comes to linear projects, unless permissions along the entire route have been obtained, the work shouldn’t start. “The double-tracking is a linear project, which implies that if any part of it cannot be constructed, the whole project will become useless and public funds wasted. It is not only mandatory in law, but also prudent and sensible not to spend public funds on any section of the double-tracking until all permissions are obtained,” the memorandum submitted to the RNVL, states.Activists have been opposing the line because, they say, it is being built solely to facilitate the transportation of more coal between the port and steel plants in North Karnataka, for which Goa is the closest port. Unlike steel plants in the Jharkhand-Orissa belt for whom coal is locally available, the lack of coal mines in peninsular India means that steel plants rely on imported coal. Residents in Goa especially in the port town and those living along the railway line have long complained that the handling and transport of coal has covered their homes with coal dust and threatens their lives and livelihood. Around 12 million tonnes of coal is imported annually, but plans are afoot to expand the capacity to nearly 55 million tonnes through a network of infrastructure projects for which the railway line will serve as a crucial link. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, however, refuted these suggestions. “The infrastructure is not being created for the movement of coal alone. Stop these agitations. We have not started importing coal. Coal has been imported for so many years now. We have not even increased the import of coal. We are carrying out this development, for development of industries and promotion of export and import,” Sawant said at a function earlier this week. The protesters have now earned the support of the major opposition parties. “These projects will affect the wildlife, forest and the identity of Goa. The CLP unanimously resolved to extend full support to the people’s protests and agitations raising concerns about the mass destruction of the environment and identity of Goa. The CLP also decided to actively participate in the protests with people,” Goa Leader of Opposition Digambar Kamat said after a meeting of the Congress legislature party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-against-railway-expansion-in-goa-gather-steam/story-1ybaKcVoffRZglRi5H44NL.html
01-11-2020||India||Bharat Biotech to launch Covaxin in Q2 2021||Bharat Biotech is planning to launch its vaccine for Covid-19 in the second quarter next year if it gets the requisite approvals from the Indian regulatory authorities, a top company official said.  It said its immediate focus is to conduct the Phase 3 trials successfully across sites in the country.The company’s vaccine candidate -Covaxin- has been developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV) using inactivated Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The virus was isolated in an ICMR lab.“If we get all the approvals after establishing strong experimental evidence and data, and efficacy and safety data in our last stage of trials, we aim to launch the vaccine in Q2 of 2021,” Bharat Biotech International Executive Director Sai Prasad told PTI.After the company received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct Phase 3 clinical trial to establish the efficacy of the vaccine candidate, it has begun site preparatory exercises for Phase 3, recruitment and dosage will begin in November, he added.  “The trial to be conducted in 25 to 30 sites across 13-14 states will provide two doses each for the vaccine and placebo recipients. About 2,000 subjects could be enrolled per hospital,” Prasad said.Asked about the investment on the vaccine, he said: “Our investment is about Rs 350-400 crore for the development of vaccine and the new manufacturing facilities, which include our investments for conducting the Phase 3 clinical trial, in the next six months”.On the company’s plan to sell the vaccine to the government or to private players, Prasad said: “We are looking to supply for both government and private markets. We are also in preliminary discussions with other countries for probable supply.” Prasad said the price of the vaccine is yet to be determined, as the company is still looking at the cost of product development. “Our immediate focus is to conduct Phase 3 trial successfully across sites,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-to-launch-covaxin-in-q2-2021/story-exIAleX8VGbAguk6szprtM.html
01-11-2020||India||Parents arrested for murder of unwed pregnant daughter in UP’s Pratapgarh||The Uttar Pradesh police on Saturday arrested a couple for allegedly murdering their daughter whose body was found on the railway tracks near Alapur in Pratapgarh district on October 25. Police claimed that the couple committed the crime after discovering that their unmarried daughter was pregnant and unwilling to share the name of her partner. The axe allegedly used to kill her was also recovered, station house officer (SHO) of Nawabganj police station Akhilesh Pratap Singh said. He said while the police were trying to ascertain the identity of the body found on railway tracks one Kamlesh Kumar Yadav of Kishundaspur village identified it as that of his daughter. He also alleged murder and submitted a complaint to the police. This led to an FIR being registered at the Nawabganj police station, he added. The SHO said investigations revealed the possible role of Kamlesh and his wife Anita Devi in the crime and the duo was arrested on Friday. “During interrogation, the two revealed that on October 24, they took their daughter who was unwell to Unchahar for an ultrasound on the advice of a doctor. The report revealed that she was six months pregnant. Taken aback and fearing loss of prestige, they tried to get the foetus aborted but couldn’t get it done. They then returned home and tried to inquire from the girl the name of the child’s father which she refused to reveal. The duo then took their daughter to the railway tracks in the night near Alapur and murdered her. Then they threw the body on the tracks,” Singh said. In another incident, police in Pratapgarh arrested two men and seized fake currency notes with a face value of Rs 60,000 in Kunda area on Saturday. SHO of Kunda police station Uday Tripathi said the men were arrested from the highway near Jahanabad and have been identified as Anuj Tiwari and Anubhav Tiwari, both residents of Kamlapur village of Prayagraj. “During interrogation, the duo revealed that they used to procure the fake currency notes of Rs 50 and Rs 100 denominations from Bihar and were part of a gang involved in getting these fake notes into circulation in the district. Now efforts are on to identify and arrest others involved in this racket,” he said and added the duo was sent to jail after lodging an FIR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parents-arrested-for-murder-of-unwed-pregnant-daughter-in-up-s-pratapgarh/story-9co767HRC8iBF5xkPYHkFL.html
01-11-2020||India||RLSP candidate attacked in Bihar, escapes||A candidate of Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP), who is contesting from Dhamdaha assembly constituency in the ongoing three-phase Bihar polls, had a narrow escape on Saturday night when two unidentified persons opened fire on him while he was sitting in his party office. The Dhamdaha assembly constituency falls in Bihar’s Purnia district in the state’s Seemanchal region. The police are probing the incident, which took place a week after the Janata Dal (Rashtrawadi)’s candidate from the Sheohar assembly seat was shot dead during a campaign trail. Ramesh Kushwaha, the RLSP candidate from the Dhamdaha assembly seat, said: “I was holding talks with my workers at about 10 pm after the end of the day’s campaign on Saturday, when two unidentified persons entered a party room and started firing indiscriminately.” He added; “I managed to escape by hiding in another room.” He has demanded security detail for himself. “Earlier, too, we had demanded security detail, but it fell on the police’s deaf ears,” he alleged. “Our party workers are also being threatened,” he alleged. Anand Kumar Pandey, sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), Purnia, is investigating the incident. “We will ascertain the facts soon,” Pandey said. Kushwaha has lodged a first information report (FIR) at the local police station against the two unidentified persons. Seemanchal, which consists of Katihar, Araria, Kishanganj and Purnia districts, has 24 seats in the 243-member Bihar assembly and goes to polls on November 7. The election results will be declared on November 10. This is the first assembly election being held amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlsp-candidate-attacked-in-bihar-escapes/story-0Aq64t45bTVkvbpS37ChBO.html
01-11-2020||India||Mumbai gets sensor-based monitors as low cost air monitoring feasibility study begins||Installations of low-cost sensor based air quality monitoring equipment has been completed across 15 locations in Mumbai for the first-of-its kind study in India using this technology to accurately measure harmful pollutant concentration in the air, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) said.Low-cost monitoring sensors measure ambient air quality based on light scattering technology using much smaller equipment as compared to existing air quality measuring technology.In July, MPCB and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to undertake the sensor technology assessment between November 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021.Readings from the air quality equipment will begin being relayed to MPCB and IIT-K servers from November 1. “The installation of the monitors has begun. Now we are awaiting the data acquisition for final project implementation within a couple of days. Once data starts flowing into MPCB or IIT-K servers, it will help us understand and develop the interfaces. We are planning a formal launch soon,” said Sudhir Srivastava, chairman, MPCB.The sensors will be installed across MPCB’s 15 existing continuous (real-time) ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQM) - 10 in Mumbai, one each in Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan, Vasai-Virar, and Dombivali. The sensors will monitor particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), ozone, oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and sulphur oxides (SOx).“The basic idea is to get a sense of the liability, accuracy, and reproducibility of the result of these monitors. It will also help us understand the effectiveness of existing CAAQMS data. Once the feasibility is confirmed, it will be scaled across the state,” said Srivastava.Such monitors would be rolled out across 18 non-attainment cities in Maharashtra to identify pollution hotspots through hyper-local air monitoring, source distribution and associated health impacts, he said.Manual monitors to measure air quality have been used since 1984-85 by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which was later renamed the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) network. It presently consists of 793 operating stations covering 344 cities and towns in 29 states and six union territories in India. The manual method involves analysis of pollutants measured once every six days where data is transferred manually for overall assessment, and the cost is Rs. 8 lakh per station per annum including purchasing cost, maintenance, and number of pollutants measured (according to MPCB). CAAQMS monitors cost Rs. 1.5 crore per station per annum including all additional costs and are automatic monitors providing real-time data that is easy to interpret.Low-cost monitors are bought for Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 2 lakh (including maintenance) based on the number of pollutants they measure, said independent researchers.“For hyper local monitoring, these sensors are indispensable. However, one is required to do extensive validation for accuracy and precision of sensor data over a wide range of meteorological and environmental conditions,” said Professor SN Tripathi, head of civil engineering, IIT-K and apex committee member, National Clean Air Program.“This is the first experiment in India which is currently being conducted in collaboration with MPCB covering the entire CAAQMS or government network of the greater Mumbai region. This will enable us to conclusively determine the accuracy and stability of sensor data and will pave the way for large-scale sensor deployment in Maharashtra in particular and India in general,” Tripathi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-gets-sensor-based-monitors-as-low-cost-air-monitoring-feasibility-study-begins/story-LjSYWRqLsC7Q27B6WQDrEN.html

The hamlets recognised as vulnerable in Chambal region account for 57% of the total hamlets identified during the bypolls, the officer said. “Vulnerability in the context of elections is susceptibility of any voter or section of voters, whether or not living in a geographically identifiable area, to being wrongfully prevented from or influenced upon in relation to the exercise of his right to vote in a free and fair manner, through intimidation or use of any kind of undue influence or force on the voter,” states the ECI’s website. “The police in Morena and Bhind are convincing voters to cast their votes without fear and if they do have any fear, police teams will accompany them between their homes and polling booths. Taser guns and chili grenades have also been provided to the police force to control the mob, if there is any nuisance,” said the EC officer who did not wish to be named.“In the past one month more than half-a-dozen incidents of violence have been reported between workers of different political parties in Morena. It is one of the most sensitive districts in the state and prone to violence. Extra precautions are being taken by the police in Morena,” said an officer of the intelligence department. In Morena, bye-elections will be held in five of the six assembly constituencies on November 3. The EC identified 154 vulnerable hamlets in the district, 667 sensitive voting booths and 74 critical voting booths. Eleven thousand people have been identified as nuisance makers in Morena district and have been asked to file an affidavit while 140 people have been externed from the district as police suspected that they might create trouble during elections, said the officer. “We are running confidence-building programmes. The police personnel of all the police stations were asked to convince the voters for exercising their right to vote without any influence and fear. We have displayed the mobile numbers of police officers of nearest police stations and higher officers at public places so that voters can contact us easily,” said Anurag Sujania, superintendent of police, Morena. “As compared to 2018 assembly elections bypolls are stated to be more sensitive so we will provide special security to people,” he added. “Five companies of paramilitary forces have already been deployed in the district. Additional force of 3,300 personnel has reached for the voting day,” said the SP. Bhind superintendent of police Manoj Kumar Singh, “We are taking all possible measures to ensure a free and fair poll.” Joint chief electoral officer Mohit Bundas said the Covid-19 pandemic was another factor worrying the voters.“This election is very sensitive as people are already hesitant in coming out of their homes and cast their votes due to Covid-19. We are addressing every issue efficiently to deal with problems related to fear and other issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-to-provide-security-cover-to-voters-in-bypolls-in-mp-s-chambal-region/story-NyF8Jfn1TrlSPVMHJ50G1K.html

The department of expenditure of the Union ministry of finance, in its letter dated October 12, capped the cost of Polavaram project at Rs 20,398,61 crore at 2013-14 price level, as against the project cost of Rs 47,725.74 crore approved by the 2nd Revised Cost Estimate (RCE) of the Union ministry of water resources. “This is totally unrealistic to complete the Polavaram project, which was declared a national project under AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, according to which the Central government shall bear the entire cost of the project,” Jagan said in his letter to the Prime Minister. He said an amount of Rs 17,656.82 crore of public money had already been spent on the project. At this juncture, any unrealistic cost estimate would result in project remaining incomplete, he reminded. The chief minister pointed out that all the central government agencies including Polavaram Project Authority (PPA), Central Water Commission (CWC), Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and Revised Cost Committee (RCC) had approved the increase in project cost. He said the major reason for increase in the project cost was due to land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement cost, on account of Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, enacted by the Centre. “When the cost of land acquisition and R&R alone for rehabilitating project displaced families itself is Rs 28,191 crore, how is it possible to complete the entire project at a capped cost of Rs 20,398 crore?” Jagan asked. He reminded that the Union cabinet in March 2014 had clearly stated that the Centre would bear the entire cost of the project and obtain all requisite clearances including environmental, forests, and rehabilitation and resettlement and any increase in the project cost would also be borne by the Centre. Stating that it was nothing but natural that the cost of the project was bound to escalate due to cost-overruns and time overruns due to inflation, GST regime and other unforeseen factors, Jagan said any further delay would only increase the land acquisition and R&R costs further due to increase in basic price of land solatium and other factors. “The state government is only an executing agency on behalf of the Centre and the overall responsibility of completion of the project lies with the Centre as envisaged in AP Reorganisation Act, 2014,” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-reddy-s-sos-to-pm-modi-after-finance-ministry-throws-a-spanner-in-polavaram-project/story-P7hWS4yzoNEqf3iYGWoFJM.html

01-11-2020||India||Tamil Nadu minister R Doraikannu passes away at 72, had tested positive for Covid-19||Tamil Nadu Agriculture Minister R Doraikannu, who was battling Covid-19, has died, a private hospital said on Sunday.The 72 year-old Minister breathed his last late on Saturday night, Kauvery Hospital Executive Director Dr Aravdindan Selvaraj said in a medical bulletin.“With deep grief, we announce the sad demise of Honourable Minister for Agriculture R Doraikkannu,” on Saturday at 11.15 pm, he said.“Our thoughts and prayers are with the grieving family during this difficult period,” he added.Doraikkannu was undergoing treatment here, after being shifted from a government medical college hospital in Villpuram on October 13, where he was admitted to after he complained of uneasiness.Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit condoled the death of Daoraikkannu and said he was saddened to know about the demise of the Minister.Doraikkannu “was known for his simplicity, humbleness, straightforwardness, governance skills and commitment towards the welfare of farming community...” “He handled Ministry of Agriculture with full dedication and engraved his strong mark. His untimely demise is an irreparable loss to the people of Tamil Nadu and particularly to the AIADMK party,” he said in his condolence message.Purohit conveyed his deep condolences to the bereaved members of the family and said he prayed to the Almighty God to rest his soul in peace.Doraikkannu was elected to the Tamil Nadu Assembly from Papanasam in Thanjavur district in 2006, 2011 and 2016, with the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa inducting him in the cabinet in 2016.The Minister’s health had suffered a significant deterioration in vital functions on Sunday last.The hospital had said on Monday that the Minister was being treated for severe Covid-19 pneumonia and its complications.A CT scan had showed 90 per cent lung involvement vis- a-vis the infection and he was put on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and ventilator.On October 13, the minister experienced unease when he was on his way to attend the funeral of Davusayammal, Chief Minister K Palaniswami’s mother, who had died at the age of 93 at Salem.Doraikkannu, who was travelling in his car, was rushed to the government medical college hospital in Villupuram and from there was shifted to Kauvery hospital the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-minister-r-doraikkannu-dies-of-covid-19/story-QiqZmB04xfRx3pU3qAzQaM.html

01-11-2020||India||Opposition tried to use Pulwama attack for own gain: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday referred to a Pakistan minister’s statement admitting the country’s role in the 2019 Pulwama attack in Kashmir to hit out at opposition parties, and said that even while India was mourning the sacrifice of its soldiers, there were others who indulged in “dirty politics” for “political gains”. “The country cannot forget the unwarranted statements made after the Pulwama attack. Dirty politics laced with selfishness and arrogance was at its peak when the country was suffering from immense pain,” the Prime Minister said on the occasion of Rashtriya Ekta Diwas during an address in Gujarat’s Kevadia. “But the real face of such people has been exposed after the truth was accepted in the parliament of our neighbouring country,” Modi said after paying tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at the Statue of Unity on the leader’s 145th birth anniversary.The PM was referring to remarks by Pakistan’s science and technology minister Fawad Chaudhry, who triggered a controversy on Thursday after bragging in Parliament about “beating India on its own soil”. “Hum ne Hindustan ko ghuss ke maara hai (We have entered and attacked India),” Chaudhry said, adding: “And our success in Pulwama, that was the success of this nation under Imran Khan’s leadership.”This was the first time a Pakistan minister has admitted what India has long maintained — that the country directly and indirectly encourages and supports terror groups targeting India. Chaudhry later backtracked on his remark and said he was only referring to “post-Pulwama issues” when the “Pakistan Air Force taught a lesson to the Indian side after the air strike on February 26”.Forty Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers were killed when a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden car into a bus, part of a convoy of security forces, in Pulwama on February 14, 2019.In reprisal for the attack, Indian Air Force planes bombed a JeM training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot 12 days later. On February 27, 2019, Pakistan said its combat jets targeted areas near Indian military installations across the Line of Control (LoC), and this sparked an aerial engagement between the air forces of the two countries.On Saturday, PM Modi said he remained silent despite all the “accusations” against him after the Pulwama terror attack.“Politics done after the Pulwama attack shows that people can cross any limit for their political gains. I want to urge such political parties not to indulge in this kind of politics as it affects the morale of our security forces,” he said, without naming any party. “For your political gains, you should not play into the hands of anti-national forces, knowingly or unknowingly,” the PM added.Opposition parties have in the past criticised the government over alleged security lapses that allowed the terror outfit to target the CRPF convoy in Kashmir. Earlier in February, on the first anniversary of the attack, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi raised questions over the terror strike, asking who was accountable for the “security lapses”and “who benefitted the most” from the attack. On calls by the BJP to apologise, Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted on Saturday said he is “trying to figure out” why the party is being asked to apologise. “For expecting the government to keep our soldiers safe? For rallying around the flag rather than politicising a national tragedy? For expressing condolences to the families of our martyrs?” he wrote. The Prime Minister on Saturday also spoke about the need for nations to unite against terrorism and said India understands the pain of terror victims. In the backdrop of the recent terror attack in the French town of Nice — where an extremist decapitated a woman and killed two others on Thursday — Modi said it was a matter of concern that some people had come out in support of terror. Recently, the Emmanuel Macron-led French government has been criticised by some world leaders, including Pakistan’s Imran Khan and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, for what they said was an anti-Muslim stance. New Delhi has maintained that it “deplores” such criticism of the French President. “In the present situation, all the nations, all the governments and people of all the faiths must get united against terrorism. Peace, brotherhood and respect for each other is the identity of humanity. Terrorism and violence is not good for anyone,” Modi said.The PM also brought up the months-long border standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and said Indian soldiers are giving a “befitting reply” to those “eyeing” our land. “India is building hundreds of kilometres of roads, bridges and tunnels near our borders. The country is committed and well-prepared to protect its honour and sovereignty,” Modi said.On the issue of the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status by the central government last year, Modi said he was “fortunate” to get the opportunity to complete the “unfinished task” of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. “Now, Kashmir has embarked on its journey of development,” the PM said, referring to the government’s August 5, 2019 move nullifying Article 370 — which gave the erstwhile state its special status — as J&K’s “unification” with India. The Prime Minister spoke of the slowing spread of the pandemic in the country and said Indian citizens had come together to fight the virus and “as a result, India is coming out of the outbreak and marching ahead”.

01-11-2020||India||CPI(M) open to Bengal alliance with Congress||The Communist Party of India (Marxist), or the CPI(M), announced on Saturday its inclination for a seat adjustment with the Congress in the upcoming assembly elections in West Bengal and Assam, even as it is contesting against the Congress in Kerala. If the plan materialises, it would be the first formal seat adjustment pact between the Congress and the Left in West Bengal, where the two parties have been rivals till the 1990s. “In West Bengal, the CPIM and the Left Front will have an electoral understanding with all secular parties, including the Congress, which seek to defeat the BJP and the TMC. In Tamil Nadu, the CPIM will contest the elections as part of the DMK-led alliance. In Assam, the CPIM will contest the elections in cooperation with all secular opposition parties including the Congress to defeat the incumbent BJP government in the state, which is sharpening communal polarization, destabilizing social harmony and heaping miseries on the people,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury announced after the two day-long Central Committee meet. CPI(M) politburo member Nilotpal Basu rejected claims of a unilateral move and said, “Don’t think we have decided it on our own. There is a strong signal from state Congress units for a joint fight against BJP-RSS.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpi-m-open-to-bengal-alliance-with-congress/story-l7BG4xTPOHmyKNn67ctfJN.html
01-11-2020||India||UP government planning law to ‘regulate’ interfaith marriages, says Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said on Saturday that his government is planning to introduce a law to regulate interfaith marriages involving Muslim men and Hindu women, citing a high court order to promise that his administration would secure and protect women in the state. Adityanath also pledged that public land encroached upon by criminals and mafia would be used to build houses for the poor. He made the announcements while campaigning for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidates in for the upcoming assembly bypolls. In his speech, Adityanath cited an Allahabad high court order, passed on October 30, where a single-judge bench held that religious conversion solely for the purpose of marriage is not valid under law. The case pertained to a Muslim woman who converted to marry a Hindu man, and the couple approached the court for police protection. “The Allahabad high court has said that for marriages, changing religion isn’t necessary. The government too has decided to check ‘love jihad’ with all its might. An effective law would be made that would ensure that those who cheat gullible women by hiding their identity would be effectively dealt with,” the CM said. Love Jihad is a term used by right-wing workers to describe interfaith relationships between a Muslim man and a Hindu woman. In February this year, the government told Parliament that there was no definition of the term and no such cases were reported by agencies. To be sure, the HC order didn’t use the term in its order. “I want to warn all such people that if they don’t mend their ways, they would have to set out on a ‘Ram naam satya hai’ journey,” he said. ‘Ram naam satya hai’ (Ram is the eternal truth) is the chant Hindus raise while lending a shoulder to the bier during last rites. “Many of our sisters and daughters became victims of `love jihad’. They were deceived by people using forged names and identity,’’ he pointed out. Interfaith relationships have become a hot-button issue in several states, including Uttar Pradesh, where Hindu activists allege that Muslim men “lure” gullible women for conversion. Many experts reject these allegations and say that adult men and women are free to convert for relationships. “Is this the first time he (CM Yogi Adityanath) used this kind of language? It’s been over three years now. Earlier he had said Thok Do (do encounter killing), and now this. Samajwadi Party is against crime but firmly believes that it is the job of the judiciary to give punishments... He has been using this kind of language and making tall claims and lies. But all kinds of crimes have skyrocketed in his regime. Innocent are getting killed, killers are getting protection,” said Samajwadi Party state spokesperson and former minister, Rajendra Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-government-planning-law-to-regulate-interfaith-marriages-says-yogi-adityanath/story-RT4Vg2RDiDM9Injg2qND4M.html
01-11-2020||India||Jyotiraditya Scindia slams previous Congress government over graft||Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia said on Saturday he did not expect that there would be rampant corruption in the previous Congress regime in Madhya Pradesh when he sought votes for a development-oriented government in 2018. Scindia was addressing an election meeting at Shadora in Ashok Nagar, a part of the Guna parliamentary constituency that he represented in the Lok Sabha from 2002 to 2019. Scindia said, “Kamal Nath ji is known as a world-level industrialist but not a single industry was set up during his term of 15 months. Instead, he ran a transfer industry in Vallabh Bhavan (state secretariat) which is a temple of democracy. There was an auction of posts. I had begged for votes from you not to form a government of corruption. But liquor, transfer and other mafia operated with impunity under the Congress government.” He said the situation had come to such a sorry pass that public representatives couldn’t have their voice heard in the government for development projects in their constituencies. When public representatives wanted to meet the then chief minister Kamal Nath in this regard the door was slammed in their face with an assertion that there was no money for development work, Scindia said.“He didn’t visit Ashok Nagar even once during 15 months of his tenure. He was confined to his air-conditioned office in Vallabh Bhavan all the time. About ₹7,500 crore in respect of a crop insurance scheme could be released to farmers only when Shivraj Singh Chouhan became chief minister and I made a request to him. When I raised my voice... I was told to take to the streets. I did take to the streets and brought down the corrupt government.”Addressing the gathering, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took a dig at state Congress chief Kamal Nath and said, “On one hand we comply with all the instructions of ECI but on the other hand there is Kamal Nath whose tag of star campaigner was snatched by the commission which didn’t find him fit for the status as he passed an objectionable remark against a woman minister in my cabinet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jyotiraditya-scindia-slams-previous-congress-government-over-graft/story-XsV2gaDQIQKCd9LDLpgUQO.html
01-11-2020||India||Kamal Nath approaches Supreme Court against Election Commission decision to revoke his star campaigner status||Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath approached the Supreme Court on Saturday challenging an order of the Election Commission to revoke his “star campaigner” status for violations of the model code of conduct ahead of bypolls to 28 assembly constituencies in the state. “For repeated violation of the model code of conduct and for completely disregarding the advisory issued to him, the Commission revokes the status of leader of political party (star campaigner) of Kamal Nath,” EC said in its order on Friday.The commission has found Nath guilty of violating para 2 of Part 1 of General Conditions of Model Code of Conduct for Guidance of Political Parties and Candidates which states, “Parties and candidates shall refrain from criticism of all aspects of private life, not connected with the public activities of the leaders or workers of the parties.”The poll body has taken note of the Congress leader’s speech on October 13 in which he said chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan treated the “mafia” and “milawatkhor” (adulterators) like gods. On October 26, the commission warned Nath against using derogatory terms, shortly after he referred to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate Imarti Devi as an “item” during a rally.According to Nath, no notice was issued to him on his October 13 speech. This was clearly a violation of principles of natural justice, his petition stated. On his “item” comment, Nath said he submitted his reply to EC that his remark was completely misunderstood. Based on his response, EC issued an advisory on October 26 asking him to refrain from such comments in future.In his petition to set aside the EC order, Nath said, “It is clear that the order has been passed in complete violation of natural justice, without any application of mind, and is arbitrary and unreasoned.” Nath’s lawyer Varun Chopra said, “Between the date when EC issued advisory (October 26) and the order revoking star campaigner status (October 30) there is no fresh violation of MCC by Kamal Nath. Freedom of speech of a campaigner is a fundamental right which the Election Commission has abrogated at the fag end of the election campaign. We want the Court to lay down the principle whether the Commission was right to do so.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamal-nath-approaches-supreme-court-against-election-commission-decision-to-revoke-his-star-campaigner-status/story-rUwsiRiu2xfbo0oM8vP3yN.html
01-11-2020||India||Centre plans to brief diplomatic corps on efforts to develop Covid-19 vaccines||The government will brief the Delhi-based diplomatic corps next week on efforts to develop vaccines for Covid-19 and explore potential partnerships for manufacturing and delivery of vaccines, people familiar with developments said on Saturday. The briefing, to be done on November 6 by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, is set to be attended by envoys and senior members of the diplomatic corps. Niti Aayog member VK Paul, union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and other senior officials are expected to be present at the briefing, being seen as the one of the key Covid-19-related interactions handled by the external affairs ministry this year. The interaction will be New Delhi’s first such outreach to the international community on vaccines when countries are eagerly awaiting a successful candidate. Officials and diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said India is also looking for partners to co-produce vaccines so that they can be manufactured faster and distributed on a larger scale. The Narendra Modi government is set to propose five models for vaccine cooperation with friendly countries and key neighbours, with India having entered late stage trials for two indigenous vaccines and the Oxford AstraZeneca candidate, which will be made by Pune-based Serum Institute of India. Click here for complete coronavirus coverageAccording to top officials involved in finalising these models, New Delhi could offer free supply or trial partnerships to South Asian, European, West Asian, African and Latin American countries for the vaccine to ensure they can ramp up their drive to protect their populations from Covid-19. The countries will be carefully chosen to include key neighbours, countries where large numbers of Indians are studying or working, and those that have been supportive of India at international forums such as the UN. The move is also aimed at building on India’s image as a key supplier of pharmaceutical products in the early stages of the pandemic, and to help the country emerge as a major player in the post-Covid-19 world order, the people cited above said. It also fits in with the government’s drive to create resilient and diverse supply and value chains, the people said. On August 15, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India is prepared to mass produce Covid-19 vaccines for domestic consumption once scientists approve the trials. “Not one, not two, as many as three coronavirus vaccines are being tested in India,” he said from the Red Fort in his customary Independence Day speech. The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine is in the third or final phase of trials and is widely considered a frontrunner in the global race to tackle the virus that has already infected 45 million people and resulted in 1.19 million deaths worldwide. The two Indian vaccine candidates – from Zydus-Cadila and Bharat Biotech – have entered the second phase of human trials. Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India, recently said trials of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine in India should be over by December and it could be launched in the country in January, subject to UK trials that are on the verge of being completed. While a large share of vaccines will be used in India, with healthcare workers identified as priority recipients, PM Modi said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in September that the country’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will also be used to help all countries in fighting the pandemic. “India will also help all countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of vaccines,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said. In this connection, India has organised two training sessions for neighbouring countries that were joined by about 90 health experts and scientists. This programme will be expanded to include other countries. An Indian delegation visited Dhaka during October 17-19 for discussions on vaccine development in India and modalities for clinical trials in Bangladesh. Officials from India and Myanmar have had a virtual interaction on cooperation on vaccines, and the two sides are expected to decide on modalities. “In due course, depending on trials in India, we propose to expand our cooperation with other countries also in clinical trials and capacity building for vaccine development, production and delivery,” Srivastava said. Amid the pandemic, India has provided medicines and medical equipment to more than 150 countries, including grants to 82 countries worth around Rs 80 crore. It also expedited approvals for export of drugs and deployed medical rapid response teams to countries such as Kuwait, the Maldives, Mauritius and Comoros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-plans-to-brief-diplomatic-corps-on-efforts-to-develop-covid-19-vaccines/story-dvf7SPy8WXINRiuscB0ZPN.html
01-11-2020||India||House panel on Personal Data Protection summons Ola, Uber, Jio, Airtel||The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Personal Data Protection has summoned cab hailing apps Ola and Uber, and telecom giants Bharti Airtel, Jio Infocom, Jio Platforms and Truecaller for its next set of meetings to be held in the first week of November, according to the Lok Sabha website.The Committee has asked the companies to make detailed submissions about their policies related to data collection, data protection, artificial intelligence and privacy of consumers, people familiar with the matter said.The JPC, led by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarian Meenakshi Lekhi, already heard from Twitter, Amazon, Google, PayTm and Facebook on the issue last week.The JPC is meeting large tech companies to understand their view on personal data protection. India’s Personal Data Protection bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha last December. Among other provisions, it proposed a national regulator to protect the personal data of individuals.A key topic that may be discussed in meetings of the panel this week is a provision of the draft data bill that asks tech-giants to share non-personal data, comprising elements such as traffic density mapped by companies like Google maps and Uber, with the government when asked.The government, which presented its draft non-personalized data-sharing framework in July, defines it as “any data that is not related to an identified or identifiable natural person, or is personal data that has been anonymised”.The government has argued such sharing of data will help formulate better and more efficient policies. The framework talks about the creation of a data market for sharing of data that will be regulated. In case a business claims that the data can’t be shared, it has to justify its decision it to the regulator.This particular provision was controversial with pushback from industry leaders who said companies use non-personal data to boost revenue and may suffer losses. Earlier this week, the panel asked tech giant Google and fin-tech company One 97 Communications, which runs Paytm, to explain their relationship with China, according to people familiar with the matter.Google officials reiterated that the company walked out of China on its own, but the panel was keen to know if its products or services have any links with China since Google owns Android, the software used by many Chinese phone makers.Paytm, the people said, admitted that Chinese company Alibaba is an investor but that none of the investors has a say in the company’s running.One of the people quoted above added that Google officials were grilled about the need for regulating the company, especially on the content part of its business.According to one member of the JPC, Google maintained that India should avoid data localisation requirement as it is ill-fitted to protect privacy and security. The tech giant also claimed that the move to localise data is not in sync with open trade commitments and modern data protection standard, this person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/house-panel-on-personal-data-protection-summons-ola-uber-jio-airtel/story-vArVrgKfSblFHpOFjKDSVL.html

01-11-2020||India||Rajasthan introduces 4 bills to counter farm laws||The Rajasthan government on Saturday introduced four bills to counter the farm laws recently enacted by the Central government.Parliamentary affairs minister Shanti Dhariwal tabled the Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill 2020 and the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill 2020 during the special session of the Rajasthan Assembly.According to the statement of objects, the bills seek to “protect the interest of farmers, farm labourers, those engaged in ancillary and incidental activities relating to production, sale and marketing of agricultural produce as also consumers and for adherence to the minimum support price mechanism”.Addressing reporters outside the assembly, state health minister Raghu Sharma said that the state government wanted to protect the interest of farmers with the new laws.Similar bills have been introduced in Punjab and Chhattisgarh assemblies following widespread protests by various farm bodies against the central laws pushed through in Parliament during the monsoon session.The Chhattisgarh assembly on October 27 approved the Chhattisgarh Krishi Upaj Mandi (Amendment) Bill 2020 that declared the entire state as a market for selling agriculture produce. Earlier on October 20, Punjab government passed four bills and a resolution to counter Centre’s three agriculture marketing laws. Both states have Congress governments.The Congress leadership had earlier suggested that states where it is in power should pass laws of their own to counter the central legislations.Hitting out at the Ashok Gehlot-led Rajasthan government, state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Satish Poonia said, “The fact is, the state government cannot bring law against a central law by calling a special session but Ashok Gehlot is conspiring to mislead farmers and to please Sonia Gandhi.”BJP MLA Pratap Singh Singhvi said the government is lying about its intention of ensuring minimum support price. “Farmers of bajra (pearl millet) are forced to sell their produce at ₹1400-1500 per quintal against the MSP of ₹2150 because the state government did not send a proposal to Centre for procurement under Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA),” said the six-time legislator.Experts said that amendments to Central laws by a state assembly were not possible. Political commentator Avadhesh Akodia said, “Even if the Rajasthan assembly passes these amendment bills, they are unlikely to get the President’s assent.” The speaker adjourned the House until Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-introduces-4-bills-to-counter-farm-laws/story-VluQg7CHvqLMjQkyIwiY7L.html
01-11-2020||Editorials||Covid-19: Delhi is being irresponsible | HT Editorial||Covid-19 cases in Delhi are rising, along with a spike in positivity rate, a clear indication of an even further increase in cases in the offing. The Delhi government said, in a document presented at the meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Saturday, that it expects 12,000 cases a day by end-November. Air pollution has become worse in Delhi, partly because of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, and partly because of higher traffic in Delhi (HT reported on Sunday that this is now 10% higher than pre-pandemic levels). There’s enough scientific evidence on how bad air exacerbates the pandemic. Finally, this is the festive and marriage season in Delhi and across India — a time marked by social gatherings.Together, these constitute a severe challenge for administrators and health authorities — and point to imminent pressure on the Capital’s health care system. Understandably, everyone is worried. DDMA met on Saturday. And the home secretary has called for a meeting on Monday. Yet, DDMA — both the Centre and the Delhi government are part of it, so the credit or blame has to be shared — has a strange way of showing its concern. It has increased the number of people who can attend weddings and other ceremonies in closed spaces from 50 to 200. And the state’s health minister has ruled out another lockdown or harsher restrictions. This is downright irresponsible. Sure, the Union Territory is doing the right thing by continuing to test aggressively, and preparing its hospital infrastructure for the coming onslaught (the document presented at the DDMA meeting mentions this), but its reluctance to enforce restrictions on movement and activities — a column in this newspaper suggested a curfew, restricted timings for restaurants, and the enforcement of social distancing norms in markets — or ban social, religious or cultural gatherings altogether (another suggestion in that column) is baffling.The easing of restrictions on weddings is believed to be aimed at providing relief to the owners of banquets halls. And it is clear that the unwillingness to restrict or ban other festivities comes from the fear of angering the population. This is the situation much of Europe found itself through the continent’s long summer. Most European countries failed to do the right thing then — and are paying the price now, and scrambling to enforce lockdowns. Delhi is making the same mistake. It’s better to have a population angry at the State than one ravaged by a stronger wave of the pandemic..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/delhi-is-being-irresponsible/story-pVrlAp1SsnLEUPBUwX0y8O.html
