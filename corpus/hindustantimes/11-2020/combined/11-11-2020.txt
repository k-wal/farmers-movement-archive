Briefly, each third-party app, such as GPay or PhonePe, cannot exceed 30% of the total number of Unified Payment Interface (UPI) transactions. Typically, an obscure and technical regulatory change for a payments system does not draw sharp reactions. Still, given that the number of users and the volume of transactions are rapidly increasing every day, this move can potentially affect a lot of people. The given justification for this rule by NPCI was to “address the risks and protect the UPI ecosystem as it further scales up”. Unfortunately, this justification raises more questions than provides answers. The new rule is both unnecessary and inconsistent for a set of reasons. For one, there is no empirical evidence of this form of systemic failure until now (except the YES Bank episode, which is a different category altogether). Even if we consider this rule to be forward-looking, NPCI would have been better off seeking technological solutions to a potential technical problem, rather than using crude policy instruments such as placing limits. Systemic risks are automatically lower when consumers, merchants, and third-party app developers are all multi-homing, meaning they simultaneously use more than one app for the same purpose. The UPI ecosystem is radically substitutable. In the case of failure, consumers and merchants can switch from one app to another without the slightest friction. Though two apps, PhonePe and GPay, dominate the UPI market (with roughly 80% of UPI transactions), consumers are not without choice — there are at least 52 UPI service providers, 189 issuers and around 21 third-party apps. Third-party app developers also can and do have tie-ups with multiple banks simultaneously, such that the YES bank-PhonePe fiasco will not be repeated. Beyond being unnecessary, the rule is also improper, incomplete, and inconsistent. If the aim is to mitigate the systemic risk of failure of one big market player, the rule change should apply to all apps providing UPI services, and not just third-party apps. Is the systemic risk different when the app of a scheduled commercial bank fails as against a third-party app? Two, in terms of systemic risk, the most significant one is that of the UPI architecture failing, which can instantly impact millions of users. Note that NPCI has a virtual monopoly over the UPI architecture and therefore consumers are left with no choice, apart from hard cash and cheques. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should be taking a closer look at this risk. Three, whether the justification for the rule is of systemic failure or that of potential market domination, NPCI (a private company, which is a consortium of banks) is not the proper authority to be making rules regarding payments. In the first case, it should be RBI regulating, and in the case of competition issues, it should be the Competition Commission of India looking into the matter. There is uncertainty about how companies can reduce their share of the total transactions. Companies could place hourly, daily, or monthly limits on the number of transactions for each consumer; restrict the use of UPI to specific use cases; restrict transactions to above a certain minimum amount; or restrict the number of new installs by users. In all these scenarios, it leads to uncertainty about the app functionality and potentially higher failure rate of transactions. The better way to reduce systemic risk is to ensure greater competition and lower the entry barriers. The inordinate delay in permitting newer entrants to the market is inexcusable in this regard. Having a combination of third-party apps, domestic banks, and niche payment platforms is an effective solution to mitigate risk and should be preferred to the sledge hammer-like instrument of placing caps on the number of transactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/flawed-regulation-can-undermine-the-digital-payment-ecosystem/story-jVikN3SWxYYRKGZZiO5loL.html
11-11-2020||News||The Opposition fails because it’s dishonest||Misinformation, disinformation and outright lies form the staple diet of fake and false narratives. These have, in turn, become the weapon of choice for some of our political parties, otherwise bankrupt of a mission and national purpose. Regrettably, some in our intelligentsia and media participate, perhaps out of choice, only to discover that “a lie can travel half way around the world while truth is tying its shoelaces”. Fortunately, truth does get running and ultimately triumphs.Why do some sections of the media participate in these narratives? Why do pollsters get it so wrong? The elections in Bihar are a testament to the fact that the silent majority prefers development-oriented governance. The National Democratic Alliance’s win, despite 15 years of incumbency, is also a testament to their unwavering trust in Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi. The resounding victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the by-polls is also a reaffirmation of the faith of the people in the PM. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)’s Sardar Ayaz Sadiq’s recently recounted how Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa was perspiring and his “legs were shaking” when foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said, during a meeting, that if Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was not released, India would attack Pakistan “at 9 PM”. This has destroyed the false narrative created by many leaders in the Indian Opposition. Some politicians questioned the strike and suggested that this was a ploy to win votes. They questioned the valour and professionalism of our armed forces and cast aspersions on the intentions and achievements of the Union government in times of a grave crisis. The people rejected their politics and punished them. The allegation by the leader of an Opposition party that Indian democracy is being “hollowed out” reflects the deep sense of insecurity and frustration felt by a clique which ruled the nation for decades without any accountability. Even though this party couldn’t even touch three figures in the two Lok Sabha elections of 2014 and 2019 elections put together, it leads the narrative on all nationally divisive issues. Before 2014, New Delhi was symptomatic of a culture of “family connections”, power brokers and middlemen, who along with senior politicians were running their independent fiefdoms with impunity. Institutions, including even that of the PM’s Office, were often reduced to a rubber stamp, subject to the extra-constitutional body of “activists” in a so-called National Advisory Council.The selective outrage of some of these activists who were caught receiving funds illegally from abroad is not difficult to comprehend. Their partisan interests must not be confused with the legitimate interests of civil society or the Indian people. But to portray legal actions on these vested interests as an attack on civil liberties is pure humbug, specially coming from a party which has a rich history of suspending civil liberties. The Emergency in 1975 is a case in point. They imposed President’s Rule to summarily remove elected state governments over 75 times when they were in power and politicised enforcement agencies to such an extent that the Supreme Court had to refer to the Central Bureau of Investigation during their time as a “caged parrot”. Even today, their governance in Maharashtra appears rooted in the brute use of State institutions to attack freedom of the press and speech and further narrow political ends. Since 2014, the PM has transformed the working culture in the government with zero tolerance of corruption, and cut down of delays and bureaucratic inertia. To present his courage and his impatience with the debilitating status quo as an attack on Indian democracy is both cynical and dishonest.In case of the farm bills, which only implemented long-pending reforms which were part of their own election manifestoes, the Opposition chose to mislead the farmers by spreading fear and canards while 33 out of their 107 members were not even present in the Upper House when the bills were being debated and voted upon. They suggested that the Minimum Support Price procurement will be stopped. But in fact, the paddy procurement is up at a national level by over 20% from last year and over ₹3,8000 crore have already been transferred to our farmers. In case of Punjab, the procurement is up from last year by over 26%; we have already exceeded this year’s target by 8%; and over ₹29,000 crore have been paid to our farmers. In the case of China, they surrendered India’s position and are now alleging falsehood of surrender. Whether it is the farm bill or the Goods and Services Tax or the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, all these measures were initiated during the time of the Congress government, but it did not have the gumption to implement these painstaking reforms. Instead of a debate on real issues, unbridled hatred for PM Modi seems to be the cornerstone of Congress politics. The Opposition should step out of the mindset of weaving false narratives, treating different sections of the society as mere vote banks and wake up to an era where every Indian regardless of religion, caste, creed or gender is an equal partner in the nation’s progress. A robust and vibrant democracy also requires an Opposition which is truthful and sincere. It is high time that the Opposition steps up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-opposition-fails-because-it-s-dishonest/story-x8EY2wvGiiY7tKfmTM5PHL.html
11-11-2020||News||How Nitish Kumar returned to power||Ending the intense speculation of the past month, the results of the assembly elections in Bihar are finally out. Nitish Kumar has added yet another feather to his cap by winning the confidence of the people of Bihar for the fourth time, a rare feat in Indian politics. Of course, the strength of Janata Dal (United) is now reduced, but the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has performed well, thanks to the image of Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi as an able leader. The JD(U)’s relatively poor performance is easily understandable, as it had to fight two opponents — the Mahagatbandhan (grand alliance) of the Opposition on one hand, and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) on the other, unlike the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had to fight only the Opposition.What is the larger meaning of the NDA’s win?To begin with, Nitish Kumar’s return only reiterates that anti-incumbency is not an unbeatable force, provided the incumbent government has performed well during its tenure — irrespective of the length of this tenure. Competing political parties may have varying ideological orientations to attract voters, but more than anything else, citizens are interested in a rapid-and-inclusive development process. They opt for political change only when that basic agenda is left unserved. Although identity-based mobilisation is a part of Bihar politics, this election was essentially a referendum on Nitish Kumar’s government of the last 15 years. The government’s record, to be sure, has gaps — especially in the realm of employment generation that affects young citizens most deeply. But its overall performance was ultimately appreciated, especially for a state that carries a huge historical burden of underdevelopment and is constrained by its poor financial resources. During the campaign, the NDA focused on the key components of its good governance story, both in terms of the “minimal” function of the government (maintenance of law and order) and the developmental function of the government (economic growth and welfare programmes). On the law and order front, Nitish Kumar’s government convincingly argued that, thanks to its relentless effort, Bihar had come out of the so called jungle raj which characterised the previous regime. The present result indicates that the fear of jungle raj is still deeply embedded in the minds of the electorate. Indeed, once it became known that the Opposition alliance had performed well in the first phase, the NDA planned a conscious counter-mobilisation against the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), using the slogan of jungle raj. To be fair, one must note that the law and order situation has deteriorated in the last five years, but citizens do realise that it has improved substantially since 2005, when Nitish Kumar started his regime.On the development front, too, Nitish Kumar has performed more than satisfactorily. The Gross State Domestic Product growth rate in Bihar has not only been high over the last 15 years, but also been one of the highest (above 9%) in the last five years. This is the result of high-development expenditure of the state government, the consequent strengthening of the physical infrastructure, and a conducive environment for economic activities. Infrastructure development has included improvement in both road networks (including rural roads) and the power scenario, appreciated widely even by the chief minister’s critics. Along with this process of economic growth, the state government has also implemented a number of welfare programmes, the most recent being those under “Saat Nischay”, which covers, among other measures, the provision of electricity, piped drinking water, approach roads and toilets for all households. This is actually micromanagement of the development process. Unfortunately, the state government has not been equally responsive to the need to improve the educational and health infrastructure of the state.Besides the issue of development, the people of Bihar, particularly its disadvantaged sections, are also concerned about social justice. Admittedly, it is Lalu Prasad who first gave voice to the subaltern class, but Nitish Kumar consciously carried forward that agenda, sometime at the cost of offending his more socio-economically privileged supporters. He brought the Extreme Backward Classes (EBCs) or Annexure-I castes — they constitute over 30% of the state’s population — into the governance and executive structure of the state. For example, for EBCs, he introduced 20% reservation in panchayats and 21% in judiciary. This consistent outreach led to decisive EBC support for the NDA. With an eye on empowering women, Nitish Kumar introduced 50% reservation for them in panchayats and 35% reservation in government jobs. One should also remember here the historic decision of Nitish Kumar in 2016 regarding prohibition, just after the elections. It did harm the state’s finances, but it was more than compensated by the benefit it brought to poor women, often victims of alcoholism of their menfolk. This has clearly drawn a large number of women voters towards the NDA.In the next five years, the new government will face serious challenges. To meet urgent priorities — such as the creation of employment opportunities, strengthening the education and health sectors and other development needs — the state government has to mobilise additional resources, but here lies a problem. The negative economic impact of Covid-19 has not only meant depletion of the state’s resources, but also affected transfers from the Union government. One has to wait and watch to find out how the state government negotiates this difficult path.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-nitish-kumar-returned-to-power/story-Mk2ta7QoYhLtXpqEtyw2vO.html
11-11-2020||News||Reading the mandate in Bihar’s fragmented political landscape||Bihar’s voters have reposed their trust in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) — despite the fact there were strong voices on the ground expressing discontent with the Nitish Kumar government, especially due to the hardships suffered by labour in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown.However, what is very evident is that the voters have disaggregated their choices within the broad fabric of a “coalition”, and given to each political party only whatever seemed to be their due. So, overall, it is the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that has emerged as a senior partner within the NDA, with the Janata Dal (United) a distant second. While Nitish Kumar’s poll propaganda banked on the plank of his return as chief minister, and this will happen, his party is not the leader of the coalition anymore, and has had a poor electoral strike rate well below the 50% mark. It is the BJP which saved the day for the NDA.For the other opposing coalition, the Mahagatbandhan (grand alliance), led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), it is the Congress that has registered an abysmal strike rate of around 25% of the seats allocated to it. In terms of the number of seats, it is the Left parties that have performed almost as well as the Congress. The combined Left front has a high strike rate. Even here, voters have seen each component of the coalition for what they are, and rewarded them in proportion. There is a larger message here — voters are perfectly capable of making their political preferences clear, even as complicated political choices have to be registered under coalitions.The second important issue is that of poll promises. Here, the NDA went in two different directions. The JD(U) focused on building on its governance agenda with skills, polytechnics, and improved job opportunities. The BJP took on the RJD’s promise of a million jobs with its own promise of providing 1.9 million jobs, and setting up an IIT and AIIMS for high quality technical and professional education. As news of the poor performance of the NDA in the first phase of polls began spreading, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeared in posters with a personal appeal, asking voters to repose their trust in the BJP—“Bhajapa hai to bharosa hai”. The message was simple — the BJP could be relied upon to deliver to the people, just as it had delivered on its welfare schemes. The BJP also kept up its attack on dynastic politics, and did not hesitate to remind the electorate of the jungle raj that could come back in Bihar if Tejashwi Yadav and the RJD were anointed to power. This then throws up a second message — political trust and direct delivery trumped a new offering and lack of experience.Contrary to perception, this election has also revealed that there are no settled terrains of vote bank politics premised on caste. For instance, in the Kosi and Seemanchal belt, there is an average share of 30% Muslim votes, and the Yadav-Muslim combination is considered formidable. This area has been the bastion of socialist thinking and Mandal politics. But the RJD faced a strong challenge in a politically fragmented arena. Both Asaduddin Owaisi and Pappu Yadav’s respective formations turned into competitors for the Mahagatbandhan. Do remember that it was in this region that Nitish Kumar turned emotional, calling it his last election. And it was here that PM Modi’s rallies acquired a nationalist pitch. The region went to polls in the last phase, and NDA has done remarkably well. Bihar’s voters have displayed electoral acumen in seeing through alliances, valuing political trust, and choosing their parties according to political geography. This brought the NDA close to power in a closely contested race, despite battling severe anti-incumbency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/reading-the-mandate-in-bihar-s-fragmented-political-landscape/story-id9Z2MTTfweObApX6RrrXM.html
11-11-2020||News||Why Tejashwi failed to break the glass ceiling | Opinion||Exit polls predicted a landslide for the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagatbandhan (MGB) of Opposition parties. The only quibble was the quantum of the RJD victory. These findings gained greater credence since those covering the ground reported deep resentment and anger against the incumbent Nitish Kumar. We were told that Tejashwi Yadav’s plank of economic justice that covered themes as kamai (employment), dawai (medical facilities), padhai (education), sichai (irrigation) and mehengai (price rise) found great resonance among the voters, and that the young voters in Bihar were adamant for a change of guard. How did the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), then, manage to turn the rising tide against Kumar? Why could Yadav not build on the groundswell of support evident in his rallies to trounce the NDA? And finally, where did the exit polls go wrong? These three questions are critical to understanding the 2020 elections in Bihar.First, the analysis of provisional results from the Election Commission of the three phases indicates a clear pattern. Demographically, phase one, comprising 71 seats in south Bihar, had a higher concentration of Dalit voters. The 94 seats in central Bihar polled during the second phase had a higher proportion of Extreme Backward Classes (EBCs). The remaining 78 seats that polled in the final phase had a larger share of the Muslim population. The MGB has outperformed the NDA in the first phase. It seems that the Dalit vote in this region got divided between the NDA, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), and the Left Front (which, as an MGB constituent, contested a large number of seats in this phase). In addition, the pre-poll survey conducted by Lokniti-CSDS suggested that while the JD(U) voters were seamlessly transferring their support to NDA candidates and Nitish Kumar, BJP voters were not wholeheartedly backing Kumar. This confusion within the BJP’s rank and file was created due to the widespread belief that the party propped up Chirag Paswan as a front to dislodge Nitish Kumar. The LJP was largely contesting on seats that the JD(U) was a contender and it also fielded some high-profile ex-BJP members. There was a late realisation within the BJP leadership that if these rumors persisted, they may have a tough time retaining the state. So they left no stone unturned in reminding voters that no matter how many seats the BJP won, Nitish Kumar was going to be CM. And this is likely to be the most important reason that there was a turnaround in the second phase, in which the NDA managed a slight edge over the MGB. It then went on to completely dominate the third phase. Second, while there was clearly some resentment against Nitish Kumar owing to his perceived non-performance in his last term, anti-incumbency sentiments were not sharp enough for the erstwhile NDA voters to switch sides. This may be because Yadav’s promise of one million jobs and his focused campaign led the crowd to throng rallies, but they could not bring themselves to trust him enough to vote for MGB. He does not seem to have inspired confidence outside his party’s base among Yadav and Muslim constituents. Even the ticket distribution of RJD couldn’t cast a wider social net; at least 50% of candidate nominations went to members of these communities. In addition, the prospect of MGB sweeping in the first phase may have helped the NDA to consolidate its support base with the spectre of the return of a jungle raj of the Lalu Prasad era. The NDA succeeded in counter-consolidating non-Yadav and non-Muslim communities. While the RJD itself did not do spectacularly in the second and third phases, it was further pulled down by a very poor show by Congress as well as the fragmentation of Muslim voters in the Kosi-Seemanchal region. Finally, why were exit polls, especially Axis-My-India with an impeccable track record of correctly predicting outcomes in the past few years, off the mark this time? The most important reason seems to be women voters — a constituency carefully nurtured by Nitish Kumar over the years through various policies including the prohibition on the sale of liquor in the state. This constituency steered Nitish Kumar to the post of chief minister for the first time in the October 2005 elections. And since then, anecdotal evidence suggests, there is no match to Kumar’s popularity among this segment in Bihar.Women turnout exceeded men turnout by five percentage points — a factor that remained unaccounted for in most exit polls. Women were underrepresented in most exit polls. The Axis-My-India poll, which polled over 63,000 voters, had only 31% women respondents. To be fair to pollsters, they were mindful of this problem and extrapolated the data (a valid technique in survey research) to overcome this bias. But this was not enough.The Bihar verdict confirms that elections are won and lost during the campaign. Given the complexities involved, rather than predicting outcomes, our focus must remain on understanding the opportunities and constraints each campaign reflects — in this case, it is a story of the glass ceiling Tejashwi Yadav couldn’t break and the possible return of Nitish Kumar against all odds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/why-tejashwi-failed-to-break-the-glass-ceiling-opinion/story-c6L8kSaZeqQpQcz06hENuM.html
11-11-2020||City||Sacked over remarks on former Maharashtra CM Ashok Chavan, claims Navi Mumbai mathadi leader||The Mathadis (headloaders) stalled work at the wholesale APMC market in Vashi on Wednesday morning following the sacking of their leader Narendra Patil by the state government from the cabinet rank post of chairman of Annasaheb Patil Arthik Vikas Mahamandal. However, the operations resumed after three hours of protests. Patil claimed that he had been sacked over his comments on former chief minister Ashok Chavan who he blamed for not taking up the Maratha community cause effectively. Chavan on the other hand claimed that the Opposition is merely playing politics in the name of reservation. The onion potato, grains and spices market were affected as the mathadis protested in the market premises. They raised slogans against the state government and in favour of reinstatement of Patil. Kailash Shinde, a mathadi leader, said, “We condemn the decision of the state government which is politically motivated. The mandal was started by late Balasaheb Thackeray and then revived by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Patil had toured all over the state and was targeting 1 lakh entrepreneurs from the Maratha community that has long been suffering. ” Narendra Patil who held a press conference in Mumbai on the dismissal of the board of the Mandal, that is named after his late father and much revered Mathadi leader Annsaheb Patil, denied that he had asked for the markets to be shut. The mathadis later resumed work. Patil said, “Despite relentlessly working for the Mandal since my appointment by the last government, I have been sacked without any intimation. I expected at least some appreciation from the government, I will meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and CM Devendra Fadnavis and thank them for the opportunity.” Patil claimed that the decision to sack him was politically motivated due to his comments on former chief minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation. He added, “My father who gave up his life for the community and I have been working for the upliftment of the Maratha community. The previous government ensured reservation for us but now Chavan has failed, I had asked for Chavan to be replaced by minister Eknath Shinde to head the committee as Shinde is well versed with the issue and will do a better job. That did not go down well. I have never been after power and was not targeting Chavan for any personal reasons. For me the interest of my community is paramount.” When contacted Ashok Chavan, he dismissed the allegations of failing on the reservation issue stating, “The same team of lawyers who had taken up the case successfully in the high court during the previous government’s tenure took up the matter in the Supreme Court. Besides we have been coordinating on the issue with various concerned organisations and held several meetings with them.”Chavan said that they are doing all that can be done and in fact, more than the previous government, to ensure justice to the Maratha community. He remarked, “Those making allegations are only interested in playing politics on the reservation issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sacked-over-remarks-on-former-maharashtra-cm-ashok-chavan-claims-navi-mumbai-mathadi-leader/story-iFp5eTzsPrVTklYkY7drbO.html

11-11-2020||Mumbai||Don’t step out, celebrate Diwali from homes: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday once again appealed to citizens to celebrate Diwali in a low-key manner, so as to avoid a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections.Maharashtra, keeping in line with it declining trend in cases, reported 4,907 new infections and 125 deaths on Wednesday, taking the tally to 1,731,833 and toll to 45,560. Active cases in the state stand at 88,070.Reminding citizens about the potential second wave of infections, on the lines of the ones being witnessed in Europe, Thackeray called for citizens to celebrate the festival without venturing out of their homes. “I am celebrating Diwali sitting at home and exchanging greetings online. It is important to keep ourselves and our families safe until the vaccine is available and reaches us. It is only because of the restraint adopted by the people during the festivals of all religions in the past eight months, we could keep the virus at bay. It is possible even in future if we adopt Covid-19-appropriate behaviour,” he said.Thackeray said that in European countries where the pandemic was in its second and third wave, authorities were facing a shortage of doctors, medical staff and even equipment. Also read: How Maharashtra’s jails stayed free of Covid-19“If we become complacent, a surge could be witnessed in the state. We are planning to open schools and colleges after Diwali, but to enable it, following the protocol strictly is more important,” he said.While the state has been recording daily cases at an average of 4,857 in the first 11 days of October, Mumbai’s average number of daily cases remained at 841 this month. Mumbai on Wednesday recorded 1,069 new Covid-19 cases, up from the figures of the past two days — 535 on Tuesday and 599 on Monday. Mumbai also recorded 22 deaths owing to Covid-19 on Wednesday. The total number of cases in the city has now gone up to 266,748 and the toll has risen to 10,506.There are 15,825 active cases in Mumbai, with a recovery rate of 90%. The average growth rate of Covid-19 cases is 0.29% with a doubling rate of 243 days. Mumbai has conducted 1,648,347 Covid-19 tests so far.Following Mumbai, Pune retained its second position in terms of cases and deaths, with 573 new cases (229 in rural parts, 218 in city and 126 in Pimpri-Chichwad) and 16 deaths. Nashik clocked 441 cases and five deaths, while Nagpur logged 237 cases and seven deaths. Satara reported 201 cases and nine deaths. The state’s case fatality rate (CFR) stands at 2.63%. Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) added 1,832 cases and 41 deaths in the last 24 hours.Anticipating a second wave, state authorities have been directed to gear up the augmentation of health infrastructure. “Except school-colleges and religious places, there will be no more activities opened up. Though the state government has asked railways to keep their plan ready for operations of local trains for general public, we are not pushing to begin them immediately. We will allow students to travel in trains after Diwali, but the decision to open for all in non-peak hours will depend on cases 10 days after Diwali,” said an official from Mantralaya.Meanwhile, the state conducted 53,427 tests in 24 hours at a positivity rate of 7.64%. The state’s recovery rate stands at 92.23%, after 9,164 more patients recovered on Wednesday, taking the tally of recovered patients to 1,597,255.

11-11-2020||Noida||Electrician beaten up outside residential society in Greater Noida||Greater Noida: A 25-year-old electrician was allegedly beaten up by three suspects outside a residential society in Sector Chi V on Tuesday night. The victim, Raj Kumar, a resident of Chuharpur village, alleged that the suspects also tried to abduct him in their car. “I was taking tea at a stall outside the society when three persons in a Maruti Baleno car reached the spot. The suspects held me without a provocation and beat me. They also tried to abduct me in their car,” he said. Kumar raised an alarm and local people gathered at the spot. The suspects then got into the car and fled the spot. Local people informed police and a team from Sector Beta 2 police station reached the spot and rushed the victim to a private hospital. Kumar said that he works as an electrician in Nimbus Express Park View I in Greater Noida. According to the police, some people also captured the incident on their mobile phones. However, since it was dark, the suspects’ photos could not be captured clearly, they said. Sujeet Upadhyaya, SHO, Sector Beta 2 police station, said that it was a case of beating and not abduction. “It appears the suspects had beat him up over personal enmity. This was not a case of abduction. We have registered a case against three persons under Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC. We are scanning footage of CCTV camera to arrest the suspects,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/electrician-beaten-up-outside-residential-society-in-greater-noida/story-cAW0uGMHt3rs9XhNF53NiO.html
11-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Teen stabbed during robbery bid in shared vehicle||Noida: A 16-year-old boy was injured on Tuesday evening after he was stabbed by unidentified persons in a robbery bid near the Mahamaya flyover.The victim was identified as Priyanshu Singh, a resident of Delhi’s Badarpur area. He is a class 11 student at a private school and had come to Noida’s Atta market for some errands, said police.“The boy was in Noida for some work and was leaving in the evening to go to Kalindi Kunj. He took a shared auto-rickshaw near sector 37 to go to Delhi,” said Ankita Sharma, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), zone 1.Police officials said that three people were already present in the vehicle which the victim assumed to be other passengers. When the auto reached near Mahamaya flyover, the driver turned towards the road leading to Amity University instead of the one going to Kalindi Kunj.“That is when the boy realised that something was wrong. He asked the driver to drop him there itself, but the driver didn’t stop. Meanwhile, the men tried to rob him but the boy resisted,” said the ACP.When the suspects realised that his shouts might attract other people, one of them stabbed him with a knife in his neck. Police officials said that the men were unsuccessful in taking anything from him and they left him bleeding while they fled with the vehicle.The boy was later able to call his family and the police helpline after which a team was rushed to the spot and he was taken for treatment to a nearby hospital. “ His injury was serious and he was referred to a higher centre in Delhi where he is doing well now,” said the police official.Based on the complaint of the boy’s father, a case of attempt to murder (section 307 of Indian Penal Code) has been registered at the sector 39 police station against unidentified suspects.The police officials said that they are scanning CCTV cameras in the area to trace the vehicle and identify the suspects after which due legal action will be taken against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-teen-stabbed-during-robbery-bid-in-shared-vehicle/story-Wv7UX8hzGrzm1h5nrLnU3N.html
11-11-2020||Noida||Delhi FRRO to cover Noida, Ghaziabad OCI card services||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Wednesday announced that the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Delhi will cover matters relating to services with respect to Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders residing in Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts. OCI allows people of Indian origin to live and work in India and avail certain benefits at par with non-resident Indians and resident Indians. According to rules, those who wished to apply for OCI benefits, including permission for research work, and change in particulars, would be required to approach their respective FRRO for their applications to be processed.“So far, Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad districts of Uttar Pradesh were under the jurisdiction of FRRO, Lucknow for the purpose of receiving and processing of applications for various services in respect of OCI card holders. This was causing inconvenience to OCI card holders residing in these districts,” read an MHA press statement. It said that the two districts will now be brought under FRRO, Delhi. “These measures are expected to greatly facilitate foreign nationals residing in the National Capital Region (NCR) for availing visa and OCI related services” The FRRO, Delhi already services the states of Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, apart from the Capital itself.In response to persistent demands for “dual citizenship”, the central government had launched the OCI cardholder scheme in 2006 to register Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs), provided they satisfied certain conditions as laid out in the MHA website. The OCI cardholder, however, does not have certain rights, such as political rights or equal opportunity in matters of public employment. The MHA press statement said that during the last few years, the central government had taken a number of measures to facilitate the stay in India of foreign travellers. “The central government has introduced various measures recently such as launching of an e-FRRO module throughout the country bringing various visa related services being granted to foreigners within India on the online platform, permitting foreigners on any category of visa to avail indoor and outdoor medical treatment up to 180 days without conversion of their visa to medical visa,” it read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/delhi-frro-to-cover-noida-ghaziabad-oci-card-services/story-2XNt8JDFkziwPnHRSCFMLP.html
11-11-2020||Noida||Mask violations: Police enforcement lacks sting in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Even as the markets and public places are abuzz with activity during the festive season, the number of fines issued by the district police against people not wearing face masks has dipped to its lowest level in the past two months. The situation seems to be moving out of hands as residents are openly flouting the Covid-19 protocols amid the rising number of cases. This is despite repeated directions by state government to the western UP districts for taking all measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19, especially in the wake of a surge in cases in Delhi. However, officials of the district police said that they will intensify the drive. On Wednesday, Ghaziabad recorded 136 new Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 20,071 in the district, according to the state control room records. The district now has 1,223 active cases.As regards the enforcement against mask violations, the official records, sourced through the district administration, revealed that the police penalised 60,680 people for not wearing face masks during the period from May 1 to November 6. The police penalised 2,131 people in May, 17,917 in June, 20,936 in July and 11,410 in August. However, the drive went haywire in the past two months -- September and October -- when the police issued 5,779 and 2,353 challans, respectively, against persons not wearing face masks. Also, in the first six days of November, the number of such challans stood at just 154, shows the data. When contacted, Kalanidhi Naithani, senior superintendent of police, said, “We will soon intensify the drive against persons not wearing face masks.” Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, said, “We have started with a drive in different police station areas where teams will check and penalise people if they are found not wearing face masks. We will intensify the enforcement activities.” Traders said that they have decided not to attend customers who come without wearing masks. “During the times of festival season, we have about 25,000-30,000 people coming daily to the market. About 50% of them come without masks and roam around without anyone questioning them. On our part, we have decided not to attend customers who come without wearing masks. We have kept surgical masks at our shops and give them to our customers free of cost if they visit without a mask,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairperson of Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal. Experts said that face mask, social distancing and hand-washing are the only means to prevent the Covid-19 spread till the time a vaccine becomes available. “This is the time when people need to take the highest level of precaution as repeatedly advised by the government. Otherwise, the winter season is most conducive for respiratory infections and any Covid infection will aggravate health conditions. According to my estimate, about 50% people do not use masks in markets and public places, and the number could be higher,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. “It is so because of lack of awareness and enforcement. Strict enforcement is needed as there is overcrowding in markets and people are flouting norms openly,” Agarwal added. The Ghaziabad district has an estimated population of about 44 lakh. On Tuesday, Alok Kumar, UP principal secretary (health) yet again reiterated that wearing of face masks, adhering to social distancing and frequent hand-washing is must to keep Covid-19 infection at bay. “There has been surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi and some of our western UP districts are also affected. So, it is vital that people take all precautions and wear face masks and adhere to social distancing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/mask-violations-police-enforcement-lacks-sting-in-ghaziabad/story-3591uVuwaRepJ1dXGNegIM.html

Neighbouring Gautam Budh Nagar is also nearing 20,000 cases, as per the records of the state control room. As per the control room figures, the total tally of Ghaziabad reached 20,071 which includes 18,763 patients discharged, along with 85 deaths and 1,223 active cases. GB Nagar, on the other hand, has now 19,614 total cases, with 71 deaths and 1,115 active cases while 18,428 patients have been discharged. Ghaziabad is among the top four districts in the state which have the highest number of cases. In the first 10 days of November, Ghaziabad had 1,359 fresh cases while GB recorded 1,737 new cases. The figure of 20,000 cases in Ghaziabad arrived in a span of 251 days with first case in the district reported on March 5. The first 10,000 cases were recorded in 189 days while the next 10,000 took about 62 days to arrive. With a surge in cases in Delhi, there have been concerns that the tally of new cases in NCR districts of UP may rise while Diwali is round the corner. “To check any rise of new cases, we are conducting focussed testing which is taken up for different groups and have also increased our contact tracing which is about 25 contacts per patient. Further, surveillance activity has been ramped up to keep tab on new cases,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer of Ghaziabad. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey was not available for his comments.According to the state figures, Ghaziabad is among the top three districts in the state having highest number of active cases. The other two districts are Lucknow (3,054) and Meerut (1,784). Ghaziabad also figures among the top four districts in the state, along with Lucknow, Kanpur City and Prayagraj, which have total cases more than 20,000. According to the records of the Ghaziabad district health department, the overall positivity rate in the district is about 4.22% with 474,067 samples collected till November 10. The total sampling also includes 275,963 tests conducted with the help of rapid antigen kits. Meanwhile, GB Nagar district is also nearing the 20,000 mark. However, district officials said that there is no major spike in cases considering the festival season and recent spike in cases in Delhi. “We are conducting more tests. It is in the range of about 3,500-4,000 tests per day. The rise of cases in Delhi could be due to multiple factors. But we cannot say that our district has sudden spike in cases. Earlier, there were about 200 average daily cases and now we have about 150 average daily cases,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar. “To keep cases in check, we are testing more of symptomatic persons and have also ramped up our contact tracing which is about 20-25 contacts per patients. We keep asking residents to mandatorily wear face masks and maintain social distancing,” he added. However, the officials in both the districts have raised concerns that wearing of face masks by people is a major issue which needs strict enforcement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-20-000-noida-nearing-the-mark/story-UWVZahEwwUjaiY5lrjsmpK.html

11-11-2020||Noida||Greater Noida: Police book man, family for ‘killing and cremating’ wife||The Greater Noida Police on Wednesday booked six persons, including the husband and in-laws of a woman who was allegedly killed and cremated in Dankaur. Chandni, 23, of Bulandshahr, had married Jitendra, a resident of Junedpur in Dankaur in January 2017 and had two sons.On Wednesday, Chandni’s family claimed that they were told that she had been killed and cremated. Police could not confirm the allegation, but have booked the six -- Jitendra, his siblings and their parents -- under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including section 304-B (dowry death). Police said the suspects were absconding with the children.Chandni’s brother Nitin Kumar filed the complaint at the Dankaur police station. Kumar said his family had spent nearly ₹10 lakh on the marriage. “Since then, Chandni’s in-laws started demanding ₹2 lakh dowry to start a business,” Kumar said. He alleged that Jitendra, his father Maharaj Singh, mother Sanno, brothers Ravi and Lala and sister Usha had been harassing the victim. “On October 8, 2020, they had beaten up my sister. We reached Dankaur and brought her back. She stayed with us for a month. On November 8, Jitendra arrived and promised that he will not harass Chandni anymore,” Kumar said in the complaint. But two nights later, Kumar said, Chandni called him and said that her in-laws were harassing and assaulting her again over dowry. “She pleaded with us to rescue her. On Wednesday morning, we tried contacting Jitendra but the call was not received. We asked our relatives in the neighbourhood to check their house. They reported back saying that the family had killed Chandni and cremated her,” he said. Vishal Pandey, additional DCP Greater Noida, said that a police team visited the site where the woman was allegedly cremated. “The police have found some evidence which suggested that a body was cremated there. The forensic team has collected evidence and are processing it for confirmation,” he said.Chandni’s family and a number of others later gathered at Dankaur police station and protested the murder. Anil Kumar Pandey, SHO Dankaur police station, said based on complaint a case has been registered against six persons under Section 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), Section 304-B (dowry death), Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy), Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), and Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act 1961. “A police team found the suspects absconding,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-police-book-man-family-for-killing-and-cremating-wife/story-ybUbc8A6ZaDlYUEQhkUxgL.html

11-11-2020||Noida||Corporation starts bio-remediation at Arthala drain as pilot project, will give relief to river Hindon||The Ghaziabad municipal corporation has started a pilot project to improve the quality of the waste water discharge from the Arthala drain into the Hindon river. There are 10 major drains in Ghaziabad that discharge their untreated contents into the Hindon river, thereby polluting it. These drains carry both domestic and commercial waste. Since the last many years, these discharges have resulted in the increase of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). “The pilot-project involves pouring an organic solution into the drain that will help in reducing odour and improve quality. We are likely to get the first results of the experiment in five days,” said Brijesh Kumar Singh, general manager (water works) from the corporation. “The process has been initiated on directions of national green tribunal (NGT) and tenders for other drains will also be floated soon.”“Both BOD and COD are basically impurities in water. If the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels are high, the BOD and COD will reduce. Bio-remediation involves releasing microorganisms which destroy impurities. But, a constant monitoring of results should be reviewed on periodic basis to gauge improvement,” said Dr Chandravir Singh, an environmentalist and a retired scientist from Haryana pollution board. In its status report filed before the NGT on August 27, the corporation has stated that survey was done for 10 drains which fall into river Hindon. These were identified as Karhera drain, Hindon Vihar drain, Kaila Bhatta drain, Arthala drain, Sarvodaya Nagar drain, Rahul Vihar drain, Indirapuran drain, Dasna drain and Nandgram drain near Petrol Pump besides the one near City Forest’s main gate. The corporation has also engaged National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to prepare detailed project report for the 10 drains. “The condition of the river is in bad state as it has almost negligible amount of dissolved oxygen which could help in propagation of aquatic life. Major pollution sources are the drains which are flowing untreated into the river. Once the corporation has started the process, they must continue it and monitor results,” said Akash Vashishtha, a city-based environmentalist. According to the official records of the UP pollution control board, the river stretch from Saharanpur to Ghaziabad has presence of 31 drains of which two are partially tapped while rest 29 are untapped. The records mention that river Hindon gets total discharge of 674.03 MLD which includes 595.64 MLD from sewage discharge (with 224 MLD treated and 371.64 untreated) while the rest of about 78.39 is treated industrial discharge. To gauge the state of river Hindon, the official records of the UP pollution control board states that the three stretches of river Hindon falling in Ghaziabad at Karhera, Mohan Nagar overbridge and Chhijarsi has dissolved oxygen levels in range of 0.62 to 2.4 mg/litre, 0.48 to 1.87 mg/litre and 0.0 to 1.7 mg/litre, respectively, during the period January to September this year. According to officials, DO levels about 5 mg/litres or above are suitable for propagation of aquatic life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/corporation-starts-bio-remediation-at-arthala-drain-as-pilot-project-will-give-relief-to-river-hindon/story-K3m0U7nXfkTKzvKoxr46HN.html
11-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Anti-smog gun installed at Sector 6 to reduce air pollution||Noida: The Noida authority has installed anti-smog gun in Sector 6 Udyog Marg, one of the key roads in the city, to mitigate air pollution.The authority is likely to install more anti-smog guns at traffic intersections to reduce air pollution caused out of vehicular emission and traffic congestion, officials said. To begin with, the authority has installed an anti-smog gun at a small park in Sector 6, along Udyog Marg that remains congestion-ridden during peak hours. The road connects Delhi-Noida Link Road with Sector 11/Jhundpura. The authority’s main administrative building is also located along this road.“The anti-smog gun will help settle dust particles which fly due to vehicles on roads. We have planned to install more anti-smog guns at main roads. We have directed all circle officers to install anti-smog guns in their respective circles,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of Noida authority.The gun at Sector 6 will remain functional during peak hours. It cannot remain operational continuously for the whole day as it requires regular water supply, the officials said.The authority has already installed 30 anti-smog guns at big construction sites across the city.“At least 10 more anti-smog guns will be installed at key roads in the next three to four days. Our priority is to make sure that adequate measures are taken to mitigate air pollution,” said Maheshwari.The authority has also directed private contractors and developers to make sure that the anti-smog guns are installed at big construction sites.“We have directed that if a construction site is above 20,000 square metres in area, then it is mandatory to install anti-smog gun to reduce air pollution. We will shut down the site and impose penalty if the big site is operational without an anti-smog gun,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority.The authority has imposed Rs 71,500 penalty against four entities for flouting rules and causing pollution, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-anti-smog-gun-installed-at-sector-6-to-reduce-air-pollution/story-Ortl1xBQeRmBy5ZkOaVLgI.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||Expedite rehab of slums near Mithi river and on Mumbai airport land: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday directed officials to expedite the rehabilitation of slum-dwellers around the Mithi riverfront on the Mumbai airport land. The meeting held at CM’s official residence Varsha, was attended by the officials from the housing department, slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) and urban development. Thackeray directed the officials to finish the process of rehabilitating the slum dwellers who are ineligible for rehabilitation, as per the 1995 Slum Regularisation Rules, under the 2011 rule of the state government. A speedier rehabilitation of the slum-dwellers will give a boost to the long-delayed expansion plan of the Mumbai airport.Slum-dwellers at Kranti Nagar and Sandesh Nagar in Kurla on the Mithi riverfront should be rehabilitated on priority, CM Thackeray said, according to a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO). “Those slum-dwellers, who are ineligible for rehabilitation as per the 1995 rules, must be made eligible under the 2011 rules. The rehabilitation of the slum-dwellers must be completed in a time-bound manner,” Thackeray said.In December 2017, the state government had cleared an amendment in the Maharashtra Slum Areas Act, 1971, to enable the government to provide houses to ‘ineligible’ slum-dwellers residing in hutments built until January 1, 2011. However, they will have to pay the construction cost before getting possession.The expansion of the Mumbai airport, which was proposed in 2006, has been stuck owing to opposition from hutment dwellers, who occupy 276 acres of airport land. Shiv Sena legislators from Mumbai had raised the issue of freeing up the airport land, among other issues, with Thackeray during their meeting last week. The CM added that there are 17,200 tenements available in Kurla, which must be utilised for rehabilitation, after its repair, as some of the buildings are in an uninhabitable condition. He added that besides squatters on the airport land, slum-dwellers around Mithi river must be rehabilitated on priority by constructing tenements in other areas.Redevelopment of BBD chawls The much-delayed redevelopment of BDD chawls was also discussed in a separate meeting chaired by Thackeray on Wednesday as Larsen and Toubro reportedly decided to withdraw from the Naigaum project. The firm had bagged the contracts to redevelop Naigaum and Worli BDD chawls. A private contractor also made a presentation in the meeting, however, no decision was taken. The state government had planned to redevelop all the four clusters of BDD chawls — Naigaon, NM Joshi, Worli and Sewri. Tata Group had bagged the NM Joshi project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/expedite-rehab-of-slums-near-mithi-river-and-on-mumbai-airport-land-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray/story-2puXL782hv1IH85WLkNk7K.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||How Maharashtra’s jails stayed free of Covid-19||From facing flak for its initial handling of the Covid-19 situation to coming up with a proactive approach which kept the cases and fatalities low, the state prisons department has put up a strong fight against the coronavirus disease, feel experts, considering how social distancing in overcrowded jails doubled the challenge.As of Wednesday, there were 60 active cases among the 28,590 inmates in 43 prisons across the state. Six inmates have died of Covid so far. Around 534 staff members working at the jails tested positive, of whom 511 recovered, while seven succumbed. Decongesting premisesSunil Ramanand, additional director general (prisons), admitted there was panic among prisoners in the initial days of the outbreak, but later the prison administration managed to prevent the spread. The 43 jails in the state had population of 36,000 prisoners. As part of the decongestion drive, many prisoners facing non-serious crimes were allowed to go home on court’s order. Those out on bail were asked not to return to jail. Those released on emergency parole could stay out till the time government revoked the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act and lifted the lockdown completely. Consequently, the number of inmates in the state prisons came down to 28,590. A prison officer from Pune headquarters said strict lockdown was imposed in every prison after the first case was reported in a prison in the state was reported in Byculla jail on May 31, then Satara prisons and then the outbreak in Arthur Road prison in June. The staff and officials posted at all prisons were not allowed to go out for a month. “Even the jail staff who lived in nearby quarters were not allowed to step out, fearing he/she may bring the contagion in the prison. The staff was on rotation every month,” the officer said. New prisoners are not allowed to directly enter the jails. They had to first compulsorily spend a 14-day quarantine stay outside at temporary prisons, after which they were lodged in the main prison, only after undergoing testing. “The state prisons department as of today has over 42 temporary prisons,” the officer said. Testing timesTesting was another key tool in this battle. The prison authority has so far conducted 26,740 tests across 43 central, districts and other jails. In these, 2,392 prisoners tested positive. Of them, 2,332 prisoners have recovered. “Overcrowded prisons were identified and testing was intensified. Maximum tests were carried out in Yerwada-Pune prison (3,197), followed by Taloja (2,919), Kalyan (1,603) and Thane (1,520),” said the officer.Among other measures were giving homeopathic immunity boosting medicine such as Camphora to prisoners, encouraging prisoners to perform yoga and exercise, and enhancing the nutritional value of the food served, he said. The six Covid fatalities were reported in prisons in Taloja in Navi Mumbai, Yerawada in Pune, Amravati and Dhule. The last Covid death of a prisoner was reported on August 10 in Vashimb, a jail official said. “Till date, six prisoners have lost their lives. In three months, there was no fatality,” said Ramanand. Another jail officer said, “Now, we are prepared to deal with a second wave, if need arises.” Raja Bagga, senior researcher, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, said, “The role of high-powered committee constituted under the directions of the SC in trying to reduce overcrowding and Ministry of Home Affairs’ detailed guidelines issued in May 2020 have been important and timely to address the pandemic in prisons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/how-maharashtra-s-jails-stayed-free-of-covid-19/story-bFqlWFA3OhX5RjgU31jZIN.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||Bihar election: Maharashtra’s Shiv Sena, NCP score less votes than Nota||The two regional parties from Maharashtra — the Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) — drew a blank in the Bihar elections, results for which were declared on Tuesday. While the Sena had fielded 22 candidates, the NCP contested 108 seats. Both the parties could not win a single seat and got below 1% votes, which is even less than the None of the Above (Nota) option. According to the Election Commission of India (ECI), the Sena polled 0.05% of the eligible votes, while Nota fetched 1.68% votes. All Sena candidates lost their deposit, a senior party functionary said. The Sena does not have a foothold outside Maharashtra, but has been contesting the Assembly and general elections in states, including Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan etc, to increase its footprint. So far, it has not been successful. The party gave tickets to local level functionaries and social activists with some presence in the constituency. Sena leaders said it contested polls on the development plank. The Uddhav Thackeray-led party initially planned to contest around 50 seats in the election. Later, around 30 candidates filed nomination forms, only 22 candidates made it into the fray after scrutiny, the functionary said. Similarly, the NCP got just 0.23% votes and did not manage to win even one seat, according to the ECI website. “We wanted to contest the polls as partners of the grand alliance comprising Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and others and were also ready to accept RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav as chief ministerial candidate. But the grand alliance wasn’t ready to leave even two seats for us, hence we opted to contest on our own,” said a senior NCP leader, privy to the development. “We were not ready to go solo in the polls and not prepared as well. Not a single rally was held by NCP chief Sharad Pawar for the Bihar polls. Some of our candidates got 4,000 to 5,000 votes and some could not pull even 500 votes too,” he said. In 2015 too, the party solely contested 40 seats, but failed to get one seat. The NCP has two MLAs in Kerala and one MLA in Gujarat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bihar-election-shiv-sena-ncp-score-less-than-nota/story-jT5cRUNB8tReDdL7h7qjwL.html

We also conducted a dust audit of 19 construction sites and checked for adequate emission control measures like anti-smog guns and water sprinkling. Three builders were found flouting norms and we recommended a fine of ₹5 lakh each,” said Praveen Kumar, regional officer, UPPCB, Noida. Meanwhile, UPPCB Greater Noida too penalised builders. “We had recommended to the Greater Noida authority, and the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development authority (UPSIDA) to take adequate measures to ensure garbage or waste are not set afire in the open,” said Archna Dwivedi, RO, UPPCB, Greater Noida. A builder at sector-1 was penalised ₹5 lakh and another in Surajpur area was slapped with ₹30,000. A fine of ₹5,000 was imposed against a motorcycle repair shop in Greater Noida for burning waste. Meanwhile, in two separate letters to UPSIDA and Greater Noida Development Authority, the pollution board said, “As you are aware that the currently the air quality of the region is hovering around sever and severe+, under which as per the order of national green tribunal the UPSIDA sites were found in violation of the environment norms. Upon inspection several piles of burnt and unburnt garbage and solid waste were found at Site-B that could lead to burning and emission thereby deteriorating the air quality. Kindly ensure swift action to manage the soild waste in your area.”The UPSIDA, Greater Noida had been accused of flaunting the environment norms and open burning earlier as well. “We will be hiring an agency to manage the solid waste soon. There had been instances of garbage set afire at our site however it was soon controlled with the help of fire tenders. It’s also difficult to identify the people who often set garbage on fire, but we are vigilant to avoid such cases in future,” said Anil Kuma Sharma, regional manager, UPSIDA, Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-pollution-board-imposes-fine-on-builders-asks-authorities-to-manage-garbage/story-4odREJs3hN2fvoHEWLPiXI.html
11-11-2020||Noida||Winds pull Noida and Ghaziabad out of ‘severe’ air quality||Favourable winds pulled Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida out of the “severe” pollution category on Wednesday, improving the air, yet still under the “very poor” category, which is the cleanest since November 2. The three cities had been breathing extremely toxic air for over a week, with its first “severe” level being recorded on on November 5. What helped matters was the reduction in smoke from stubble burning from neighbouring Punjab and Haryana regions as the wind direction changed from north-westerly to easterly. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), further improvement is likely in the next two days as the easterly winds will continue providing sufficient ventilation. A minimum wind speed of 10kmph is required to reduce pollutants in the atmosphere of the national capital region (NCR).“The easterly winds of 10-12 kmph continued for almost the entire day on Wednesday leading to significant improvement. Since the direction of intrusion of the fire was not from Punjab and Haryana where the major fires were seen, the level of pollutants also dropped. The winds are expected to continue at the same speed for next two days, so we can anticipate a further more improvement in the region,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, IMD. He added that the westerly and north-westerly winds may return for some time on November 13, but is likely to shift to easterly from November 14, leading to further improvement. “The change to westerly for some time on November 12 will not lead to significant deterioration,” added Srivastava. According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), while the stubble fire have reduced from over 4,528 on November 6 to approx. 2,422 on Wednesday there share of PM2.5 also dropped significantly in the region from over 30 per cent a day earlier to 3 per cent on Wednesday.. “The change in transport level wind direction has led to a significant decrease in the fire-related intrusion in spite of high fire counts. The PM2.5 ageing and relatively not so calm surface winds helped to flush out,” said SAFAR statement on Wednesday. According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 309 or ‘very-poor’ against 455 or ‘severe’ a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 340 against 436 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 360 against 444 a day earlier. The average PM2.5 levels for Noida for past 24-hours was recorded to be 170 microgrammes per cubic metres (μg/m³), against 547.99μg/m³ a day earlier. For Greater Noida, the PM2.5 was 180.54μg/m³ against 536.87 μg/m³ a day earlier. The average PM10 levels for Noida was 418.49 μg/m³ against 619.51μg/m³ a day earlier. For Greater Noida, the PM10 levels were 388.74 μg/m³ against 661.49 μg/m³ a day earlier. According to the CPCB, the standard limit for PM10 is 100 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m³) while the limit for PM2.5 is 60μg/m³, which are in any case much higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) limits of 20 μg/m³ and 10μg/m³, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/winds-pull-noida-and-ghaziabad-out-of-severe-air-quality/story-KFFe5woTQLtkqD8JaTnYMN.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||Permit local train travel for teachers: Maharashtra government to railways||The state government has requested the railways to allow teachers and school staff to travel by local trains. The move comes days after the Maharashtra education department made 50% attendance mandatory for teachers and non-teaching staff in schools. Last week, the government’s disaster management department wrote to the Central Railway (CR) and Western Railway (WR), asking them to allow teachers to travel by trains. “In accordance with the department’s move of implementing 50% attendance for teachers, it is requested that they be allowed to ply by trains,” the letter stated. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad said, “We have proposed the railways to allow train travel for school staff and are hoping to get an approval soon.”Officials from the railways said that the proposal will be sent to the railway board for approval, and a decision will be taken accordingly. If approved, teachers will benefit from being allowed to travel by local trains. “Most teachers travel very long distances from their homes to school. Travelling by buses or private vehicles is time-consuming and costly. The government should allow train travel soon,” said a teacher of a suburban school. As per standard operating procedures (SOPs) released on October 30, teachers from all schools in Maharashtra can be asked to be physically present for work related to online learning or other academic purposes. Schools have been asked to ensure that they sanitise their premises and undertake temperature checks. Teachers have been asked to follow safety guidelines like wearing masks and following physical distancing. Similarly, schools need to follow the policy of “staying home if unwell” for teachers who are not feeling well, especially those who have comorbidities or are above the age of 50 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/permit-local-train-travel-for-teachers-maharashtra-government-to-railways/story-79OD95Vu0zWVnvrd7f40CO.html

11-11-2020||Mumbai||BMC to undertake ₹125-crore drain work in Mumbai’s western suburbs to prevent waterlogging||To bring relief from monsoon waterlogging between Borivli and Bandra in the western suburbs, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has planned repair, restructuring, and widening work on stormwater drains along 19 chronic and newly-emerged waterlogging spots. On Wednesday, the civic body invited 19 separate bids for the ₹125-crore work.This is phase one of the planned works on spots that need immediate relief from waterlogging, as Mumbai is opening up after an eight-month-long lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak and the 2021 monsoon will see more traffic and people venturing out, in comparison to the 2020 monsoon.Some work is slotted to be completed within six months to a year, while other work will take over two years to complete. It includes augmentation or new construction of box drains and removal of encroachment at Chandavarkar nulla, from SV Road to TJSV Bank at Borivli; construction of stormwater drains at Dahisar subway; augmentation of box drains at Linking Road and Dadabhai Road in Santacruz (West); construction of missing link in the drain on Pali Mala Road, Dr Ambedkar Road, and near Mehboob Studio; widening of culverts on the Western Express Highway; and widening of nullahs and drains in Malad, Ville Parle, and Khar.A senior official of the stormwater department (SWD) said, “These 19 extensive works are needed at chronic waterlogging spots. During the last monsoon, many new waterlogging spots also emerged in the suburbs that need to be addressed. The tendering process is likely to extend till January. BMC will be able to issue work orders immediately so some areas will get relief in the monsoon of 2021, and others in the monsoon of 2022.” Throughout next year, BMC has also shortlisted other areas in the city for drain augmentation work.Another senior civic official said that new waterlogging spots emerged during the previous monsoon due to incomplete drain and nullah desilting work which came to a standstill because of the lockdown and resultant lack of labour. Sedimentation due to ongoing road and Metro construction work also caused waterlogging.“We studied each of the waterlogging spots that emerged this monsoon. All ward offices were asked to identify localised waterlogging spots that can be fixed in the short duration of six months that we have before the 2021 monsoon,” he added.After the monsoon of 2017 and 2018, BMC shortlisted 273 waterlogging spots in the city. Over the past two years, it has tackled 204 of them. The 2020 budget made allocations to address 45 other waterlogging spots, leaving only 24 to be tackled next year. However, due to the lockdown, the civic body could not complete the work this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-to-undertake-125-crore-drain-work-in-mumbai-s-western-suburbs-to-prevent-waterlogging/story-RWfIZzfNyH7mYpSogOkFtN.html

The self-help group called Baba Jhandewalan comprises 15 members from Noorpur Bet with the youngest one being 20 years old.The business centre was inaugurated on Wednesday by Ludhiana ADC(D), Sandeep Kumar and Neeti Jain, director of Neva Garments in presence of village panchayat among others.“There cannot be a better time to invest in livelihood programmes. especially because rural expenditure is at an all-time low due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Sandeep Kumar.The garment unit will get their products manufactured by the SHG while also providing them with necessary handholding for a month and marketing support throughout the process of production. This comes at a time when the city has seen a mass exodus of workers due to the pandemic. A member of the SHG said, “It is time we stop saying we are not ready to become an entrepreneur, we will learn on the go as we do things and we are not scared to fail and learn.”This project is conceptualised and executed with the efforts of district development fellow, Aishwarya Dixit who has been appointed by the state government in Ludhiana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/all-women-self-help-group-join-hands-with-garment-unit-in-ludhiana/story-75Czxjcy478nt6yVMkRrFK.html
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||Hailed as Covid warriors, but no bonus: Chandigarh PGI non faculty staff to hold protest on Diwali||Miffed over not being given a Diwali Bonus, members of the Non Faculty Union of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research will hold a protest on the day of the festival (November 14) at the rally ground in Sector 25. The union has accused the PGIMER administration of not holding talks with them and said the deadlock over employee welfare issues had also not been resolved. “No measures have been undertaken by the government on overall fiscal management. Till then, this is the right of the healthcare workers and the bonus should be given to the employees from the internal revenue generated by the institute if it is not provided by the government,” said Ashwani Munjal, president of the PGI Employees Union of Non Faculty Members. “Since there are orders from the (Punjab and Haryana) high court prohibiting protests on the institute’s campus, the employees will protest at the rally ground instead. Employees on emergency and Covid-19 duties will not participate,” he added.After the health ministry in the recent communication directed the institute to desist from paying the non productivity linked bonus till the finance ministry’s nod, the PGIMER administration has been silent on the matter. Nurses at the institute were also surprised when authorities said they were “helpless” in sorting out the bonus issue. Satyaveer Dagur, general secretary of the Nurses Union, said autonomous bodies such as PGIMER had been at the forefront of dealing with the pandemic and such decisions affected the morale of the workers.“On Diwali, we will not light up our homes and post photographs on social networking sites. It will represent the real picture. What purpose has it served to show solidarity with the frontline warriors of the Covid-19 pandemic by turning off house lights and lighting candles and oil lamps early during the pandemic?” questioned Dagur. Approximately 5,000 group B (non-gazetted), C and D employees will not receive the bonus. Group B includes nursing officers, office superintendents, and personal assistants; Group C comprises clerical staff on different pay scale levels, and Group D employees are hospital and sanitation attendants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-bonus-pgimer-non-faculty-staff-to-hold-protest-on-diwali/story-y9zsv709a7kfXE9EUx6GLK.html

Besides overspeeding and other causes, 92 black spots are also contributing significantly to the rising road mishaps, said Kamal Soi, chairman of NGO Raahat, the Safe Community Foundation.“Every year, more than 350 people die in road accidents and more than 600 get severely injured. The fatality rate is as high as 69% making Ludhiana one of the most dangerous cities in the country,” said Soi.Although there are various reasons for this high fatality rate, the presence of 92 black spots is one of the main reasons, he said while adding that this can easily be improved with little effort.“Poor road infrastructure is claiming several lives in the district. Apart from just separating the traffic, no effort has been made for the safety of commuters on Jagraon and Gill flyover,” said Soi.He enunciated that speed is the single biggest factor contributing to road accident deaths in the country and more particularly in Ludhiana. “Over 40% of fatal collisions are caused by excessive or inappropriate speed. We don’t have any mechanism to enforce speed limits in the district. People drive recklessly endangering their own as well as lives of others,” he added.

11-11-2020||Mumbai||If Nitish Kumar becomes Bihar CM, he should give credit to Shiv Sena, says Sanjay Raut||Sanjay Raut, the chief spokesperson of the Shiv Sena, on Wednesday reiterated that if Nitish Kumar becomes the chief minister of Bihar again, he should give credit to the Sena, as it has shown what an ally can do, if the other alliance partner goes back on his word. Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Raut said, “The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are saying they have given him their word [on the CM post]. Nitish Kumar’s party is on the third spot. If the BJP keeps their word and if defeated Nitish Kumar becomes the CM again, he should give the credit to the Shiv Sena. Because we have shown in Maharashtra what happens if a word is not kept in an alliance.” Sena mouthpiece Saamana heaped praises on RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav for putting up a spirited fight in the Bihar polls where the BJP and Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) won a clear majority. An editorial in the Marathi daily published on Wednesday said it was not ready to believe that Tejashwi lost the election, adding that Bihar has seen the rise of a young leader in Tejashwi Yadav. In the results announced on early Wednesday morning, the BJP won 74 seats, while the JD(U) bagged 43 seats paving way for the National Democratic Alliance to come back to power with the support of smaller allies. Yadav’s RJD became the single largest party with 75 seats, and its ally Congress secured 19 seats. “Tejashwi hasn’t lost. Merely losing an election does not mean defeat. His fight was a big struggle - not only in the family but also against the powerful in Patna and Delhi. PM Narendra Modi called him the ‘prince of jungle raj’, while Nitish Kumar made an emotional appeal to voters saying it was his last election. But Tejashwi focused on issues of development, employment, health, education in the poll campaign,” the editorial said. The editorial further added that poor performance of the Congress hurt Tejashwi’s chance at becoming the chief minister. “Bihar has seen the rise of Tejashwi era. He single-handedly fought the people in power. It would be an injustice to Tejashwi to say that Modi’’s charisma worked in Bihar. The election, which looked one-sided initially became a closely- fought contest due to Tejashwi,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/if-nitish-kumar-becomes-bihar-cm-he-should-give-credit-to-shiv-sena-says-sanjay-raut/story-XJtvnlxXLMUwimTNQY9YnO.html

DTCP officials said that these were crucial highways and such construction will prevent future expansion, development of green belts and other facilities. KMP Expressway passes through Nuh and connects Palwal and Kundli via Manesar. The Sohna-Alwar road connects Gurugram and Sohna with Alwar district in Rajasthan. The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway, which is under construction, passes through Gurugram and Nuh.RS Bhath, district town planner, Nuh, who recently took over the charge, said that the highways last week and found that a large number of shops had come up within 50 metres of these roads. “A setback of 50 metres has to be kept on both sides of scheduled roads like these highways. During inspection it was found that commercial shops have come up unevenly and this is likely to cause problems in the future when these roads are completed and later when expansion is needed. We have already seen how difficult it has been to develop roads in Gurugram due to heavy construction in setbacks,” said Bhath, adding that any construction in controlled areas needed permission from the DTCP. “We will first ask people to vacate the shops voluntarily and if this is not done then large scale demolition drives will be carried out,” he said. In a related development, officials said that they would also carry out sealing of commercial properties built in parking areas in residential complexes Gurugram. The department said that they have received complaints in this regard and action would be initiated from next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/100-illegal-shops-along-crucial-road-links-notices-issued/story-VYtDbHFh38mYvoZqtBiVBM.html
11-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram air improves significantly due to wind||Gurugram’s air quality improved significantly on Wednesday. Favourable winds helped the city bring its quality down from “severe” a day earlier to “poor”, according to the air quality index (AQI) published by the central pollution control board (CPCB).The city’s air was the cleanest in the national capital region (NCR) with neighbouring Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad recording “very poor” air.On Wednesday, the AQI read of 288 (‘poor’), down from 427 (‘severe’). Experts attributed the improvement to change in wind direction and wind speed, which helped disperse pollutants that had accumulated over the past week. Gurugram’s AQI had stayed in the ‘severe’ zone for four consecutive days since November 7. “At the moment, winds are coming from the north and the north-east of Delhi. Gurugram lies south west of Delhi, right in the path of these winds, which have blown a fair bit of pollutants away that had collected because of stagnant weather over the past few days,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist. The concentration of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5), the city’s primary pollutant, was 272µg/m³ on Wedensday, as per the CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11 — down from 428µg/m³ on Tuesday. Similar improvements were seen across two other official air quality monitoring stations in Gurugram, which recorded ‘very poor’ air. However, Sector 51 continues to record higher pollution levels, with an average PM2.5 concentration of 331ug/m3 on Wednesday. This was also the only official monitor in Gurugram to record ‘very poor’ air on Wednesday, with a daily AQI reading of 331.According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to improve marginally but remain in the ‘very poor’ category on Thursday. The air quality is expected to deteriorate marginally and remain in the upper end of ‘very poor’ category on Friday. On Wednesday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 29.9 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature was 12 degrees Celsius. Both maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover in a similar range on Thursday. As per the weekly IMD forecast, clear skies will prevail on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-air-improves-significantly-due-to-wind/story-HB5r6DKdCLy6fsKxUcx4kM.html

The move will push up the district’s total Covid-19 bed availability to over 2,500 beds, from 1,975 beds currently allocated. The move follows a Tuesday meeting between the chief medical officer of Gurugram and representatives of these healthcare centres. “We have communicated to the hospitals that an additional 10% of beds may be required in the coming days. We will assess the situation post Diwali and are prepared to reserve as many as 45% of all hospital beds in the district,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram. “We are looking at reserving more ICU and general beds for now. In terms of ventilator capacity, we are okay. Less than 1% of people end up requiring intubation, and the spread of the virus needs to really escalate before ventilator availability becomes a problem in Gurugram. We have 122 ventilators reserved and can augment the number when needed,” Yadav said.With the increase in the number of Covid-19 patients requiring critical care, experts warned of a possible spike in mortality numbers this month. “The progression of the Covid-19 epidemic so far shows that there is always a gap of about two weeks between a surge in cases and a surge in deaths, or at the least a surge in cases with aggravated symptoms. If Gurugram is now at a stage where ICU beds are being taken up at a rapid pace, it stands to reason that we might see more deaths as well, perhaps in the next 10 days or so,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former head of the department of community medicine at PGIMER, Chandigarh. However, Kumar also clarified that such a surge can be countered by efficient treatment protocols and by increasing the availability of resources to treat patients showing aggravated symptoms. He also said that a spike in mortality, though possible, is unlikely to be as severe as the one Gururgam witnessed in June, when 94 patients succumbed to Covid-19 — the highest in a month.“Treatment protocols have evolved and improved over the past six months, so the mortality rate is still better than it was in June,” Kumar said. Gurugram reported 44 Covid-19 related deaths in October and has reported 11 Covid-19 related deaths in November so far, with over 6,000 new cases being reported in the first 10 days of the month. In contrast, 9,500 infections were reported in the month of October. Prabhakaran Dorairaj, head of research and policy at the Public Health Foundation of India, said that a spike in mortality is to be expected, given the current trend. “More people in the ICU means more people falling seriously ill. As the spread of the virus gains steam in the winter, the number of people getting ill will increase, and naturally so will mortality. The public health response should anticipate this and free up resources,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/patients-requiring-intensive-care-on-the-rise-in-gurugram/story-567Ie0dhZoa865yyFyO4VO.html
11-11-2020||Gurugram||Case count to reach over 43k by November 30, predicts health department||Nearly 7,000 people in the district are likely to be infected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection in the next 19 days, according to a projection made by the state health department. These new cases will take the tally to almost 43,300 cases in Gurugram by November 30.With the current upward trend, nearly 6,000 new infections have already been reported in just 11 days. Experts, however, said that new cases can go beyond the estimated figures due to the accelerated pace of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission in the district.Data available with the state health department shows that by November 30, the overall tally in Gurugram will reach 43,311, of which 5,197 will be active cases. The projections were made based on the case trend till November 1. Record spikes have been reported in Gurugram from October 16, with over 500 new cases being reported every day. The spike reached a maximum of 964 on November 8. On Wednesday, at least 726 new cases were recorded, taking the tally to 36,879. Of these 5,880 are currently active.The district took more than a month and a half to reach the count of 20,000 cases from 10,000 (as depicted in the graph). In the following month, 10,000 new cases were added, taking the count to nearly 30,000 by October-end. But in just 11 days of November, almost 6,000 new cases have been reported, with the weekly positivity rate almost at 16%, similar to the July trajectory, when positivity rate reached almost 18%. In August and September, the weekly average positivity rate fluctuated between 9% and 11%.According to the prediction, at least 312 of 602 allocated beds with oxygen supply will remain occupied this month. Likewise, 156 intensive care unit (ICU) beds of 817 beds and 52 ventilators out of 343 will be engaged for Covid-19 patients. The projection takes into account only Gurugram patients. An equal number of out-station Covid-19 patients from parts of Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other states are also admitted in Gurugram hospitals, leading to occupancy of nearly 70% of ICU beds in the city. Among the currently active cases, 396 (almost 6.7%) seriously ill patients from Gurugram are in hospital.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer, said, “Only 2% of the new infections require hospitalisation. Considering the high recovery rate, there will be a downfall in active cases in the next 10 days. Meanwhile, fluctuations of 10-20% in daily new cases will continue now. More than 93% of Covid-19 patients are under home isolation. It is likely that we would manage serious cases with the currently available infrastructure. If required, bed capacity will be increased further.”Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, said, “It is the third spike across the Delhi-NCR, which will slightly slump in a few days after Diwali. It is a cycle which will be stabilised. We are prepared to tackle the new cases as sufficient health care infrastructure is available in Gurugram and Faridabad.”On the other hand, Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine and community health department, PGIMER-Chandigarh, said that projected numbers can go beyond the 43,000.“Covid-19 predictions are made taking the case trend of the last 15 days. Based on it, forecast for the coming 15 days or a month is done. These estimations are based on worst case and real case scenarios. Government generally take figures between the worst and the real. Several factors like daily growth rate, doubling time and positivity rate are taken into account for the projections. Since it is a dynamic process, the numbers can vary every week.”Currently, the growth rate of the new cases is nearly 2%, while cases are doubling in every 38 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/case-count-to-reach-over-43k-by-november-30-predicts-health-department/story-NyYr0L4cFSh1JRAT66LMGM.html
11-11-2020||Gurugram||Model roads to come up in Gurugram’s residential areas||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is planning to redesign streets in South City-1 and Sushant Lok-1 as “model streets”, by freeing footpaths of encroachments, introducing no-vehicle zones, and increasing speed calming measures, said officials on Wednesday.MCG officials said that streets in both areas are mostly residential, but due to a high volume of vehicles accessing them, pedestrians and cyclists find it unsafe to navigate.“The redesigning process has started. We want to make streets in both areas as model streets, which will serve as examples of how streets should be designed in Gurugram. Such models can then be replicated across different parts of the city,” said Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG.The civic body will carry out the redesigning project in association with the World Resources Institute (WRI) and Raahgiri foundation.In South City-1, four streets are being redesigned to ensure the safe passage of students studying in four schools in the area, along with those residing in residential complexes in the vicinity.“Currently, the streets within South City-1 have limited speed calming measures, due to which vehicles tend to travel at a high speed. Further, the existing footpaths are either badly damaged or heavily encroached upon, resulting in pedestrians walking on the main carriageway. As per our design plan, we want to reclaim footpaths by removing all encroachments, build new footpaths where they are either broken or missing altogether, and introduce speed breakers before residential, commercial areas,” said Sarika Panda Bhatt, co-founder of Raahgiri foundation.With regards to the four schools in the area, Bhatt said that the streets outside the schools have to be redesigned on the lines of a model school zone set up by the Raahgiri foundation, MCG, and WRI in Sector 47 earlier this week, as per the proposal. On Sunday, using traffic cones, paints and signage, the agency redesigned a 200-metre stretch outside Mount Olympus School in such a manner that dedicated waiting areas, pick and drop-off points were created along with crossing points.WRI and Raahigiri foundation have done a technical study on the four streets in South City-1 and submitted their report to the MCG for perusal.In Sushant Lok-1, MCG officials said they are planning on redesigning the 2.5-kilometre service lane between Vyapar Kendra and Gold Souk Mall in such a manner that vehicles can no longer be parked in the residential lane and that it is not used as an alternate route. Commuters extensively use this residential stretch, leading towards St Thomas Marg/Golf Course Road, instead of the main carriageway as it helps them avoid four traffic signals and save time.“The street will be designed with facilities for all road users including the management of parking around market areas, which is currently the biggest reason for the chaos on Sushant Lok-1 streets. The infrastructure change would benefit residential areas to access the market by foot or cycling safely with their families,” said Priyanka Sulkhlan, manager, cities and transport, WRI India.MCG officials privy to the matter said that bollards would be placed on all entry and exit points of the 2.5-kilometre service lane to prevent vehicles from entering the lane, while residents of Sushant Lok 1 could access the same through alternate routes within the colony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/model-roads-to-come-up-in-gurugram-s-residential-areas/story-l0RM5lq88Y97SzSkS3PnSK.html
11-11-2020||Gurugram||Developers to face action for not giving info, mistreating buyers||The Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera), Gurugram, on Wednesday observed that not providing information pertaining to plan, specifications and timeline of real estate projects to homebuyers shall be treated as violation of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, and may invite stringent actions against the promoter.The H-Rera bench, headed by Dr KK Khandelwal, the chairman, and members SC Kush and Samir Kumar, observed that a large number of complaints have been filed before the authority where serious allegations of misbehaviour and improper treatment with the allottees by the promoters have been levelled.The bench observed that the allottee has the right to visit the project site and check the quality of construction going on. But, even after persistent requests, no such opportunity is given to the allottees and when the allottees visit the site, the security guards of the promoters not only prevent them from the lawful visit of the site but also, at times, mistreat them. The treatment meted out to the allottees is not only illegal and objectionable but also against the canon of decency and decorum, it observed.Dr Khandelwal said that it has come to the notice of the bench that the customer relations department of the promoter also does not respond in a right and welcoming manner. The response of the customer relations department is totally antagonistic at times and the allottee has to face not only inconvenience, but also mental agony and pain. The authority is pained to observe that even during the proceedings of the authority, the representatives of the promoter rebuke, reprimand and scold the allottee in a very threatening manner, he said.“Bad behaviour or lack of moral behaviour with the customer, denial of their rights as mandated in the Act, non-supply of requisite information to the allottee shall be treated as violation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 and promoter will meet with strict actions and penal consequences,” the bench observed.The authority has also directed two developers — Emmar and JMD Developers — to provide training to their customer relations department so that the employees behave with dignity and grace.A spokesperson for JMD Developers said that the company is “very customer-centric” and that the managing director directly interacts with the customers to resolve their issues. “We will abide by the directions of the H-Rera and try to improve our customer relationship management more if the authority desires so,” said the spokesperson. Representatives of Emmar did not respond to queries seeking comment. H-Rera will also finalise a code of conduct for promoters and staff to deal properly with buyers and also conduct workshops to train employees in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/developers-to-face-action-for-not-giving-info-mistreating-buyers/story-B8k9iWUBXEHp69nmhGTOsO.html
11-11-2020||Gurugram||Air purifiers installed at high traffic volume points||Outdoor air purifiers were installed in clusters at three crowded locations of the city on Wednesday, as part of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority’s (GMDA) Project Air Care.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday inaugurated the GMDA venture through videoconferencing. Six purifiers were installed at the Sector 44 traffic junction, just ahead of the GMDA offices, besides 11 devices in the vicinity of the Sikanderpur Metro station and another 10 around Iffco Chowk on Wednesday.The purifiers — wind augmentation and purification units (or Wayu) — have been developed by researchers at the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.Sunil Kumar, a senior scientist at Neeri involved with the project, said, “When used in clusters, these devices can provide cleaner air to people in a vicinity of about 500 metres. They are effective at reducing tailpipe emissions in high-traffic areas, such as traffic intersections, bus bays, parking lots and so on, where idling vehicles are a huge source of air pollution.”Kumar said, “The device doesn’t just filter out pollutants like PM2.5 and PM10 particles, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds, but chemically breaks them down and releases carbon dioxide as a by-product. It can reduce 60-70% for PM10 and 30-40% for PM2.5 at traffic junctions, but efficiency will depend on the pollution load and size distribution of particulate matter in the ambient air.”Under the CSR-funded project, 65 outdoor air purifiers are expected to be installed at key locations across the city by early next year, officials in the GMDA’s urban environment division said.“About 38 more devices will be installed within the next two months at Rajeev Chowk, Vatika Chowk, Atul Kataria Chowk, Cyber City and Genpact Chowk, among other places. We will also make sure to cover industrial areas like Udyog Vihar, so we can get a sense of what the situation is like there. A Neeri team will continue to analyse data from the Wayu units and share the chemical analysis with us,” said Subash Yadav, a metropolitan green planner with the GMDA’s urban environment division.Speaking at the launch of Project Air Care on Wednesday, Khattar said, “The rising levels of air pollution in Haryana, especially Gurugram, is a case of serious concern among all of us. As we move towards the festive season, we would like to bring some relief to citizens with the installation of multiple Wayu air purifiers at strategic junctions. I welcome this public-private partnership… and urge other corporates to join the movement in building a clean and green city.”Day-to-day maintenance of these Wayu units, which require weekly filter changes, will be taken up by the CSR partners concerned, along with Neeri and an independent NGO working in the field of air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-purifiers-installed-at-high-traffic-volume-points/story-nZbq63IypGEtmKqSD2BcYN.html

MC Tehbazaari inspector, Naresh Kumar said, “In 2012, the Punjab and Haryana high court had said that strict action should be taken against encroachments and regular challans should be issued. If the encroachers remain adamant then legal action was recommended against them.” The MC officials said that in January this year, erring shopkeepers were warned of legal action and now a reminder has been sent to the police department to lodge FIRs against them.MC secretary, Neeraj Jain said, “Strict action is being taken against encroachers and joint teams of MC and police are regularly conducting anti-encroachment drives in the city.”Mayor Balkar Sandhu said that after Diwali, action will also be taken against encroachments done by street vendors as the MC does not want to play a spoilsport during the festival. Regular anti-encroachment drives will be conducted by the civic body and police. The vendors will only be allowed to put up stalls at the sites earmarked for establishing vending zones in the city, the mayor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-seeks-fir-against-29-shopkeepers-for-encroaching-on-roads/story-14TDBLuyti5hNmfucoiOFL.html

They were nabbed from Transport Nagar while planning another robbery on Monday evening.Those arrested are Lovedeep Singh, alias Deepu, of Jhabewal Road, Bhamia; Gagandeep Singh of Guru Angad Dev Nagar, Faridkot; Deepak Kumar of Shimlapuri; Kulwinder Singh of Gaunsgarh village; Amanjot Singh, alias Aman Donkey, of Bulara village; Shiv Kumar, alias Shibbu, of Bhamia Kalan; and Vikram Singh, alias Vicky, of Jamalpur area.Besides six motorcycles, a scooter and seven mobile phones, the police had recovered a pistol, an air gun, four blunt weapons and a dummy pistol from them.Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said with these arrests, crime will reduce in Ludhiana. “Aman Donkey is the gang’s kingpin. They used to rob people by brandishing pistols, knives and iron rods. They also targeted migrant workers returning from factories and were most active in streets around Nagesh Factory, Bahadurke Road, Jassian Road, Dana Mandi, Shimlapuri, Daba area, Gill Road and Moti Nagar area,” he added.Out of the seven gang members, six are habitual offenders and have been in and out of jail many times in various crime cases.Lately, they had been targeting grocery stores, prompting their owners to approach the police for relief to save their businesses.Besides, the gang often indulged in violent clashes with the rival Chinka gang, whose members are already behind bars.During interrogation, the accused confessed to being drug addicts and committing crime to buy drugs.The police are investigating what the accused did with the stolen cash and other articles.CASES CRACKED WITH ARRESTIn October, they had robbed a grocery store owner of Rs 20,000 at gunpoint near Atam Hosiery in Guru Nanak Nagar. They had also snatched Rs 90,000 and Rs 6,900 from two other grocers on Tajpur Road and in Shahbana village, respectively.Earlier, in September, they snatched Rs 1.5 lakh from a man at gunpoint at Quality Chowk in Shamlapuri and also looted Rs 3,000 at knifepoint from a migrant worker near Nirmal Palace.Similarly, in August, they had robbed a man of Rs 4.43 lakh after opening fire, and snatched mobile phones from migrant workers after attacking them with sharp-edged weapons near Nagesh Hosiery and Bahadurke Road in two separate incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/donkey-gang-behind-over-100-snatching-robbery-cases-in-ludhiana-say-police/story-B0OipoHIUCsFCWewjh3wtK.html

Most heavy vehicles from Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) and Ahmedabad pass through Thane. Hence, these projects are important for decongestion of the city. I have given directives to fast track them.”He also gave directives to change the alignment of the Thane-Bhiwandi-Kalyan Metro 5, as the earlier alignment was opposed by most residents.An MMRDA official, requesting anonymity, said, “There was a presentation on the status of each of the Thane-related projects.

Members have alleged that despite regularly supplying medicines to civic hospitals and medical colleges, the procurement cell of Haffkine Institute has not released ₹206 crore over the past seven months. In a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Haffkine Institute on Tuesday, vendors said they don’t have money to pay staffers their salaries during the festival season.According to state government rules, Haffkine Institute is the only body responsible for the procurement of medicines all across Maharashtra. After getting selected in response to tenders floated by the apex body, vendors supply medicines to civic and government-run hospitals, medical colleges, dispensaries among others. Vendors claimed they have not received their pending money since May despite submitting bills to the institute.“Due to the non-receipt of the payments, our members’ financial condition got disturbed. We don’t have the funds to pay salaries to staff/workers. We don’t even have money to buy raw materials,” reads the letter addressed to Medical Education and Drugs Department, the chief minister’s office and the institute.AFDLHF claimed that of the total pending amount of ₹206 crore, ₹93 crore is to be paid by the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) and the remaining ₹113 crore by the Directorate of Health Service (DHS).Secretary of medical education and drugs department, Saurabh Vijay, said, “I am not aware of the situation right now. But will look into it.”Abhay Pandey, president of AFDLHF, said, “DHS has released our money but the institute hasn’t dispersed it to vendors. We get blacklisted if we delay supply of medicines to hospitals, but what about our sufferings? We have sent several letters to the authority but no one has paid any heed.”The federation has decided to stage the hunger strike in front of Haffkine Institute at 10am on November 12. “People are lighting up their houses for Diwali, but we don’t even have the money to pay school fees of my children,” said a vendor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-medicine-vendors-call-hunger-strike-over-delay-in-payment-of-dues/story-rbP9UBSLj3CAXZNgE489AI.html

The bars reopened after hiatus of seven and a half months.Even though hoteliers and restaurant owners were allowed to serve liquor, they were not allowed to open bars. Hoteliers said it is a welcome move ahead of Diwali and they hope for revival in the coming days. Vice-president of Hotel and Restaurant Association, Amarjit Singh said, “Our business depends on bars and it is good that the government has allowed us to reopen it. There is a steady increase in footfall in restaurants in the city.”The former president of the association said that the government should further increase the gathering limit in events.Hoteliers said that they have put together stringent safeguards to ensure a safe environment for consumers and employees.General manager of a private hotel, Abhay Kumar said, “It’s a welcome step by the state government. We have made certain changes in the rules to comply with Covid guidelines. Since social distancing is mandatory, we are following all SOPs issued by the MHA and state government. ‘Rail roko’ hitting sector Hoteliers rued that the rail roko agitation of farmers is taking a toll on their business.Amarjit Singh said, “The hotel business depends mostly on those who visit the industrial hub on business tours. As passenger trains are at a halt, the business has reduced to less than 20%. Only a few customers are visiting the city from other states by road that also for purchasing hosiery products. The government should take steps to resolve the farmer issues and restart passenger trains.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-hospitality-sector-welcomes-punjab-govt-s-decision-to-allow-re-opening-of-bars/story-B0sMkKpkEuCTG6OdOHMDFK.html
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||Ambala advocate released after Bar members protest against ‘illegal detention’||Lawyers and police faced off outside the Ambala Cantonment police station a local advocate accused of extortion was allegedly detained on Wednesday. He was released later.Advocate Kamal Dham was allegedly picked up by the police in the morning for questioning in an extortion case after which other advocates and Ambala District Bar Association (DBA) members gathered outside the police station demanding his release. Station in-charge Vijay Kumar said that Ramesh Saini, a resident of Laxmi Nagar in the Cantonment had filed a complaint against Dham of extorting money from a person to get registry done at the tehsil office. “We have registered a complaint and are investigating the matter,” Kumar said. DBA president Iqbal Singh alleged that proper procedures were not followed when Dham was detained. Even politicians got involved with Haryana Democratic Front leaders Chitra Sarwara (Congress) and Onkar Singh (Indian National Lok Dal) reaching the protest venue. Former Ambala DBA president Rohit Jain said police relented when some bar association leaders and other lawyers went to the station and asked why Dham had been detained. “When pressure was built, they asked us to take him away, after signing an undertaking. We said even if an FIR was filed the proper procedure under laws should have been followed.”Some policemen again tried to get hold of Dham when he went outside the police station and the station in-charge asked for another signature on a notice, Jain alleged. After this, nearly 200 advocates sat outside the station protesting against the “unruly behaviour of the police,” and later Dhami was served a notice to appear again on November 17, with the assurance from senior police officials that investigations would be fair. Kumar dismissed accusations against the “detention,” as “allegations”. “The man was with them outside the station. He can also be seen in some videos. He was just served a notice to appear again and has signed it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/advocate-released-after-bar-members-protest-against-illegal-detention/story-qxpLqWBmeND6wSbZfDrx5J.html
11-11-2020||City||Green firecrackers only in Punjab: Enforcing ban may prove to be a Herculean task||The Punjab government’s order allowing only the use of green firecrackers on Diwali and Gurpurab has posed a challenge in front of the police, administration and even customers – identifying the eco-friendly variety.Having come into prominence last year, green fireworks carry a QR code and a “green firework” label. However, with the standard not being followed by manufacturers invariably, traders say they neither have adequate eco-friendly stock nor are sure of differentiating between the two kinds.According to the department of science, technology and environment, Punjab, only firecrackers without barium salts or compounds of antimony, lithium, mercury, arsenic, lead and strontium chromate are considered green. These help with 30% lower emissions of toxic gases than traditional ones.However, these specifications are not reflected on the commonly available firecrackers in the market, making it a Herculean task for the administration and police to take action against the violators. A visit to the firecracker markets near Jalandhar Bypass and Model Town Extension on Wednesday revealed that most stall owners did not have green firecrackers and only few had put the limited stock on display. Commissioner of police (CP) Rakesh Agrawal said penalising the violators was a challenge, so the police will involve the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to rein in sale of banned firecrackers during raids.Sales dive further Traders complained that they were anyway receiving a low response due to the pandemic and the Tuesday announcement by the chief minister had only dented their sales further.“The market is already witnessing a slowdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The government decision to ban the traditional firecrackers after issuing licences and establishment of shops has added to our woes. While we have stock of green firecrackers, what will do with the other ones?” asked Pradeep Gupta, president of the Ludhiana Firecrackers’ Association.A trader, requesting anonymity, said they had invested in huge stock and the ban will lead to heavy losses. “The National Green Tribunal and the government should first restrict the manufacture of traditional firecrackers rather than leaving the traders to bear the brunt of such bans,” he said, while questioning how the government would stop residents from bursting firecrackers already purchased with the ban being enforced just three days before Diwali.Backing the dealers, social activist Kuldeep Singh Khaira said though the ban was appreciable, it came too late and will hit the already suffering traders hard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/green-firecrackers-only-in-punjab-enforcing-ban-may-prove-to-be-a-herculean-task/story-BQY4fBlTxTrLrBhalD56rI.html

Barium nitrate, which emits green flames when a cracker is lit, is a metal oxide that increases both air and noise pollution.Firecracker manufacturers from Sivakasi in Tamil Nadu confirmed that they were allowed to use barium nitrate and that they got manufacturing certificates.A 2018 study by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that exposure to nitrates could lead to developmental dangers to children and unborn babies.On Wednesday, Awaaz Foundation wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office and various bodies of the Central and state governments. “It is truly shocking that test results of these green crackers, which children are encouraged to use, are validated by the open display of the banned chemical content on their packaging. Such crackers, which cause serious illnesses including respiratory illnesses, will worsen the effects of Covid-19,” said Sumaira Abdulali, convener of Awaaz Foundation, and called for a pan-India ban on them.A 2018 SC order banned the manufacture of traditional polluting firecrackers and called for developing green crackers using a new chemical composition. On October 5, 2019, the Centre announced the use of green firecrackers developed by the National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI). With new formulations and a minimum reduction in emissions by 30%, NEERI developed flower pots and sparklers.Of the 11 green crackers analysed at a private laboratory, Awaaz Foundation identified seven with and four without the NEERI symbol. All these firecrackers comprised heavy metals such as aluminium, magnesium, strontium, barium, potassium, calcium, chlorine and sulphur. The study, however, did not calculate the percentage contribution of each ingredient in the firecracker. “Only the chemical composition is described on the boxes, not the quantity. So there seems to be no difference in these crackers from traditionally polluting ones,” said Abdulali.Ganesan Panjurajan, president, Tamil Nadu Fireworks and Amorces Manufacturers Association, said, NEERI issued certificates to around 600 of 1,075 factories at Sivakasi. “There’s a 20% reduction in barium in each green firecracker as per the new formula. We are using NEERI’s recommended additive for reduction of particulate matter emission by 25-30% when crackers are burst. However, we cannot comment on those ‘green crackers’ that do not have the stamp,” said Panjurajan.Pooja Dhar, advocate-on-record for the petitioners in the SC, said the Union environment ministry had filed an affidavit, , based on NEERI’s submissions, before the Apex court in November 2019 allowing minimal use of barium nitrate in the formula for green crackers. “However, SC has not given its final verdict since there was a delay in the matter due to Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, there is no clarity on whether barium nitrate can actually be used or not,” said Dhar adding that the SC had in March directed the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe Sivakasi-based manufacturers for using barium nitrate during firecracker manufacturing process.A NEERI official, who is not authorised to speak to the media, said, “We cannot comment on the use of any ingredients as the matter is subjudice. The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) grants approval for the use of green crackers. We are a research organisation developing formulations and testing emission reduction. Market or implementation-related issues do not pertain to us.”PESO official SD Mishra, controller of explosives, and MK Jhala, joint controller of explosives, refused to comment.Meanwhile, Minesh Mehta, general secretary of Mumbai and Thane district Fireworks Dealers’ Welfare Association, said, “We are only purchasing crackers from agencies that have a licence to produce crackers with the NEERI stamp on them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/banned-metals-chemicals-found-in-green-crackers-sold-in-mumbai-ngo-tells-centre-state/story-LdU9Zf4mrjrb9VZpBVMRTN.html

11-11-2020||Mumbai||Bihar victory is a result of voters’ trust in PM Narendra Modi says former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis||The National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) victory in the Bihar polls was the result of a wave of the voter’s trust in Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s leadership, said Devendra Fadnavis, Leader of Opposition, who was also the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) campaign in-charge for Bihar.Fadnavis, taking a dig at Shiv Sena and Congress, said that the former could not save its deposits, while the latter has no standing among the people of India.Fadnavis, who was tested positive for Covid-19 infection and was hospitalised during the voting in Bihar elections, said that it is the time for the Opposition to think why the Prime Minister gets the mass support across the country. He said it was the acceptance of efforts put in by the PM during the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown to safeguard the interest of poor people. “He ensured that no poor slept empty stomach during the lockdown. The voters have acknowledged his leadership in the Bihar elections,” Fadnavis said while speaking to the media in Mumbai. He also hit back at the Sena, saying that the party has not accepted the defeat. “What can I say about the party which has lost its deposit and has polled the votes less than NOTA. They need to introspect instead of attacking others,” he said. He was responding to the criticism by Sena leader Sanjay Raut.Fadnavis said that Congress has lost its base and the leadership has no standing among the people. “The party has lost its face. People have no trust in the leadership of Congress,” he said.Fadnavis said that women and youth votes stood by NDA in the Bihar elections.When asked if the Bihar election results will have any bearings on Maharashtra politics, Fadnavis said that the BJP will continue to work as a strong Opposition party. “Our confidence has been strengthened after the Bihar victory. The victory has reiterated that we are on the right path. We will continue to work as a strong Opposition party, raising the issues faced by the people of Maharashtra,” he said.Another party leader Ashish Shelar said that Congress had to face a debacle in Muslim-dominated constituencies in Bihar because of their alliance with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. “The results have established the fact that Congress candidates in Muslim-dominated areas faced defeat. The voters could not digest the fact that Congress has formed a government with Sena. The Bihar results have established the fact that parties partnering with Congress faced defeat. This will replicate in Maharashtra in the coming days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bihar-victory-is-a-result-of-voters-trust-in-pm-narendra-modi-says-former-maharashtra-cm-devendra-fadnavis/story-oAPugmJME9BombcJrPrAMK.html

Amid the pandemic, Delhiites are opting for not just cleaning but going a step ahead and enthusiastically booking for sanitisation services, as the festival of Diwali nears. And service providers in Delhi-NCR have registered a noticeable spike in demand from denizens. “Earlier we were sanitising 6-8 homes per day, but in the festive season we have been sanitising 25-30 homes per day,” says Krishna Veer Singh, from Droom – an online car marketplace that offers antimicrobial surface protection services. Sharing that they have registered a five fold increase in bookings made for their germ shield sanitation services, Singh adds, “The festive season has definitely made people conscious of safety, since many expect guests in these weeks. Which is why we even came out with special offers to cater to a growing demand.” “As the pandemic continues, people want to be safe and not run into the risk of having infections. Many who have been planning on get-togethers or functions in their homes, and wish to celebrate the festival safely, are opting for our home cleaning services,” says Alok Pant, from Hytech Expert, a company that provides sanitisation services. He adds, “In the time of pandemic, people know it’s better to get a professional to not just clean the house, but also sanitise the exposed surfaces. In the last 40 days, in the run up to the festive season, we have serviced over 350 houses, which is 50% more than what we did in the previous months!”Those employees who provide cleaning services, are equipped with a full body protective suit to ensure the safety of customers as well as their own. Aamir Ayyub, founder of Delhi-based Right to Safety Foundation, which has been providing sanitisation services at a nominal cost of ₹1 per square foot, says, “We want people to celebrate Diwali with safety, and hence provide subsidised services in north and south Delhi. We have seen more requests in the last few weeks, and have sanitised and cleaned over 400 houses in the last one month. As Covid-19 cases are rising in the city, we are also continuing to offer sanitisation services to police and fire stations, for free.”Mayank Sharma, a Kalkaji-based engineer, who recently got his house professionally cleaned and sanitised, says, “I’m planning to finally host a get-together of my cousins and have a card party. It was only necessary then to ensure that my surroundings were absolutely safe for everyone coming.” And for Noida resident Sheel Agarwal, sanitisation services were God sent! “I got our home sanitised because I knew if they wouldn’t have done it, my mother would have made me clean the entire house, and I absolutely detest that,” she chuckles, adding, “I anyway wouldn’t have done a good job of it, and my mother would have had to do it again, so I saved us both some time and arguments!”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/diwali-cleaning-in-covid-times-before-get-togethers-it-s-time-for-sanitisation/story-hMQTwX1wKYQhz1EM22eaZO.html

The dialogue was organised by the climate group in collaboration with the UN High-Level Climate Champions and the UK COP26 Presidency. Addressing a global audience of climate activists and leaders from business and government, Shah said, “The motivation behind Delhi’s ambitious roadmap to transition of zero-emission vehicles is to address both climate change and the health emergency that arises from the high level of air pollution in Delhi.” Also Read: Delhi’s air improves slightly, recorded as ‘very poor’ after six consecutive days in ‘severe’ zoneThe Delhi government’s EV policy focuses on a very clear goal - 25% of all newly-registered vehicles should be EVs by 2024. As of now, the number is 0.2%, he said. “This clarity has enabled the government to focus on all steps that need to be taken to facilitate this transition. Delhi’s EV policy will contribute to 4.8 million tonnes of reduction in carbon emissions by 2024,” Shah said.Elaborating on the five key pillars of Delhi’s EV policy, he said, “First, we targeted fiscal incentives for specific vehicle segments that contribute maximum to vehicular pollution in Delhi’s and India’s context, which are two and three-wheelers.” Second, the government introduced non-financial incentives to help overcome barriers that might hamper EV adoption. For instance, the administration has allowed bike taxis to ply in Delhi only if they are EVs. “Third, we see it as the government’s duty to facilitate the setting up of charging infrastructure - in public as well as private complexes such malls, offices,” Shah said.“Fourth, we believe governments will have to take the lead in conducting public awareness campaigns to sensitise and inform citizens of the benefits of EVs, and finally, our policy also focuses on skill training related to jobs that will arise as a result of this transition to green economy,” Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ev-policy-to-reduce-carbon-emission-by-4-8-million-tonnes-in-4-yrs-delhi-govt/story-hSJRdI3ztRiCm00V2LjjCK.html
11-11-2020||City||Traders in Lucknow stare at huge losses after ban on crackers||LUCKNOW Cracker traders in Lucknow are staring at losses of around Rs 20 crore after the cancellation of their licences by the district administration following the UP government’s ban on sale and bursting of any type of crackers in Lucknow and 12 other cities where air quality index (AQI) was either poor, very poor or severe. The state government’s order was in compliance with the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) order, banning use of cracker in cities where AQI was either poor, very poor or severe during Diwali last year. The order also stated that the use of digital and laser technique to celebrate Diwali should also be promoted in other districts. “As per the state government’s order, we have cancelled all fire cracker and related licences in the city,” said Abhishek Prakash, district magistrate. Traders termed the ban as an “unjust move”. “It’s unfair on their (NGT and UP Government’s) part to ban crackers just ahead of Diwali. We are not opposing the ban. It’s good that crackers are banned to save the deteriorating air quality. But why can’t this be done earlier and why just ahead of Diwali when cracker traders are ready with their stock. Who will be responsible for their losses?” asked Akhilesh Gupta, a cracker dealer and convener of firecracker traders’ association. Gupta said this year traders were selling only green crackers — the ones made as per the directions of the Supreme Court. “Not all firecracker traders are well off. There are many who have taken loan from the market. The order will certain push many traders to the verge of bankruptcy,” he added. Traders said along with Lucknow they used to supply crackers in the adjoining districts also, but all the sale would now be gone.Mahesh Gupta, general secretary, Lucknow Cracker Traders’ Association, said: “The cancellation of licence has come as a blow for traders who are already feeling the pinch of lockdown and cancellation of fireworks shows. This year, only 32 wholesale stalls came up at Rastogi Inter College in Aishbagh, but now we are not certain about anything.”He said, “All we want is a midway, either we should be allowed to sell crackers or we must be compensated by the state government.”“Our officer-bearers will meet the CM and divisional commissioner to represent our case,” said Satish Mishra, another office-bearer of cracker traders’ association.He said, “Livelihood of thousands depends on the sale of crackers during Diwali. I don’t know why only firecrackers are being targeted while major pollutants such as construction sites, thermal power plants, cement industries and vehicles plying on road are not banned.”Green crackers are not as polluting as the conventional ones, so their sale must be allowed, he added.“The government’s order is a second blow to firecracker traders, who will suffer huge losses,” said Mohammed Moazzam, who owns a cracker shop in Raqabganj area of Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/traders-in-lucknow-stare-at-huge-losses-after-ban-on-crackers/story-jBuDr7lD2tSrPeGNCekiWP.html
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||HARERA takes cognisance of rude behaviour by developers||Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA), Gurugram, chairman KK Khandelwal on Wednesday said that not providing information pertaining to plan, specifications and timeline shall be treated as violation of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, inviting stringent action against the promoter. The chairman said that it had been observed that a large number of complaints have been filed before the Authority where serious allegations of misbehaviour and improper treatment have been leveled by allottees against the promoters. After being apprised of such negligence and laxity in the attitude of the promoter, the Authority has directed two reputed promoters -- EMAAR and JMD -- to provide training to their customer relations management department, he said. The Regulatory Authority is also in the process of finalising a code of conduct for the promoters and their staff regarding dealing with customers while exercising their rights under the provisions of RERA Act. “It has been observed that as and when the allottees contact the promoter or their representatives, the information is either not provided or is incomplete. The allottee has the right to visit the site and can check the quality of construction going on. But even after persistent requests, no such opportunity is given to the allottees and when the allottees visit the site, the security guards of the promoters not only prevent them from the lawful visit of the site but also mistreat them at times. The treatment meted out to the allottees is not only illegal and objectionable but also against the canon of decency and decorum,” the chairman said. The Authority is pained to observe that even during the proceedings of the Authority, the representative of the promoter rebuked, reprimanded and scolded the allottee. Lack of moral behaviour with the customer, denial of their rights as mandated in the Act, non-supply of requisite information to the allottee shall be treated as violation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 and promoter will meet with strict actions and penal consequences, Khandelwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/harera-takes-cognisance-of-rude-behaviour-by-developers/story-gsHQLvjT4wUaN7FvHm6GPO.html
11-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi air quality slips back into ‘very poor’ category||Delhi’s air quality slipped back into the “very poor” category on Wednesday after remaining in the “severe” zone for six days on the trot, with a change in the wind direction reducing the contribution of stubble burning in city’s pollution.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 388 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 476 on Tuesday.Delhi witnessed six “severe” air days on the trot till Tuesday. It had recorded seven “severe” air days in November last year.The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (345), Ghaziabad (390), Noida (339), Greater Noida (322), and Gurgaon (309), which fall in the National Capital Region (NCR), also recorded “very poor” air quality.The levels of PM2.5 – which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases – were 233 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9 am, below the emergency threshold of 300 µg/m3. The safe limit is 60 µg/m3.On Tuesday, PM2.5 levels had soared to 528 µg/m3 in the afternoon.  PM10 level stood at 384 µg/m3 at 9 pm. It had peaked to 685 µg/m3 on Tuesday, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India and 500 µg/m3 is the emergency threshold.  According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered in the “severe plus” or “emergency” category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 for more than 48 hours.Also Read | 500: What a maxed out AQI meansGRAP recommends measures such as a ban on construction activities, entry of trucks and car rationing scheme in such a scenario.The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on Tuesday tasked the CPCB with operationalising and monitoring GRAP measures till a mechanism is set up by the newly-constituted panel. At a meeting, the commission also decided that in view of deteriorating air quality in the NCR region, there is a need to invoke the GRAP, which has been already notified by the central government.GRAP, which is a set of anti-pollution measures followed in Delhi and its vicinity towns according to the severity of the situation, came into force on October 15.An official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the predominant wind direction is east-northeasterly, which is not favourable for transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana.The city recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday morning. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said, “The change in wind direction and wind speed has positively impacted air quality. It is likely to remain in the upper end of the ‘very poor’ category on Thursday and deteriorate marginally on Friday.” “The farm fire count in Punjab was around 3500 on Tuesday, but the impact of stubble burning on air quality was negligible because of easterly winds,” it said.Also Read | Air emergency in Delhi, no signs of Grap The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was 22 per cent on Tuesday.Delhi’s ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed -- is likely to be around 12,500 m2/s on Wednesday, favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.The ventilation index lower than 6000 m2/s with average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-air-quality-slips-back-into-very-poor-category/story-SbmWLG2zVjNmkFgnZxPheM.html
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||Revised collector rates for land in Haryana to be fixed by March||The Haryana government has directed deputy commissioners of all districts to publish a draft list of collector rates by December 15. The final publication of collector rates will be done by March next year. Additional chief secretary, revenue, Sanjeev Kaushal, said that guidelines regarding fixing of collector rates in each colony or area in each tehsil of their districts have been issued to all divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners. As per the guidelines, a committee would be formed at each tehsil and sub-tehsil to assess the collector rates of each colony or area in the tehsil. The committee would also consult non-officials who are knowledgeable about market rates of property in the areas concerned. The committee would also conduct surveys and examine registrations done over the past 12 months in every area, and arrive at a logical calculation of collector rates. The deputy commissioners may designate a senior officer, such as the additional deputy commissioner, as the district nodal officer. This officer would be responsible for collating the rates assessed by all such tehsil-level committees, and proposing the collector rates of all areas to the deputy commissioners. Subsequent to draft publication of collector rates, a period of 30 days, or till January 15, 2021, would be reserved for receiving objections and complaints. A portal to receive objections and complaints would be developed by December 15. After this, 30 days, from January 15 to February 15, would be reserved for hearings and deciding the objections received. This would be followed by state-level screening of the draft collector rates for each district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/revised-collector-rates-for-land-in-haryana-to-be-fixed-by-march/story-MmhSqFvr3GZMpgWxrBjkrM.html

11-11-2020||Delhi||Experts warn of double trouble in Delhi with rising air pollution, Covid-19||The nearly week-long spell of worsened air quality and a fresh surge in coronavirus cases in the national capital have proved “doubly detrimental” to people suffering from respiratory ailments, as their complications have increased and many of them have also contracted Covid-19 infection, experts said on Wednesday.Many doctors and medical experts had earlier cautioned that rising air pollution coupled with the ongoing pandemic, could make matters worse for people with lung or breathing-related complications.Describing it as a “double whammy” for those with respiratory problems, Suranjit Chatterjee, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals, told PTI that “The air quality in the last six days being particularly terrible, we are seeing a jump in cases of respiratory illnesses and with greater severity than say, the scenario last November when also the pollution level was very high. But, this unpredictable virus is what is causing all the more complications.”  Smog enveloped Delhi on Tuesday as the city’s air quality hit “emergency” levels, while it also recorded 7830 fresh Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike here till date, taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.5 lakh.Delhi recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 476, which falls in the “severe” category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (448), Ghaziabad (444), Noida (455), Greater Noida (436) and Gurgaon (427), which fall in the National Capital Region (NCR), also recorded “severe” air quality.It was the sixth “severe” air day on the trot in Delhi on Tuesday. The city had witnessed seven “severe” air days in November last year.The levels of PM2.5 -- which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases -- were 494  g/m3 at 5 pm, more than eight times the safe limit of 60  g/m3.The twin factors of rising pollution level and a massive surge in Covid-19 cases in the last several days have also led to increased burden on hospitals with vacancy of beds shrinking fast and rise in footfall of patients in the OPD too, doctors said.Besides, ICU beds with ventilators at most top private hospitals and major Centre-run facilities are also getting filled up with spiralling cases and a large number of deaths in the last few days.On Tuesday, 83 Covid-19 fatalities were recorded, the highest since June 16. On the preceding three days, the daily death count was over 70.“Definitely, with rising air pollution in Delhi and worsening air quality index, there has been an increase in the number and severity of cases of Covid-19 as well COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and asthma patients. This is because air pollution causes inflammation of the nose, airways and lungs which increase our susceptibility of catching respiratory infections such as the coronavirus,” said Richa Sareen, Consultant, Pulmonogy and Critical Care Medicine, Fortis Hospital Vasant Kunj.The studies done in the US and another study suggest that there is a “direct link” between an increase in Covid-19 cases or mortality from it and rising air pollution, she said.The senior doctor said the worsening air quality and surge in cases of coronavirus are proving doubly detrimental to patients who have respiratory illnesses.Chatterjee said, “Many of these patients coming up with complaints of severe complications, like breathlessness, high fever are also ending up covid-positive”.“Even those I did not suspect to have contracted the infection, were diagnosed with coronavirus infection after a test. Since, the virus is behaving in an unpredictable way, it is making things even more difficult for patients with respiratory illnesses,” he added.Chatterjee said, the ICU beds with ventilators are getting swamped and “on a case basis, we are rotating patients to HDUs (high dependency units) so that very severe patients can be accommodated in ICUs”.The online Corona dashboard of the Delhi government showed that at 1:20 PM, out of 1270 ICU beds with ventilator facility, only 162 were vacant.At the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH) and LNJP Hospitals, both dedicated Covid-19 facilities under the Delhi government and each having 200 ICU beds with ventilator facility, only 44 and 6 beds respectively, were vacant at 1:20 PM.Air pollution may increase transmissibility of the novel coronavirus making people more vulnerable to the disease and aggravating the Covid-19 situation, experts had recently said, while warning that those who have had the infection in the past may also have to face new challenges.  Sandeep Nayar, senior director and head, Centre for Chest & Respiratory Diseases, BLK Hospital, said, due to increase in pollution, the number as well as severity of respiratory problems has “increased suddenly in the last few days”.“We are already fighting a tough battle with Covid-19. Pollution per se may not increase covid infection directly but may worsen their symptoms. It may increase in coughing and sneezing in patients which may result in more chances of spreading respiratory infections including covid if the patient is suffering from it,” he said.Moreover, since Covid-19 affects predominantly lungs, and so does pollution, the symptoms and respiratory problem will be manifold.

11-11-2020||City||Confusion over firecracker ban in Assam during Diwali||There was much confusion over a firecracker ban in Guwahati on Wednesday after a minister’s tweet that there will be no restrictions on celebrating Diwali, including the use of firecrackers, even as Assam’s Pollution Control Board has ordered a complete ban on their sale and use in the city until November 30. The ban was ordered days before Diwali on Saturday to check pollution amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Himanta Biswa Sarma, the minister, said in a tweet on Tuesday: “Like any other religion, Hindus have the right to celebrate festivals. With improvement in Covid-19 situation in Assam, we plan no restrictions on celebration of Diwali, including use of firecrackers.” He asked the public to exercise sell-restraint as it is the key to combat Covid-19.Also Read: Assam Pollution Control Board orders complete ban on firecrackers in GuwahatiThe tweet came after the Board on Tuesday said there will be a total ban on the use of all kinds of firecrackers in Guwahati from the midnight of November 9-10 till the midnight of November 30-December 1. “Except Guwahati, in other areas only green crackers can be sold and burst... for two hours during Deepawali festivals from 8 pm to 10 pm; during Chatth Puja from 6 am to 8 am and during Christmas and New Year Ever from 11:55 pm to 12:30 am,” the Board said in an order.The Board directed all district magistrates, commissioners, and police superintendents to implement the directions and submit action taken reports daily.The order came after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday said bursting of firecrackers releases “copious amounts of harmful chemicals” which in turn can have a serious impact on the health of vulnerable groups and aggravate the health of Covid-19 patients or those staying in home isolation.The NGT allowed the bursting of firecrackers for two hours during festivals like Diwali, Guru Parab, Christmas, Chatth Puja, New Year’s Eve, etc at places where air pollution levels are moderate or below.The Board ordered a complete ban on firecrackers in Guwahati as the air quality of the city has been categorised as “poor”.The NGT and the Board’s orders days ahead of Diwali has come as a disappointment for traders, who have procured firecrackers.“I bought firecrackers worth a few thousand rupees last week expecting there would not be any ban on the sale. But with the [ban] order, there is no chance of selling the stuff this Diwali,” said Alakesh Basumatary, a shopkeeper in Guwahati.Last week, state environment minister Parimal Suklabaidya told journalists the government was against a blanket ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers during Diwali.Assam has reported a decrease in the daily Covid-19 cases since October. On Tuesday, the state recorded 271 cases with a positivity rate of 1.07%. The state has overall reported 209,388 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/confusion-over-firecracker-ban-in-assam-during-diwali/story-CDGm5ExbSLO0PMTiPkMgrK.html

It was the lowest temperature for Pune this season as minimum temperature was recorded 13.3 degrees Celsius on November 7. According to the India Meteorological Department, Pune, it will be a good winter season ahead. IMD usually considers December to February as the winter season. “It is not winter yet, but post monsoon period.

The maximum temperature of the day was 29.8 degrees Celsius. “From 11.3 degrees Celsius, the temperature will increase for the next three days (November 11-13), but after the western disturbance effect it will decrease. The moisture is increasing from Bay of Bengal so we forecast cloudy weather on November 15 and 16,” Kashyapi said. In Marathwada and Vidarbha region, many places saw dip in temperature while in region of Konkan and Goa temperature has not seen a major fall.

Young age group (20-30 year olds) was found to be the most affected in this segment at 18%. City doctors said that controlling diabetes is essential even among the young as it can have multiple effects on body, including reduced fertility in men and women. The study conducted by Metropolis Healthcare indicated that Pune is fast becoming the diabetes capital of the country. Of the 89,881 samples tested for diabetes between January 2019 and August 2020 in their Pune lab, 10% was found to be suffering from poorly controlled diabetes. The incidence of poorly controlled diabetes was found to be highest (18%) in the age group of 20-30 years, followed by 30-40 years (12%) and 40-50 years (11%). The incidence was the lowest in the age group 80 years and above (8%).The study showed that men were more prone to diabetes, as 11% of all males tested were found to suffer from unsatisfactorily controlled diabetes compared to 9% for females.Dr Manish Karekar, chief pathologist, Metropolis Healthcare Pune lab said, “Diabetes strikes Indians a decade earlier than the world. It is a growing challenge in India with an estimated 8.7% diabetic population in the age group of 20 and 70 years.” Dr Sanjay Ingle, zonal pathologist at another lab said that blood sugar tests should be part of routine check-up as it will help manage diabetes too. “Diabetes is associated with complications like heart attack, a stroke, loss of vision, erectile dysfunction, oedema, kidney damage, nerve damage, skin conditions, hyperglycaemia and even scarring problems that can lead to amputation,” Dr Sanjay Ingle said.Dr Nisha Pansare, Nova IVF Pune, said, “Cardiovascular diseases, kidney, eye, foot and nerve damage, skin conditions and even sexual dysfunction may occur owing to diabetes. Those males with diabetes tend to have low testosterone levels and can lead to reduced fertility, low sperm count, erectile dysfunction, and even loss of sex drive. Thus, getting screened on a regular basis for diabetes is essential.”Dr Swati Gaikwad, obstetrician and gynaecologist in a private maternity hospital said, “Diabetes is linked to low fertility, PCOD, and other autoimmune diseases. Babies of the mothers who are diabetics may have birth defects and even heart and digestive health issues, have jaundice or even premature birth can occur.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/poorly-controlled-diabetes-found-highest-among-20-30-age-group-pune-lab/story-cU8yI72zqAWWNmSf2QIksO.html
11-11-2020||Delhi||Third Covid peak is longer than previous ones, may subside soon: Satyendar Jain||The duration of the third peak of the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital is longer than those of the previous peaks but it may subside in the next few days, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Wednesday.Interacting with reporters, he asserted that the city government has significantly ramped up testing by nearly three times on an average per day compared to the number of tests conducted when the second peak had hit around September 16, when over 4,000 daily cases were being reported.The minister also said the city government had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court after the Delhi high court did not allow reserving 80 per cent ICU beds for Covid-19 patients at many private hospitals here, and the apex court has asked the government to approach a division bench of the high court.“About two to three months ago, we had written to the Centre to increase about 1,000 beds and 300 ICU beds in Centre-run hospitals in the city,” Jain added.Delhi recorded over 7,800 fresh Covid-19 cases for the first time on Tuesday, taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.5 lakh, and 83 new fatalities, the highest numbers since June 16.This highest single-day spike here till date -- 7,830 cases -- resulted from the 59,035 tests conducted the previous day, while the positivity rate stood at 13.26 per cent amid the festive season and rising pollution in the city, according to the latest bulletin issued by the Delhi health department.The previous highest single-day spike till date here -- 7,745 cases -- was recorded on Sunday.On Tuesday, 83 new fatalities were recorded, pushing the death toll in the national capital to 7,143. On June 16, the city had recorded 93 deaths from Covid-19.Asked about the long spell of the surge in cases, Jain said in the previous peak which had lasted about 5-6 days, the tests conducted were about 20,000 per day and now the number of tests is nearly three times of that.The third peak is longer but it “may subside in the next few days,” he said.Delhi had recorded 71 fatalities from Covid-19 on Monday and 5,023 fresh cases. On Saturday and Sunday, 79 and 77 deaths due to the disease were recorded respectively.The active cases tally on Tuesday rose to 41,385 from 39,795 the previous day, while the recovery rate stood at over 89 per cent.The bulletin said the total number of cases has climbed to 4,51,382.Meanwhile, seeking to reduce coronavirus-related deaths in the national capital, the Delhi government has ordered Covid-19 test centres to mandatorily check the oxygen saturation levels of people, and persons found with below 94 per cent level are to undergo compulsory medical examination.“We are also doing RT-PCR tests in large numbers,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/third-covid-peak-is-longer-than-previous-ones-may-subside-soon-satyendar-jain/story-LTXDm1uWJ16GOe3mAeIxIL.html
11-11-2020||Pune||As people’s movement increases, Pune sees a slight rise in positivity rate||Post Dussehra and upcoming festive season, there has been an increase in the movement of people leading to a slight rise in Covid positivity in the city. Since the past five weeks the city saw a dip in the positivity rate indicating a fall in the number of Covid-19 cases, however, since the past one week from October 30 to November 5, the positivity rate has gone up indicating that more number of people are testing positive. The number of tests being carried out by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is also going down and the city is also seeing a rise in the virus cases. As per the data from PMC, the city saw a continuous dip in positivity rate which came to 10.8% as of the week between October 23 and October 29 when over 17,853 tests were conducted of which 1,921 tested positive. In the following week, the civic body conducted 17,011 tests between October 30 and November 5 in which 1,970 tested positive. Despite the civic body conducting about 700 lesser tests compared to the previous week, 50 more cases were reported which led to a rise in the positivity rate.The administration has been warning about a possible second wave in January or February and the civic body is preparing for early detection and treatment of newer cases. Additional commissioner Rubal Agrawal said, “These are not actually new cases, but I got to know from private hospitals and labs that they are updating their data and so there has been an increase in the number of cases and not necessarily new cases. We are expecting a spike in number of cases given that people are crowding markets and public places. It is also true that people are not coming forward for testing and most of our wards and testing centres are not able to fulfil their targets. People have probably lost the fear of virus which is not a good thing. Anyone facing symptoms must get themselves tested.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/as-people-s-movement-increases-pune-sees-a-slight-rise-in-positivity-rate/story-OF6HSDN1hJ2u7bIbGQe7RN.html
11-11-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal: Covid-19 norms flouted on local trains||Doctors expressed concern over flouting of Covid safety norms in suburban trains that resumed services in Kolkata and other parts of West Bengal on Wednesday, warning that the pandemic situation would deteriorate.People jostled at several stations to catch the trains with compartments crammed as services resumed after seven months in the morning.Doctors said that such violations are ideal for the spread of the virus, diminishing the gains made over the past few weeks in the fight against the contagion.“We can clearly see people are not abiding by the Covid-19 safety protocols and this is definitely a matter of concern for us,” said Dr Anirban Dalui, a public health specialist.“The problem is that those who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms are travelling on the trains, risking the lives of people who are not taking proper precaution,” he said.Dr Hiralal Konar of the Joint Platform of Doctors blamed improper planning by the state government and the railways for the violations.Also Read: Supreme Court refuses to interfere with HC cracker ban in West Bengal, says preserving life more important“The situation is quite alarming. I fear that if it goes on, the virus will spread to a level where it will be beyond control,” he told PTI.“More planning was required keeping in mind that different people travel on the trains for different purposes.Those travelling to visit their relatives should not have been allowed. The government and the railways got ample to do the planning, but they could not,” Dr Konar said.Senior physician Dr Syamasis Bandyopadhyay, however, said that it will take a couple of days for the commuters to understand and practice the safety norms while travelling on the suburban trains.“The situation is a concern for us but the government or the railways cannot be blamed. The common people have to show some responsibilities to maintain the physical distancing and follow the protocols while travelling,” he said.“I believe the sense of responsibility will grow in a couple of days. We have to wait and see,” Dr Bandyopadhyay said.The local train services under the jurisdiction of the Eastern and the South Eastern Railways have resumed. They were suspended in March as the nation went into a lockdown with the detection of Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-covid-19-norms-flouted-on-local-trains/story-695aMfC2p7xuxE5IPmoQCO.html

The WBPCB team in each zone will coordinate with the local policemen and offer assistance if needed,” the official said.The GPS-fitted devices, developed by a state-run IT undertaking, are being used by the police and the WBPCB since Kali Puja last year.Earlier, the police used sound monitoring gadgets without GPS tracker and tried to nab violators after recording noise pollution in an area.The new devices will also be used to record decibel levels from loudspeakers and sound boxes blaring during the festival and take action if required.

If he continues to be the Chief Minister of my state, there will be no support from me at the state level...We will continue supporting PM Modi at the Centre,” Chirag said.Reacting to the verdict in Bihar elections 2020, Chirag said despite the difficulties the performance was satisfactory and the current mandate clearly indicated that his party was close to 2025 election target.Read more | LJP: Biggest X-factor of the elections“We were close to victory in a few seats. But I can say our party performed well. The Bihar mandate has given us an indication that we are close to our 2025 target,” he added. Chirag also thanked his supporters and candidates for showing the courage to fight the election alone.“Happy that Bihar gave love to LJP, around 25 Lakh voters trusted ‘Bihar First, Bihari First’ and we secured 6 per cent votes while contesting alone. We were called a ‘pichhlaggu party’, that we can do something only with other’s support.

11-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC pulls up AAP govt for relaxing norms as Covid-19 cases spike||The Delhi High Court Wednesday pulled up the AAP government for relaxing norms for public movement and gatherings in the national capital even as Covid-19 cases were increasing and questioned whether it has any policy or strategy in place to deal with the “alarming” situation.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramanium Prasad said that when Delhi, as city state, was “hands down beating” Maharashtra and Kerala in the number of daily new cases in the past two weeks, what concrete steps have been taken by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government to contain the spread of infection.The court noted that the daily number of new Covid-19 cases received for November 10 was at 8,593 and “still counting” and the number of containment zones in the city were 4,016.The court further noted that as per the latest sero survey report of the government the antibodies presence was detected in 25 per cent of the persons tested which meant that one in four persons has been infected by Covid-19.“No household has been left untouched,” the bench said, referring to the survey data and questioned as to why the Delhi government was relaxing norms in such a situation when other similarly placed states were bringing in restrictions.The court questioned the rationale behind allowing 200 people to attend public functions instead of reducing the number and permitting public transportation to be fully occupied, saying that these could turn into “super spreaders” of the infection.The court also sought to know as to why the Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Satyakam, has not come out with any legislation to ensure strict adherence to wearing of masks which was being termed as a “vaccine” till the actual vaccine comes.It directed the Delhi government to file a status report explaining steps taken by it in the last two weeks, when the Covid-19 cases have risen alarmingly, to contain the spread of the infection and listed the matter for further hearing on November 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-pulls-up-aap-govt-for-relaxing-norms-as-covid-19-cases-spike/story-gWe9XeZJzHkT8bOAwir4QM.html
11-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi high court lambasts govt approach after rise in Covid-19 cases||The Delhi high court on Wednesday lambasted the state government for its alleged lackadaisical approach in handling the Covid-19 cases in the national capital while seeking to know the reason as to why a slew of businesses and activities has been reopened in the city, despite close to 8,000 cases being reported every day.A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad questioned the Delhi government’s strategy of unlocking almost everything, including granting permission for 200 people to gather at weddings, allowing public transport to function at full capacity, tehbazaari and gatherings with no social distancing and lack of masks in public places.“The rates in the city are mind-boggling. The number of deaths is every day in double figures. What’s with the Delhi government allowing all the un-lockdown when the cases are skyrocketing? Why have you opened everything? What are the strategies that you are following?Also Read: Covid-19: Three times more testing as compared to last peak, says Satyendar Jain“You (Delhi) have seen the heights which no other state in the country has seen. When the numbers are decreasing in all the states, then why numbers are rising only in your state? Either there is no control or there is lack of control,” the bench said, coming down heavily on the Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Satyakam.The court also noted that even the petitioner, advocate Rakesh Malhotra, had been infected with Covid-19 and had to run from pillar to post to arrange a bed near his house and later “had to settle for a friend’s nursing home in Dwarka after his oxygen level dipped due to the virus.”“People are running helter-skelter without knowing what to do. There are children, elderly people at everyone’s house and there is no household left in Delhi, which hasn’t been touched by the virus. When other states are locking up, either partial or weekend lockdowns, Delhi government has decided to throw its wings open and has allowed all the gatherings,” the court said.It also questioned as to who would monitor wedding attendees and how these functions would not act as superspreaders. It is a matter of deep concern, the court said.“When we speak, we do it for all the citizens of the city. From our personal experiences and those of our colleagues, we are left to wonder whether there is any policy by the Delhi government that is being followed. We do not live in ivory towers and even we receive several requests from the citizens who are struggling. It’s a struggle, a real struggle,” the bench said.The court also noted that the sero survelliance report suggested that one out of four people in the city is affected with the virus.

It directed the ASI on Monday to maintain the aqueduct properly and also reconsidering its decision of not declaring it a protected monument.A division bench of Justices SV Gangapurwala and Avinash Gharote expressed displeasure over the Union culture ministry, the ASI, and Aurangabad superintending archaeologist’s view that Thatte Nahar required to be protected, but the Maharashtra government should do it.“We are unable to countenance this argument as this merely results in passing the buck and nothing else,” said the bench.Also Read: Bombay high court paves way for redevelopment of Mumbai’s Chandan Cinema propertyThe bench said asking the state government to take over the work of preserving the monument will defeat the purpose. It added the ASI took over the monument in 1971 and has been maintaining it since.“This is not only dereliction of the duties and responsibilities under the AMASR [Ancient Monuments And Archaeological Sites And Remains] Act but apathy of the grossest nature, which in fact results in destroying the very purpose for which the ASI has been created,” said the bench.Anant Thatte, a descendant of Bhagwantrao Thatte, who built the underground water channel in 1762, moved the court in 2013, challenging ASI’s move against declaring it a protected monument.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-directs-asi-to-protect-medieval-aqueduct-in-aurangabad/story-yDAJlmfBrpqryEkEzFbb0K.html

Around 17,000 RT-PCR tests were conducted on Tuesday. “Three times more tests are being done now as compared to the last peak. No doubt the third peak is here, hope cases fall in the next couple of days. 17,000 RTPCR tests were conducted yesterday, we have increased testing,” said Jain on the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi.On increasing ICU beds for Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospitals, he said: “We had already issued an order earlier to private hospitals for increasing ICU beds but Delhi High Court stayed that. Hope we get a vacation tomorrow from the Supreme Court on our plea against HC stay.”The Health Minister further informed that the Delhi Government has written a letter to the Central Government to increase the beds. “We have asked the central government to increase about 1,100 beds and 300 ICU beds in government hospitals. There are 11 districts inside Delhi, each district has more than 80 mobile bans which are collect samples and send them to the lab for testing,” Jain added.Delhi has reported 41,385 active cases, according to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-three-times-more-testing-as-compared-to-last-peak-says-satyendar-jain/story-CnIgO8Q9Ybq48mgHbmSv4I.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar poll boost: AIMIM plans to contest in UP, West Bengal||Buoyed by the results of Bihar assembly elections, the AIMIM which bagged five seats is now looking to spread its wings to states such as Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Addressing reporters on Tuesday night, MIM’s president Asaduddin Owaisi said the party will fight for justice inthe northern state’s Seemanchal region.Reacting to allegations that his party was dividing anti-BJP votes, Owaisi said he was running a political party that has a right to contest on its own. “You mean we should not fight elections. You (Congress) went and sat in Shiv Sena’s lap (in Maharashtra). If anyone asks why did you fight the elections... I will fight in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and will fight every election in the country... Do I need to ask anyone’s permission to fight the polls,” he said when asked whether the party would contest in any other state.He however, did not clarify whether the party would contest on its own or in alliance with other parties.Read More | AIMIM gains as smaller parties fail to make a mark“AIMIM will fight in the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Time only will tell with whom we will ally,” Owaisi added. Owaisi is often criticised by Congress and other parties as “B-team” of BJP denting anti-saffron party’s votes. Owaisi-led AIMIM seems to have cut big time into the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan vote in the Seemanchal region in the third phase of the polls, according to poll pundits.The Hyderabad MP-led party was in the fray in 20 seats in Bihar elections, a majority of which went to polls in the third phase on November 7, as part of the Grand Democratic Secular Front that has four other parties, including Upendra Kushwaha’‘s Rashtriya Lok Samta Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. The party’s victory in five seats has become inconsequential in terms of lending support in case of hung- assembly as NDA emerged as the clear winner. When asked if his party will support Mahagathbandhan in case of a shortfall of majority, Owaisi did not give a direct answer saying, “Why should I speculate, when the final results are out then a decision will be taken.” Results of Bihar Assembly polls were not completely declared when the question was posed.According to statistics provided by the Election Commission of India, AIMIM got 1.24 per cent of over 4 crore votes polled.The party unsuccessfully contested in Bihar Assembly polls in 2015 and secured less than 0.5 per cent votes. MIM also unsuccessfully contested in UP Assembly polls in 2017. Besides Telangana and Bihar, MIM has two MLAs and one MP in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-poll-boost-aimim-plans-to-contest-in-up-west-bengal/story-XTgIWKE6uAu4Yw5bjikOPK.html
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal steps up health infra after spike in Covid cases||The spike in Covid-19 cases across Himachal Pradesh, particularly in the state capital of Shimla, over the past week has set alarm bells ringing for the government, which had unlocked almost all activities in phases. Besides closing down educational institutions till November 25 to break the chain of new infections, the state government has now directed hospitals to ready more beds for coronavirus patients as it fears a rise with the arrival of winter. On Wednesday, the state’s cumulative Covid-19 tally stood at 26,808 of which 5,365 are active cases. The coronavirus toll has mounted to 390. In the first week of November alone, the state saw more than 4,000 people testing positive. Mandi is the worst-hit district where the number of positive cases is 4,044, which is 15% of the total cases in the state. The district has 1,129 active cases, the highest in the state. Mandi is followed by Solan with 3,886 cases and Kangra with 3,490 positive patients. COVID WARDS PACKED TO CAPACITY “The number of beds for Covid-19 patients has been increased by 25 at the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital and by 40 at the Indira Gandhi Medical College in Shimla. Makeshift hospitals are also being set up in Shimla, Tanda and the Lal Bahadur Shastri Medical College in Mandi,” says state health secretary Amitabh Awasthi. The government has directed increasing non-ventilator intensive care unit (ICU) beds at the medical college in Mandi besides the Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College Hospital, Tanda, and IGMC, Shimla. The isolation ward at IGMC is already full to capacity. All 85 beds for coronavirus patients are occupied and the hospital has no space to accommodate more cases. Seventy patients in the hospital are on oxygen support, while the isolation ward at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital with 90 beds is nearing capacity, too. WEDDINGS, APPLE BELT NEW HOTSPOTS Besides the opening of schools, the spurt in cases is being attributed to gatherings at weddings. Wedding ceremonies have emerged as hotspots, particularly in Mandi, Kullu and Shimla districts. Rural parts of the state are also in the Covid grip. Shimla’s affluent apple belt of Kotgarh, Kumarsain, Jubbal, Kotkhai, Rohru and Rampur are among the worst-hit places. Officials say people here have not been adhering to social distancing norms. Twenty-six positive cases have been reported from Rampur Bushar, 31 from Jubbal and Kotkhai last week alone. A total of 121 people tested positive in Shimla district, while seven of them died in hospitals in the state capital during the week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-steps-up-health-infra-after-spike-in-covid-cases/story-VQ1W1WqiZtHbajoFlC4M1M.html

Train services coming under the jurisdiction of the Eastern and the South Eastern Railways started during the early hours after being suspended in March due to the coronavirus outbreak in the country. The Eastern Railway is operating 413 suburban trains in Sealdah division and 202 in Howrah division from Wednesday, an official said, according to news agency PTI. To avoid overcrowding of trains, 148 of 177 time- tabled services are being run during peak hours, he added.On Sunday, Union railway minister Piyush Goyal said a total of 696 suburban services would operate in Bengal from November 11. “Railways to run 696 suburban services in West Bengal from 11th November. With adequate safety measures in place, this will greatly enhance passenger convenience, ease of movement & facilitate smooth travel for the people,” he tweeted. The train coaches on Wednesday were not as crowded as they were during the pre-Covid era but passenger footfall is expected to rise gradually as this mode of public transportation is preferred by those living in the suburbs. Railway authorities requested passengers follow all Covid-19 protocols and also made wearing of masks mandatory for entering stations or trains. With a view to prevent the spread of the disease, officials made several other arrangements such as sanitising of stations and coaches, alternate seating arrangements in coaches to maintain physical distance and spot markings at all important places including platforms and ticket counters.On the other hand, passengers sought an increase in the number of trains to avoid overcrowding.

However, the Calcutta high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the state government to consider whether local trains could be suspended or the services could be restricted during the upcoming Kali Puja – to be celebrated during the weekend (on November 14 and 15) -- and followed by Jagadhatri Puja to restrict the public from making a beeline for Kolkata.Eastern Railway (ER) and South Eastern Railway (SER) authorities have started running 696 suburban trains from Wednesday. The break-up of the suburban train service is as follows.It has been decided to run 413, 202 and 81 suburban trains in the Sealdah, Howrah and Kharagpur division, respectively, from Wednesday. Also Read: Calcutta high court bans Chhath Puja processions across the stateSuburban trains connect Kolkata and Howrah with the villages and towns of the adjoining districts in south and central Bengal. These trains form a lifeline for the public who need to visit Kolkata daily for work. Howrah and Sealdah railway stations cater to more than two million passengers a day. “Train services have resumed following all Covid-19 protocols. Police along with the railway’s own security force are maintaining a strict vigil. Wearing face masks have been made mandatory, passengers are being checked with thermal scanners and security agencies are maintaining queues in a bid to maintain adequate social distancing in a bid to keep the contagion at bay,” said a state government official. Railway officials said that while train compartments and stations are being sanitised, the handles and seats in bogies have been colour coded to help passengers maintain social distancing during their rail journeys.“Announcements are being made on public address (PA) systems to make the public aware of the Covid-19 safety norms. Hawkers are not being allowed to board suburban trains,” said a railway official. Bamboo, ropes and guard-rails have been used to put up barricades to ensure queues could be maintained at ticket counters and on railway platforms. Entry and exit gates of railway stations are being made separate to comply with social distancing norms. On Tuesday, the Calcutta HC said that crowding could be avoided during Durga Puja because suburban train services were suspended. “The state should consider whether it may be fit in the best of interest of all to suspend the operation of local trains on November 14 and 15 (Kali Puja) and on the day of Jagadhatri Puja or to manage the number of trains in such a manner that people do not find it convenient to come to Kolkata or travel to other places. The state is left free to make appropriate arrangements with the railway authorities in such regard,” the HC said in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/local-train-services-resume-in-west-bengal-could-be-restricted-on-puja-days-to-check-crowding/story-wkVlMzOZ0vx6u15qe6DkRI.html

But the party managed to retain one seat while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the remaining six.Even as the SP had been the lone gainer in the bypolls in the state since 2017, former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav and other top leaders of the party stayed away from campaigning.

11-11-2020||Kolkata||Calcutta high court bans Chhath Puja processions across the state||The Calcutta high court on Tuesday banned Chhath Puja processions across West Bengal while allowing only two persons per family to enter a water body to offer the puja. Also, devotees have been barred from entering two of the largest lakes within the city, Rabindra Sarobar and Subhas Sarobar. Earlier, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had banned Chhath Puja at Rabindra Sarobar. “The court has banned Chhath Puja processions. Only two persons from a family can enter any water body to perform the puja.

Wearing of masks has been made mandatory at all stages. Earlier in November, the high court had banned the bursting of crackers during all pujas, including the Kali Puja and Chhath Puja. Also the police have been directed to ensure that no crackers are sold or used in Kolkata as crackers have already been banned till November 30 by the high court and the NGT. Despite the NGT’s ban, hundreds of devotees broke open the gates of Rabindra Sarobar in November 2019 to perform the Chhath rituals. They even burst crackers and played drums at the Sarobar although the government had earmarked alternative water bodies in the city for conduct of the rituals. The incident made headlines and triggered a huge controversy. “As far as the Subhas Sarobar and Rabindra Sarobar are concerned, in view of the subsisting order of the NGT, these water bodies will be totally out of bounds for Chhath Puja celebrations,” the Calcutta high court said in its order on Tuesday.

11-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s air improves slightly, recorded as ‘very poor’ after six consecutive days in ‘severe’ zone||The air quality index (AQI) of Delhi showed a marginal improvement on Wednesday morning after six consecutive days of pollution in the “severe” category. The AQI was in the “very poor” category as the early morning recording of 394 showed. The improvement from “severe” to “very poor” category was largely due to the wind speed gathering momentum and an appreciable dip in farm fire incidents in Punjab on Tuesday. An AQI between 401 and 500 and from 301 to 400 is considered in the “severe” and “very poor” category, respectively. Poor AQI causes distress and respiratory illnesses, especially among the vulnerable population such as children and senior citizens, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Also Read: Worst episode of smog negates all good air records in DelhiThe minimum temperature in the national capital recorded at 6.10am on Wednesday was 12 degrees Celsius (C). There was no fog, only mist.On Tuesday, at around 9:30 am, at least 18 stations in Delhi had reported an AQI of 500, which is the maximum on the pollution measurement metric.A few private air quality monitoring platforms had even reported an AQI of 999, indicating that the pollution measuring values had hit the maximum level.On Tuesday, the average 24-hour AQI in Delhi was 476, according to CPCB data. The past six days was one of the longest spells in the nation capital’s brush with “severe” air quality.Scientists said that Wednesday’s improvement was primarily due to a change in wind speeds. According to the Tuesday’s bulletin of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a national initiative introduced by the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), the wind condition further aggravated Delhi’s pollution woes.The national capital is reeling under stubble burning in neighbouring Haryana, Punjab and also parts of western Uttar Pradesh (UP), which has become an annual feature around this time of the year. “AQI is likely to improve on Wednesday. It will hover between the lower end of ‘severe’ and the higher end of ‘very poor’ category owing to a likely change in wind direction and marginally better ventillation condition,” the bulletin said.“A few hundred farm fires were raging on Tuesday, as compared to thousands in the past week. Winds are also picking up. We are expecting an improvement in the pollution level,” said Vijay Soni, a scientist with India Meteorological Department (IMD).The weather bureau has predicted that Wednesday would be foggy. The maximum and minimum temperature’s forecast is 30 and 11 degrees C, respectively.On Tuesday, the minimum temperature had dropped to 10.7 degrees C -- three degrees below normal -- and maximum temperature stood at 30.1 degrees C – a notch above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-s-air-improves-slightly-recorded-as-very-poor-after-six-consecutive-days-in-severe-zone/story-8CPSz9qSHrGK4IGNmOmGZP.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Why did the exit polls get the Bihar results wrong?||The numerical see-saw presented by the Bihar election results through the day was not just hard on political parties and their supporters but also on psephologists who were wondering how they could have, yet again, gotten things as wrong as they did.Most predicted a clear win for the Tejashwi Yadav led Mahagatbandhan, but the alliance eventually lost out in a close contest that went down to the wire, and which was decided by wafer-thing margins in some constituencies.Such surveys measure vote share and then use an algorithm to convert this into seats, with the conversion usually being the cause of erroneous projections.This time, many even got their vote shares wrong. Also Watch | Five lessons from Bihar Assembly elections 2020For instance, Today’s Chankya, a polling agency that has made a name for itself predicted that the Mahagatbandhan could win up to 180 seats on a 44% vote share. The NDA’s vote share would be around 34%, it said.The Mahagathbandhan was projected to get about 120 seats in the 243-member house by the Times Now C-Voter exit poll. Republic TV-Jan Ki Baat projected 118-138 for the alliance.The ABP C-Voter and the News X-DV polls did better, with the Mahagatbandhan’s final numbers falling square in the middle of the range predicted by them .So, what went wrong this time?Experts said three factors could have skewed exit polls.One, timing, with the National Democratic Alliance really picking up momentum after the first phase. Two, an underrepresentation of women in exit polls, who, in the end, voted overwhelmingly for the NDA. And three, the presence of a huge silent majority, unrepresented in exit polls, who actually voted in large numbers for the NDA.Noted political scientist Neelanjan Sircar said that predicting election outcomes is difficult at any time, but that during the Covid-19 pandemic, those conducting these surveys may have also faced logistical difficulties. He also said the BJP and RJD performed well, while alliance partners JD(U) and Congress did not. He argued that this sort of volatility, which is often not seen, may have made the prediction of final outcome all the more difficult.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/why-did-the-exit-polls-get-the-bihar-results-wrong/story-f3Ye3kZorAdRGpvgH9VMBP.html
11-11-2020||Election:||LJP: Biggest X-factor of the elections||The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) contesting the Bihar elections outside the fold of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was the biggest X-factor in these elections, though the party has won a solitary seat in the elections.On the campaign trail, the LJP’s main attack was focused on the Janata Dal (United) -- so much so that it kept talking about forming a government with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after the results, stressing on how it was still part of the NDA at the Centre and leader Chirag Paswan kept criticising chief minister Nitish Kumar while praising the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.This talk of being a part of government formation has little meaning now -- the NDA has managed a simple majority of 124 in the assembly, and the LJP has won just one seat. The LJP has managed to improve its vote share from 4.8% to 5.7% between 2015 and 2020 assembly elections, largely a function of the fact that it contested in 135 assembly constituencies (ACs) this time, compared to just 42 in 2015. However, this is the LJP’s worst performance in terms of seats, and in keeping with the trend of its growing marginalisation in the state’s politics. (See Chart)But an HT analysis of the LJP’s performance shows that its candidates played the role of a spoiler in 64 assembly constituencies (ACs). Candidates are defined as spoilers if they are ranked third or below, and get more votes than the victory margin in a constituency. The biggest sufferer of the LJP in these elections was the JD(U), which lost elections in 27 ACs where the LJP was a spoiler.The LJP also has acted as a spoiler in 17 ACs for the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), 11 for the Congress, 4 for the Vikassheel Insan Party (VIP), 3 for the Communist Party of India Marxist Leninist (Liberation), and one for the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/ljp-biggest-x-factor-of-the-elections/story-ZuZme8FoU0SUK7GQ6FmZyH.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: LJP wins one seat but cuts into JD(U)’s votes||The Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party (LDP) won a single seat in the 243-member Bihar assembly, results and trends for which were declared late Tuesday evening.The party fielded 137 candidates, primarily in opposition to Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United), after it decided to quit the National Democratic Alliance. As many as 25 Bharatiya Janata Party rebel leaders had joined the LJP after being denied a ticket by the party.The party’s tally, however, is down from its last performance in 2015 where it managed to win 2 seats after contesting from 42 assembly constituencies. In the lone seat of Matihani that LJP managed to win, its candidate Raj Kumar Singh defeated JD(U)’s Narendra Kumar Singh by a slim margin of 333 votes.Though the party got just one seat, it managed to slice through a crucial chunk of the NDA vote by impacting nearly 29 of the 58 constituencies that the JD(U) was trailing on. In most of these assembly constituencies, the LJP managed to secure a nearly 10% vote share, dealing a decisive blow to its erstwhile ally. Results for a number of these constituencies was still in process, according to the EC website until press time.The party has, according to experts, managed to help the Mahagathbandhan by helping the RJD, the Congress and the Left parties cross the threshold to gain the upper hand in nearly 50% of 58 constituencies analysed by Hindustan Times.In the key constituency of Dinara, where the LJP fielded former BJP loyalist Rajendra Singh, who had been an RSS worker for nearly 37 years, the JD(U) was reduced to 16% votes, while the RJD bagged victory with 34.97% votes. The LJP managed to secure 30.13% votes.Former BJP legislators Usha Vidyarthi, who contested from Paliganj on an LJP ticket, and Rameshwar Chaurasiya, who contested from Sasaram, barely managed to secure a little over 10% of the vote share. Other BJP leaders including Ravindra Yadav managed only 6% votes in Jhajha, while Mrinal Shekhar managed 24.59% of the vote but failed to trounce Jayant Raj of the JD(U).Psephologist Yashwant Deshmukh said on Tuesday evening that by the time final numbers would come in, the LJP would have impacted the JD(U)’s chances on nearly 35 seats. “Whatever the idea was, Hanuman has ended up damaging Ayodhya rather than Lanka,” Deshmukh said. “If Hanuman was implanted to inflict such damage, then he has done remarkably well.”Deshmukh added that the NDA would have won no less than 150 seats if the LJP hadn’t cut down its chances.Political analyst Sandeep Shastri concurred with Deshmukh that the strategy for the LJP to go it alone may have backfired. “At the end of the day, LJP has not achieved anything,” said Shastri. “There is no shadow of doubt that it has caused a major decline in the JD(U)’s seat count.” However, Shastri added that Chirag Paswan may have inevitably damaged the role his party would play in the future of Bihar politics. “Whatever his father Ram Vilas Paswan worked to achieve, the social identity, has been undone,” said Shastri. “It seems he (Chirag) is paving the way to become part of the BJP fold; in the long run, it will hardly be a gain.”Deshmukh said he wouldn’t be surprised if Chirag is offered a position as a Union minister in the near future. “It was always impossible for a party like LJP, which barely has a 6% vote share in the state, to win nearly 35% without being in an alliance,” Deshmukh said. “Chirag did exactly as he was told... it wouldn’t come as a surprise if he is offered a Union ministership soon.” He added that BJP rebel candidates could never have made a mark since the party organisationally works with a cadre system. “Unless you have a long-standing grassroots level connect, the candidate wouldn’t have made a difference as the BJP goes forth as a party and not individuals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-ljp-wins-one-seat-but-cuts-into-jd-u-s-votes/story-L3TFBSB7tgOeNKUpCbJPNK.html
11-11-2020||Election:||AIMIM gains as smaller parties fail to make a mark||The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), led by Asaduddin Owaisi, appears to have found a foothold in Bihar even as most other smaller parties in the fray, including the once significant Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) now led by Chirag Paswan, were unable to open their account on verdict day in the Bihar assembly elections.The AIMIM won five seats — Baisi and Amnour in Purnia district, Bahadurganj and Kochadhaman in Kishanganj, and Jokihat in Araria district -- a performance that meant the party must shed its vote thief or spoilsport card, and emerge as a party with a not insignificant presence on the next assembly.All five seats have a high Muslim population ranging between 50% and 70% of the electorate.The party did not win a single seat in the 2015 elections, but grabbed one seat (Kishanganj) in a bypoll last year.Its partner in the Grand Secular Democratic Front (GDSP), the Bahujan Samaj Party, was leading from Chainpur constituency in Kaimur.The BSP, too, failed to open its account in 2015, when its candidates forfeited their deposits on 225 of the 228 seats they contested.Other members of the GDSP, former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) and the Janwadi Party Socialist (JPS), did not feature on the leaderboard.What is impressive is the AIMIM’s strike rate, having contested just 24 seats for its five wins, while the RLSP contested 104 seats and the BSP 80. AIMIM had got 1.25% of the total votes polled in the state so far.“It’s a great moment for us as people of Bihar have honoured us with so many votes. Our leaders & workers have put a lot of efforts into strengthening our party in Bihar. We will try our best to fulfil the promises made by us,” Owaisi, a four-time member of Parliament from Hyderabad since 2014, told news agency ANI.The Congress, meanwhile, dubbed the AIMIM the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) “B-team” and accused it of colluding with the party.Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathore admitted the AIMIM snatched key seats in the Seemanchal region from the Congress. “Had it not contested, some of the seats would have come to us,” he said. “It’s a test for the AIMIM now as it has to decide which side it will be, as it may have an important role to play in government formation, with the contest being close.”It may not come to that with the National Democratic Alliance securing a slender majority, winning or leading 124 seats in the 243-member assembly, as per results declared on the Election Commission website at 11pm.But AIMIM national spokesperson Asim Waqar told PTI in New Delhi that there was no question of supporting the NDA in any case, asserting that his party has always stood against the BJP.Experts said the performance may have been driven by aggressive voting by the Muslim migrants. “The AIMIM has done extremely well in areas having Muslim majority, with a sizeable migrant population. The voters believe that the AIMIM will take up their cause more aggressively and proactively than the RJD or the Congress, which would have simply consolidated their position,” said Prof Arvind Aditya Raj of the political science department at Patna’s College of Commerce, Arts and Science.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/aimim-gains-as-smaller-parties-fail-to-make-a-mark/story-Ban9hcyqSngZseMaqsh7wJ.html
11-11-2020||Election:||RJD, Congress allege irregularities by EC in announcing poll winners||Members of the opposition Mahagathbandhan, including Manoj Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Randeep Singh Surjewala of the Congress, on Tuesday alleged irregularities in the counting process in seats with tight margins, as the Grand Alliance appeared to make a late charge but fell short of the crucial majority mark in a close contest against the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The charges were denied by the Election Commission of India (EC), and said they were going about their duties with all procedures followed impartially.Jha alleged that leaders from the ruling Janata Dal (United) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were “misusing their official power” to delay the handing over of certificates to winning candidates, and thereby leaving the scope for tampering with the final results in the elections held amid the Covid-19 curbs.Jha, the national spokesman of the RJD, said that the Mahagathbandhan -- the RJD, the Congress and three Left parties -- was confident of pulling off a victory at the last moment. “Our strike rate is better than others. The JD(U)-BJP leaders are sitting at the chief minister’s residence. I urge these leaders and the administration that it is their duty to be impartial,” he said.Jha, however, did not elaborate on what this alleged pressure amounted to.Surjewala said that in Kishanganj, the Congress candidate won by 1,266 votes. “Now the Congress candidate is being denied a winning certificate,” he alleged.Responding to their comments, the EC said that there was no wrongdoing of any kind, and that some winning certificates were pending further verification because of the tight margins.“We have cross-checked with the chief election commissioner of Bihar and the allegations (by the RJD) are found to have been false and are not substantiated. At no place has counting of postal ballots stopped,” said deputy election commissioner Chandra Bhushan, in charge of BiharJD(U) dismissed the Grand Alliance’s allegations.“The one who used to take gin out of ballot boxes are talking about foul play. What an irony. They (Grand Alliance) are taking respect out of the mandate,” said JD(U) spokesperson Ajay Alok.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/rjd-congress-allege-irregularities-by-ec-in-announcing-poll-winners/story-NgRGF7t0gWtMH2cDmNgTcM.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Increased poll booths delays vote counting||Counting of votes in the Bihar assembly polls turned out to be a slow process — about 42% votes were counted by 4pm on Tuesday and nearly 27 million out of the 41.1 million votes polled in the state were counted by 5.30pm, according to Election Commission of India officials.Given the extraordinary circumstances caused by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, there was an increase in the number of booths from where votes were to be counted. In 2015, counting took place at 38 locations.“In all assembly constituencies, counting is happening at invariably 14 tables, across large halls,” said deputy electio n commissioner Chandra Bhushan, in charge of Bihar. “The number of rounds of counting range from 19 at the least to 51 at the most. The average number of rounds per constituency will be around 35. We hope to finish the counting as per procedure by late tonight.”“The final data for postal ballots will only be available at the RO level,” said Chandra Bhushan. He added that since the number of rounds of counting would vary from constituency to constituency, exact data could not be provided.The commission had set up nearly 63% more polling booths, up from 65,000 in 2015 to 106,000 in 2020, to meet Covid-19 guidelines.“Correspondingly, the number of EVMs as also increased to 106,000.”Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Manoj Jha said that in multiple seats, counting could go up to 30 to 35 rounds, which left scope for a comeback, particularly with several constituencies being decided by wafer-thin margins.Deputy election commissioner Ashish Kundra said nearly 160,000 ballots were dispatched for service voters, of which over 50,000 were received by the returning officers.Deputy election commissioner Sudeep Jain said the EVMs (electronic voting machines) were absolutely robust, shooting down any insinuations about the possibility of tampering with the count.The delay in counting led to members of the opposition Mahagathbandhan, including Manoj Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Randeep Singh Surjewala of the Congress, alleging irregularities in the the counting process in seats with tight margins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-increased-poll-booths-delays-vote-counting/story-XnEb1GbwqTV08fezdUXJbN.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Amid demands for recount, EC points to May 2019 order||Amid demands by some political parties in Bihar for a recount of votes in some constituencies, the Election Commission of India (EC) on Tuesday said that a recount would only take place when the margin of victory was lesser than the number of postal ballots found invalid.According to an order issued by EC on May 18, 2019, when the margin of victory is less than the number of postal ballot papers rejected at the time of counting, all rejected postal ballot papers must mandatorily be reverified by the returning officer. “Wherever such reverification is done, the entire proceeding should be videographed as per instructions of the Commission,” the instructions state, said officials of the poll body.The clarification came amid demand for a recounting of votes by the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Lenin) in light of the narrow margin of victory in three constituencies.“We urgently seek a recount of votes in the Bhorey, Arrah and Daraundha Assembly constituencies of Bihar. On all three of these seats, CPI(M-L) candidates have been shown to be defeated in very narrow margins, following some worrying violations of counting norms,” said party politburo member Kavita Krishnan in a representation to the chief election commissioner on Tuesday.She alleged that in Bhorey -- where the party lost by 462 votes, according to EC data -- the Janata Dal (United) candidate Sunil Kumar, a former additional director general of police (DGP), commands clout. “The local JD(U) MP Alok Kumar Suman was seen entering the counting hall – which is illegal and prohibited. This was clearly an attempt to influence fair count of votes. As of now, the EC site shows Sunil Kumar at 73,550 votes and CPI(M-L)’s Jitendra Paswan at 72,524 votes,” the letter stated.EC secretary-general Umesh Sinha, however, shot down any allegations of undue pressure on the commission. “The election commission is not under anyone’s influence,” said Sinha.The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), too, alleged irregularities in the counting process in seats with tight margins. The party released a list of 119 seats that it said it had purportedly won in the state, prompting the poll body to clarify that the results for only 146 assembly constituencies in Bihar had been declared as of 10pm, with trends for the remaining 97 seats available on its website.“A message on social media claimed that a party has won 119 seats about an hour ago, the EC’s website in the public domain and one can see that only 146 seats have been won so far,” said deputy election commissioner Chandra Bhushan at a press conference at 10 pm. As of 9:30 pm, 39.6 million votes had been counted, the election commission said. While the electorate in Bihar stands at 72 million, only 57.09%, or about 40 million, cast their votes in the polls to the 243-member assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-amid-demands-for-recount-ec-points-to-may-2019-order/story-RuJVmyDLJfTbohn4hu808I.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Left records higher strike rate than RJD, Cong; lags in popular support||The three left parties – the Communist Party of India (CPI), the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M), and the Communist Party of India Marxist Leninist (Liberation) or the CPI-ML – have won 16 of the 29 assembly constituencies (ACs) they contested in the Bihar assembly elections. Their combined strike rate of 55.2% is third after the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) strike rate of 66.4% and Hindustani Awaam Morcha (HAM)’s 57.1%.The CPI-ML has got its highest ever tally of 12 ACs, 5 more than the previous high of 7 ACs in the February 2005 elections in Bihar. In the February 2005 election, the party contested 109 ACs, while it contested only 19 ACs in this election.Although some of the improvement in the performance of the left parties in Bihar can be attributed to their alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress, they have performed better than their alliance partners in terms of strike rate. The CPI, CPI(M), and CPI-ML, who contested four, six, and 19 seats respectively, have a strike rate of 33.3%, 50%, and 63% respectively. The RJD and Congress, which contested 144 and 70 seats respectively, have a strike rate of 52.8% and 27.1% respectively.With 16 legislators in the 243-member assembly, the left’s seat share is 6.6%. This is its highest in the Hindi belt since 1995 when the three parties together had a seat share of 14% in the 243 seats that comprise the current Bihar assembly.To be sure, the improvement in seat share and strike rate of the left parties must not be construed as a big rise in popular support for the left. Its total vote share at the time of writing this story (11:45 pm) was 4.6%, less than the 5.1% votes it polled in the November 2005 election to win nine ACs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-left-records-higher-strike-rate-than-rjd-cong-lags-in-popular-support/story-r5Qr3Oa4N2BEbsKP4gkMQO.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar show strengthens BJP’s national standing||Its performance in the battle of Bihar is a salve for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that has faced several defeats in assembly elections starting 2018 -- of the 17 assembly elections starting late 2018, it has won six and lost 10. The party, as a primary winner in the NDA, has secured 74 seats, the most in the alliance.The losses that the party faced in strongholds such as Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (it managed to wrest power in the last, and the results of the by-elections in the state have consolidated its position), punctured the notion of the party’s invincibility after the BJP’s electoral juggernaut collected wins in as many as 21 states between the 2014 general elections and 2017.The BJP, in alliance with the Janata Dal (United), the HAM(S) and the VIP party has retained power in Bihar proving both forecasts of anti-incumbency and the exit polls wrong. And with Bihar in its kitty, the BJP-led NDA is now in power in 16 states.In Madhya Pradesh by-election, the party won or was leading in 19 seats of the 28 seats that were critical for the survival of the state government; in Karnataka, the BJP won both seats; in UP 6 of the 7 seats and in Gujarat all 8. The party also won the only seat in Telangana and 4 of the 5 seats in Manipur.Following the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, where the BJP retained the seat of power at the centre with a brute majority, the party’s electoral fortunes reversed.It lost the chance to return to power in Maharashtra where it fell out with its oldest ally, the Shiv Sena, over power sharing, and in Jharkhand where the Raghubar Das government lost to the coalition of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha with the Congress, RJD, CPI and NCP.In Haryana, a hurried post-poll alliance with the Jananayak Janta Party ensured a second term for chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in the face of a surprisingly strong performance by the Congress.Earlier this year, it lost Delhi to the Aam Aadmi Party. In 2018, the party lost polls in the Hindi heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. Its coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir with the PDP also collapsed in 2018.The losses were attributed to the BJP’s inability to relate to the issues on the ground, and amplified the trend of Indian voters voting remarkably differently in state and national elections.Ajay Gudavarthy, political analyst and professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University said the BJP has not been able to perform as well at the state level as it does at the Centre because of its inability to understand the federal structure of the country.“Its campaigns are all centered on PM (Narendra ) Modi. In some cases they undermine and undo their own regional leaders. This centralization helps win the general elections but proves to be detrimental at the state level.”He said the campaigns in states sought to project Modi as a strong leader but failed to focus on the track record of the local leadership.BJP leaders disagree with the assessment. Vinay Shahsrabuddhe, a Rajya Sabha MP, said the BJP’s approach to contesting state elections has been to head into a contest on the twin planks of development and politics of performance.“A democracy imprisoned by identity politics has changed. Now people are inclined to vote for development politics and the politics of performance. I have never heard the Congress leadership including Mrs (Sonia) Gandhi appeal for votes on the basis of performance. In contrast in West Bengal recently, union home minister Amit Shah said people should compare the BJP’s track record of governance with that of the opposition and they will see we are far better,” he said.The BJP’s winning streak began in late 2013 with wins in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh. It then swept to power in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Soon after the May 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP led-NDA formed government in 11 states including in Jammu and Kashmir with an unlikely partner, the ideological polar PDP.But in 2015 it lost Delhi and Bihar. The season of losses ran through 2016, when the party managed a win only in Assam and fared poorly in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, but showed an increase in its vote share in Kerala and West Bengal.It gained ground in 2017 and some part of 2018, through weaving alliances in the North East, and winning Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Manipur. It did lose in Punjab to the Congress, though.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-show-strengthens-bjp-s-national-standing/story-5yni19kj1WP2Xj5BiwNoYJ.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: NDA’s seat share rose with every phase||The fact that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has managed to secure a majority in the Bihar elections is largely an outcome of its ability to gain momentum after the first phase of polling in the state. The irony involved here is difficult to miss, as it was the NDA which entered the contest as the favoured coalition against the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan (MGB).An HT analysis of phase-wise statistics shows this clearly. On every indicator, be it strike rate, vote share, or victory margin, the NDA performance improved discernibly from the first to the final phase of the elections. Phase-wise statistics also suggest a growing counter-polarisation against the RJD, which could have been the result of the NDA evoking the memories of RJD president Lalu Prasad from 1990 to 2005.The Bihar elections were held in three phases. Seventy-one assembly constituencies (ACs) went to poll on October 28, 94 ACs on November 3, and 78 on November 7. The seat share of NDA increased over each phase. It is 29.6% in the first phase, 52.1% in the second phase and 66.7% in the third phase. The MGB’s performance is the opposite. It bagged 67.6% of the seats in the first phase, 46.8% in the second phase and just 26.9% in the third phase.What is interesting is the fact that this huge difference in seat share is more a result of vagaries of the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system rather than difference in popular support.Even though the MGB suffered a dip of just about 1.5 percentage points in its vote share from Phase 1 to Phase 2 and phase two to phase three, its seat share dropped by about 20 percentage points compared to the previous phase in both the second and the third phase. The increase in the NDA’s vote share was bigger than the loss in the MGB’s vote share. It increased by 6.33 percentage points between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and 1.9 percentage points between Phase 2 and Phase 3. As a result of these changes, the NDA recovered from a 6.8% vote share deficit vis-à-vis the MGB in the first phase to a lead of 4.4% in the third phase. This suggests that the NDA was more successful in consolidating the floating voter than eat into the MGB’s support base. (See Chart 1)The phase-wise difference in performance also shows in the victory margins of the two major alliances. Median victory margin of the NDA increased from 5% to 9.8% from the first to third phase, whereas it came down from 11.4% to 6.6% for the MGB.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-nda-s-seat-share-rose-with-every-phase/story-ZS5x063tSw75agxBU3zvlK.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Congress’s poor show hurts allies, party says fought tough seats||A poor performance by the Congress appeared to prove costly for the Grand Alliance (GA) in Bihar as the party was leading or winning in just 19 of the 70 seats it contested in the assembly elections. Considered a “weak link” in the GA and despite piggybacking on the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Congress could not match its performance of the 2015 assembly elections. It had then contested 41 seats and won 27.The Congress also lost the crucial bypolls in Madhya Pradesh, where the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was ahead in 19 out of the 28 seats and was set to retain power with a comfortable majority. The Congress was leading on 9.Click here for complete Bihar election coverage It failed to win any seat in the bypolls in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Manipur, Nagaland, Odisha and Telangana.In Bihar, the strike rate of the three Left parties — Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) or CPI(ML) — was much better than that of the Congress, as per the Election Commission’s figures. Out of the 29 seats contested by them as part of the GA, the three Left parties were leading or winning in 16. Out of the 144 seats it contested, the RJD was ahead in 76. Congress leaders blame a delayed seat-sharing deal between alliance partners, poor selection of candidates, weak organisational structure, ineffective state leadership, unimpressive campaign and lack of coordination with alliance partners for the party’s poor show.The RJD-Congress-Left combine struck the seat-sharing deal on October 3, just 25 days ahead of the first phase of the elections on October 28. “It was a bad deal for us. Our negotiators should not have accepted the choice of seats. Out of the 70 seats given to us, 30-35 were extremely tough. These were the seats where we had no base and even the RJD was weak,” said senior Congress leader Kishore Kumar Jha.A Congress functionary said the 70 seats given to his party were NDA strongholds, with the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) having won 33 and 32 seats respectively in the 2010 assembly elections. And in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the two NDA parties won 67 out of these 70 segments. The Congress also ran into trouble after protests erupted across the state over the selection of “tainted and incompetent” candidates. The allegations of irregularities in ticket distribution and growing dissidence in the state unit prompted the Congress leadership to step in and form six different panels to oversee the party’s poll preparations and management. But that didn’t seem to have helped. “Our ticket distribution was the worst I have seen in my political career. A candidate from east Bihar was given ticket in north and so on. Similarly, caste balance was not maintained in Seemanchal and that is why we fared so badly in the region,” added Jha. Patna-based political analyst Ajay Kumar Jha said Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, failed to lend a helping hand to the RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav in campaign trail or take forward the narrative set by him. “While Tejashwi Yadav talked about jobs, economy and development of Bihar, Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders spoke of China, attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and raised inconsequential issues,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-congress-s-poor-show-hurts-allies-party-says-fought-tough-seats/story-BomddHRdIZjld1KB2yqlXP.html
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab continues to fare worst in Covid-19 fatality rate in country||Punjab has consistently fared worst in the country in terms of Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) for the last more than two months with the Union government expressing concern over the issue again. When the other states are showing remarkable improvement on the count, Punjabs CFR has been on the rise, reaching 3.14% on Tuesday, more than double the national average of 1.49%. On Monday, the Union health ministry in a meeting with officials of 10 worst-hit states again asked Punjab to take steps to improve its CFR by taking urgent steps. It was on September 9 when Punjab topped the country with the highest CFR (2.95%) by surpassing Gujarat (2.93%) and Maharashtra (2.90%), the two worst-affected states. As on Tuesday, whereas Maharashtra managed to reduce its CFR to 2.6% and Gujarat to 2.1%, Punjab’s ratio increased to 3.14%, showing a worrying sign as the number of daily addition of cases has also fallen sharply to average 500 a day this week. Concerned over the high CFR, the Centre in September had rushed a team of experts to the state. The team had made some recommendations to make certain changes in the treatment protocol. Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the state’s high CFR is primarily because of a sharp decline in daily addition of positive cases. “In the other states with high CFR, the daily addition of cases has not decreased in the same proportion as in Punjab. High rate of co-morbidities and lifestyle diseases is also a major reason behind a high CFR. But Punjab has also been appreciated for testing every person even as their death was due to other reasons,” said Dr Bhaskar. “We are in the process of compiling data but we also tested those who lost their lives in accidents. In at least 25 such cases, the patients were found positive after their death. Similarly, three persons who consumed poison and died were also found positive after death,” he added.

11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Did Modi push propel NDA in tight poll race?||The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has managed a simple majority in what was a very closely contested election in Bihar. However, the difference in the performance of the two major alliance partners, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Janata Dal (United) will mean that the balance of power changes significantly within the NDA. The BJP and the JD(U) have won 73 and 43 seats in the new assembly. Click here for complete Bihar assembly election coverage The difference is in keeping with their strike rates; seats won as a share of seats contested. This number is 66% for the BJP and just 33% for the JD(U). Did the BJP save the elections for the NDA? One way to look at this question is the performance of the NDA in assembly constituencies (ACs) where Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed election rallies. Modi addressed 12 rallies during the campaign. HT has looked at the performance of the NDA in 110 ACs which are in the 12 districts where these rallies took place. A simple analysis suggests that the NDA’s performance is much better in these regions. The NDA’s strike rate in these 110 ACs is 56.4%.  This is significantly higher than the strike rate of 48.9% in the remaining 133 ACs. However, a more nuanced analysis suggests otherwise. As has been pointed out, the NDA has performed significantly better in the second and third phases of the polls compared to the first phase. Its strike rate is just 29.6% in the 71 ACs that went to the polls in the first phase. This increases to 53.2% and 66.7% in the 94 and 78 ACs that went to the polls in the second and third phase. A phase-wise break-up of the NDA’s performance in the 110 ACs in districts where Modi addressed rallies for the NDA follows a similar pattern. A comparison of NDA performance in ACs in each phase where the Prime Minister addressed and did not address rallies shows that these rallies generated relatively greater tailwinds for the NDA in the third phase compared to the first and second phases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-did-modi-push-propel-nda-in-tight-poll-race/story-RSXXSpypzvm5Pe3L5fGlYK.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: With superior poll strike rate, BJP may call the shots in NDA||The tables have turned.For many years, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) relied on Nitish Kumar and his Janata Dal (United) to stay in power in Bihar. Today, their National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is back in power. But the BJP calls the shots now. Nitish Kumar, the poster boy for a good governance chief minister, is a shell of his former self.As I had argued in election day commentary for this paper, since the election of Narenda Modi as Prime Minister, Nitish Kumar and JD(U) have been an electoral weak link — underperforming compared to major alliance partners in both 2015 and 2019.Nitish Kumar’s political appeal was premised on the ability to deliver benefits, and myriad development and welfare schemes kept him in power. But today, those same voters primarily attribute the delivery of benefits to Prime Minister Modi, stripping Nitish Kumar of his main political appeal.Voters were willing to vote for the BJP but not the JD(U).This is borne out by the provisional election returns in Bihar (at 10:19pm). There was a wide gap in performance between the BJP and the JD(U). The BJP had an average vote share of 43% in the seats it contested (contested vote share) as compared to 33% for the JD(U). In fact, even the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) had a much higher contested vote share than the JD(U) at 39% (the Congress once again proved to be a weak coalition partner with a contested vote share of 33%).The vote share differences manifested in radically different strike rates (percentage of contested seats won) — with the BJP scoring a strike rate of 65% and the JD(U) of just 37%. Nowhere was this difference more evident than in head-to-head contests with rival RJD.In the 57 head-to-head contests against the RJD the BJP had a strike rate of 65%, while the JD(U) had a significantly weaker 33% in its 61 head-to-head contests against the RJD.To be sure, an important factor was that NDA rebel Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) put up candidates in direct competition with the JD(U) on 113 seats, with the LJP gaining a vote share of at least 10% in 51 (45%) of those seats. Assuming perfect vote transfer between the LJP and the JD(U), which is unlikely, the LJP played a spoiler on up to 34 seats for JD(U).But that wasn’t the only thing that mattered. Tejashwi Yadav, the new leader of the RJD, grew his wings in this campaign. His focusing on the jobs crisis (and migrant issues) in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic dented Nitish Kumar’s popularity even further and yielded electoral dividends for the BJP.The lockdown from March, which triggered a massive migrant crisis and economic deprivation, could in principle have hurt both the BJP’s and the JD(U)’s popularity. But like so many other such issues, it is the state-level leader in Nitish Kumar that bore the brunt of voter anger with little cost to Modi and the BJP.In order to understand how migrant-heavy areas may have voted, we look to the 2001 Census data (the last year for which out-migration data is available) to calculate the rate of male out-migration (males migrating out as a proportion of the total population).Because the actual numbers are no longer trustworthy after 20 years, I calculated two groups of constituencies for a meaningful analysis — the 102 constituencies in districts below the median district rate of male migration, and the 141 constituencies above the median district rate of male migration.The RJD’s average contested vote share rose from 37% in the low migration constituencies to 41% in the high migration constituencies, while the JD(U)’s dropped slightly from 33% to 32%.Against the RJD, the JD(U) dropped from a 46% strike rate in low migration constituencies to a strike rate of just 24% in high migration constituencies. Even with RJD’s increase in vote share, the BJP’s strike rate remained impressive across low (71%) and high (58%) constituencies.Click here for complete Bihar election coverage While things may look the same (after all, the NDA is back in power), the political game in Bihar has changed significantly.Chirag Paswan and his LJP have shown their electoral importance to the NDA, and Nitish Kumar no longer has much bargaining power within the NDA. In this new era, politics in Bihar will revolve around the competition between a nationally dominant BJP with Modi at the helm and a resurrected RJD led by an ascendant Tejashwi Yadav.(The writer is an assistant professor, Ashoka University, and visiting senior fellow, Centre for Policy Research)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-with-superior-poll-strike-rate-bjp-may-call-the-shots-in-nda/story-REOAbzOoVOLvhYSUW8SuDJ.html
11-11-2020||Election:||PM Modi: Bihar taught the world first lesson of democracy||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the people of Bihar have made a “decisive move” to give development a chance, as results of the assembly election continue to trickle in, showing the ruling NDA leading in or winning 124 seats and the opposition alliance in 111 seats.PM Modi’s tweets came minutes after Union home minister Amit Shah declared victory in Bihar for the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). “Bihar has taught the world the first lesson of democracy. Today Bihar has told the world again how democracy is strengthened. A record number of poor, deprived and women of Bihar also voted and today have also given their decisive decision for development,” PM Modi tweeted in Hindi.“The poor in villages, farmers, labourers, merchants, shopkeepers and every section of Bihar have relied on the NDA’s mantra of sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas. I again assure every citizen of Bihar that for the balanced development of every person, every region, we will continue to work with full dedication,” PM Modi tweeted.Senior party leader and Union home minister Amit Shah termed the victory in the elections as a reflection of people’s faith in the Modi government’s battle against Covid-19 and said it was a lesson to those who were trying to misguide the people.In a series of tweets in Hindi, Shah also said that the victory of the NDA was the win of the “double engine” development of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. “Every section of Bihar has once again chosen the development of NDA by denying hollow politics, casteism and appeasement politics. I thank all the brothers and sisters of the state from the core of my heart for re-choosing development, progress and good governance. I especially thank the youth and women who formed the NDA government with absolute majority by choosing security and a bright future in Bihar.”Another senior party leader and Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the victory in Bihar is a win of the NDA’s commitment to good governance and development and expressed his gratitude to the people of the state.Describing the BJP’s victory as the reimposition of faith in the Modi government’s pro-poor policies, the party president J P Nadda said the entire nation has reposed its trust in the welfare work done by the Centre, as shown by results of the Bihar assembly elections and of by-elections in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Manipur and Telangana.“In the difficult times of the Covid-19 epidemic, when the country was struggling with crisis and challenges, Modi government took all possible steps to help the poor and the needy and provided them free ration and financial assistance as well. It was a unique example of serving the humanity,” JP Nadda said in a series of tweets.Talking about Bihar assembly elections, Nadda said people of Bihar have rejected dynasty, corruption, divisive politics while expressing faith in Prime Minister Modi’s leadership and in the work done by the state’s NDA government led by Nitish Kumar.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/pm-modi-bihar-taught-the-world-first-lesson-of-democracy/story-jzhkn0PtZ1QRRkRJ0bT1KP.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Five JD(U) ministers lose assembly elections||On Tuesday, even as the NDA inched closer to magic figure of 122 to retain power, it was clear that this would be the only constant in the relationship. For, with the BJP winning 58 seats and leading in 15, and the JD(U) 33 and 10, respectively, the traditional roles have changed and the latter has now become the junior partner. This was expected, and the BJP, ahead of the polls, said that Nitish Kumar would be the chief minister, even if the JD(U) won fewer seats than it. On Tuesday, the party repeated this. “There is no question of going back on our promise. An announcement to this effect was made by our former national president Amit Shah. We stand by our commitment,” said BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal. The JD (U) has a strength of 71 MLAs in the outgoing assembly. It has seen as many as five ministers lose, as the LJP played spoiler. Still, experts believe the loss of the JD (U)will have far-reaching consequences. “It will be reduced to smaller party after carrying the tag of big brother over a period of time,” said former director of A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, D M Diwakar. “The alliance may be affected. And there is a possibility that Nitish Kumar might get a role in centre,” he added, putting forth a theory that has been doing the rounds in some corners of Patna in recent days. A senior JD (U) functionary added: “The party lost due to 15-years of anti-incumbency. Tejashwi (Yadav of the RJD) was taken light-heartedly and even our senior leaders mocked him. Some loose comments were made.” Kumar and the JD (U) have been criticised for their handling of the migrant issue, especially by the LJP. Still, it is creditable that the party and Kumar have returned, said another analyst. “The last time in 2015, the JD (U) was with a different alliance and its vote bank was different. I think the party has done reasonably well though its seat share may have come down given the fact that chief minister Nitish Kumar, who is seeking re-lection for the fourth successive term, faces anti-incumbency. People’s ire is directed against him because some of his policies may not have gone down well,” said Prof Arvind Aditya Raj of the political science department of the College of Commerce, Arts and Science in Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-five-jd-u-ministers-lose-assembly-elections/story-zdeUO53X0BOQTbHY2nHc7I.html
11-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: How women steered NDA towards majority||Women seem to have played a pivotal role in ensuring the victory of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar assembly elections. An HT analysis shows that the NDA has a decisive edge over the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) in assembly constituencies (ACs) where women voters outnumbered men.Click here for complete Bihar election coverageData from the Election Commission of India shows that women do not outnumber men among registered electors in any of Bihar’s 243 ACs. But there are 118 ACs where the number of women voters this year was higher than men voters. This is because voter turnout was higher among women. HT has calculated this from the number of electors and voter turnout figures, both of which are available by gender.There is a massive lead of 19 percentage points in the NDA’s strike rate (seats won as a proportion of those contested) in ACs where actual women voters outnumbered actual men voters. In fact, the higher the share of women voters in a constituency, the better is the NDA’s performance. This is evident in a quintile (bottom 20% to top 20%) distribution of all ACs by the share of actual women voters.The NDA won 62% of the seats in the highest quintile compared to just 24% seats in the lowest quintile. There is a 6 percentage point gap in vote share between these two extreme groups of constituencies. (See Chart 1)The advantage or lack of it among women voters is consistent for parties in either the NDA or the MGB, which suggests that they voted for government formation rather than local factors. Nitish Kumar’s government in Bihar has tried to consolidate women voters by schemes such as distribution of bicycles for girl students and announcing prohibition in 2016. (See Chart 2)Women in Bihar have a higher share among voters, compared to their share in the population and registered voters. Women comprised 47.9% of Bihar’s population,according to the Census 2011, and 47.4% of the registered electors, but approximately 49.6% of the people who voted this year. Turnout by women has been higher than that of men in Bihar in the last three assembly elections.

11-11-2020||City||Four Haryana thermal plants get 2-year extension to comply with emission limits||Almost six months after the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) imposed environmental compensation on four thermal power plants of Haryana for non-compliance with norms, the pollution control body has granted extension to these plants to comply with emission limits. As per the copy of the orders accessed by Hindustan Times, National Thermal Power Corporation’s Indira Gandhi Thermal Power Plant in Jhajjar, Haryana Power Generation Corporation’s Deen Bandhu Chhotu Ram Thermal Power Station in Yamunanagar, Rajiv Gandhi Thermal Power Project in Hisar and Panipat Thermal Power Station have been under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act given extension up to December 31, 2022. The orders mentioned that the compliance with the directions will be reviewed by CPCB periodically and if required, further directions will also be issued which may include closure of the erring units.It is worth mentioning here that in May this year, CPCB had imposed environmental compensation of ₹18 lakh per month per non-compliant unit of the four thermal power plants in the state for not following emission norms. As per the orders, the penalties levied under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act had come into force from January 1 and plants had to pay ₹7.2 crore till June 5. According to the orders, these power plants, which were to be retrofitted with modern flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) units that cut emissions of sulfur dioxide, did not comply with the norms.The penalties were imposed following a study by IIT Kanpur on air pollution and greenhouse gases in Delhi in January 2016, which had indicated that 13 thermal power plants with the capacity of over 11,000 MW in the 300-km radius of Delhi were expected to contribute to secondary particulate pollutants, and considering the impact of coal-based power plants on ambient air quality in Delhi-NCR, the timelines given by the ministry of power for thermal plants within the specific limits were revised on December 31, 2019.Haryana State Pollution Control Board member secretary S Narayanan said that the state pollution control board is following up the issue with the power plants and Haryana Power Generation Corporation for the necessary compliance with norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-haryana-thermal-plants-get-2-year-extension-to-comply-with-emission-limits/story-PVtgDtTu4d5giKjpgI6ilL.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||Bihar elections: NCP, Shiv Sena laud RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday praised Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav for giving a tough fight to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by incumbent chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Bihar elections. “I believe the election was between NDA and Tejashwi... On one side, there’s a young, inexperienced person like Tejashwi and on the other, a gentleman [Narenda Modi] who was the CM of Gujarat for so many years and is also the Prime Minister of the country for the second term with an incumbent CM Nitish Kumar, who has been heading the state for so many terms. Irrespective of all that, whatever seats he [Yadav] has got, it’s a good achievement. I am sure this will be an inspiration for younger generations,” the NCP chief said, reacting to the results of the Bihar Assembly elections. Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut also lauded Yadav’s performance in the polls and said that though he may not emerge as the winner, he is the ‘Man of the Match” in the Bihar election as the 31-year-old put up a “brave fight” against the ruling party. “Definitely the trends favour NDA. BJP is now at the top and Nitish babu [Kumar] is on the third spot. But the Man of the Match is Tejashwi Yadav. Sometimes, a member of the losing team is awarded Man of the Match award for the brave fight he puts up. In the entire Bihar election, Tejashwi has shone alone. He fought alone against the ruling party without any major allies and no support from the family,” Raut told media persons in Mumbai. The Sena parliamentarian added that Tejashwi controlled the campaign narrative for the Bihar polls and took it from frivolous issues to unemployment. “He put up a fight against the prime minister and the Union cabinet. I think the country and the state have got a leader who can be banked upon,” Raut said. Commenting on the performance of its ally, Raut said, “If the Congress had performed better, then Tejashwi Yadav would have been the frontrunner in the race to the CM’s post.” The Sena leader added that the JD(U)’s performance needs introspection. “If a three-term CM is on the third spot, then it is definitely a matter of introspection. Nitish Kumar and NDA should introspect. It also means that the government had failed completely,” Raut remarked. With BJP expected to be the single largest party in Bihar with its pre-poll ally JD(U) on the third spot, Raut said that BJP will not go back on its words to make Nitish Kumar the CM again. Referring to the fallout between the BJP and Sena after last year’s Maharashtra Assembly elections, Raut said, “All the BJP leaders are still saying that Nitish Kumar will be the CM. For this Nitish Kumar has to thank Shiv Sena. After our counterattack on BJP following what they tried to do with us, they will not behave in that manner again. Nitish Kumar will and should be the CM.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bihar-elections-ncp-shiv-sena-laud-rjd-s-tejashwi-yadav/story-mdcLVVwTgq3pQNgMwdQA2H.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai wakes up to the coldest morning of season after mercury dips to 19 degrees Celsius||The city recorded its lowest minimum temperature of the season so far on Tuesday. The Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, recorded the minimum temperature at 19.2 degrees Celsius, over 3 degrees Celsius below normal. The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 22.5 degrees Celsius – a degree Celsius below normal. Prior to Tuesday, Mumbai had recorded 19.7 degrees Celsius on November 7, but thereafter the minimum temperature had been fluctuating. It increased to 25 degrees Celsius on November 8 and then dropped back to 23 degrees Celsius over the same weekend. The weather bureau on Sunday had predicted a drop in temperatures from Tuesday onwards. “Cool winds from easterly to northeasterly direction from Monday late at night and early Tuesday morning allowed the night temperature to dip. However, this fall is short-lived as the wind pattern is likely to change again from Thursday,” KS Hosalikar, deputy director general, western region, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. While the minimum temperature has remained low, the maximum temperature was a degree Celsius above normal in the suburbs, showing high variability through the day. Tuesday’s day temperature at Santacruz was 34.5 degrees Celsius as compared to 34.7 degrees Celsius on Monday. However, the day temperature at south Mumbai was below the normal mark at 32.5 degrees Celsius. “This is happening owing to the late setting in of sea breeze and increase in heat radiation through the day due to clear skies,” said an IMD official. Meanwhile, most parts of interior Maharashtra witnessed cold conditions over the past two days with the lowest minimum temperature recorded at Chandrapur (9 degrees Celsius), followed by Parbhani (10.1 degrees Celsius). Pune recorded 11.3 degrees Celsius, while Nashik recorded 11.8 degrees Celsius. The IMD has predicted clear conditions for Wednesday, with the maximum temperature to rise to 36 degrees Celsius and minimum temperature to be 21 degrees Celsius. Air quality fluctuates between moderate-poor categories, 3 areas record very poor air The drop in temperature did not affect the city’s air quality on Tuesday morning, as the pollutant measuring indicator – air quality index (AQI) – for PM2.5 pollutant was recorded at 142 (moderate), according to the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), even though a thin layer of haze was witnessed. By Tuesday afternoon, the AQI worsened to 221 (poor) but by evening, as the sea breeze set in, it fell to 183 (moderate). Chembur had the worst air quality in the city at 322 (very poor), followed by Malad at 309 (very poor) and Mazagaon 305 (very poor). While all other locations in Mumbai recorded ‘moderate’ air quality, Worli had the cleanest air on Tuesday at 86 (satisfactory). SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. An AQI of 166 (moderate) has been predicted for Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-wakes-up-to-the-coldest-morning-of-season-after-mercury-dips-to-19-degrees-celsius/story-8E6Zs14OIipPFsn4bPgidL.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||Owners of Mumbai’s Kamala Mills compound discharged in 2017 fire case; other accused to face trial||The sessions court on Tuesday discharged Ramesh Gowani and Ravi Bhandari – the two owners of the Kamala Mills compound – booked in connection with the 2017 inferno which broke out in a restaurant located inside the compound. The court however, refused to discharge the owners of the restaurant, some civic body officials and other accused. Special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty said that the detailed order is yet to come and the prosecution would take further action only after going through it. Gowani and Bhandari had claimed that they cannot be booked for the incident as they had no connection with it. On December 29, 2017 around 12.30am, a fire broke in 1Above and Mojo’s Bistro restaurants, which killed 14 guests and injured several others. The investigation had claimed that the blaze broke out first at 1Above restaurant owing to hookah embers, and later spread to Mojo’s Bistro. The NM Joshi Police had booked 14 accused, including the owners of the restaurants and their employees, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials and the owners of Kamala Mills compound. Meanwhile, the court rejected the plea for discharge of the other accused, who include the owners of 1Above restaurant, Kripesh Mansukh Sanghavi and Jigar Mansukh Sanghavi: two managers of 1Above, Lisbon Lopes and Kevin Bawa; the owner of Mojo’s Bistro pub, Yug Ravindrapal Singh Tuli; fire officer Rajendra Baban Patil; BMC’s G South ward sub-engineer Dinesh Yashwant Mahale; assistant divisional fire officer (Worli division) Sandeep Shivaji Shinde and hotelier Vishal Kariya. All the accused had been booked under various charges, including culpable homicide not amounting to murder. They had claimed that the charge of culpable homicide is not applicable to the case as the accused had no intention to cause death. However, the prosecution had contended that all the accused had failed to abide by the law and there were several irregularities in the fire safety system at the restaurants, which ultimately resulted in the death of innocents. The court has ordered that the accused would face trial for the charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder along with the other charges filed against them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/owners-of-mumbai-s-kamala-mills-compound-discharged-in-2017-fire-case-other-accused-to-face-trial/story-6Nj5vbzOkx7PHsXtsZ6GVL.html
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||Baroda bypoll: Downer for ruling combine, shot in the arm for Hooda||The outcome of the Baroda assembly bypoll in Haryana may not influence the political arithmetic or upset the ruling coalition’s apple cart, which had last month completed its first year in power, but the emphatic Congress victory over the ruling BJP-JJP alliance is surely an indication of the people’s sentiment especially, the farming community and the Jats. For the sake of statistics, the Congress on Tuesday retained its tally of 31 in the 90-member assembly following the bypoll win. The victory margin of 10,566 votes is more than impressive, considering the fact that the opposition party was pitted against the ruling coalition having four years of its term left. The win has also come as a shot in the arm for Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader and former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Baroda assembly constituency is known as Hooda’s backyard. The segment in Sonepat district lies adjacent to Hooda’s home constituency Garhi Sampla Kiloi in Rohtak. The bypoll victory has underlined Hooda’s sway in the Deswali belt, particularly among the Jats who have a brute 50% majority in this constituency. In fact, the Congress candidate, Indu Raj Narwal, secured over 49% of the votes polled, about 15% more than what Sri Krishan Hooda, the deceased MLA, had polled in 2019 assembly elections. The bypoll win is also expected to give impetus to the “anti-farm laws” protest by farmers and their unions. Analysts say the enactment of three farm laws by the BJP-led NDA at the Centre has influenced the complexion of this contest in a constituency which is agrarian in nature. A bitter pill for Khattar, Dushyant The loss has come as a downer not only for chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, but also his ally and deputy Dushyant Chautala, a Jat leader. Wary of the vociferous protests by the farmers, including the dominant Jats in Baroda constituency over the enactment of three farm laws, both Khattar and Dushyant chose to stay away from the poll campaign for a major part of the electioneering. The duo though stepped in the poll arena in the last couple of days of the campaign, their efforts lacked vigour. The BJP’s candidate, Yogeshwar Dutt, who suffered second consecutive loss from Baroda, though increased his vote share by about 10% in the bypoll, it was not enough. The last time he contested, Dutt had lost by about 4,800 votes. ‘BJP graph on a decline since 2019 assembly polls’Prof Ashutosh Kumar of political science department at Panjab University, Chandigarh, said the bypoll result indicated that the graph of the BJP is clearly on a decline. “Their downslide in Haryana had started in 2019 assembly polls when the BJP fell short of a simple majority. It won just 40 seats in the 90-member assembly. It was way below the leads they got in 79 assembly segments in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Also, the BJP got only 45 lakh votes in the assembly polls as compared to 73 lakh in Lok Sabha election held a few months ago in 2019,” he added. Prof Kumar further said the recently enacted three farm laws by central government which were vehemently opposed by the farming community was a big factor behind BJP’s humiliating defeat in the bypoll. “If elections were to be held in Haryana and Punjab today, the Congress will register easy wins,” he said. Chautala’s INLD puts up a poor show Om Prakash Chautala’s Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) performed poorly in the bypoll, securing just about 5,000 votes to finish a poor fourth behind Raj Kumar Saini of the Loktantra Suraksha Party. The INLD candidate, Joginder Singh Malik, got 4.07% votes while Saini polled 4.56%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/baroda-bypoll-downer-for-ruling-combine-shot-in-the-arm-for-hooda/story-XB1Uy8EcgkCjizlx0irtDI.html
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||Dispute over Covid duties: Punjab and Haryana HC for transfer of two junior doctors||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said that the two doctors who had entered into a fight with a senior medical officer over Covid-19 duties in April should also be transferred out of their present postings.The high court was hearing a plea from Dr Aradhana, the senior medical officer who was transferred after the fight with two of her subordinates. She had challenged her transfer order stating that she was only trying to enforce what had been ordered by the higher authorities in view of the outbreak, asking junior doctors Dr Meenal and Dr Sarita to carry out their duties, who were not cooperating.Dr Aradhana told the court that “Dr Meenal accompanied by Dr Sarita entered my room and harassed me. I was being told things like “app hamari COVID duty lgate raho aur hum katvate rahenge”, “register apni custody me kitne din chupakar rakhoge”. Followed by this, they misbehaved and attempted physical assault by trying to push me. They were very aggressive and could have done significant harm; my safety was compromised.”The incident was brought to the knowledge of authorities on April 17 and instead of taking action against the junior doctors, she was transferred out of her present posting, she said.The bench of justice Mahabir Singh Sindhu while seeking a response by November 18 said that it would be appreciated if these two doctors were also transferred from their present place of posting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dispute-over-covid-duties-punjab-and-haryana-hc-for-transfer-of-two-junior-doctors/story-ZqD2v4UvcF5IVQEAN2hrBN.html
11-11-2020||City||Covid-19 positive pregnant woman gives birth prematurely at Mira Road hospital, ; mother and baby discharged||A 35-year-old woman from Mira Road beat Covid-19 and went on to successfully deliver her baby in the 7th month of her pregnancy. Both the mother and baby were discharged after the woman spent 60 days in the hospital, including 21 days in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 14 days on the ventilator.The patient was referred to Wockhardt Hospital, Mira Road, after she complained of fever, breathless and desaturation (low blood oxygen concentration), said Dr Bipin Jibkhate, a senior critical care consultant at the hospital. “The patient was taken to a private practitioner, and after testing positive for Covid-19, she was shifted to our hospital. There were multiple challenges in managing the pregnant patient in the ICU as her immunity was low. Her physiological needs were different from normal women, and pregnant women have a higher tendency of clotting, high abdominal pressure, low carbon dioxide levels and higher tendency to vomit, said the medico.In such situations, if the oxygen level is not maintained, the options are limited, Dr Jibkhate explaining, adding that they had to put the patient on the ventilator. “Fortunately, she responded to the treatment, and her ventilator requirement went down. However, even after seven days, she required a significant amount of ventilator use, and so we removed the tube from her mouth and put it through her throat – a procedure called as tracheostomy,” he said.In the meanwhile, the woman’s second Covid-19 test came negative. She was shifted to a non-Covid ICU and slowly taken off the ventilator.“Because of the stress of the disease and ICU stay, the patient went into labour prematurely and delivered a baby boy,” said Dr Mangala Patil, obstetrician, Wockhardt Hospital.According to Dr Samir Shaikh, consultant neonatologist, the baby weighed only 1,560 gram and was shifted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

11-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai reports lowest Covid-19 case spike since May 12; Maharashtra tally 1,726,926||Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded 3,791 Covid-19 cases, second day of fewer than 4,000, pushing the count to 1,726,926. The day’s caseload included Mumbai’s smallest spike in the past six months — 535 infections. Before this, the smallest spike was 426 on May 12.It was the 24th consecutive day daily cases recorded in the state were fewer than 10,000. Active cases have maintained the downward trend and reached 92,461, which meant 5.35% of the total patients were taking treatment at various hospitals and Covid Care Centres in the state presently.The state’s Covid-19 toll reached 45,435 as 46 casualties were reported. Of the total deaths, 37 were from the past 48 hours and five were from last week. The remaining four deaths were from the period before last week, health officials said.Meanwhile, the total number of cases in Mumbai has reached 265,679, of which active cases were 16,373. There were 19 deaths reported and the total toll in the city has reached 10,484. An initial hot spot for Covid-19, Dharavi has also witnessed a downward trend in November with just a case being reported. The total cases in Dharavi reached 3,606. City’s recovery rate is at 90% and the doubling rate of cases is 233 days.Malegaon city in Nashik, which was also once a prime Covid-19 hotspot, recorded zero cases and no deaths on Tuesday. Total cases and deaths recorded in the city till date were 4,219 and 152 respectively.The graph of fresh infections is gradually going down in the past 45 days. The downward trend in cases that started from the last week of September has continued even in the second week of November. On September 26, the state reported 20,419 cases and since then, it is on a decline. Since the past two consecutive days, fresh infections have not crossed the 4,000-mark. On November 9, cases recorded were 3,277 cases.However, the danger is yet over as there are concerns over a rise in cases by the end of this month.“This is the reason that the temporary facilities developed to fight against Covid-19 have been continued, despite beds at Covid care facilities and field hospitals being vacant with the number of active cases drastically reducing,” said a senior official from the state health department.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said that the next 20 days were crucial and people will have to maintain social distancing, avoid crowding and wear masks to prevent another surge in Covid-19 cases in the state. “Even if the numbers are coming in control, Diwali and the next 15 days after Diwali are the big test... European countries have gone on lockdown again.… if we have to go into a lockdown again, it will be very tough. I am seeing many people are not wearing masks, it will not be tolerated. Those who do not wear masks will be fined. An estimation said a patient without a mask could infect up to 400 people,” he said.Solapur district contributed the second-highest infections in the daily caseload as it recorded 248 cases, taking its tally to 35,227.Nagpur city recorded 215 cases, third-highest number of cases, pushing its count to 82,133.With decline in fresh cases, the number of deaths also reduced. However, the case fatality rate (CFR) is not coming down. It has also maintained second position after Punjab in the country with 2.63%. The CFR of Punjab was 3.14% (with 4,338 deaths) till Monday, according to the information shared by the state medical education department.The state has completed 9,536,182 tests with 53,242 conducted on Tuesday. The positivity rate for the day dropped to 7.12% against the overall positivity rate of the state that stood at 18.11%.The number of recovered patients reached 1,588,091 with 10,769 recorded in the past 24 hours.

11-11-2020||Election:||BJP gives Bihar to Nitish Kumar||The Nitish Kumar-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was set to return to power in Bihar, scraping past the majority mark with 124 seats in the state assembly, but with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerging as the senior partner in the alliance for the first time with 73 seats, in a mandate that appeared to mark both continuity and change. The closely fought election — results were declared late on Tuesday night — saw the Tejashwi Yadav-led Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) run an energetic campaign and emerge as the single largest party with 76 seats in the 243-member assembly. But its wider alliance, the Mahagatbandhan (MGB), failed to become the largest pre-poll formation, with the Congress winning only 19 of the 70 seats it contested, though the Left forces put up their best performance in the state in the last two-and-a-half decades, with 16 seats. In all, the alliance won 111 seats. All numbers are wins plus leads at 11:45pm Tuesday. by which time, according to the Election Commision’s website. 99.5% of the votes had been counted.Also read: Bihar show strengthens BJP’s national standingPrime Minister Narendra Modi, whose rallies played a part in ensuring the NDA returned to power in the state, tweeted: “Voters in Bihar have made it clear that development is their only aspiration and priority... People’s blessings to NDA’s good governance even after 15 years of rule show what Bihar’s dreams and expectations are. The youth of the state have made it clear that the new decade will be of Bihar and for a self-reliant Bihar.”He added in another tweet: “...from farmers to traders, from businessmen to shopkeepers, every section has trusted NDA’s sabka vikas, sabka vishwas. I assure each person that we will continue to work towards development of the state.” The election also witnessed a key role being played by forces outside the framework of the two alliances, with the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) winning just one seat but hurting the Janata Dal (United)’s prospects in 26, and the Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) winning five seats to affect the MGB’s prospects in the Seemanchal region.The fierce nature of the election, and the consolidation of support behind the major forces in the state, was reflected more sharply in the vote share, with the MGB winning around 8,000 votes more than the NDA (as of 11:45 pm) . Political leaders offered their interpretation of the result, with the BJP claiming this was a vote in favour of the double engine model — with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Centre and chief minister Nitish Kumar in the state — while the RJD said there were attempts to change the “people’s mandate”. The JD(U) said the party’s performance may have been affected due to anti-incumbency while the Congress claimed it did a creditable job given it was contesting on tough seats. “It was a bad deal for us. Our negotiators should not have accepted the choice of seats. Out of the 70 seats given to us, 30-35 were extremely tough. These were the seats where we had no base and even the RJD was weak,” said senior Congress leader Kishore Kumar Jha. Experts, however, suggested that the outcome reflected the popularity of PM Modi, the consolidation of non-Yadav castes behind the NDA as Yadav-Muslim consolidation behind the RJD became apparent with Tejashwi Yadav’s rallies, and the memory of the misgovernance of the Lalu Prasad years overwhelming the more recent post-lockdown distress. Also read | Bihar Assembly Election 2020: NDA’s seat share rose with every phaseAt the same time, the RJD’s performance was seen as marking the arrival of Yadav as a key Opposition figure, growing out of the shadow of his father even if he could not translate the energy of his campaign into enough seats for a victory, but only just. The results of the first state-level election held in the middle of the pandemic took longer than usual to tabulate, with the day witnessing constant ups and downs in the fortunes of political parties in the fray — the MGB led when early leads emerged on Tuesday only to see the NDA edge past it, a trend that stayed till the end though it became close on several occasions. The MGB alleged irregularities in the last rounds of counting in seats with tight margins -- a charge that the poll panel has denied.The big takeaway from the election, however, is the return of Nitish Kumar as chief minister for a fourth term. His close aide and minister in the Bihar government, Sanjay Jha, said, “We were shocked at the media narrative against Nitish Kumar in the run up to the election. The results show that the ground reality was different. The CM’s past record of governance, his tremendous appeal among women voters, and the resilience of our social coalition has proved many people wrong.”While Kumar has indeed returned after what appeared to be deep anti-incumbency, his seats have reduced from 71 in 2015 to 43 in 2020. The JD(U)’s strike rate (seats won in proportion to the seats contested) was just over 35% while the BJP’s strike rate was close to 70%. He will, thus, have to reconcile with the BJP as a senior partner, and suspicions that the BJP did not do enough to stop the LJP continue to mark the dynamic between the two leading NDA partners. A second JD(U) leader, familiar with the thinking in the party, said, “The BJP unnecessarily created confusion initially. If the LJP was within the NDA, or if the BJP had spoken more strongly against LJP, the NDA would have crossed 160 seats.” But this, he insisted, will not impair future ties. “Both parties are clear that the mandate is for a Nitish Kumar-led NDA government.”For its part, the BJP is pleased at both emerging as the single largest party in the state for the first time in political history and returning to power. A top leader involved in the campaign said, “You should take into account the fact that there was anti-incumbency. Covid-19 has caused difficulties for people. But the results have shown that there is complete support for PM Modi and recognition that BJP is needed for the state’s development.” When asked if they would stick to supporting Kumar, despite his depleted numbers, the BJP leader said there was no doubt about that, and that BJP would fulfil its promise and “coalition dharma”.For the RJD, the campaign reflected a big comeback after the 2019 Lok Sabha election rout, when it failed to win a single seat of the 40 in the state. But a top RJD leader claimed that the party had begun working quietly soon after — building booth committees on the ground on the same lines as the BJP, launching an outreach campaign on employment early in the year that got interrupted by the pandemic, providing support to migrant workers seeking to return home during the lockdown, and then launching a campaign that focused on key economic and livelihood themes with Tejashwi Yadav leading the charge.But a second leader of the Opposition alliance acknowledged that the campaign had errors. “Our support base became too vocal and aggressive. As news channels began talking about RJD’s return, the other social groups — who still resent Lalu Prasad’s rule — began to get worried. They were silent but turned out in substantial numbers to vote for NDA.” The second reason for the upset — since the MGB was expecting a majority on its own — was the Congress’s performance, which got 19 seats with a strike rate of just over 25%. In comparison, the RJD’s strike rate was over 50%.Experts believe the result is a boost to the BJP. Milan Vaishnav of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said, “The Bihar result — read with the bypoll outcomes — is positive affirmation for ‘brand BJP’. Despite a prolonged economic slowdown, ongoing pandemic and the migrant crisis, Modi’s image remains undeniably strong. The voters have directed the brunt of their anger at the BJP’s coalition ally JD(U) and chief minister Nitish Kumar. Within the NDA, this victory puts the BJP in the driver’s seat in Bihar.” Rahul Verma of the Centre for Policy Research agreed said that the outcome of the election would bring relief to the BJP leadership since there were questions after 2019 over its political prospects in the wake of setbacks in state polls. “The BJP has consolidated further and is another pole of Bihar politics now. The outcome also shows that elections are won and lost during the campaign. A deeper analysis of data will reveal the X factor, but it seems MGB got complacent, while the NDA, like seasoned players, came from behind and clinched the game.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bjp-gives-bihar-to-nitish/story-bBGU4gvmhK1KXpEWFIHP6L.html

11-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: MC House approve 60% hike in water-sewer user charges||Bad news for residents as the Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) has passed a resolution for a hike of around 60% in water-sewer user charges in the city. The decision was taken during the General House meeting held at the Rose Garden on Tuesday afternoon. The House has also revoked the exemption on water-sewer user charges being given to houses on area up to 125 square yards. Now, the exemption will be available only for single-storey houses, on area up to 50 square yards.Until now, the MC had been charging users according to the fixed slab rates. The system will continue until the water-metering system is introduced in the city. Once metering is introduced, residents will be paying a two-part tariff, including fixed charges and consumptions charges.The newly passed resolution also allows for a 3% annual hike in slab rates, with the possibility of further revision once 24/7 water supply starts in the city. Residents will also have to install water meters within the timeframe given by the MC, failing which they will be penalised.Speaking on the hike, mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “It was necessary to increase the tariff as it is one of the conditions imposed by the World Bank before funding the 24/7 surface water supply project for the city. The resolutions approved by the House will be forwarded to the local bodies department for final approval.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) councillors, including Sunita Rani, opposed the hike, stating that the residents are already reeling under economic hardships due to the ongoing pandemic.No zero-hour allowed, councillors irked While the meeting lasted for over two hours, the agendas were approved in about half an hour. Even some Congress councillors, including Pallavi Vinayak, were unable to raise the issues of their wards. Only two councillors from each party were allowed to speak during the meeting. Mayor Sandhu said that zero hour could not be allowed as they had to wind up the meeting quickly due to Covid-19 restrictions. Meanwhile, two leaders, including Anil Malhotra and Balwinder Shanky, were shown the way out of the meeting as they were participating in place of their councillor wives. Congress councillors lock horns over contentious resolution; LIP stages protest High drama was witnessed over the formation of a committee to take a decision on the allotment of 1,600 yards of land reserved for a park in Sarabha Nagar area to a person, in exchange for a land in the same area.Congress councillors Mamta Ashu and Amrit Varsha Rampal came into loggerheads over the issue as Rampal stood against the decision to form a committee while Ashu was in favour of it. Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) councillors, led by Sawarndep Chahal, also opposed the resolution, stating that this would encourage illegal encroachments. Chahal sat in protest over the issue during the meeting itself. Private company for collection of charges:With MC officials failing to achieve the recovery targets in the past, the House has also given a nod for appointing a private company for recovery of water-sewer charges, property tax etc. The company will also check illegal water-sewer connections in the city. As per information, MC has failed to recover over 200 crore from the residents.User charges for firms using plastic packagingThe fund-starved MC has decided to impose user charges on multinational and home delivery companies, including Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Zomato and Swiggy, and liqour vendors for using plastic packaging to deliver their products as the plastic is ultimately disposed off by the civic body.Reconstruction of MC Zone A building and multi-storey parking:The MC has also approved a resolution for reconstruction of MC Zone A office and a multi-storey parking on 3.5 acres in the old city market area. The MC will invite proposals from different companies willing to take up the project. Bring back JEs, SDOs of O&M cellDifferent councillors, including leader of Opposition Harbhajan Singh Dang, Jaspal Giaspura, Rakesh Prashar among others demanded that the MC should bring back outsourced JEs and SDOs of O&M Cell as the branch is facing acute shortage of staff. For the last three months, the MC has been mulling on whether to extend their contract or not. Illegal connections choking sewer lines With residents at different parts of the city raising hue and cry over choked sewer lines, the councillors slammed the MC for its failure to take action against illegal colonies and their sewer connections, which have been attached to the MC sewer lines especially in outer wards of the city. The matter was raised by SAD councillor Jaspal Giaspura who accused the MC building branch officials of being hand-in-glove with inhabitants of illegal colonies. Congress councillor Pal Singh Grewal even named a former SAD minister who got the sewer connections of colonies, falling under GLADA, attached with the MC sewer lines. The councillors said that this is increasing pressure on MC sewer lines and MC should collect sharing charges from GLADA. Non-functional streetlightsLIP councillor Swarandeep Singh Chahal raised the issue of non-functional streetlights in various parts of the city. Meanwhile, the House approved a resolution to get over 15, 000 LED streetlights installed at the missing points.Publishers, printers to face heat over illegal hoardingsWith complaints against illegal hoardings continuing to pour in, the MC has decided to go tough on printers and publishers of illegal hoardings. While the printers and publishers will have to pay a penalty up to ₹50, 000, MC superintendents will be charged ₹5, 000 a day if they fail to remove the illegal hoardings in their jurisdiction within 24 hours.AGENDAS APPROVEDThe MC approved 21 out of the total 31 agendas taken up during the meeting. These include: - Project to install biogas plant at Bhattian sewer treatment plant- Providing 2 acres for transforming a slaughterhouse into an export-oriented unit- Waiving off water bills for LIG flats (81 yards) situated in Urban estate, Phase-2, Dugri.- Waiving off water-sewer charges for the dyeing industry for 70 days of lockdown. - Identification of slum area under Punjab slum dwellers (proprietary rights act) 2020- Buddha Nullah rejuvenation project- Filling up of over 100 vacant MC posts on outsourcing basis- Punjab municipal services improvement project, including surface water supply project||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-house-approve-60-hike-in-water-sewer-user-charges/story-9KG7s2zdgWNVd40qHMzZeK.html

11-11-2020||City||Haryana Democratic Front’s first foundation day a show of opposition strength in Ambala||The first foundation day of the Haryana Democratic Front (HDF) turned into a show of strength as several leaders from various opposition parties, except Congress, gathered in Ambala City’s Panchayat Bhawan on Tuesday on the occasion.The party recently announced its mayoral candidate, Amisha Chawla, former councillor and wife of Dilip Chawla Bittu and former media coordinator of former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The foundation day celebrations were made grand to officially launch the party’s campaign for the upcoming municipal corporation (MC) polls in Ambala City.Leaders from Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU-Charuni) and stalwarts from various caste-based and religious groups, who had supported HDF’s founding leaders Nirmal Singh and Chitra Sarwara in Ambala City and Ambala Cantonment during the 2019 assembly elections, were present at the event.Both the leaders were denied tickets by Congress, who then decided to contest as independents, securing the runner-up position on their respective seats.Speaking at the occasion, HDF founder and president Nirmal Singh called for support to make separate political issues and development agenda for North Haryana. “North Haryana, with 27 MLAs, has been neglected for five decades. There has been considerable discrimination in terms of jobs as well as development. Even after 54 years, no leader of North Haryana could sit on the CM’s chair,” he said.North Haryana’s ‘own leader’Nirmal has been trying to project himself as North Haryana’s “own leader”, in contrast to former CM Hooda, whom he was close to before the 2019 assembly polls.He said that the HDF will make a strong entry in the elections of the municipal council, zilla parishad and MC, and thereafter in the assembly and Lok Sabha elections as well.The absence of senior party leader Himmat Singh at the event, however, raised several questions. Singh was absent at the presser on Sunday as well, when the party announced its mayoral candidate and gave him important responsibility as the head of a screening committee for those seeking HDF ticket in MC polls.Chitra Sarwara told the Hindustan Times that Himmat Singh was busy and had informed her that he was out of station. Nirmal, on the other hand, denied any knowledge of the matter.Former general secretary of the Youth Congress, Himmat Singh, was also reportedly seeking a Congress ticket from Ambala City in the previous elections, but was denied and later joined Nirmal Singh.HDF also inaugurated its first party office next to the Panchayat Bhawan and announced its official website along with social media handles at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/haryana-democratic-front-s-first-foundation-day-a-show-of-opposition-strength-in-ambala/story-Zg6Gyz72EPTkUIZNgbxn2N.html

The report has been sought by the bench of justice Manjari Nehru Kaul by November 18, on the plea of a high court lawyer, who had sought directions to the UT administration to provide protection of life and liberty to her and her family members. The court was told that she and her family members are facing continuous threats to their life and liberty at the hands of Monty Shah, who is involved in a number of other criminal cases. Despite continuously approaching police, no action has been taken to apprehend the dreaded criminal, she had told court, adding that the harassment started after she filed an FIR against Shah. The FIR was registered on September 30 this year, after the woman had alleged that he posted her daughter’s pictures on social media platforms. Shah is presently on the run after being booked last month for threatening two witnesses in Sonu Shah murder case. He has a reward of ₹50,000 on him, and has been declared proclaimed offender in multiple cases. He has also been convicted and sentenced to three-year jail in one of the cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-seeks-report-on-threat-to-chandigarh-lawyer-from-gangster-monty-shah/story-xO7mAqckn3nhf5vO6po7BO.html

11-11-2020||City||Has Panjab University senate outlived its utility?||The four-year term of Panjab University senate came to an end on October 31 and now the varsity is without the apex governing body, an integral part of its administration since its inception in Lahore in 1882. There is now uncertainty over its future with polls not being notified, a development coinciding with the central government announcing National Education Policy, which envisages the constitution of board of governors in all universities. The University Grants Commission has last month asked all higher educational institutions to initiate governance reforms in the light of the new policy. The PU senate has more than half of its members elected from various constituencies. In recent years, their role in the functioning of the varsity has come under criticism, especially from those heading the institution. Needs some reforms: The notion of senate has not outlived its utility in academic institutions. What has outlived is the role assigned and privileges accorded to senators in PU Act 1947, which is a variant of Indian Universities Act 1904 introduced for the then five varsities of India, which did not have campuses and departments and teachers on their rolls. What is needed is the reform of the construct of the senate and the election of syndicate on behalf of faculties as per stipulations given in the 1904 Act.Arun Kumar Grover, former vice-chancellorVarsity’s nature has changed: It is not only about the senate, but the whole structure of the university. The PU Act needs a review to meet the requirements of the university, which is a different institution from what it was in 1882 or 1947. The nature of the university has changed over time. There are various committee reports, such as Kothari’s, that can be taken into consideration while reviewing the Act. The present senate should be allowed to continue till a new senate is formed.RP Bambah, former vice-chancellorReduce nominated members: The Panjab University senate has always discharged its responsibilities and served its purpose well. PU has been a dynamic example of democratic governance. In the past, many V-Cs have moved along well with the governing body. If at all, it requires any change, my suggestion is that the provision regarding elected members should remain as it is, and only the number of nominated members should be reduced. However, the president and secretary of PU Campus Students Council should be included as ex-officio members.Pawan Kumar Bansal, former senator and Congress leaderPresent system is transparent: PU’s governance system is unique in the country, and members of the governing body represent different sections of the stakeholders. It also has public participation in the form of a graduate constituency. No university has such a healthy democratic system of participation of stakeholders. Universities with executive council, which is similar to board of governors, feel the system is autocratic. The senate system is transparent with every voice being heard. Some reforms may be required and can be done without affecting the senate’s structure and concept.Rajat Sandhir, former PUTA presidentPU governance needs revampBeing a member of the governing body, over the years I have realised that the functioning of the university always gets compared with the functioning of other universities. I believe that the governing system of PU needs a revamp on the pattern of how other universities are run, so that its functioning becomes smooth.Sanjay Tandon, former senator and BJP leaderIt is a democratic body: Democratic bodies never outlive their utility. Several V-Cs in the past too disliked the senate as they could not use it as per their wishes. Agendas and issues discussed in the senate are in public, which reflects its character. The PU senate cannot be thrown away. If at all there is a need, it should be reformed appropriately.Mritunjay Kumar, PUTA presidentMinor changes are fine: I am not in favour of abolishing the senate. It is a very unique and majestic system where we have the representation from all different walks of life. With time, minor changes can be made, but the senate must be in place. Also, the president and secretary of the student council should be its members.DPS Randhawa, syndicate member and former student representativeRepresents all stakeholders: Senators work for the university and make policies for the benefit of both students and faculty members. The senate has representation of all stakeholders. There might be a case where one person misuses the power, but that doesn’t mean we should do away with the senate. We have complete faith in the senate.Chetan Chaudhary, former president, Panjab University Campus Students Council||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/has-panjab-university-senate-outlived-its-utility/story-3b0MWs6DzcjfkUnqym15lJ.html
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||Covid hampers construction of Panjab University’s multi-purpose auditorium||The Covid-19 crisis has hit the construction work of the multi-purpose auditorium on the south campus of Panjab University, which is now expected to get ready by August 2021.The foundation stone of the ₹90 crore project was laid in 2009 by the then prime minister Manmohan Singh and its construction started in 2012. PU’s executive engineer RK Rai said, “Earlier, we were expecting to complete the construction by the end of 2020, but now it will get delayed. The basic structure of the auditorium is ready though.”“The tendering of the construction of phase 3 is expected to be done in coming days,” he added. In the final stage, the work on panelling, stage lighting, flooring, lifts and electrical fittings will be done.Over the years, the construction work of the auditorium has remained tumultuous. In 2018, ₹80-lakh fine was imposed on the contractor of the auditorium for delaying the project.With the seating capacity of over 2,400, it will have a main auditorium with three small seminar halls able to accommodate 130 to 600 people. The total covered area will be 1.4 lakh sq ft and auditorium will include dining area, parking area, approach roads, substation, power backup, AC plant, elevators, firefighting system and CCTV cameras. It will have a VIP workshop, green rooms and rehearsal rooms as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-hampers-construction-of-panjab-university-s-multi-purpose-auditorium/story-ocnYDCBVltHEX3FPDrvb7L.html

11-11-2020||Chandigarh||HC gives CBI 3 months to probe Sector-5 property grab case||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) has asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe within three months an alleged attempt to grab an NRI’s ₹30-crore property in Chandigarh’s upscale Sector 5. In the detailed order released on Tuesday, the bench of justices Daya Chaudhary and Meenakshi Mehta asked CBI to entrust the probe to a superintendent of police rank officer and submit the report by February 26. The case was handed over to CBI on October 30. The case came to light in August, when Padamjit Singh, 84, a former United Nations executive who lives in the US, alleged that a petition filed on July 8 using his name was not, in fact, filed by him. The NRI and his brother’s family have 50% share each in the property — House No 17 in Sector 5 — as later verified by the Chandigarh administration. Padamjit Singh, in a July 8 plea, had claimed that he had not sold his share to a woman named Pritam Kaur, but in an affidavit in August said he had in fact sold it to her and that no one had been authorised by him to file the July 8 plea. When the lawyer appearing in connection with the July 8 petition was questioned, he told court that the matter had been conveyed to him by another lawyer and all requisite permissions to file the plea were obtained through mail. HC in its order said that in the best interests of justice the entire matter regarding the transfer of 50% share of the house in dispute by Padamjit Singh and all the matters incidental thereto, including the said record in respect of the house in dispute having gone missing from the Estate Office, Union Territory, Chandigarh, be referred to the CBI for investigations. “It is further clarified that the CBI shall look into all the angles of the said dispute,” the order stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-gives-cbi-3-months-to-probe-sector-5-property-grab-case/story-Zsynmj57PAEHTmJQKrrvJM.html
11-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to put fee hike orders, financial details of private schools in public domain||In a bid to bring in more transparency, the Delhi government’s directorate of education (DoE) has decided to make public all its orders, accepting or rejecting the proposals of private schools to hike their fees, on its official website, along with financial details -- fee statements, salary expenses, savings, balance sheets and budget, officials said. The DoE informed the Delhi high court about the decision in an affidavit filed on Tuesday, drawing adverse reactions from schools that said they were examining the order and could challenge it. The affidavit was submitted as a response to a petition filed by NGO ‘Justice for All’ in July, seeking directions to the respondent (DoE) to upload fee-hike related orders passed by it, along with related file notings and documents. The court had on July 24 issued a notice to the DoE, asking its stance on the plea. In its affidavit, the DoE said it will make the mentioned information available on its website solely on the basis of provisions of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, as sought in the petition. The answering respondent submits that they would, within a period of four months, be able to upload and/or put on their website all the earlier final sanction orders passed by the DoE qua fees increase proposals filed by recognised private unaided schools in Delhi and will continue to upload them,” the DoE stated in the affidavit.The DoE said it will also put on its website the statement of fees of schools along with annexures as directed in an order by the Supreme Court (Modern School Vs Union of India in 2004), while interpreting Section 17 (3) of Delhi State Education Act, 1973. According to the Supreme Court judgment, every unaided private school has to maintain financial statements consisting of information such as balance sheets, and profit and loss accounts. The schools are required to file a statement of fees every year with the DoE. The statement includes income of the school derived from fees, current operations expenses towards salaries, provision of donations, and savings, among others. “The respondent shall also upload on its website the inspection reports and orders passed to correct the statement of fees submitted by recognised unaided schools of Delhi after finalisation of the same,” the DoE affidavit added.Yogesh Pal Singh, assistant director of education at DoE’s private school branch, said, “there have been several instances in the past when parents complained that private schools increased the fees without prior approval from the DoE or increased the fee more than they were allowed by the directorate.” “With this move, all relevant information will be available on the official website of the DoE. Parents will now be able to check if schools have got permission for fee hike from the DoE or not in a particular financial year,” Singh said.Under the land lease agreements, private schools built on government land in Delhi cannot increase fees without DoE’s approval. Once a proposal is sent, the DoE will audit their finances and allow the schools to increase fees only if they are found to be struggling to manage expenses. Schools operating on private land are not required to take DoE’s approval to increase fees but they have to submit their statement of fees and other financial details with the directorate every year. The petitioner advocate Khagesh Jha said the move will help both parents and teachers. “Many a time, private schools hire teachers on a contractual basis and do not pay them on a par with permanent teachers. Besides, schools won’t be able to fool parents now by demanding hiked fees without permission from the DoE.”SK Bhattacharya, president of the action committee of unaided recognised private schools -- an umbrella body of over 400 schools in Delhi -- said they are examining the legality of the DoE’s decision. “Our legal team will examine what all can be made available in the public domain following provisions of the RTI Act. This kind of order will open a new chapter of unnecessary confrontations between school management and parents.”Advocate Kamal Gupta, who represents private schools in several fee-related matters, said, “We will file our response and challenge the decision. Disclosure of such information is not only prohibited under the RTI Act but also under the Income Tax Act.”The Delhi parents association, meanwhile, welcomed the move. Aprajita Gautam, president of the association, said, “We had been demanding that DoE should make public the list of schools permitted to increase fee. Parents should know how schools are functioning and it will bring transparency in the system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-to-put-fee-hike-orders-financial-details-of-private-schools-in-public-domain/story-VOaYHqxpPgZ5Q40D8magCO.html
11-11-2020||Delhi||500: What a maxed out AQI means||On Tuesday morning, around 9.30 am, at least 18 stations in Delhi reported an air quality index (AQI) of 500, the highest value on the pollution measurement metric. A few private air quality monitoring platforms even reported an AQI of 999, indicating that the pollution measuring values had maxed out.What these numbers don’t indicate is that concentrations of the ultra-fine and hazardous particulate matter (PM 2.5 or PM 10) in Delhi could be much higher than indicated by the maximum index value of 500. However, experts say the index is not underestimating the crisis by capping the value at 500. The PM concentrations may be far higher than the criteria for meeting an AQI of 500. But ‘500’ indicates worst air quality with worst health impacts, the experts said.For example, an AQI of 401 to 500 represents PM 2.5 concentrations of over 250 micrograms per cubic metres and PM 10 concentration of over 430 micrograms per cubic metres on an average.. Since Monday, PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations in Delhi have been over 350 micrograms per cubic metres and 550 micrograms per cubic metres, respectively, but the AQI values have remained within or up to 500.The daily safe limit of PM 2.5 is 60ug/m3 while that of PM 10 is 100 ug/m3.A Central Pollution Control Board scientist explained, “In our estimate, the AQI cannot deteriorate infinitely. Exceeding the 500 scale indicates the situation is terrible. At 500, maximum damage is done so there is no point going beyond that. It’s a situation similar to the US Environment Protection Agency’s (EPA) hazardous level. Its recommended that people remain indoors but indoor air quality is also impacted.” “Not much has been studied as to what happens after we reach an AQI of 500. Health impacts plateau after a certain point. There is not much point in monitoring beyond that,” the scientist added.“An AQI of 500 is exceptionally high. One can always conflate numbers. But it only means that air quality is in a very severe condition,” said Mukesh Sharma, scientist, department of civil engineering, IIT Kanpur, who helped develop the AQI system for India.The United States EPA considers the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern.“The kind of air quality you are breathing depends on the concentrations of pollutants such as PM 2.5 or PM 10. The AQI is basically taking pollution levels from different pollutants and grading them in sub-indices and then calculating an index value based on the pollutant, which is of highest concentration at the time…,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).“The maximum AQI values have been calculated based on the kind of pollution experienced during the London smog of 1952. There is no logic in extending AQI values. We need systemic changes to control air pollution levels in the region,” Roy Chowdhury said.Severe category air could have respiratory effects even on healthy people and serious health impacts on people with lung/heart diseases. The health impacts may be experienced even during light physical activity, according to Central Pollution Control Board’s AQI report released in 2015. RoyChowdhury said all action to curb severe air quality should kick well in advance and not when AQI is 500.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/500-what-a-maxed-out-aqi-means/story-Zg0gUMnSKCZKEAu0iry62J.html
11-11-2020||Delhi||Air emergency in Delhi, no signs of Grap||Delhi equalled its longest spell of severe air on Tuesday -- the sixth consecutive day of the city breathing in an air with most harmful levels of particulate and gaseous pollutants. Before this, the capital had breathed severe air for six consecutive days in 2016. However, there was no sign of emergency measures that used to kick in under the graded response action plan (Grap).Even though India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast said that Delhi might experience a slight respite on Wednesday, but it will be “short-lived”, scientists said.CPCB data showed that the overall AQI of Delhi on Tuesday was 476, in the severe category. On Monday, the AQI of the city was 477.Tuesday began with pollution levels clocking an all time high of the season at 487. By 9am, at least 18 monitoring stations, such as Sirifort, Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Bawana, Mundka, and Alipur recorded the maximum possible AQI recording of 500.According to Central Pollution Control Board’s data, at 7pm on Tuesday, it was 48 hours since the PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) had constantly remained above the 300ug/m3 and 51 hours since the PM10 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers) had been above the 500ug/m3 mark, pushing the city into the severe plus zone.The national ambient air standard for PM2.5 is 60ug/m3 and 100ug/m3 for PM10. Till 12 pm, the Dr Karni Sena Shooting Range station recorded a maximum PM2.5 level of 907ug/m3. In Mundka, these levels were as high as 1156ug/m3.Such long episode of bad air mandates emergency measures under Grap, including odd-even road space rationing scheme, ban on all construction activities, entry of trucks that are not destined for the city, except those carrying essential commodities, etc. However, till late Tuesday, no such steps had been initiated by the agencies. In a letter written to the CPCB late Thursday evening, the newly appointed Commission on Air Quality Management (CAQM) said “till a mechanism is set up by the commission, as an interim measure, the CPCB is entrusted with the task of operationalising and monitoring the Grap measures”.The letter read, “...(the commission) has decided that in view of the deteriorating air quality in NCR region, there is need to invoke the Grap already notified by the central government.”Responding to this direction a CPCB spokesperson said that the monitoring body will issue the required directions on Wednesday looking at the AQI.Experts, however, said that the agencies should have been more proactive and this late direction by the commission was “too little, too late”.“We have reached a point where the measures listed under Grap should automatically be implemented according to the AQI levels, without having to give any directions. I understand that the commission has just been formed and is taking some time to get used to this system, but we already have a mechanism in place, CPCB taskforce is supposed to monitor the air quality levels and recommend action. There is no excuse for not doing that,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment.She said that let alone bringing in additional measures, the authorities seem to be struggling with the enforcement of the basic measures listed under Grap, and Tuesday’s situation was a classic example of that.“Delhi air pollution is in the severe category, the ministry of earth sciences’ prediction suggests that the AQI will remain very high even tomorrow (Wednesday) and reduce marginally on November 12...A lot of challenges for the commission for air quality over NCR set up by the government of India,” said Madhavan Rajeevan, secretary, union ministry of earth sciences.Rajeevan added, “Let us not expect this pollution problem will be resolved quickly. Even China took 15 years to clean up their air. We need consistent and sincere efforts by all stakeholders without any blame game.”Last year, the now dissolved Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority had restricted construction activities and the operation of hot mix plants in the city from October 26, before calling for a complete ban on construction from November 5, as a preventive measure to control the rise of pollution levels. The ban was finally lifted by the Supreme Court in February this year.“We are implementing Grap and will continue to do so. Its implementation does not depend on Epca,” said RP Gupta, secretary, union environment ministry.Scientists at the IMD said that a change in the wind direction and improved wind speed came to the rescue of the city, and after 2pm, the air quality started showing marginal improvement.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said that the wind direction changed to easterly on Tuesday afternoon, which reduced the impact of the high instances of stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana on Delhi’s air.“The wind picked up to reach around 8kmph during the day but there was so much pollution accumulation that its impact was not immediately seen in the air quality. We are hoping that we will be able to get out of the severe plus category through Tuesday night. Easterly winds will continue till Thursday,” Soni said.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that this relief, however, will be short-lived.“From Thursday, the wind direction will change again to north-westerly, which will be conducive to bring the plumes of smoke from Punjab and Haryana. There is also a possibility that Delhi and NCR towns might get light rain around Friday and Saturday, which means that the moisture in the air lead to pollutants latching on closer to the surface, worsening the air quality further,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-emergency-in-delhi-no-signs-of-grap/story-44xfCaYgZCM8qbELH4dUXJ.html
11-11-2020||Delhi||Worst episode of smog negates all good air records in Delhi||More stubble fires than previous years and unsuitable weather conditions have negated the gains made in terms of more good and satisfactory air days as well as the annual average PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations on account of a prolonged lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, experts said. They said consecutive days of severe air quality days or an air emergency episode like the present one wasn’t recorded since 2016. The present smog episode will be the worst since AQI is being measured if severe air quality persists till Wednesday. Experts said the improvement in air quality over Delhi being recorded in the past two years will be negated because of severe air pollution this winter.In 2018 and 2019, 159 and 182 good to moderate air quality days were recorded compared to 108 and 152 in 2016 and 2017. In 2018 and 2019, 206 and 183 poor to severe air days were recorded compared to 246 and 213 in 2016 and 2017 according to CPCB. One of the signs of air quality improving is the absence of any severe air quality or smog episodes which are linked to higher hospital admissions and complications of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions in the vulnerable population. . Officials from anti-pollution agencies said one of the reasons Delhi couldn’t sustain its improvements in curbing severe air episodes is an unusually high number of stubble fires flared this year and possibly because of the reopening of the economy after curbs imposed to control Covid-19 spread coinciding with adverse meteorological conditions like calm winds for the past one week.This time there have been at least 62,000 fire points compared to less than 60,000 in the past two years.“There is no doubt that 2020’s annual average concentrations will be lower than last year. Even if you consider AQI, we have had a very high number of good, satisfactory and moderate days this year because of the national lockdown for Covid 19 pandemic. Severe days occur every year whether they were consecutive or not will not matter much,” said a senior Central Pollution Control Board official on condition of anonymity.Scientists said the satellite data indicates a very high number of stubble fires this year. “The satellite data we assessed indicates that crop stubble fires have been relatively higher than the average number of fires recorded in the past five years from 2015 to 2019. This has mixed with poor meteorological conditions. It is definitely true that number of severe air days had reduced in 2017, 2018 and 2019. There were a very high number of severe air days in 2016 and we experienced one of the worst smog episodes. This year again this has happened because of higher stubble fires, lack of surveillance because of Covid-19 related restrictions,” explained Sagnik Dey, associate professor at IIT Delhi. He also flagged that Delhi needs to reduce its own emissions by at least 30% during the winter months beginning October to avoid such spikes. “Air pollution has doubled in October-November compared to say August-September even though local emissions have remained nearly the same. Stubble fires have only added to the emissions. If neighbouring states do not cooperate, Delhi will have to reduce its own emissions even further so that we don’t see such hazardous air quality episodes. We also need to fine tune the graded response action plan so that strict control mechanisms kick in even before we have severe air continuously for six days,” Dey said, referring to NASA satellite images which show a smoke plume has descended over Delhi and surrounding regions from the north.Trilochan Mohapatra, director of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), and farmer leaders in Punjab have been saying more stubble fires are being reported in the state because of agitation and discontent over the three farm bills introduced by the Centre. Farmers are in no mood to comply with regulations and labour shortage due to the national lockdown has also made disposing stubble very difficult.“This year we have started recording several severe air quality days even before Diwali has arrived. The entire region is suffering severe air quality because pollutants get trapped here due to adverse meteorological conditions. We need significant curbs locally to reduce the intensity, duration and frequency of such episodes. Its important to monitor how fast such episodes clear up with emergency action. I am not aware of how effectively Grap is being implemented on a regional level right now,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/worst-episode-of-smog-negates-all-good-air-records-in-delhi/story-n7IFCtp2dtEbXMWcQRFSnI.html
11-11-2020||Delhi||SC refuses to interfere with Delhi HC order staying govt decision to reserve Covid beds in pvt hospitals||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to interfere with the Delhi High Court’s order, staying the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s decision asking private hospitals in the city to reserve a substantial number of beds in intensive care unit (ICU) for Covid-19 patients.The AAP government had on September 12 told 33 private hospitals to reserve 80% ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. But the Delhi High Court on September 22 stayed the government’s order on a petition filed by the Association of Healthcare Providers. On October 9, a division bench of the Delhi High Court took up the Delhi government’s appeal against the stay but adjourned the matter to November 27. The AAP government approached the apex court against these two orders of September 22 and October 9.The apex bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and BR Gavai raised a preliminary objection against hearing the case. The bench said, “We know the problem faced by Delhi as cases (of Covid-19) are increasing. But the October 9 order passed by the Delhi High Court has merely adjourned the matter. How can a special leave petition (SLP) be entertained against such an order?”Appearing for the Delhi government, additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain pressed the panic button citing the Diwali festival this weekend. He said, “We are willing to go back to the Delhi High Court but we request if the high court judgment could be stayed for a week as this week is crucial. Due to Diwali, people are intermingling and cases will go beyond control...If our order (of September 12) would not have been stayed, we could have got 500 more beds to admit Covid-19 patients. The current requirement is for more than 6,000 beds and Delhi government hospitals put together can provide only up to 4,000 beds.”The bench told Jain, “We are aware that the situation in city is worsening. Delhi has a problem, sometimes 5,000, sometimes 10,000, this is a fluctuating situation...You can bring this matter to the attention of the High Court.”Jain explained that in the last few days, the daily average of Covid-9 cases had crossed the 7,000-mark. “If possible, please understand my predicament. The city is facing an extraordinary situation. Lots of people from other states are coming into Delhi for better health care. A large number of people in the middle-class segment in the city prefer to get admitted in private hospitals.” He said the order to reserve 80%ICU beds applied only to 33 private hospitals and was meant to be a temporary measure. “We won’t insist on reserving 80% beyond a week or two weeks,” Jain said.The Association of Healthcare objected to any stay of the HC order. Senior advocate Maninder Singh informed the court that the high court was functioning till November 12 and to date, no request for an early hearing has been made before the division bench. Even the matter arising out of the September 22 order was listed for hearing on November 18. Singh said he had no objection if the top court directs the matter to be heard by high court this week.The bench recorded this submission and stated in its order, “Looking to the facts of the case and the request made by learned counsel for the parties, we request the concerned bench (of the Delhi High Court) for taking up the letters patent appeal (LPA) on November 12.”The Delhi government’s standing counsel Chirag M Shroff presented a chart before the apex court, showing the availability of ICU beds in Delhi’s government hospitals vis-à-vis private ones. In its petition, the Delhi government stated that out of a total of 1263 registered hospitals and nursing homes, 88 are government-run hospitals while 1,175 fall in the private sector. There are 168 private hospitals in Delhi (including the 33 hospitals asked to reserve ICU beds) with 3,239 ICU beds.The Delhi HC in its September 22 order held, “The state cannot discriminate between a Covid-19 and a non-Covid-19 patient requiring emergent treatment. In time of emergency, such patients cannot be told to run around finding a hospital where beds have not been reserved for Covid-19 patients.” Though the HC accepted a surge in the number of Covid-19 patients, it felt that the government’s decision was “arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of Article 21 (right to life)” of non-Covidpatients suffering from life-threatening diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-refuses-to-interfere-with-delhi-hc-order-staying-govt-decision-to-reserve-covid-beds-in-pvt-hospitals/story-J0qEg6N6wdSzyisbZqKs7O.html

With Delhi recording an average of 6,898 cases every day over the past seven days, the government also warned all hospitals against denial of beds to Covid-19 patients.The new directives, aimed at easing the chaos at hospitals and preventing Covid-19 deaths, were issued in the form of two orders issued by the state health department on Monday.“It has been noticed that many people are approaching the hospitals, having already progressed to either moderate or severe categories of Covid-19 illness… Early identification of not only those with detectable infection (via testing), but also those at increased risk of developing complications or progressing to moderate to severe disease, shall help us reduce Covid-19 associated complications and deaths,” read the order, which made it mandatory for hospitals and labs to check the oxygen saturation level of people taking a Covid-19 test. The rule will apply to all government and private hospitals and laboratories as well as sample collection centres -- all of whom will have to record the oxygen saturation level on OPD slips. It will have to be followed for both rapid antigen tests (RAT) and RT-PCR tests. “In case, oxygen saturation is found to be less than 94%, the client be mandatorily advised to be examined by a doctor,” the order read.On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 7,830 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the city’s total tally to 451,382, including 402,854 recoveries and 7143 deaths. Delhi had on Sunday recorded a spike of 7,745 new cases after which the Union health ministry said the national Capital had overtaken Maharashtra and Kerala to become the largest contributor towards the daily Covid-19 tally of the country.NO BED REFUSAL, NO PATIENT TRANSFER WITHOUT CONFIRMATION In a bid to address the repeated complaints of Covid patients being refused a bed or serious Covid patients being shifted from one hospital to another because of the scarcity of ICU beds, the Delhi government issued another order, warning health facilities against such as practice.“Instances of Covid-19 designated hospitals refusing admissions to Covid-19 cases/suspected Covid-19 cases even when there is a vacancy available have been brought to the notice of the competent authority. Further, it has been noticed that the patient has to approach multiple hospitals before getting himself/herself admitted,” read the order, seen by HT. Seeking “most strict compliance” of the order, the government directed that no Covid-19 patient should be refused admission if a bed is available in a hospital. It ordered that a patient under critical care should only be transferred with the prior confirmation of the referral hospital and under emergent need.“Also, it has been learnt that some critical patients are also being transferred from one hospital to another without ascertaining the availability of vacant critical care bed/infrastructure or bringing to knowledge of the referral hospital regarding the referral being made and reasons there off. All this may put the life of the patient in jeopardy...,” the order stated.As cases surge in the national capital, there has been an increase in the occupancy of hospital beds. On Tuesday evening, less than half of Covid-19 hospital beds in Delhi were vacant, according to the state government’s Delhi Corona mobile application.Of 16,375 beds earmarked to treat patients with the disease, 8,026 were vacant, of which only 191 ICU beds with ventilators and 335 ICU beds without ventilators were available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-makes-oxygen-saturation-check-mandatory-for-covid-tests-warns-hospitals-against-denial-of-beds/story-VmSgqlc3ZtXM86VJjP6wEO.html
11-11-2020||Delhi||DMRC requests Centre to stagger office timings||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has requested the Centre to implement staggered office timings, both in government and private sector, in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the capital. DMRC officials said the measure is important to ensure social distancing during peak hours on its network.DMRC managing director Mangu Singh, it is learnt, has written to Union housing and urban affairs ministry in this regard suggesting that government and private offices should work in two slots: 9am and 4pm and 11 am to 6pm.A housing and urban affairs ministry official said, “We have received the suggestion from the DMRC and the matter has been referred to the Department of Personnel and Training for consideration.”A copy of the letter was also marked to the Delhi government.Delhi recorded 5,023 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday, fewer than 6,500 cases for the first time in six days. Also, the positivity rate has remained above 12%. Monday’s tally was the highest number of cases reported after a weekend, which usually see a drop in testing, and cases. The Metro, which resumed operations on September 7 after a gap of 169 days, said its ridership has doubled—14 lakh passenger journeys are performed daily now—in the past two months. This is posing a serious challenge before the Metro, which is the transport lifeline of Delhi, to ensure social distancing at the station and on trains during peak hours.The DMRC recently conducted an online survey to study the commuting pattern of Metro users and explore the possibility of them planning their travel as per flexible timings to avoid overcrowding, especially during peak hours.As per the survey, nearly 66% of the Metro users travel during peak hours—63.1% between 8am and 10 am, and 66. 1% between 5pm and 7pm. DMRC official said that 68.5% commuters said that they don’t have the provision to work from home and 73.1% said that their offices won’t agree for staggered timing. But to ensure smooth operations while following the Standard Operating procedures laid down by the Centre for social distancing, DMRC officials said that it is important to implement staggered timing for offices. The two time slots will ease the pressure on the network during peak hours.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said: “On a few corridors, the volume of traffic is exceeding the reduced carrying capacity of the system during the peak hours. Keeping this in view, the DMRC has repeatedly appealed to the passengers to ‘break the peak’ and stagger the timings of the journeys so that all Covid protocols can be stringently followed.”DMRC officials said that currently the level of traffic during the peak hours on some corridors has actually exceeded the available capacity. However, enough spare capacity is available during the non-peak hours.In the past two months of its operations, the carrying capacity has been exceeded on a number of sections during peak hours on DMRC’s Blue (Dwarka Sector 21 - Noida Electronic City and Vaishali), Red (Dilshad Garden - Shaheed Sthal) and Yellow (HUDA City Centre - Samaypur Badli) corridors.With economic activities resuming on full scale in the Capital, the situation is the same on some sections of its Green(Inderlok - Mundka), Violet (Kashmere Gate- Raja Nahar Singh and Magenta (Botanical Garden- Kalkaji Mandir Section) corridors. With Covid cases on the rise and air pollution slipping into severe category, public health and transport experts say that staggered office timing is important.“It is a very good suggestion by the DMRC. This will not only help in ensuring social distancing but also help in reducing air pollution, as it will stagger the vehicular load during peak hours. In the present scenario, it’s advisable that people should stay at home and offices should encourage work from home,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.Transport expert Amit Bhatt, director transport at WRI India, said staggered timing should be made a permanent feature in Delhi which faces a serious problem of pollution due to traffic congestion.“Staggering of office timings becomes even more important now during the pandemic. It will help in ensuring social distancing in public transport. Currently, there is bunching of people happening during peak hours as offices start and end at almost the same time. While DMRC’s suggestion will help ease crowding on its network, there is also a need to stagger timings area-wise to ease congestion on roads,” said Bhatt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dmrc-requests-centre-to-stagger-office-timings/story-NeS2QInpBLGizrA20qzERI.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||TRP case: Republic TV’s distribution head arrested; channel denies charges||A special investigation team (SIT) of Mumbai crime branch, probing the Television Rating Point (TRP) fraud case, on Tuesday arrested the Republic TV’s distribution head Ghanshyam Dilipkumar Singh, 44, from his Thane residence. The crime branch has claimed in their remand copy that Singh allegedly paid ₹15 lakh (a month) for seven months to a vendor to boost viewership of his channel. Police also claimed that hawala channels were also used for these transactions.Singh was arrested after several days of questioning in the case. He is the 12th person to be arrested in the case. However, Republic TV in a tweet said, “Relentless attack on Republic Media network continues; Republic Distribution head AVP Ghanshyam Singh detained by crime branch; Ghanshyam had been cooperating in the Mumbai police’s fake TRP case probe.” Sachin Vaze, assistant police inspector heading the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) and also part of the investigating team said, “Singh was produced before the court and was sent to police custody up to November 13”.Singh’s name cropped up in the investigation while the officers were probing the role of Abhishek Kolawade alias Ajit alias Amit alias Mhadik, who was arrested on October 31.Kolawade worked as a vendor for many channels and ran a company named Max Media. He first met Singh last year at Ashish Chaudhary’s office (11th arrested accused in the case).Police’s remand copy stated that Kolawade’s sustained interrogation revealed that to amplify TRP of Republic TV he has received monthly ₹15lakh from Singh between January 2020 to July 2020. This money he had received at the office of Ashish Chaudhary. Some of the money he had received through the hawala channel.The remand copy further stated that Kolawade gave some part of this money to Ramji Varma, Dinesh Vishwakarma and Umesh Mishra to further pay to the families whose house were selected for installing barometer, with instructions to watch Republic TV channels. Kolawade would keep some part of this money with himself for personal gains. When SIT conducted a raid at his residence and office they seized ₹13.72 lakh cash.While seeking Singh’s custody, the SIT informed the court that they wish to investigate if in past too Singh had paid money to Kolawade to increase viewership of his channels.The police also told the court that they want to investigate if Singh was in contact with officials of Multi-System Operators (MSO) and Direct To Home (DTH) to increase the viewership of his employer channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-case-republic-tv-s-distribution-head-paid-15-lakh-for-7-months-to-boost-viewership-says-mumbai-crime-branch-channel-denies-all-charges/story-04yFDjZCtiUEwtRKddRqsL.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||Air pollution in rural India at par with cities, finds study by Colorado State University and IIT-Bombay||A study has found that air pollution levels are similar in rural and urban areas in the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP), which has the highest levels of pollution in India. A team of four researchers from Colorado State University (CSU) in the United States of America and Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) — led by professor AR Ravishankara, department of chemistry, CSU — compared the amount of particulate matter (PM2.5, referring to suspended particles which are 2.5 microns or smaller) in six regions in the country (IGP, north India, eastern India, western India, central India and southern India) for over four months. PM 2.5 levels were studied at ground level from satellite measurements of aerosols. Partly funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the study reiterated that IGP — covering Punjab to West Bengal — has the highest levels of air pollution. The study was published on November 2 in the international multi-disciplinary journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Unlike in industrialised countries, there wasn’t much difference in air pollution levels in rural and urban areas in India. “Globally, air pollution research is focussed in urban areas, particularly in industrialised countries where a large section of the population resides in cities. In India, however, the case is different,” said Chandra Venkataraman, professor, department of chemistry at IIT-B, who was part of the research team.“The lack of a massive difference in population density between urban and non-urban regions may be a feature of the developing world,” said Ravishankara. With similar health risks being posed to rural and urban populations alike, the study estimates approximately 10.5 lakh people die prematurely of causes that may be attributed to PM 2.5. The causes include ischemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and type 2 diabetes. “Of this, 69% deaths occur in rural areas and the rest are in urban areas. This is likely because more people reside in rural areas,” said Venkataraman. “We have found that in non-urban areas, residential energy use is a significant emissions source, primarily due to household cooking with solid fuels. Therefore, we need string regional monitoring systems and include emission controls in rural areas,” she added.LS Kurinji, who is a research analyst at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water; and was not involved in the study, said, “The report raises concerns about the lack of rural air quality monitoring. The concern is pertinent as several studies have documented that air quality in rural areas is equally bad due to the use of solid fuels in households.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-pollution-in-rural-india-at-par-with-cities-finds-study-by-colorado-state-university-and-iit-bombay/story-kqZuPUNTzuaEs5DJIhVYfL.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||2018 suicide abetment case: Court order on plea for Arnab Goswami’s police custody due on Thursday||A sessions court in Alibag will on Thursday deliver its order on the revision application filed by Alibag police to question Arnab Goswami and two others arrested in connection with the 2018 suicide abetment case of architect Anvay Naik and his mother, Kumud. Goswami, Feroz Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda were arrested on November 4. Arguing for Goswami, senior counsel Abad Ponda on Tuesday requested the court not to grant police custody. Ponda said there was a contractual dispute with Naik as the work done by him was not satisfactory. “90 per cent of the amount was paid and 10 per cent of the amount was kept on hold. This matter is of contractual dispute and that should be decided in a civil court, not in a criminal court. If people start committing suicide in contractual dispute, then there will be many suicide cases,” argued Ponda. “There was no need to arrest Goswami as he was not absconding and was available for questioning…After the incident in 2018, when the FIR was registered, my client was called to record his statement, and he remained present. And at that time, police chose not to arrest him and filed ‘A’ summary report. It was clearly mentioned in the ‘A’ summary that there is no nexus between accused number one, two and three in this crime. My client was not aware till 4th of November that a closure report has been filed in this case. My client was told about it when he was arrested. My client was not called for questioning even once before arrest. Joginder Singh principle said in every case arrest is not required. There is no question of further custody.” Ponda went on to give the background of the case and referred to Goswami’s comments on the Maharashtra chief minister. “My client is a news anchor and may have said things he shouldn’t say. But this is not the way to arrest him. How can it be abetment to suicide when in my mind it is a contractual dispute? How is it instigation for suicide,” asked Ponda. There are no reasons made out on why this court should go against magistrate court order for judicial custody, argued Ponda. “Also, the magistrate court has already given permission to police to question my client in judicial custody three hours every day, then why is police custody required? My client has already alleged assault by police and we all are very much aware there are ways of assaulting which will not be visible. If I am sent to police custody, God bless me,” Ponda argued before the court. Niha Raut, defence lawyer for Shaikh, argued there was no direct work contract between the companies of Shaikh and Naik. “Shaikh had given work contract to Atos India Pvt Limited company which gave a sub-contract to Naik. The contract was given on the total price of around ₹3.85 crore. However, my client has paid around ₹4.78 crore,” argued Raut. “There is no connection between my client and Naik. Naik has taken several work contracts for interior work and has given money to his sub-contractors, and kept pending work of his customers,” said Raut. Public prosecutor Pradeep Gharat pointed out that “the order given by magistrate was perverse”. “Learned magistrate didn’t use the discretion given and hence correctness and proprietary of the order is under challenge. Magistrate was duty bound not to get swayed in pressure,” said Gharat. “Fair chance should be given to police to confront the accused with available evidence to verify,” argued Gharat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2018-suicide-abetment-case-court-order-on-plea-for-arnab-goswami-s-police-custody-due-on-thursday/story-FOu8P14fYlFujCL5JX1dkN.html
11-11-2020||Mumbai||Leopard cub reunited with mother at Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park||A three-to-four-month female leopard cub was reunited with its mother at the Tulsi range of Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) on Monday, in one of the first leopard cub rescue and reunion operations at SGNP, the forest department said.This was also the second time an abandoned leopard cub was found inside SGNP after a male cub was found in critical condition in the Yeoor range in December 2019. In the latest incident, the cub was located early Monday morning near Kalamabacha Fonda, a small hamlet near Akurli Malad in the Tulsi range by local residents.“After the residents informed the forest department, the cub was moved to a secure location by the rapid response team, citing safety of hamlet residents,” said G Mallikarjuna, director and conservator of forest, SGNP.A medical examination was conducted and the cub was kept under observation, Mallikarjuna said, adding that the cub was then taken to a secure location close to the spot where she was found. “The cub was reunited with its mother at 9pm on Monday, making it one of the first such rescue and reunion operations at SGNP,” said Mallikarjuna, adding that the cub was kept in a basket. “We had left the lid open from one end. On hearing the mother’s call, the cub got out of the basket and walked deeper into the forest towards her mother. We will monitor the area to ensure that the cub is not abandoned again and to see if there is any other movement,” he said.According to veterinarians, reunions, which are common at landscapes such as Junnar in Pune, play a significant role in avoiding human-animal conflict as leopards unable to locate their cubs may turn hostile or aggressive on seeing humans in close proximity to that area. “The effort by staff from Tulsi range, SGNP’s rapid response team, biologist Nikit Surve and wildlife warden Mayur Kamath ensured the safe reunion of this cub in the least possible time with minimum disturbance, which also increases a sense of security for local residents,” said Mallikarjuna.“As this is the second instance of a leopard cub being identified in SGNP and probably the first reunion, it highlights the importance of positive human intervention. In some cases, if the reunion is not successful, the cub spends its life in captivity. However, Monday’s incident was encouraging from the point of view of wildlife conservation,” said Surve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/leopard-cub-reunited-with-mother-at-mumbai-s-sanjay-gandhi-national-park/story-eB47fVDg1eFzElPQrhCQlO.html

But the Chirag Paswan-led party decided to split from the alliance and contested the Bihar assembly elections alone.All the three phases witnessed a good voter turnout amid the coronavirus pandemic in the country. The Election Commission of India (ECI) had laid several Covid-19 related guidelines such as regular sanitising of polling booths, provision of gloves and masks to those visiting the booths to exercise their franchise and maintenance of social distancing at all times. The commission also allowed Covid-19 infected patients placed under home or institutional quarantine to participate by the way of postal ballots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-election-2020-result-updates-for-asthawan-biharsharif-rajgir-islampur-hilsa-nalanda-harnaut/story-X1DQZ9jiVHWRdjukoVvOZN.html

11-11-2020||Mumbai||Ready to reopen, Mumbai’s colleges plan staggered classes and stringent checks||With schools and junior colleges set to reopen on November 23, colleges in the city are also gearing up to open up their classrooms. Even as colleges wait for directives from the state government and the University of Mumbai (MU), several steps are already being taken to ensure students’ safety. Social distancing, temperature checks, sanitisation and face masks are a priority as colleges prepare to resume classes on campus after a hiatus of over eight months. From insisting on Covid-19 tests for teachers and other staff members to ensuring 24/7 sanitisation of college premises, many institutes are finding ways to ensure social distancing is maintained on campus. “We are waiting for clear directives from the government on how to reopen, whether to stagger classes etc. In the meantime, we have been regularly sanitising our premises, including labs, classes and offices. Temperature checks will be done when students start coming in,” said Tushar Desai, principal, Ruparel College, in Matunga. “Sanitisation has been our top priority and that is something we will continue throughout the day, especially once college reopens. We are just worried about handling the staff and students because at any given point of time, at least 1,000 people will be on campus and we don’t want to take chances with the staff’s or students’ health,” said Marie Fernandes, principal, St Andrew’s College, in Bandra. Social distancing, compulsory masks and cleanliness around the campus will be priority, said Fernandes.Some institutes have decided to call only those students to college who need practical sessions while continuing online classes for others. Keeping in mind the large number of students per batch, some colleges will also run classes in two or three shifts whereas others plan to wait for more directions from MU before reopening colleges. Some principals are hoping for the rule of 75% attendance rule will see a relaxation this year, considering the lockdown.Usha Pravin Gandhi College, in Vile Parle, caters to around 1,600 students in the degree college and is trying to work out the best way to implement rules so that the institution can reopen safely. ”We plan to start a staggered entry of students, starting first with students from Bachelors of Arts (BA) and Information Technology (IT) students for their practical classes only, while the rest of the batches continue virtual classes,” said principal Anju Kapoor. Kapoor added that without local transport functioning normally, expecting students to attend lectures would not be practical. “The university needs to relax the 75% compulsory attendance rule keeping in mind the current situation. We will also ensure a student doesn’t have to physically attend college more than two or three times a week,” she added.At Matunga’s GN Khalsa College, authorities are hoping the head of the institute will be the one who decides how many students must attend college in person. “Depending on the total strength of [students at] the college, principals and management should have the authority to decide how many students should be invited to college on a daily basis. This will help us ensure that only those students who need to be in college for practical lectures are invited while the rest continue online classes,” said principal Kiran Mangaonkar, adding that GN Khalsa College has 5,500 students currently studying in the degree college.MMK College in Bandra has appointed a doctor to be on call, in addition to other measures including regular sanitising and check temperatures of students and staff. “We have staggered the benches to allow social distancing norms to be followed in classrooms. Hand sanitisers have been installed at every floor. A doctor, who is close to the campus, will be available on call in case of any distress,” said principal Kishore Peshori.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ready-to-reopen-mumbai-s-colleges-plan-staggered-classes-and-stringent-checks/story-y3cY2l0LOutQ5iTEmiT5KO.html

Report “Rejected”,” the ousted premier tweeted, reported Dawn.No other PML-N leader has commented on the party’s official stance on the report, although Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) spokesperson Mian Iftikhar Hussain termed the inquiry as “a victory of the democratic forces.”“Now those responsible should be brought to justice. PDM will hold further consultations in this regard,” he added.Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had also welcomed the development as “good news”, reported Dawn.While addressing a public meeting in Gulmit, Gilgit-Baltistan, Bilawal said: “I have received good news that the chief of army staff [ordered] an inquiry, that inquiry has been completed and action has also been taken. We should welcome this step.”The Pakistan Army on Tuesday said that it has found officials of secret intel agency, ISI, and Rangers guilty of the “abduction” of Sindh IGP Mushtaq Mehr and the “overzealous” arrest of Capt Awan in a desecration case, adding that they have been removed from their posts.In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) -- the military media affairs wing -- said that the court of inquiry, constituted to redress the grievances of the Sindh inspector general on the orders of Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa, has been completed.Last month, the ISPR said the Army chief had taken notice of and ordered an immediate inquiry into the “Karachi incident”, minutes after PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari called on General Bajwa and ISI Director General Faiz Hameed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the arrest of Awam, husband of PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz, from his hotel room on October 19.Almost all police officers in Sindh applied for leave in protest against the humiliation meted out to IGP Mehr.PML-N spokesman Muhammad Zubair, who is also a former Sindh governor, said that the IGP Sindh was “kidnapped” by the Rangers who forced him to file an FIR for Safdar’s arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-army-inquiry-into-safdar-awan-s-arrest-a-cover-up-says-pml-n-chief-nawaz-sharif/story-vVr7JO9q9LJYlKMQR5UJYK.html
11-11-2020||World||Trump campaign files another lawsuit in Michigan challenging election results||President Donald Trump’s campaign has filed another lawsuit in Michigan challenging the election results.The federal lawsuit, which the campaign said it filed late Tuesday, seeks to stop the state from certifying results that show Democrat Joe Biden leading by almost 146,000 votes.The campaign asked a judge to stop Michigan from certifying fraudulent ballots, those received after Election Day, those processed when observers weren’t present, and any counted with defective tabulating machines or software. At least two prior suits contesting the state’s election results have already been rejected by Michigan judges.Trump has said he doesn’t accept results showing that Biden won and his campaign and Republican supporters have sued in at least four states. Legal experts say the suits will fail to substantially change the vote tally or provide enough votes to give Trump a win in the electoral college.Trump’s campaign has provided no evidence of widespread voter fraud.Trump sued Monday to block Pennsylvania from certifying its election results, claiming that voting irregularities justify keeping the winner undeclared while the case proceeds. Biden leads in Pennsylvania, which has 20 electoral votes, by nearly 46,000 votes, according to the Associated Press.The campaign supplied a copy of the 31-page complaint, which couldn’t immediately be verified in federal court in the Western District of Michigan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-campaign-files-another-lawsuit-in-michigan-challenging-election-results/story-swUXpOFCGp0bLU4bPyZ9NJ.html

Landlords and capitalists dominate Pakistan’s 342-member National Assembly -- the lower legislative house -- with the majority of members possessing huge pieces of land and massive investments in stocks, shares and industrial units, it said, citing the statement of assets of the lawmakers for year 2019 released by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).As many as 12 out of the total 342 members of the National Assembly have declared that they own assets worth over a billion rupees. Five of the declared billionaires are from Punjab, another five from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and two from Sindh, the report said.While five of the billionaire lawmakers are from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) of Prime Minister Imran Khan, two are from its ally Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), three from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and one each from Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Awami National Party (ANP).Interestingly, many other leaders -- including Prime Minister Khan, former premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi of the PML-N and PTI’s Khayal Zaman Orakzai -- who in the previous years had put the worth of their assets at over a billion rupees, opted to mention the cost of their assets this time, which is less than a billion.Prime Minister Khan owns assets worth over Rs 80 million, though this does not include the value of his 300-kanal villa in Bani Gala that he says was a gift. Almost all other properties including a house in Lahore’s Zaman Park, around 600 acres (4,800 kanals) of agricultural land besides non-agricultural land, too, are stated to be inherited.However, this year he has not mentioned two properties, which he had listed in the statement of assets filed last year, measuring around 15 acres in the Bhakkar area.While Khan continues to possess four goats valued at Rs 200,000, he does not own any vehicle.

He has extended over Rs 1.24 billion loan to four companies from the money he inherited from his mother and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto after her assassination. The total value of his shares in the four companies forms only a small fraction of the amount he has lent to them.He has shares in two villas in Dubai, but their value has not been mentioned in the statement. The total worth of his assets comes to Rs 1.58 billion. He owns 19 properties in Pakistan including over 200 acres of land, most of which are inherited or gifted.

He owns over a dozen properties in Pakistan besides his share in the five properties that he inherited from his spouse Benazir Bhutto.Leader of the Opposition Shehbaz Sharif has more than 83 acres of agricultural land.

11-11-2020||World||In blow to WHO, EU seeks powers to declare health emergencies||The European Commission (EC) on Wednesday proposed rules which would give the European Union(EU) the power to declare a health emergency and stress test national plans to tackle pandemics, in a potential blow to the World Health Organization(WHO).The move follows an often uncoordinated reaction by the 27 EU governments to the Covid-19 pandemic, which at the beginning of the crisis led to competition on vital medical gear and export bans on medicines.It also comes after the WHO was criticised for having declared the pandemic, which first emerged in China at the end of last year, too late.The UN agency has repeatedly denied the accusation. Under the proposals, the EU would be able to declare an EU-level public health emergency, which would in turn trigger more coordination among EU states.Currently, the EU relies on the WHO to declare such an emergency.“The new rules will enable the activation of EU emergency response mechanisms without making it contingent upon the WHO’s own declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” an EU document says, adding that such a move would be coordinated with the WHO.If adopted, the overhaul would partly take away a major power from the WHO, as EU states call for reform of the organisation to address shortfalls in emergencies.“We relied too much on the WHO for the Covid-19 pandemic,” Peter Liese, a top EU lawmaker from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, said. “Under pressure from China, the WHO declared the health emergency too late. It is therefore very important to have the possibility to act at European level in future similar situations.”The WHO, which the Trump administration has labelled a puppet of China, was not immediately available to comment.Coordination on vaccinesUnder the commission’s proposals, the EU would help governments prepare pandemic plans and would audit and stress test them, an EU document says.EU states have traditionally been reluctant to give more powers to Brussels on the matter.During the pandemic, they have applied different national measures on a series of issues, including testing policies for Covid-19 cases, quarantine rules and travel restrictions. But they have shown good coordination on procuring vaccines.If approved by EU governments and EU lawmakers, the commission said the proposals would be immediately applicable and could strengthen EU powers to tackle the current pandemic, in which most European countries are seeing a surge in cases.Brussels wants to strengthen the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, whose non-binding advice, such as on the length of quarantine after contact with an infected person, has often been ignored.It also wants more power for the EU Medicines Agency to prevent risks of shortages of medicines and medical devices.Brussels also said it would unveil by the end of next year plans for a new health authority modelled after the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which has played a vital role in procuring experimental dugs and vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-blow-to-who-eu-seeks-powers-to-declare-health-emergencies/story-aH667HTAjPBUvHAdVZ2wzL.html

Biden has indicated he’s willing to extend it for 5 years as permitted under the treaty, which was signed in 2010.President Vladimir Putin won’t congratulate Biden until all legal challenges by Trump have been exhausted and the Democrat is officially declared the winner, the Kremlin said earlier this week. Putin is one of a dwindling number of leaders who haven’t recognized Biden as the next US head of state, along with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Ryabkov declined to comment on the controversy over the election outcome in the US, saying Moscow would work with whatever administration takes office on January 20.Russia, which was accused by US intelligence agencies of intervening in 2016 to help get Trump elected, has been wary of Biden, fearing an increase in sanctions pressure and clashes over human rights and the post-Soviet space. Still, Moscow could find Biden easier to engage on some issues including arms control, climate change and the Iranian nuclear program, analysts close to the Kremlin say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-isn-t-planning-any-contacts-with-biden-yet-says-official/story-EWzk7Q72glUDxkOOJ8BogJ.html
11-11-2020||World||Thousands in Armenia protest Nagorno-Karabakh truce terms||Thousands of people gathered in the capital of Armenia on Wednesday to protest the country’s agreement with Azerbaijan to halt weeks of fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh. The deal calls for the deployment of nearly 2,000 Russian peacekeepers and territorial concessions.Participants at the rally, which Armenia’s opposition parties promoted, demanded the resignation of the country’s Prime Minister, who signed the peace agreement along with the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Russia. Some of the protesters in Yerevan clashed with police, and scores were detained.The truce between the two ex-Soviet nations, brokered by Moscow and announced early Tuesday, came after significant advances by Azerbaijani forces that the Armenia-backed leader of Nagorno-Karabakh said made it impossible for his side to carry on.The agreement was celebrated in Azerbaijan, but it angered Armenians, who immediately took to the streets demanding that the pact be invalidated.Armenia and Azerbaijan have been locked in a conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh for decades. The region lies within Azerbaijan but has been under control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994. Heavy fighting erupted in late September, the biggest escalation of the conflict in a quarter-century, and has left hundreds, possibly thousands, dead.Several cease-fires announced over the past six weeks crumbled almost immediately, but the current agreement appeared to be holding, with neither side reporting any more fighting since it came into force.It came days after Azerbaijan pressed its offensive deeper into Nagorno-Karabakh and took control of the city of Shushi, which is strategically positioned on heights overlooking the regional capital of Stepanakert.Nagorno-Karabakh’s separatist leader, Arayik Harutyunyan, acknowledged Tuesday that “had the hostilities continued at the same pace, we would have lost all of Artsakh (an Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh) within days.”Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said it was “extremely painful for me personally and for our people,” calling the situation a “catastrophe” and adding that he had no choice but to sign the peace agreement.The agreement calls for Armenia to turn over control of some areas its holds outside the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh. They include the Lachin region, which the main road leading from Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia passes through. The agreement calls for the road, the so-called Lachin Corridor, to remain open and to be protected by Russian peacekeepers.The deal also calls for transport links to be established through Armenia that would connect Azerbaijan and its western exclave of Nakhchivan, which is surrounded by Armenia, Iran, and Turkey.Armenian opposition politicians on Wednesday called the agreement “treacherous” and demanded that Pashinian step down.“We need to save Armenia and Artsakh from Pashinian,” Ishkhan Saghatelyan, member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Dashnaktsutyun political party, said at a rally that drew up to 10,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-in-armenia-protest-nagorno-karabakh-truce-terms/story-iDm0q0WOl8zs5MU1W1iKjK.html

He shall be shown the way out soon Inshallah (God willing),” Iqbal had tweeted, without directly mentioning Khan.The US embassy account on Tuesday evening retweeted this, causing an uproar among the local Twitterati. On Tuesday, #ApologiseUS_Embassy trended on Twitter. The embassy clarified on Wednesday that the tweet from its handle was unauthorised.“Dear Followers: The US Embassy Islamabad Twitter account was accessed last night without authorisation. The US Embassy does not endorse the posting or retweeting of political messages. We apologise for any confusion that may have resulted from the unauthorised post,” it said.That should have settled the issue. But human rights minister Shireen Mazari and Sindh governor Imran Ismael demanded an apology from the US embassy on Wednesday.Mazari tweeted: “This not good enough esp after great delay! Account was clearly not hacked so someone who had access to it used it “without authorisation”. Unacceptable that someone working in US Embassy pushing a particular pol party’s agenda - has serious consequences incl staff visas scrutiny.”Mazari has not only suggested that the US Embassy was lying that their account was hacked and that in fact it was an embassy staffer who had retweeted, she also threatened that the move could impede issuance of staff visas to embassy personnel. It is believed that this issue will escalate in days to come.“US embassy is still working in Trumpian mode in support of convicted absconder and intervening brazenly in our internal politics,” Mazari said, referring to former prime minister and PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif.“Monroe doctrine also died centuries ago! US embassy must observe norms of diplomacy,” she said.Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Shahbaz Gill said that for the first time ever, an embassy was seen “insulting” its own lawfully elected president. “We expect some heads to roll. This is unacceptable!” he said.The latest development came after many Pakistanis welcomed President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over Trump, who had friendly relations with Khan and had publicly praised him for his help in paving the way for the US-Taliban peace deal.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-embassy-in-soup-over-retweet-of-pak-leader-s-post-targeting-imran-khan/story-BmJOsuLvYUhA2CceGWkMJP.html
11-11-2020||World||Bangladesh orders significant cuts in 2 China-funded railway projects||The Bangladesh Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) has issued directions to significantly reduce the cost of two China-funded railway projects after carrying out a review, with authorities describing it as the first such action taken for ventures backed by Beijing. The PMO directed the railway ministry to reduce the cost of the project to convert the metre-gauge line between Akhaura and Sylhet to dual-gauge line by 3,354.31 crore takas or 20.8% of the total cost, according to a report by The Daily Star newspaper. The ministry was also directed to cut the cost of the project for upgrading the Joydebpur-Ishwardi dual-gauge line to dual-gauge double line by 1,495.52 crore takas, or 12.91% of the total cost. The directives were issued by a special committee reviewing the costs of three China-funded projects. Such a directive from the PMO is “not only rare, but I think this is the first”, an unnamed Bangladesh railway official was quoted as saying by the daily. The PMO had formed the special committee on September 30 to review three railway projects to be implemented with Chinese finance and by Chinese companies. The committee submitted its report within seven days. Following the submission of the report, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina issued the directive. The committee also made several observations and suggestions and the PMO asked for “necessary changes in the projects”, the report said. Of the three projects studied by the committee, the Akhaura-Sylhet and Joydebpur-Ishwardi projects had been approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec). Chinese companies had been selected to implement these projects and contract costs had been negotiated. The final loan and commercial deals were yet to be signed, the report said. The Ecnec had approved the project to convert the Akhaura-Sylhet railway line in April last year at a cost of 16,104 crore takas. The contract cost negotiated with China Railway Construction Bridge Engineering Bureau Group Co Ltd was 12,079 crore takas. However, questions were raised about the cost. The Joydebpur-Ishwardi railway project was taken up in January last year at a cost of 14,250 crore takas. It was scheduled to be completed by December 2024. The negotiated contract cost for this project was 9,839 crore takas and the selected company was the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation. The Bangladesh government’s move comes at a time when questions have been raised in several South Asian countries about the cost and implementation of several infrastructure and connectivity projects by China. In 2018, Nepal had scrapped an agreement with China’s Three Georges Corporation for building the $1.5-billion West Seti hydropower project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-orders-significant-cuts-in-2-china-funded-railway-projects/story-1eamW4E24G5Um4kLyQ8VxI.html

The Chinese military closely tailed the US patrols sparking tensions.China is also concerned over US naval ships travel through the Taiwan straits and high-tech arms sales to Taiwan, which Beijing claims as part of its mainland.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-us-militaries-discuss-humanitarian-assistance-disaster-relief/story-cgmwAWtYu1Q4QhNhVJlh0L.html

The case has caused a diplomatic chill between Canada and China, which soon after Meng’s arrest detained two Canadian citizens, Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, on espionage charges.“We don’t believe in coercive diplomacy and ... we actually deeply believe that if you start giving into that kind of pressure, you’ll leave yourself worse off for the long term,” Trudeau said in an interview during an FT online conference.“China continues to think that they can just put enough pressure on us and we will ... give in, but that’s exactly the opposite of our position,” he said. Meng has denied charges brought against her in the United States and is fighting extradition from house arrest in Vancouver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-says-canada-will-not-bow-to-china-s-coercive-diplomacy/story-F2sqJJXJ1br5gDAFO11UWJ.html
11-11-2020||World||-70° celsius: Deep-freeze hurdle makes Pfizer’s vaccine one for the rich||When Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine rolls off production lines, Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co. will be waiting to distribute it through a complex and costly system of deep-freeze airport warehouses, refrigerated vehicles and inoculation points across China. After they reach vaccination centers, the shots must be thawed from -70 degrees celsius and injected within five days, if not they go bad.Then the herculean journey from warehouse freezer to rolled-up sleeve must be undertaken all over again -- to deliver the second booster shot a month later. The roadmap sketched out by the company, which has licensed the vaccine for Greater China, offers a glimpse into the enormous and daunting logistical challenges faced by those looking to deliver Pfizer’s experimental vaccine after it showed “extraordinary” early results from final stage trials, raising hopes of a potential end to the nearly year-long pandemic.That euphoria is now being diluted by the realization that no currently used vaccine has ever been made from the messenger RNA technology deployed in Pfizer’s shot, which instructs the human body to produce proteins that then develop protective antibodies.That means that countries will need to build from scratch the deep-freeze production, storage and transportation networks needed for the vaccine to survive. The massive investment and coordination required all but ensures that only rich nations are guaranteed access -- and even then perhaps only their urban populations.Read more | Keeping Pfizer vaccine at minus 70 degree Celsius tough, says AIIMS chiefWhere Things Stand in the Race for a Covid-19 Vaccine: QuickTake“Its production is costly, its component is unstable, it also requires cold-chain transportation and has a short shelf life,” said Ding Sheng, director of the Beijing-based Global Health Drug Discovery Institute, which has received funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.The expense of deploying the Pfizer shot will likely heighten existing fears that wealthier nations will get the best vaccines first, despite a World Health Organization-backed effort called Covax that aims to raise $18 billion to purchase vaccines for poorer countries.It also presents a choice now faced across the developing world: to pay for the expensive construction of subzero cold-chain infrastructure for what seems like a sure bet, or wait for a slower, more conventional vaccine that brews batches of protein or inactivated viral particles in living cells, and can be delivered through existing health-care networks.“If there is a protein-based vaccine that could achieve the same effect as an mRNA vaccine does and there’s the need to vaccinate billions of people every year, I’d go for the protein-based shots in the long run,” Ding said.Even for rich countries that have pre-ordered doses, including Japan, the U.S. and the U.K., delivering Pfizer’s vaccine will involve considerable hurdles as long as trucks break down, electricity cuts out, essential workers get sick and ice melts.Safe DeliveryTo safely deliver shots in mainland China and Hong Kong, Fosun will partner with the state-owned Sinopharm Group Co., a pharmaceutical distributor with well-established networks across the country. One of Sinopharm’s subsidiaries has also been developing Covid-19 vaccines. Packed into cold storage trucks, those vials will arrive at inoculation sites where they can thaw and be stacked in fridges at 2 to 8 degrees celsius for a maximum five days before going bad. “The requirement for extremely cold temperatures is likely to cause spoilage of a lot of vaccine,” said Michael Kinch, a vaccine specialist at Washington University in St. Louis. It’s also likely to cost Fosun tens of millions yuan, according to the company’s Chairman Wu Yifang. Fosun is considering importing the vaccine in bulk and filling them into vials at a local plant. That will also require further investment in production and storage.Read more | How Pfizer vaccine could be cold comfort for some Asian nationsThe Vaccine Cargo Cavalry Sizes Up Readiness of Historic AirliftThe resulting price tag may be too hefty for many developing nations, including neighboring India, which has struggled to contain the world’s second-largest coronavius outbreak and currently has no agreement to purchase the Pfizer vaccine.‘Forget It’Many working in the country’s public health and the pharmaceutical industry have already voiced concern that India lacks the necessary capacity and capability to deliver a vaccine across its vast rural hinterland and population of over 1.3 billion people at the breakneck speed now expected.“Most of these vaccines need minus 70 degrees, which we just can’t do in India, just forget it,” said T. Sundararaman, a New Delhi-based global coordinator of the People’s Health Movement, an organization that brings together local activists, academics and civil society groups working on public health.“Our current cold chains are not able to cope with some districts’ need for measles vaccines, and that’s only for children below the age of 3,” he said. “That’s a really trivial number of people compared to the numbers that will need a Covid-19 vaccine.”When asked at a Tuesday briefing if India’s government would look to buy any of the Pfizer vaccine, Rajesh Bhushan, the secretary at the health ministry, said New Delhi is in talks with all vaccine manufacturers. He added that India was in a position to “augment and strengthen” its existing cold-chain capacity, but declined to release any purchase details immediately. Pfizer already has orders from some developing countries like Peru, Ecuador and Costa Rica. It’s unclear how widely those nations plan to distribute the shots, but their small orders of less than ten million doses suggest limited deployment. After the release of their positive preliminary data, some governments have rushed to finalize orders and start negotiations with Pfizer and BioNTech. The European Union confirmed an order of up to 300 million doses on Tuesday, while the Philippines, Singapore and Brazil said they were in talks.Read more | Fauci says he will take new Pfizer vaccine if FDA approves it‘Last Mile’Even without the subzero issue, rolling out a vaccine in a short space of time will be a “major challenge” requiring mass paramedical training to administer two-shot doses, said Pankaj Patel, chairman of Indian drugmaker Cadila Healthcare Ltd., which is developing its own experimental plasmid DNA Covid-19 shot.This is especially so in areas where people are not easily contactable or have to travel long distances to reach vaccination centers. Past vaccination campaigns show that many simply never show up for the second shot, said public health experts. The mounting obstacles mean that some developing countries may pass on the Pfizer vaccine, despite early signs of its exceptional efficacy.“If we were to wait an extra year and have something that’s feasible for us to deliver to as many people as possible in this country, would that be a bad trade-off?” asked Gagandeep Kang, professor of microbiology at the Vellore, India-based Christian Medical College and a member of the WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.“Based on the cost of the Pfizer vaccine, the logistics of an ultra-cold storage -- I don’t think we are ready and I think this is something that we need to weigh the benefits and the costs very, very carefully,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/70-celsius-deep-freeze-hurdle-makes-pfizer-s-vaccine-one-for-the-rich/story-jX5WOpwR8AEaEXpYDDVF9J.html
11-11-2020||World||UK to increase powers to block foreign investments||The British government plans to increase its power to block or modify foreign investment in the UK on national security grounds under legislation to be introduced Wednesday. The National Security and Investment Bill would require businesses to notify the government about deals in sensitive industries, including defense, transportation, communications and artificial intelligence. The government will then have 30 days to review the transactions and impose conditions on those deemed to pose a risk to national security. The legislation, which applies to technology and intellectual property as well corporate takeovers, follows similar moves by the US and Australia amid increasing concern about investment from potentially hostile countries such as China. “The UK remains one of the most attractive investment destinations in the world and we want to keep it that way,” Business Secretary Alok Sharma said in a statement. “But hostile actors should be in no doubt – there is no back door into the UK.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-increase-powers-to-block-foreign-investments/story-4qkm95qVNyc8NIqYF2oehL.html
11-11-2020||World||Scientists detect two-way transmission of coronavirus on mink farms||An analysis of outbreaks of the novel coronavirus on 16 mink farms in the Netherlands has revealed that the Covid-19 virus is capable of transmission between humans to minks, as well as from these mammals to people.While the virus was initially introduced from humans to the minks, the researchers, including Bas B. Oude Munnink from the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, said it has since evolved. “More research in minks and other mustelid species is important to understand if these species are at risk of becoming a reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,” they wrote in the study, published in the journal Science. According to the scientists, the virus was first diagnosed on two mink farms in late April of 2020 in the Netherlands. In response, they said an extensive surveillance system was set up. The researchers performed an in-depth investigation among the first 16 infected mink farms in the Netherlands using a combination of coronavirus diagnostics, whole-genome sequencing, and in-depth interviews with farm workers. By the end of June, they found that 66 of 97 of the mink farm residents, employees and/or contacts tested had evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to the study, the mink virus genome analysis revealed a diversity of sequences. These large clusters of infection were initiated by Covid-19 cases with viruses that bear the “D614G mutation”, which has come to dominate human infections in several parts of the world, the scientists said. They also found that some people were infected with strains of the virus with an animal sequence signature, providing evidence of animal to human transmission. However, they did not find any evidence of spillover to people living in close proximity to mink farms. “It is imperative that fur production and trading sector should not become a reservoir for future spillover of SARS-CoV-2 to humans,” the scientists wrote in the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-detect-two-way-transmission-of-coronavirus-on-mink-farms/story-gYfzgx5HYmTbN9180TseyK.html
11-11-2020||World||Several wounded in WWI memorial attack at Jeddah cemetery for non-Muslims: France||Several people were wounded Wednesday in a bomb attack at a World War I(WWI) commemoration ceremony attended by European diplomats at a non-Muslim cemetery in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, France’s foreign ministry said.“The annual ceremony commemorating the end of World War I at the non-Muslim cemetery in Jeddah, attended by several consulates, including that of France, was the target of an IED attack this morning, which injured several people,” the ministry said.“France strongly condemns this cowardly, unjustifiable attack.”Last month, a Saudi citizen with a knife injured a guard at the French consulate in Jeddah on the same day that a knife-wielding man killed three people in a church in Nice in southern France.Wednesday’s blast came as French President Emmanuel Macron, the target of ire in much of the Muslim world for vowing to confront Islamist radicalism following a spate of attacks, attended a WWI memorial ceremony in Paris.Several countries are marking the 102nd anniversary of the armistice signed by Germany and Allied countries to end the war.Macron has vigorously defended the right to publish cartoons viewed as offensive by some, including caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed printed by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.The same cartoons were shown by French history teacher Samuel Paty to pupils in a class on free speech, leading to his beheading outside Paris on October 16 following an online campaign by parents angry over his choice of lesson material. Macron’s stance angered many Muslims, prompting protests in several countries at which portraits of the French president were burnt, and a campaign to boycott French products.Saudi Arabia, home to Islam’s holiest sites, has criticised the cartoons, but “strongly” condemned last month’s attack in Nice.On Tuesday, Macron hosted a summit of European leaders to plot a joint approach to combating Islamist radicalism after four people were killed in a shooting rampage in the heart of Vienna last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/several-wounded-in-wwi-memorial-attack-at-jeddah-cemetery-for-non-muslims-france/story-seJcIS4x2tIqKyMceGJlAM.html
11-11-2020||World||Myanmar’s opposition party demands re-election as Aung San Suu Kyi heads for victory||Myanmar’s biggest opposition party on Wednesday said it would not recognise this week’s general election and urged authorities to hold another vote, with the help of the powerful military. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) urged a re-run of Sunday’s vote as soon as possible, with the military’s cooperation, “in order to have an election that is free, fair,unbiased and free from unfair campaigning”.The USDP call came as Aung San Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party looked on course for its second successive election sweep, after partial results on Wednesday indicated a commanding lead and wins in more than 80% of the parliamentary seats that have been declared. The NLD has claimed a resounding based on its own unofficial tally.Nearly a third of the contests have been formally announced and the latest official results take the NLD’s seats in the bicameral legislature to 130 of the 158 declared, compared with 15 for the USDP.The NLD won by a similar margin in the last election in 2015, which was the first vote since the end of nearly 50 years of strict military rule and quasi-military rule.The NLD needs 322 seats to be sure of forming the next government.The USDP alleged irregularities like poor-quality ballot boxes and envelopes, problems with advanced voting and government cash handouts it said amounted to NLD bribes.It also complained about celebratory gatherings by NLD supporters it said breached novel coronavirus restrictions.The NLD said such complaints were to be expected but it demanded proof of any wrongdoing.“There will always be some people who say it is not fair,” said NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt. “They must present evidence for their accusations.” The election commission was not immediately available but it was scheduled to hold a news conference later on Wednesday. The election was seen as a referendum on Suu Kyi’s fledgling democratic government, which is hugely popular at home but its reputation abroad has collapsed due to accusations of genocide against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority, which it denies. Despite the emergence of new parties, experts saw the election as a straight choice between the NLD and the USDP, the political juggernaut created by the military junta before it started the transition towards a civilian-led democratic system.International and local observers have said the election went smoothly without major irregularities. The US-based Carter Center said on Tuesday that voting was conducted positively in 94% of stations visited. The election commission, which is appointed by the president, was criticized before the vote over alleged errors in voter lists, censorship of broadcasts by opposition parties, and the cancellation of voting in areas affected by insurgencies.Among the critics was the military’s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who said there were “unacceptable mistakes” ahead of the polls, underlining tension between the civilian government and the military, which has a quota of house seats and control of several ministries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-s-opposition-party-demands-re-election-as-aung-san-suu-kyi-heads-for-victory/story-uz7EEl0p1xIK0HuQjkXZeI.html
11-11-2020||World||Trump appoints loyalists to top Pentagon jobs after Esper firing||A day after President Donald Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper, three staunch loyalists to the president were named to top defense jobs. Among them was a former Fox News commentator who failed to get through Senate confirmation because of offensive remarks he made, including about Islam.The abrupt changes sent reverberations through the Pentagon as nervous civilian and military personnel waited for the next shoe to drop. And they fuelled worries of a wider effort to drum out anyone considered not loyal enough to Trump.The unease was palpable inside the building throughout the day over concerns about what the Trump administration may do in the months before President-elect Joe Biden takes office and whether there will be a greater effort to politicize the historically apolitical military. While radical policy shifts seem unlikely before the January 20 inauguration, the changes could further damage prospects for a smooth transition already hampered by Trump’s refusal to concede his election loss.James Anderson, who had been acting undersecretary for policy, resigned Tuesday morning and he was quickly replaced by Anthony Tata, a retired Army one-star general. A short time later, Joseph Kernan, a retired Navy vice admiral, stepped down as undersecretary for intelligence, hastening what had been an already planned post-election departure. Kernan was replaced by Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who becomes acting undersecretary for intelligence.Also Read: Republicans searching for problems with Wisconsin electionThe departures came on Christopher Miller’s second day on the job as defense chief. Miller also brought in his own chief of staff, Kash Patel, to replace Jen Stewart, who had worked in that job for Esper. Patel and Cohen-Watnick are both considered staunchly loyal to Trump and previously worked at the National Security Council.Patel was among the small group of aides who travelled with Trump extensively during the final stretch of the campaign. He also is a former prosecutor in the national security division of the Department of Justice and former staff member on the House Intelligence Committee. In that post, he was a top aide to Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., leading the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.Patel was linked in media accounts to efforts to discredit the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. He moved to the National Security Council in February 2019, and earlier this year, he travelled to Syria for rare high-level talks aimed at securing the release of two Americans who have been missing for years, including journalist Austin Tice.Cohen-Watnick was a protégé of Trump’s initial national security adviser, Michael Flynn, but was replaced in the summer of 2017 by Flynn’s successor, H.R. McMaster, as part of a string of shakeups at the White House and National Security Council.While the personnel changes added to the tumult in the wake of Esper’s departure, it’s not clear how much impact they could have on the massive Pentagon bureaucracy. The department is anchored by the tenet of civilian control of the military, and much of the day-to-day activities are conducted by career policy experts and military leaders in the U.S. and around the globe who adhere to a strict chain of command.Also, many of Trump’s policies and defense priorities have already been put in motion by Esper and his predecessors, guided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including the chairman, Army Gen. Mark Milley. All of those military leaders remain in place.This is Trump’s second attempt to secure the policy job for Tata. Earlier this year, Trump appointed Tata to the post, but the Senate cancelled a hearing on the nomination when it became clear that it would be difficult if not impossible to get him confirmed. Tata withdrew his name from consideration for the job, which is the third-highest position in the department. Trump then appointed Tata to serve in the job of deputy undersecretary.There has been continuing tumult in the Pentagon’s policy shop. John Rood was forced to resign as undersecretary for policy in February after he drew White House ire for warning against the US withholding aid to Ukraine, the issue that led to the president’s impeachment.Tata will be “performing the duties of” the undersecretary job, rather than holding the “acting” title. Officials who carry the “acting” title have more authority than those who are “performing the duties of” the job.According to reports, Tata posted tweets in 2018 calling Islam the “most oppressive violent religion I know of,” and he called former President Barack Obama a “terrorist leader” and referred to him as Muslim. The tweets were later taken down.At the time of the Senate hearing, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash. and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Trump must not prioritize loyalty over competence and install someone in a job if the “appointee cannot gain the support of the Senate, as is clearly the case with Tata.”Defense officials said Miller, who previously was director of the National Counterterrorism Center, continues meeting with staff and becoming familiar with the Pentagon and its wide range of complex and critical national security issues and mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-appoints-loyalists-to-top-pentagon-jobs-after-esper-firing/story-wqoxivTCpuJV1xtm5IvJrM.html

11-11-2020||World||Hong Kong opposition to quit as China moves to quash dissent||Hong Kong’s opposition bloc planned to resign on Wednesday after China moved to disqualify lawmakers who aren’t deemed sufficiently loyal, one of Beijing’s strongest moves yet to quash dissent in the territory.More than a dozen members of the pro-democracy camp of the 70-seat Legislative Council will quit at a press conference later Wednesday following the disqualification of four members under Beijing’s new rules, democratic politician Fernando Cheung said by phone.“This move makes it clear that dictatorship has descended on to Hong Kong and that Chinese Communist Party can eradicate all opposing voices in the legislature,” Cheung said. “There’s no more separation of powers, no more ‘one country, two systems,’ and therefore no more Hong Kong as we know it.”China’s top legislative body earlier passed a measure requiring Hong Kong lawmakers to demonstrate loyalty to the central government, curbing debate in a democratic institution that has endured more than two decades after the former British colony’s return. The decision of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee is “conducive to the long-term peace and stability, as well as prosperity and development of Hong Kong,” Chairman Li Zhanshu said at the close of its two-day meeting.Offences included supporting Hong Kong independence, refusing to recognize China’s sovereignty over the city, asking foreign countries to intervene, failing to uphold the territory’s Basic Law or pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and “engaging in any other acts that endanger national security,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said.“We need to have a political body that’s composed of patriots,” Lam said at a briefing on Wednesday, echoing similar statements from China’s top agencies overseeing Hong Kong. She dismissed concerns that Hong Kong would have a “rubber-stamp” legislature if the pro-democracy members resigned, saying she welcomes “diverse opinion.”Hong Kong Ousts Four Lawmakers After China Passes Patriotism LawThe resolution is the latest sign of China’s determination to rein in dissent in the wake of anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong last year. Beijing bypassed the Legislative Council to impose controversial national security legislation in June, causing the Group of Seven nations to accuse China of violating the terms of its handover agreement with the UK and prompting the Trump administration to sanction more than a dozen senior officials who oversee the city.A mass resignation would highlight international concerns about China’s human rights practices just as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on a promise to defend democratic values around the world. He has vowed to “fully enforce” legislation signed by President Donald Trump that punishes Beijing for eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Wednesday called the matter “purely China’s internal affairs,” and warned foreign governments to avoid “interference or wanton comments.”The ability to purge opposition lawmakers would make it easier for Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed politicians to control the Legislative Council if they win an unprecedented majority in elections that the government has postponed -- citing coronavirus concerns -- over the protests of democracy advocates.The move by Beijing will demolish any opposition in the legislature and allow the Hong Kong government to ram through even more restrictive measures in the coming years, said Ivan Choy, a senior lecturer at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.‘Beijing is trying to eradicate any political opposition’“The situation is quite clear in Hong Kong that Beijing is trying to eradicate any political opposition, whether it’s the moderate or the radical wing,” Choy said. “In the next two years, I think they’ll do even more nasty things to strengthen their draconian rule.”The disqualified lawmakers on Wednesday were Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung, Hong Kong’s government said in a statement. The four lawmakers had been criticized by authorities for using delay tactics common in democratic legislatures around the world.“The people of Hong Kong should not give up,” Kwok Ka-ki said as opposition members briefed Wednesday. “We can’t give up.”The move will raise new questions about the future of the legislature, perhaps the most high-profile platform for open debate left under Beijing’s rule. After several “localist” activists were among a record 29 opposition lawmakers elected in 2016, China handed down a ruling that led to the disqualification of a half dozen lawmakers.Several remaining lawmakers are also facing criminal charges related to various protests against the government, including seven charged in recent months with participating in a May scuffle at the Legislative Council.“It means, effectively, the end of meaningful opposition in Hong Kong and the acceleration of the integration of Hong Kong into the mainland party state,” said Antony Dapiran, a Hong Kong-based lawyer and author of “City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong.” “Going forward, Legco will only be comprised of Beijing-friendly people and the scope for opposition figures, even if they get into Legco, to do anything meaningful will be constrained to the extent that the Legco becomes like the NPC: a rubber-stamp parliament.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-opposition-to-quit-as-china-moves-to-quash-dissent/story-YCixOokISTbs2yFwMWLGrJ.html

Than Htay, leader of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), said in a video on the party’s official Facebook page that it was pursuing legal options and urged viewers to send in evidence of “illegal acts”.“There were many contentious events during the whole voting process, whether in line with the law or not, and more facts are coming out,” he said, without specifying. “We will continue to work according to the law to receive the result our supporters want.”Sunday’s election was seen as a referendum on the fledgling democratic government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD), which remains very popular at home but has seen its overseas reputation battered by accusations of genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority, which it denies. The NLD has said it won more than the 322 seats in parliament needed to form a government based on data compiled from reports by party agents at polling stations nationwide. The election commission is yet to announce a final tally, but the several dozen seats it has announced so far put the NLD comfortably ahead.The commission, which is appointed by the president, was criticized in the run-up to the vote over alleged errors in voter lists, censorship of broadcasts by opposition parties, and the cancellation of voting in areas affected by insurgencies. A commission spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. The NLD said it was ready to cooperate if any reliable evidence of violations was provided.“We are also ready to resolve it according to the law,” party spokesman Myo Nyunt said by phone. International and local observers have said the election went smoothly without major irregularities. The U.S-based Carter Center said on Tuesday entry for observers was restricted in three centres where votes were being tabulated but that voting was conducted positively in 94% of stations visited. Candidates can file objections within 45 days of the results to tribunals appointed by the election commission, but cannot appeal the judgments at an independent court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-s-army-backed-party-alleges-contentious-events-during-election/story-t2S0g4PfRS9hTDvP9NlgZO.html
11-11-2020||World||Hong Kong disqualifies 4 pro-democracy legislators||Hong Kong has moved to disqualify four pro-democracy legislators, after Beijing passed a resolution that would allow the local government to remove lawmakers from their positions if they’re deemed to threaten national security.The disqualification came after the National People’s Congress Standing Committee, which held meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, passed a resolution stating that those who support the city’s independence or refuse to acknowledge China’s sovereignty over the city, as well as commit acts that threaten national security or ask external forces to interfere in the city’s affairs should be disqualified, according to the state-owned Xinhua News Agency.The four lawmakers – Alvin Yeung, Dennis Kwok, Kwok Ka-ki and Kenneth Leung – confirmed that they were disqualified in a news conference with the press.“In terms of legality and constitutionality, obviously from our point of view this is clearly in breach of basic law and our rights to participate in public affairs, and a failure to observe due process,” said Kwok.On Monday, 19 lawmakers from the pro-democracy camp said they would resign en masse if Beijing moved to disqualify any pro-democracy lawmakers.A mass resignation by the pro-democracy camp would leave Hong Kong’s legislature with only pro-Beijing lawmakers. The pro-Beijing camp already makes up a majority of the city’s legislature, and would allow lawmakers to pass bills favored by Beijing without opposition.Earlier in the year, the four now-disqualified pro-democracy lawmakers were barred from running for legislative elections originally scheduled for September, prior to the government stating that it would postpone the elections by a year due to the coronavirus situation. The four lawmakers later remained in their posts following the postponement.The elections postponement was criticized by the pro-democracy camp as an attempt to block them from taking a majority of seats in the legislature, after they had held an unofficial pro-democracy primary participated in by over 600,000 voters to decide which candidates to field.Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam is expected to hold a news conference later Wednesday to address the disqualifications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-disqualifies-4-pro-democracy-legislators/story-EMsxc1z7Kw0DcN6JIJE2UP.html

As many as 1,708 cases were detected in the last 24 hours, taking the nationwide Covid-19 tally to 348,184, while the death toll reached 7,021 with 21 more patients succumbing to the viral infection, the health ministry said.The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) -- the nerve centre to synergise and articulate unified national effort against Covid-19 -- was briefed on Tuesday about the threat of rising positivity as the rate of coronavirus cases once again surpassed five per cent after a gap of over three months, the Dawn News reported.The highest increase of 16.71% was observed in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), followed by Balochistan (8.71%), Sindh (5.39%), Punjab (4.46%) and Gilgit-Baltistan (3.24%); while in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, cases were decreased by 4.92% and 4.61%, respectively. In Pakistan, the maximum positivity rate had reached 23% in June. It was brought down to 1.7% in September, the report said.Read more | PM Modi takes dig at Pakistan during virtual SCO meetingPositivity rate is the percentage of positive results out of the total number of tests sampled. The positivity rate was 11.79% on March 30, 19.95% on May 25 and 22.24% on June 1. Later, it started dropping and reached 16% on July 6, 3% on August 10 and 1.7% on September 21. An upward trend in the positivity rate was spotted the following month as it reached 2.49% on October 19, 4.26% on November 2 and 5.13% on November 10.Similarly, the trend of new admissions due to Covid-19 has also started rising as 131 patients were admitted in hospitals, across the country, as compared to 46 on October 5, the report said. The NCOC was informed that among healthcare workers, 8,573 cases were confirmed which was 3% of overall Covid-19 cases. According to the latest data released by NCOC, the number of active Covid-19 in Pakistan has increased by more than 14,000 cases in the last eight weeks. The total number of active cases on November 10 was 20,045 as against 5,831 on September 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sudden-spurt-in-coronavirus-cases-in-pakistan/story-HDy6FbUjGqLSNCeMu4s16O.html
11-11-2020||World||Biden warns Johnson of Brexit risk to Northern Ireland peace||Joe Biden used his first phone call with Boris Johnson as US president-elect to warn the British leader not to compromise peace in Northern Ireland in his pursuit of Brexit.During the course of a 20- to 25-minute conversation on Tuesday, Biden “reaffirmed his support” for the 1998 deal that put an end to the violence in Northern Ireland, according to a statement from the president-elect’s team.A British official confirmed that Biden raised the Good Friday Agreement in the context of Brexit negotiations, and that Johnson responded by promising the president-elect that Britain would uphold the peace accord. Biden spoke later to Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, and again made a point of emphasizing his backing for peace in the region.The exchange with Johnson marks an uncomfortable start to the newest incarnation of the so-called special relationship between the UK and the US and suggests Biden will not be an unequivocal backer of Johnson’s Brexit project in the way President Donald Trump has been.The two men have never met in person, and Biden has shown himself to be fiercely proud of his Irish roots. His transition to power comes at a delicate phase in the UK’s divorce from the European Union. Unlike Trump, Biden was opposed to Brexit and has aired his views on it.Also Read | UK govt defiant after House of Lords rejects Brexit billKnown HistoryBack in September, Biden raised his concerns over Johnson’s plan to break international law by reneging on parts of the Brexit divorce agreement he struck with the EU relating to trade with Northern Ireland. President Barack Obama, who Biden served under, famously weighed in on the 2016 referendum to say that if the UK opted out of the EU the US would be put at the “back of the queue” when it came to trade talks.Those talks, begun under Trump, will now likely be followed up by a Biden administration in a process that could take years, judging by the length of previous trade negotiations.Biden had said in September that any US trade deal with the UK must be “contingent” on respecting the Northern Ireland peace agreement and avoiding a return to a hard border with the Republic of Ireland.A British official said the call was friendly and good. The UK has always insisted its plans do not compromise peace in the region and are intended to safeguard stability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-warns-johnson-of-brexit-not-to-disturb-peace-in-northern-ireland/story-wcNpxODv3Q7318PMKtH3FL.html

The new Host Nation Support agreement will replace the existing agreement which expires on March 31, 2021,” a statement on the Foreign Ministry’s website read.The delegations were led by Yutaka Arima, Deputy Director-General at Japan’s North American Affairs Bureau and Donna Welton, Senior Advisor at the US State Department’s Political-Military Bureau, according to the statement. High-ranking defense officials were also part of both sides.A day prior, Japanese defense minister Nobuo Kishi said that Tokyo would seek a stopgap one-year funding deal, instead of the usual five-year agreement. This holds out hope that the upcoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden would reverse Trump’s demands to increase spending.The current agreement on sharing the cost burden of maintaining the military bases runs out at the end of the fiscal year, in March 2021. Preparatory talks between the two sides have so far taken place virtually at a lower level of diplomats in October.Japan last year shelled out over USD 1.8 billion to sustain numerous US military bases, airfields and installations. Trump’s Pentagon has been pushing to increase the spending to about USD 8 billion per year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-washington-conclude-first-round-of-formal-talks-on-us-military-base-spending/story-zNiLO4lHOxGzN9ijZrJ81K.html
11-11-2020||World||Russia says its Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine is 92% effective||Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine is 92% effective at protecting people from Covid-19 according to interim trial results, the country’s sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday, as Moscow rushes to keep pace with Western drugmakers in the race for a shot.The initial results are only the second to be published from a late-stage human trial in the global race to produce a vaccine that could halt a pandemic that has killed more than 1.2 million people and ravaged the world economy.Russia registered Sputnik V for public use in August, the first country to do so, though the approval came before the start of the large-scale trial in September.The interim results are based on data from the first 16,000 trial participants to receive both shots of the two-dose vaccine, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which has been backing the vaccine and marketing it globally, said.The so-called Phase III trial of the shot developed by the Gamaleya Institute is taking place in 29 clinics across Moscow and will involve 40,000 volunteers in total, with a quarter receiving a placebo shot.The chances of contracting Covid-19 were 92% lower among people vaccinated with Sputnik V than those who received the placebo, the RDIF said.That’s well above the 50% effectiveness threshold for Covid-19 vaccines set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.“We are showing, based on the data, that we have a very effective vaccine,” said RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev, adding that it was the sort of news that the vaccine’s developers would talk about one day with their grandchildren.Russia’s announcement follows swiftly on from results posted on Monday by vaccine developers Pfizer Inc and BioNTech , who said their shot was also more than 90% effective.The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology and is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles.The Sputnik V vaccine is designed to trigger a response from two shots administered 21 days apart each based on different viral vectors that normally cause the common cold: human adenoviruses Ad5 and Ad26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-says-its-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-is-92-effective/story-dqscH3kxsDeUPfJwyvroKL.html

11-11-2020||World||China says Australia knows what is needed to improve ties amid strained relations||China indicated that it wants Australia to act to improve strained relations, saying Canberra should know what needs to be done to get ties back on track.“China has been pragmatic in growing its business relations with all partners. A healthy relationship needs the nurturing and care of both sides,” Assistant Minister of Commerce Li Chenggang said Wednesday at a press conference in Beijing. “Australia should know more clearly than China what it needs to do to improve this relationship.”Ties between the two nations have worsened rapidly this year after Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic in China. Beijing, meanwhile, has placed tariffs on Australian barley imports, banned some other imports and ordered traders to stop buying at least seven commodities including coal, copper and wine -- actions which Australian ministers have labeled “economic coercion.”China Turns to Lobsters, Wine and Coal to ‘Punish’ AustraliaLi’s comments were similar to a statement last week from China’s Foreign Ministry, which also urged Australia to act first.“Mutual respect is the basis and prerequisite for state-to-state cooperation,” ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said then. “Once again we urge some in Australia to reflect upon their deeds, do more things that are conducive to mutual trust, cooperation and the China-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership, and create favourable conditions and atmosphere for bilateral practical cooperation across the board.”Also Read: Xi says SCO member states should resolve disputes, differences through dialogueThe Australian government needs to calm down and see the huge potential of China’s market, according to a former senior Commerce Ministry official.To improve ties, “first of all, Australia has to stop making irresponsible remarks,” Wei Jianguo, a former vice commerce minister, said Wednesday. “Second, you have to import Chinese products based on WTO principles, especially 5G and digital products, rather than using security grounds at will.”“Third, and I think this is very important, we should strengthen mutual trust,” he said, adding that the situation would worsen if things weren’t corrected. Wei denied that any ban had placed placed on imports from Australia, calling this “rumors by Australian media.”Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham declined to comment to Bloomberg about Li’s remarks.In an interview Monday with Sky News, Birmingham said the government was still unable to make contact with China at a ministerial level -- a stalemate that has been in place since Australia called for independent investigators to be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the pandemic.“There are problems, and there are deeply troubling and concerning aspects, to some elements of that trade relationship at present,” Birmingham told Sky News. “So we are continuing to closely monitor that and trying to work out all diplomatic and government-to-government levels that we can to secure a better understanding and resolution of some of those concerns.”Ties between the key trading partners have grown increasingly strained in recent years, with Canberra barring Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network, and amid accusations of Chinese interference in Australia’s internal politics. Beijing’s retaliatory moves come as Australia -- whose economy is the most dependent in the world on China -- tries to pull out of its first recession in almost three decades.The Chinese pressure came from many sides, with an editorial Tuesday in the state-backed China Daily also calling on the Australian government to resolve contentious issues.“Australia should see clearly the bright prospect of the bilateral cooperation and meet China halfway to push the bilateral relationship back on track at an early date,” China Daily said.Earlier this week, in an interview with an Australian newspaper, a researcher at a Chinese government-connected think tank said Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government needed to act to improve ties.Researcher Mei Xinyu, who works at a think tank under China’s Commerce Ministry, suggested Australia should offer to send government ministers to China and should express interest in Beijing’s new five-year economic plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-australia-knows-what-is-needed-to-improve-ties-amid-strained-relations/story-4q2PTid1gvLAPXIAKZ1T9K.html
11-11-2020||World||ASEAN nations to sign China-backed trade deal amid US presidential uncertainty||Southeast Asian leaders start meetings on Thursday that are expected to lead to an ambitious China-backed trade deal at a time the still uncertain election result in the United States leaves questions over its engagement in the region.Leaders of the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand are scheduled to conclude talks on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) this Sunday.The deal, which is expected to be signed later on Sunday on the sidelines of a mostly online, four-day ASEAN summit in Hanoi, will take years to complete but will progressively lower tariffs across many areas and could become the world’s biggest trade agreement. The 15 participating RCEP countries make up nearly a third of the world’s people and account for 29% of global gross domestic product. China is already the biggest source of imports and destination for exports for would-be RCEP members.“The signing of RCEP will provide momentum for regional trade, particularly between signatories,” said Nguyen Quoc Dung, deputy foreign minister of Vietnam, which is chairing ASEAN meetings this year.Also Read: Chinese proxies systematically threatening expats living in Canada: ReportThe summit comes while the result of the US presidential election has yet to be declared despite Democrat Joe Biden projected to have comfortably won the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. Biden, who was vice president during President Barack Obama’s “Asian pivot”, is expected to steer away from Trump’s “America First” agenda and re-engage more actively in the region. But legal challenges to the election result and the firing of the US defense secretary by Trump risk raising concerns among US allies at a time that China’s influence is growing.Trump’s tariff-raising trade war with China has given extra impetus in recent years to push ahead with the RCEP, which had otherwise progressed only sluggishly since negotiations began in 2012.The deal, which is expected to be the most significant agreement at this year’s ASEAN summit, will likely cement China’s position more firmly as an economic partner with Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea, and put it in a better position to shape the region’s trade rules.“The uncertainty regarding the US election raises questions regarding US participation in relevant meetings and may give China a chance to influence the narrative about America’s engagement with the region,” said Le Hong Hiep, a fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asean-nations-to-sign-china-backed-trade-deal-amid-us-presidential-uncertainty/story-O9uJLafix4i6Txye6oxIvL.html
11-11-2020||World||Bahrain Prime minister, world’s longest-serving, dies At 84||Bahrain’s Prime minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al Khalifa has died, the royal palace announced on Wednesday on Twitter. He was a dominant figure in the Gulf island’s politics for much of his near half century in power. He passed away on Wednesday morning at Mayo clinic hospital in the United States, Bahrain’s state news agency said. Khalifa, 84, the uncle of King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, had served as prime minister since the Sunni Muslim-led island kingdom declared independence from Britain in 1971, almost half a century. The al-Khalifa family has ruled since 1783.Born on November 24,1935, he was a Bahraini royal and politician who has served as the Prime minister of Bahrain since 1970, taking office over a year before Bahrain’s independence on 15 August 1971.He was the longest-serving Prime minister of any government in the world although under the 2002 constitution he lost some of his powers, with the King having the authority to appoint and (along with the Bahraini parliament) dismiss ministers. His stern response to pro-democracy protests in Bahrain in 2011 -- and criticism of similar unrest across the Arab world -- underlined what for many was the defining characteristic of his career, namely a stalwart defence of dynastic rule.In August last year, Sheikh Kahlifa left the kingdom for what official media called at the time “a private visit abroad”. Earlier this year he spent time in Germany for unspecified medical treatment, returning to Bahrain in March. The burial ceremony will take place upon the repatriation of his body and the funeral will be limited to a specific number of relatives, Bahrain’s state news agency said. Official mourning has been declared for a week and government ministries and departments will close for three days starting Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bahrain-prime-minister-has-died-royal-palace-says/story-zXxSfyK6qQGIO2mgsAi9aJ.html

11-11-2020||World||Singapore, Hong Kong to resume flights with special air travel bubble||Hong Kong and Singapore will start an air travel bubble that will replace quarantine with Covid-19 testing from Nov. 22, officials said in separate media briefings Wednesday.There will be several flights a week on Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. from that date, rising to daily from Dec. 7. A maximum of 200 people will be permitted on each flight and details of the arrangement, released nearly a month after the two Asian hubs first announced they’d reopen their borders to one another, will be reviewed after one month.Singapore Minister for Transport Ong Ye Kung said at a news briefing that this was the first travel bubble of its type and may be used as a template for other countries, if successful. The travel bubble will help ensure a brighter future for the city-state’s Changi Airport and Singapore Airlines, he said.Travel bubbles are seen as key to reopening borders ahead of the rollout of an effective and internationally recognized vaccine. But they’ve been hard to put into practice as the coronavirus continues to spread or flare again in much of the world. Cases globally have surpassed 51 million while deaths are nearing 1.3 million.Even the Singapore-Hong Kong arrangement comes with a long list of requirements and some restrictions. Ong said the waiting time for a Covid test would likely be about four hours and fares would be a commercial decision for the two airlines.“I suspect travelers might well be quite careful in the beginning before they gradually become more confident,” Ong said. “I suspect that many Singaporeans and Hong Kongers will take a wait-and-see attitude until after awhile you can do one test less perhaps.”Medical CostsFlying on the travel bubble between the two cities will also require a degree of paperwork. Tests should be taken within 72 hours prior to departure and applications for travel approval should be done online at least seven days ahead of time. Should travelers become Covid positive in either city, they would need to bear the full cost of any medical treatment provided to them.Shares in Singapore Airlines dipped after the announcement, down 0.3%. Cathay rose 1.4%. Both carriers rose sharply on Tuesday after a study showing a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE protects most people from the coronavirus.Having brought their Covid-19 outbreaks largely under control, Hong Kong and Singapore are eager to prise open their borders and get their economies ticking back to life again. Hong Kong’s total reported infections stand at 5,389, while Singapore’s tally is just over 58,000. That contrasts with many nations in Europe, as well as the US, which is now reporting over 100,000 cases a day.“Both Singapore and Hong Kong rely a lot on the success of the airlines and airports for their economies,” said Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics.Officials from Hong Kong and Singapore said on Oct. 15 that quarantine would be replaced by coronavirus testing and that the two cities were hoping to start it in November. Travelers must have been in Hong Kong or Singapore for 14 days before departure and need to take and pass mutually recognized virus tests.On Nov. 3, Hong Kong announced new rules stating that arrivals from anywhere other than mainland China would have to quarantine in a hotel for 14 days. But visitors from Singapore will be exempted from this under the travel bubble agreement.Affordable TestingSingapore already allows people from five countries for general travel without having to serve quarantine, though they still have to isolate when they return home. The city-state is also assessing the risk travelers pose based on where they are arriving from. The priority is to have effective tests to replace the quarantine requirements that deter people from flying overseas.“Affordable testing will be the key to reviving travel,” said Mayur Patel, OAG Aviation Worldwide Ltd.’s regional sales director for Japan and Asia Pacific. “If the cost of testing is too expensive, it’s not going to drive demand.”“We are obviously very keen to make the travel bubble a success,” Lee Lik Hsin, Singapore Airlines’ executive vice president of commercial, said on Monday. “Of course we do have to take into account the various considerations that the government, the regulators will have in approving such a bubble and being experimental, you can expect some level of conservatism.”The pressure is on for places like Hong Kong and Singapore, which depend on international trade and tourism. Ong has warned that Singapore’s future is at stake.Opening borders is also important for flag carriers Singapore Airlines and Cathay as they’ve been reduced to flying at just skeleton capacity because they have no domestic market in which to operate. Last year, the Hong Kong-Singapore route was the 10th busiest internationally in Asia, according to OAG. Both airlines have suffered record losses this year.Ticket prices have risen in anticipation of the Hong Kong-Singapore bubble. The lowest fares on Singapore Airlines economy class rose to S$678 ($500) for return flights in December, up from S$557 earlier this month, according to the carrier’s website. The airline doesn’t plan to use its Airbus SE A380 superjumbos for flights to and from Hong Kong when an agreement on opening up is reached, Lee said.Hopes for travel bubbles elsewhere have hit snags. Australia and New Zealand eventually formed a corridor after some setbacks due to virus flareups, only for it to transpire that some passengers flying into Sydney subsequently broke the rules by connecting to other places. The quarantine-free agreement only covers parts of Australia and isn’t reciprocated in kind in New Zealand, meaning it falls far short of initial hopes.“Singapore is probably among the most pro-active nations in the world when it comes to looking at ways to open up and reduce travel restrictions,” Singapore Airlines Chief Executive Goh Choon Phong said at a post-results briefing on Monday. “This will serve as a very good pilot and example of how we can actually open up travel in a safe manner for everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-hong-kong-to-resume-flights-with-special-air-travel-bubble/story-mRCXQ7bH22KF9AjCUxmu1H.html
11-11-2020||World||Indian-origin Canadian MP quits over breach of ethics||An Indian-origin member of Canada’s House of Commons has resigned from the ruling Liberal Party of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after revelations that she had breached ethics norms by hiring her sister for a public job in her constituency office.Yasmin Ratansi, who was born in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and has roots in Kutch, Gujarat, is an MP from the Toronto riding of Don Valley East. Interestingly, Ratansi had recently moved a petition in the House of Commons to criticise the Indian government over its actions in Jammu & Kashmir.She had presented a petition in parliament in late September protesting the revocation of Article 370 and seeking the appointment of a fact-finding mission. Pro-Pakistan groups in Canada had welcomed the petition which asked the Government of Canada to “condemn the siege of Kashmir.” Ratansi claimed an “error in judgement” in employing her sister for the taxpayer-funded job. “I have remedied the situation, but this does not excuse the error I made,” she said in a statement posted on social media. The case is being reviewed by Canada’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described her action as “unacceptable.” During a media interaction, Trudeau said, according to the outet Global News, “I am deeply disappointed by the news I learned yesterday from Ms Ratansi and how she handled the office. It is unacceptable and I expect there will be a thorough follow up by administration on this.”Meanwhile, the national broadcaster CBC reported that four of Ratansi’s employees alleged the MP mistreated them and created a “toxic and verbally abusive” environment in the office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-origin-canadian-mp-quits-over-breach-of-ethics/story-rJiugb4SK4fsIwAoeGXrFL.html
11-11-2020||World||Chinese proxies systematically threatening expats living in Canada: Report||The Chinese government deploys “trusted agents” or proxies for its state agencies in Canada to threaten and intimidate members of its diaspora community into refraining from criticism of the regime, using tactics such as retributive action against family and friends in the mainland, a media report said.This strategy employed by Beijing has now been recognised by Canada’s spy agency, Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), according to a report in the national daily, Globe and Mail.While these tactics may be used to force fugitives to return to China, a CSIS spokesperson told the daily that they could also be utilised “for silencing dissent, pressuring political opponents and instilling a general fear of state power no matter where a person is located.”“Certain foreign states routinely attempt to threaten and intimidate individuals around the world through various state entities and non-state proxies. These states, such as the People’s Republic of China, may use a combination of their intelligence and security services as well as trusted agents to assist them in conducting various forms of threat activities,” the spokesperson said.In the strongest public denunciation of China’s bullying of its expat community in Canada, the CSIS spokesperson also added that the “fear of state-backed or state-linked retribution targeting both them and their loved ones, in Canada and abroad, can force individuals to submit to foreign interference”. Taken together, such activities “constitute a threat to Canada’s sovereignty and to the safety of Canadians,” he said, while asking Chinese-Canadians to report such coercion to Canadian law enforcement.Such actions of the Chinese government echo those occurring in the United States, under the name of Operation Fox Hunt, which the Federal Bureau of Investigation director Christopher Wray had said was launched under the direction of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2014 through the Ministry of Public Security to “target Chinese nationals who he sees as threats and who live outside China, around the world.”These revelations come even as protests against Beijing have burgeoned in Canada. Multiple marches and other events have been jointly organised by community groups with their roots in Hong Kong, Tibet and also Uighurs, to protest Chinese Government measures including a controversial security law in Hong Kong and persecution of minorities. Reacting to the report, Shuvaloy Majumdar, Program Director and Munk Senior Fellow for Foreign Policy at the Ottawa-based Macdonald Laurier Institute, told the Hindustan Times, “It is now apparent through many reports that the CCP pursues a systematic campaign of intimidation against Canadians - in Hong Kong, and across Canada. They underestimate the strength of this country and what binds all Canadians together.”The Canadian spy agency’s statement also comes as relations between China and Canada have cratered after the arrest of two Canadians, including a diplomat, in China in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described as “hostage diplomacy”. The Canadian government has asserted those arrests were taken in retaliation to the detention of a senior executive of the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei in Vancouver in late 2018 on charges of defrauding a bank to bypass sanctions against Iran. Critics of China’s interference in Canadian matters have also pointed to the role of other State-backed outfits such as the Confucius Institutes and the United Front Work Department, which is part of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee apparatus.Last month, China’s ambassador Cong Peiwu had riled the Canadian government by saying that Canada should stop giving asylum to “violent criminals” from Hong Kong, the pro-democracy activists, if it “really cares about the good health and safety of those 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong, and a large number of Canadian companies operating in Hong Kong.” That veiled threat received a rebuke from Trudeau, as he said, “We will stand up loudly and clearly for human rights, all around the world, whether it’s talking about the situation faced by the Uighurs, whether it’s talking about the very concerning situation in Hong Kong, whether it’s calling out China for its coercive diplomacy.” Opposition leaders had then asked Ottawa to withdraw the diplomatic credentials of the envoy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-proxies-systematically-threatening-expats-living-in-canada-report/story-H36CyqYobJfhu6tuuCyqhM.html

Kang said she conveyed the South Korean government’s commitment to advance the alliance and work together on North Korea issues, while hearing about Biden’s views on foreign policy issues during the meetings. “I highlighted the need to reinforce diplomatic efforts to achieve the goal of completely denuclearising the Korean peninsula given the urgency of the North Korean nuclear issue,” she told reporters. “I put a particular emphasis on the importance of a swift restart of US-North Korea dialogue ... as an issue that requires a priority, summit-level interests.” The office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in said separately on Wednesday it was arranging a phone call between Moon and Biden for Thursday. Kang said she was looking forward to having early formal discussions after Biden is sworn in, building on past experiences working with Democratic administrations. Kang also met incumbent White House National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien.

The island province of Catanduanes and nearby Albay, both southeast of the capital Manila, bore the brunt of Typhoon Goni in late October, a category 5 typhoon that killed 25 people and left six people missing.Vamco is due to make landfall in Polilio Island on Wednesday evening and hit rice-producing provinces north of the capital before exiting the Philippines’ main island of Luzon on Thursday, Chris Perez, a state weather forecaster, told DZMM. Residents in coastal communities, who are expecting up to a three-metre (nine foot) storm surge, were ordered to leave their homes, said Cristina Bosque, mayor of Polilio. But ensuring the prevention of the spread of Covid-19 in evacuation centres remained a challenge, she said.The Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, sees around 20 tropical storms annually. After lashing the Philippines, Vamco is forecast to head towards Vietnam. Vietnam’s weather agency is expecting Vamco to arrive in its central region on Sunday, bringing intense rains.Floods and mudslides over the past month have killed at least 160 people in central Vietnam, left dozens missing and damaged 390,000 houses, official data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippine-authorities-evacuate-thousands-as-typhoon-vamco-approaches/story-lSsmlMRCJKbvNcmSwwXEGI.html

But the latest body blow to the industry was just delivered courtesy of Covid-19, via a mutation of the virus found in mink.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The animals have emerged as highly efficient spreaders of the coronavirus, potentially complicating efforts to control a pandemic that’s already claimed more than a million human lives. Last week, Denmark revealed it had found a variant of the virus that officials fear could be so disruptive that it justified ordering the extermination of the country’s entire mink population -- 17 million animals.Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has acknowledged that wiping out all breeding mink means the industry may not recover in Denmark, which is among the world’s biggest producers of the fur.“My position remains that the mink have to be culled, because they pose a risk to human health,” she said in Copenhagen on Tuesday.As the prospects grow that mink farming could derail efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic, the future of Europe’s fur industry seems less certain than ever. Outside Denmark, other mink producing nations are watching closely as they figure out their next steps.“We are alarmed by the news from Denmark,” said Nadezhda Zubkova, executive director for Russia’s National Association of Fur Animal Breeders. “But so far it’s about scientists’ assumptions.”In Sweden, authorities say they have transmission of the virus among mink under control. But roughly a quarter of Swedish mink farms have had outbreaks, and the industry realizes it can’t ignore the risks. Jorgen Martinsson, the head of Swedish Mink, said in a Facebook post that “we must never hide from the difficult questions.”The Luxury IndustryThe real shift might come from within the luxury industry itself. Diana Verde Nieto, co-founder of Positive Luxury, which rates the social and environmental impact of high-end brands, says that the “spread of the virus among the mink population in Denmark is likely to be another wake-up call.”“The world as a whole has to re-think our relationship with nature,” she said.LVMH established a supply charter last year that aims to protect biodiversity. While the world’s largest luxury conglomerate lets its brands decide whether or not to use fur, one of the goals of the new policy is to make it possible to trace pelts back to the breeding farms.Also Read | Covid-19 raises serious questions for Denmark’s mink farmersEven before mink became associated with coronavirus mutations, the industry was facing a bleak future. Global mink production has dropped to about 45 million pelts, almost half the all-time high of 87 million in 2014, according to Fur Europe, a lobby group for the industry in Brussels.A Perfect StormThe organization has defended the industry, and says fur trade has played “no significant role” in spreading the disease and that mink farmers have increased screening since the pandemic began in the spring. It argues that there’s still room in the world for fur.“The fundamental demand for natural fur is strong,” Fur Europe said in a statement last week. It says the key is renewable products, rather than “today’s ‘buy and throw away’ culture.”The fur industry is well versed in battling negative campaigns and is gearing up for another fight. But the science may be hard to ignore.As Kare Molbak, Denmark’s top epidemiologist, put it in an interview with Politiken, “Mink are very easily infected by the coronavirus, and once it’s there, it spreads at the speed of light,” he said. “We’ve seen how that then spreads to humans. That makes it practically impossible to handle the spread during a pandemic.”“It’s a perfect storm,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mutant-covid-19-in-mink-raises-questions-about-the-future-of-fur/story-65N9sTPmWMshZOz0zTV0yK.html
11-11-2020||World||Democrats clinch thin majority in House but lead likely to shrink more||Democrats clinched two more years of controlling the House on Tuesday but with a potentially razor-thin majority, a bittersweet finale to last week’s elections that has left them divided and with scant margin for error for advancing their agenda.The party has now nailed down at least 218 seats, according to The Associated Press, and could win a few others when more votes are counted. While that assures command of the 435-member chamber, blindsided Democrats were all but certain to see their current 232-seat majority shrink after an unforeseen surge of Republican voters transformed expected gains of perhaps 15 seats into losses potentially approaching that amount.“We have the gavel, we have the gavel,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who seems all but certain to continue in that role. While she bemoaned Democrats’ losses in districts where GOP votes proved “almost insurmountable,” she told reporters last week, “We’ve lost some battles but we’ve won the war.”By retaining the House, Democrats will control the chamber for four consecutive years for only the second time since 1995, when Republicans ended 40 years of Democratic dominance.Yet though Joe Biden won the presidential election, there was a strong chance Republicans would keep Senate control. That would force Democrats to scale back their dreams of sweeping health care, infrastructure and other initiatives, instead needing compromises with the GOP.As the bad news sunk in, Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., who led House Democrats’ campaign committee, announced Monday she wouldn’t seek another term leading that organization. Democrats said privately she would have lost had she again sought the post, for which the party’s lawmakers vote.Republicans have been heartened by the House results, which many believe position them for a strong run for the majority in the 2022 elections. They also bolstered their distressingly low number of women representatives from 13 to at least 26, a record for the GOP, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, and were adding new ethnic minority lawmakers as well.“The Republican coalition is bigger, more diverse, more energetic than ever before,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the day after the election.Democrats went into Election Day with a 232-197 House advantage, plus an independent and five open seats. With some races remaining undecided, it was possible that in the new Congress that convenes in January they’ll have the smallest majority since Republicans had just 221 seats two decades ago.Democrats secured the majority after The Associated Press declared three winners late Tuesday: incumbents Kim Schrier in Washington, Tom O’Halleran in Arizona and Jimmy Gomez in California.A tight majority could cause headaches for Pelosi, empowering any determined group of lawmakers to pressure her on what bills should be considered or look like. But sometimes, a slender margin can help unify a party because its members know they must stick together to achieve anything.Democratic moderates and progressives clash periodically, and while the moderates are more numerous, the progressives’ ranks include influential social media stars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NYUnderscoring that tension, House Democrats vented during a three-hour conference call last week in which both factions blamed the other for rhetoric and policies they said proved costly in the campaign.“We should be honest that this was not a good outcome,” Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-NJ, a moderate freshman, said in an interview. He said terms like “defunding the police” hurt Democrats by making it sound like they oppose law enforcement, and said they shouldn’t speak “as if we were talking to woke progressives in neighborhoods where 90% of the votes are for Democrats.”Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., a progressive leader, said in an interview that Democrats need to discuss “how we talk about some of these issues that are critical to different parts of our base.” But with moderates complaining that the GOP hurt Democrats by repeatedly accusing them of pushing socialism, Jayapal said such accusations “will be used against us no matter what we say.”Democrats believed they’d pick up seats, especially in suburbs, because of a decisive fundraising edge, President Donald Trump’s unpopularity and exasperation over the pandemic. Many Republicans and independent polls supported that expectation.But with some races still uncalled, Democrats haven’t defeated a single GOP incumbent and failed to capture open GOP-held seats in Texas, Missouri and Indiana they thought they’d win.Instead, they’ve lost at least seven incumbents: six freshmen from states including Florida, Oklahoma and South Carolina plus 30-year veteran Rep. Collin Peterson from rural Minnesota. And while they successfully defended most of their 29 districts that Trump carried in his 2016 victory, they saw stronger than expected performances by GOP candidates all around the country.“With President Trump on the ballot, it just drove enormous turnout that was almost impossible to surmount,” said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a reelected freshman.“ The country has become more polarized and divided,” said Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va. “If you’re running in alien territory, you’re always at risk of failure.”So far, Democrats’ only pickups were three open seats from which Republicans retired. Two were in North Carolina, where court-ordered remapping made the districts strongly Democratic, and one was outside Atlanta.Going into the election, Democrats envisioned strengthening their moderate wing, since most districts they seemed likely to capture were closely divided between GOP and Democratic voters. But they ended up suffering losses in those same type of districts, meaning it was mostly moderates who lost.“In electoral politics, moderates are the beachfront property,” said Jim Kessler, an official with Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. “And if there’s flooding, they’re the ones that get washed away.”Illustrating that, the Blue Dog Coalition of the most conservative House Democrats, whose membership has dwindled in recent years, lost at least six of its roughly two dozen members.On the other hand, a handful of hard-left progressive freshmen will be coming to Congress, including Democrats Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri, who each won seats in overwhelmingly blue districts.On the Republican side, the conservative House Freedom Caucus was hoping to grow from its roughly 30 members.The group has tried pushing GOP leaders to the right over the years and was a consistent source of trouble for the past two Republican speakers, John Boehner of Ohio and Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrats-clinch-thin-majority-in-house-but-lead-likely-to-shrink-more/story-kAgueNy9Ils2gkbCKa0uQO.html
11-11-2020||World||UK to spend up to $57 billion on ‘Moonshot’ mass coronavirus Testing||The UK government is set to hand more than 40 billion pounds to companies that can help in its drive to ramp up mass coronavirus testing.Public Health England put out a 22 billion-pound ($29 billion) contract to tender last week for a new “national microbiology framework agreement,” which includes the manufacture and development of tests for two years, with the option to extend for another two years.A separate tender worth 20 billion pounds from the National Health Service Supply Chain, which manages the sourcing and supply of healthcare products, involves on-the-spot tests and diagnostic equipment.The government has also issued a third tender worth 912 million pounds for the supply of rapid turnaround lateral flow tests. The total scale of the contracts -- bigger than the annual budgets of some government departments -- was revealed by the Financial Times on Tuesday.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “As part of an unprecedented response to this global pandemic we have drawn on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners to support our testing program.”The total represented the maximum value of the contracts and not necessarily the final amount that will be spent, the DHSC said.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson told in September of his hopes for millions of Covid-19 tests to be processed daily -- a plan dubbed “Operation Moonshot” -- in a bid to help Britain to return to normal life as soon as possible.Liverpool in northwest England became the first city to undertake a mass testing program last week, and the government said Tuesday this could be rolled out to 66 other local areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-spend-up-to-57-billion-on-moonshot-mass-coronavirus-testing/story-TRiyCtOmCZumQheVWzss1K.html
11-11-2020||World||US has a plan to start Pfizer vaccine shots in December: Health secretary||If Pfizer Inc submits the positive initial data from its Covid-19 vaccine trial to health regulators as quickly as expected, the US government plans to begin vaccinating Americans in December, health secretary Alex Azar said on Tuesday. Pfizer on Monday said the vaccine it has been developing with German partner BioNTech SE was 90% effective against Covid-19, based on an early look at results from its large, late-stage trial.The US drugmaker said it expects to have safety data as soon as next week that it needs to apply for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the US Food and Drug Administration.Upon FDA authorization, the United States would receive about 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine per month, Azar said on a call with reporters, noting that HHS could being procuring supplies at the end of this month. The United States has a $1.95 billion contract for 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine - enough to inoculate 50 million people - with an option to acquire 500 million more.Earlier on Tuesday, Azar said on CNBC that final decisions are subject to a close look at the vaccine efficacy data.Based on recommendations to the government, it will likely start with inoculations of the elderly in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, healthcare workers and first responders, with a goal to complete those shots by the end of January.Top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci also said in an interview with MSNBC that he expects the doses of the vaccine to be available for certain high priority groups in December.Azar said he anticipates there will soon be more vaccines to protect against Covid-19 from other companies, including Moderna Inc, which is expected to announce interim results of a large trial of its experimental vaccine at the end of the month. “By the end of March, early April, we expect to have enough for every American who would like to be vaccinated,” Azar told CBNC.Antibody drug distribution Azar also said the US government would begin distribution of Eli Lilly and Co’s antibody treatment this week, starting first in areas with the highest numbers of hospitalized Covid-19 patients and overall cases.The treatment, which is administered by infusion, received an EUA on Monday.“We’ll ensure equitable distribution, and we’ll work tightly with our governors,” Azar said. He said the government will use the same process employed to distribute remdesivir, an antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences Inc used to treat people hospitalized with Covid-19.According to the Health and Human Services website, the agency will ship more than 79,000 doses of the antibody therapy this week, with the largest number going to Wisconsin, Texas, California, and Illinois. The United States has purchased 300,000 doses of the treatment for this year and has an option to buy an additional 650,000 doses next year.Azar said health officials and Eli Lilly were exploring ways to provide the treatment outside of hospitals, including through outpatient infusion centers. Fauci described the Lilly treatment as “an important first step in the development and distribution of interventions that are given early in the course of disease.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-a-plan-to-start-pfizer-vaccine-shots-in-december-health-secretary/story-xObY3TxhGYMrBtugdsfXyH.html
11-11-2020||World||Fauci says he will take new Pfizer vaccine if FDA approves it||US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said he will take Pfizer Inc’s new coronavirus vaccine if the Food and Drug Administration approves it and that he has confidence in the company and the government agency.Asked on MSNBC if he would take the vaccine, Fauci said: “I’m going to look at the data, but I trust Pfizer. I trust the FDA. These are colleagues of mine for decades, the career scientists. If they look at this data, and they say this data is solid, let’s go ahead and approve it, I promise you, I will take the vaccine, and I will recommend that my family take the vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-says-he-will-take-new-pfizer-vaccine-if-fda-approves-it/story-F0l2N8Tn4y0CEPPikL6p2J.html
11-11-2020||World||US surpasses 1 million Covid-19 cases in November||The US has surpassed 1 million new confirmed coronavirus cases in just the first 10 days of November, with more than 100,000 infections each day becoming the norm in a surge that shows no signs of slowing. The 1 million milestone came as governors across the nation are making increasingly desperate pleas with the public to take the fight against the virus more seriously. The Wisconsin governor planned to take the unusual step of delivering a live address to the state Tuesday, urging unity and cooperation to fight Covid-19. Minnesota’s governor ordered bars and restaurants to close at 10 p.m., and Iowa’s governor said she will require masks at indoor gatherings of 25 or more people, inching toward more stringent measures after months of holding out. The alarming wave of cases across the US looks bigger and is more widespread than the surges that happened in the spring, mainly in the Northeast, and then in the summer, primarily in the Sun Belt. But experts say there are also reasons to think the nation is better able to deal with the virus this time around. “We’re definitely in a better place” when it comes to improved medical tools and knowledge, said William Hanage, a Harvard University infectious-disease researcher. Newly confirmed infections in the US are running at all-time highs of well over 100,000 per day, pushing the running total to more than 10 million and eclipsing 1 million since Halloween. Several states posted records Tuesday, including more than 12,000 new cases in Illinois, 7,000 in Wisconsin and 6,500 in Ohio. Deaths — a lagging indicator, since it takes time for people to get sick and die — are climbing again, reaching an average of more than 930 a day.Hospitals are getting slammed. And unlike the earlier outbreaks, this one is not confined to a region or two. Cases are on the rise in 49 states. “The virus is spreading in a largely uncontrolled fashion across the vast majority of the country,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease expert at Vanderbilt University. While deaths are still well below the U.S. peak of about 2,200 per day back in April, some researchers estimate the nation’s overall toll will hit about 400,000 by Feb. 1, up from about 240,000 now.But there is also some good news.Doctors now better know how to treat severe cases, meaning higher percentages of the COVID-19 patients who go into intensive care units are coming out alive. Patients have the benefit of new treatments, namely remdesivir, the steroid dexamethasone and an antibody drug that won emergency-use approval from the Food and Drug Administration on Monday. Also, testing is more widely available. In addition, a vaccine appears to be on the horizon, perhaps around the end of the year, with Pfizer this week reporting early results showing that its experimental shots are a surprising 90% effective at preventing the disease. And there’s a change pending in the White House, with President-elect Joe Biden vowing to rely on a highly respected set of medical advisers and carry out a detailed coronavirus plan that experts say includes the kind of measures that will be necessary to bring the surge under control. Biden pledged during the campaign to be guided by science, make testing free and widely available, hire thousands of health workers to undertake contact-tracing, and instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide clear, expert advice. “We are already seeing encouraging signs from President-elect Biden with regard to his handling of COVID-19,” said Dr. Kelly Henning, a veteran epidemiologist who heads the Bloomberg Philanthropies’ public health programs. “I am relieved to see he’s already put some of the smartest scientific minds on his new coronavirus task force and that they are acting urgently to try and get the pandemic under control as quickly as possible.” While the first surge in the Northeast caught many Americans unprepared and cut an especially deadly swath through nursing homes, the second crest along the nation’s Southern and Western rim was attributed mostly to heedless behavior, particularly among young adults over Memorial Day and July Fourth, and hot weather that sent people indoors, where the virus spreads more easily. The fall surge similarly has been blamed largely on cold weather driving people inside and disdain for masks and social distancing, stoked by President Donald Trump and other politicians. Even in parts of the country that have been through coronavirus surges before, “you see people breaking out of it” and letting their guard down, Schaffner said. “There really is COVID fatigue that is blending into COVID annoyance,” he said.The short-term outlook is grim, with colder weather and Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s ahead. Generations of family members gathering indoors for meals for extended periods “is not a recipe for anything good,” Hanage said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-surpasses-1-million-covid-19-cases-in-november/story-VslapCFM6yo1qBbSIL4HhM.html
11-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson, Joe Biden pledge to work together closely in 1st phone call||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Joe Biden on Tuesday during their first official phone call since the US President-elect won the November 3 election against incumbent Donald Trump. It is believed that Biden chose to telephone Johnson ahead of other leaders in Europe as Downing Street said the two leaders pledged to work closely together. “In a call this afternoon, the Prime Minister warmly congratulated Joe Biden on his election as President of the United States. The Prime Minister also conveyed his congratulations to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on her historic achievement,” a Downing Street spokesperson said. “They discussed the close and long-standing relationship between our countries and committed to building on this partnership in the years ahead, in areas such as trade and security – including through NATO. The Prime Minister and President-elect also looked forward to working closely together on their shared priorities, from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy, and building back better from the coronavirus pandemic,” the spokesperson said. During the conversation, Johnson is said to have formally invited Biden to attend the COP26 climate change summit that the UK is hosting in Glasgow next year. “They also looked forward to seeing each other in person, including when the UK hosts the G7 Summit in 2021,” the spokesperson added. Biden was declared the winner on Saturday as he edged passed the 270 electoral college votes mark. However, counting is ongoing on in some states, with President Donald Trump disputing the result. Soon after his phone call, Johnson also issued a Twitter statement to say that he is looking forward to “strengthening the partnership” between our countries and to working with him on our shared priorities – from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy and building back better from the pandemic.

11-11-2020||World||‘Lockdown’ is Collins Dictionary’s word of the year||In its original hyphenated avatar, the word meant a piece of wood used to nail pieces of a raft together. In the 1970s, it is believed that the prison systems of some US states gave it a meaning close to its current one -- restricting inmates to their cells, especially in the wake of or to prevent violence. On Sunday, it was named the word of the year 2020 by Collins English Dictionary. The word? Lockdown. The word, which, in its current context means measures implemented by governments around the world to restrict movement of people to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease, Covid-19, was chosen for its “unifying experience for billions” and for being one that “sums up the year” for most people. The dictionary defines lockdown as “the imposition of stringent restrictions on travel, social interaction, and access to public spaces”. “Our lexicographers chose lockdown as Word of the Year because it is a unifying experience for billions of people across the world, who have had, collectively, to play their part in combating the spread of COVID-19,” Collins said.“Lockdown has affected the way we work, study, shop, and socialise. With many countries entering a second lockdown, it is not a word of the year to celebrate but it is, perhaps, one that sums up the year for most of the world,” she said. The dictionary said it registered over a quarter of a million usages of the word during 2020, against only 4,000 the previous year.Several other words related to the pandemic are included in Collins’s list of the top 10 words of the year: “furlough” -- the practice of temporarily laying off employees -- and “self-isolate”. The word “coronavirus” features in the list too, with an extraordinary 35,000-fold increase in use year-on-year. But social impacts – the changes to behaviour and the human way of life – dominate the list for the year. “The restrictions placed on how we move about and interact with one another arguably had the most impact,” Collins notes.Interestingly, the dictionary points out that 2020 was not all about the pandemic. “Megxit”, or Prince Harry and actor Meghan Meghan’s decision to stand down as members of the UK royal family, was among the top words of the year. Anti-racism movement Black Lives Matter was one of the other key words, as was “mukbang” , the Korean word that refers to a video or webcast in which the host noisily eats a large quantity of food for the entertainment of viewers. There’s no explaining tastes. (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-is-collins-dictionary-s-word-of-the-year/story-BifnztCPBFwf2T51QtvCbP.html
11-11-2020||World||US attorney general Barr allows probes into voter ‘fraud’, top official resigns in protest||President Donald Trump will push ahead on Tuesday with legal challenges to the results of last week’s election after US attorney general William Barr told federal prosecutors to look into any “substantial” allegations of voting irregularities.Barr’s directive to prosecutors prompted the top lawyer overseeing voter fraud investigations to resign in protest. It came after days of attacks on the integrity of the election by Trump and Republican allies, who have alleged widespread voter fraud, without providing evidence.Trump has not conceded the election to Democrat Joe Biden, who on Saturday secured the more than the 270 votes in the Electoral College needed to win the presidency.The Trump campaign has filed several lawsuits claiming the election results were flawed. Judges have tossed out lawsuits in Michigan and Georgia, and experts say Trump’s legal efforts have little chance of changing the election result.Barr told prosecutors on Monday that “fanciful or far-fetched claims” should not be a basis for investigation and his letter did not indicate the Justice Department had uncovered voting irregularities affecting the outcome of the election.But he did say he was authorising prosecutors to “pursue substantial allegations” of irregularities of voting and the counting of ballots. Richard Pilger, who for years has served as director of the Election Crimes Branch, announced in an internal email he was resigning from his post after he read “the new policy and its ramifications”. The previous Justice Department policy, designed to avoid interjecting the federal government into election campaigns, had discouraged overt investigations “until the election in question has been concluded, its results certified, and all recounts and election contests concluded”.Biden’s campaign said Barr was fueling Trump’s far-fetched allegations of fraud. “Those are the very kind of claims that the President and his lawyers are making unsuccessfully every day, as their lawsuits are laughed out of one court after another,” said Bob Bauer, a senior adviser to Biden.On Monday, Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit to block Pennsylvania officials from certifying Biden’s victory in the battleground state. It alleged the state’s mail-in voting system violated the US Constitution by creating “an illegal two-tiered voting system” where voting in person was subject to more oversight than voting by mail.Judges have already tossed out Trump campaign’s lawsuits in Michigan and Georgia, and experts say these legal efforts have little chance of changing the election result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-attorney-general-barr-allows-probes-into-voter-fraud-top-official-resigns-in-protest/story-J6XORyvznzqBCPyZUXsAAJ.html

11-11-2020||India||Top commander of banned ULFA (I) Dhristi Rajkhowa surrenders||Deputy commander-in-chief of the banned United Liberation Front of Assam-Independent (ULFA-I) Dhristi Rajkhowa surrendered to the Meghalaya police on Wednesday evening in big success for security forces. He is being escorted by Meghalaya police to Assam where he will be handed over to their counterparts. Sources inform that the army was keen to take possession of the militant but was denied by Meghalaya police who intended to deliver him to the Assam police.Rajkhowa, with his four bodyguards, gave up after an intense encounter with Meghalaya police’s elite SF10 commandos at around 6pm in an area in South Garo Hills district, highly placed police sources confirmed to HT.“It’s true, Rajkhowa has surrendered and presently there is still movement and so we are not in a position to comment further. Suffice to say that it happened today evening,” a senior police official said requesting anonymity.An AK-81 assault rifle with two magazines of 90 rounds, 2 pistols with magazine and ammunition were recovered from the rebel leader and his team.Sources further told HT that the rebel leader was on the run lately after two encounters with Meghalaya police almost landed him in the net. The first was in March in Bolbokgre village in the same district and as recently as on October 20 when he narrowly escaped an encounter with commandos of the Meghalaya police in Bolchokgre village also in the same district.“Ever since then, he has been under tremendous pressure and has been on the run trying to avoid our teams because we were maintaining the heat consistently,” the official said.Rajkhowa - known to be a close confidant of Paresh Baruah, the commander-in-chief of ULFA (I) - is an explosives expert and is also a central committee member of the rebel group. His prowess and loyalty to Baruah earned him a promotion to the present position of deputy-commander-in-chief in November 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ulfa-i-leader-dhristi-rajkhowa-surrenders-to-meghalaya-police/story-G7p0mq4kSrDiawDS0L4V7L.html
11-11-2020||India||Delhi reports 8,593 Covid-19 cases, highest daily spike ever||For the first time ever, Delhi’s daily Covid-19 cases crossed the 8,000-mark on Wednesday as the Capital reported 8,593 cases. The total tally of the city now stands at 45,9975 and the positivity rate has jumped to 13.40 per cent. In the last 24 hours, 64,121 tested have been conducted and 85 deaths have been reported. Over 24,000 people in Delhi are now under home isolation, the health bulletin said.On Tuesday, the city recorded 7,830 fresh infections which was the highest till yesterday.The unprecedented spike in the number of daily cases comes at a time when experts have been pointing out overall laxity in maintaining social distance. All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria has said super-spreader events might have led to the recent surge in the number of cases. The Delhi High Court on Wednesday pulled up the AAP government for relaxing safety norms for public gatherings. A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramanium Prasad also noted that the wearing of masks has not been made mandatory in Delhi. The court also asked the government why it has increased the number of people allowed in weddings, public transport etc.Since October last week, Delhi has been reporting a spike in the number of daily cases. In the last two days, it has surpassed Kerala and Maharashtra in the maximum number of daily Covid-19 infections.The onset of winter with pollution combined is being blamed for what has now officially been called the third wave of Covid-19. The first wave was in June and the second was in September. But the third wave is the worst, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain has said. “The third wave of COVID-19 is at its peak in Delhi. The number of cases suggests it is the worst wave so far. But the cases will come down soon,” Jain said earlier.The latest report of serosurvey, which the government submitted to the high court on Wednesday, has found that Covid-19 antibodies were present in 25 per cent of the persons tested. After going through the report, the court pointed out that the virus has touched almost every household in the national Capital. One in four persons in the city appears to be infected by Covid-19, the court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-reports-8-593-cases-highest-daily-spike-ever/story-Vi6BYRgBiWX0fIRlUo4aPM.html

11-11-2020||India||Kerala chief minister’s office knew about gold smuggling: Probe agency||Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s private secretary M Sivasankar and some officials at the CM’s office were aware of smuggling activities, the Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday informed the special court in Kochi. This is the first time the central agency has named the CM’s office in connection with the Kerala gold smuggling case.The ED said the main accused in the smuggling case, Swapna Suresh, had divulged this information during her interrogation. Last week the ED had summoned Raveendran, CM’s additional secretary, but he could not appear after he tested positive for Covid-19. According to officials, who are part of the multi-agency probe, Raveendran was summoned on the basis of the statements of Sivasankar and Suresh. A party leader from Kannur (north Kerala), Raveendran was very close to the CM and served under many ministers earlier. In the remand statement, the ED also said Sivasankar was aware of the kickbacks in many dream projects of the government like Life Mission and KFON. He also leaked out vital project details and other information to firms which vied for the projects, the ED added. “Sivasankar shared confidential information with Suresh relating to many key projects. There could be possible kickbacks to certain private parties. It is no coincidence that he knows all main accused in the gold smuggling case,” the statement said. The latest report will invite trouble for the CM’s office which distanced from Sivasankar after his arrest. It said “Sivasankar and some officials at the CM team were fully aware of illegal activities”. Later the court extended his custody for one more day. His bail plea is coming up before the court on November 12. While investigating the gold smuggling case, probe agencies came across alleged irregularities and commissions in some other projects also. When Sivasankar was arrested on October 28, the government quickly distanced itself from him but in Raveendran’s case it will be difficult for the party to drop him. Besides the government, the party is also in big trouble after the arrest of secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri in connection with the Bengaluru drugs case. While opposition parties stepped up pressure for the CM’s resignation, the ruling CPI(M) said it was a move aimed at destabilising the government. “It proved beyond doubt that the CM office was reduced to a den of smugglers and racketeers,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. But the ruling party came down heavily on central agencies. “It is a political move aimed at stalling developmental projects in the state,” said party leader A Vijayaraghavan. The smuggling case came to light on July 5 after seizure of 30 kg smuggled yellow metal from a consignment camouflaged as diplomatic consignment. A multi-agency team headed by the NIA is probing the case and 34 people have been arrested so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-chief-minister-s-office-knew-about-gold-smuggling-probe-agency/story-m3ZL1htjHEOjbPsiJAERlL.html
11-11-2020||India||Every life saved from Covid-19 is a success story for India, says PM Modi at BJP headquarters in Delhi||While addressing party workers in Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday applauded India for showing the best response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and said that recent polls held in the country endorsed it. The Assembly election held in Bihar was India’s first major election since the Covid-19 outbreak. Crediting the BJP’s model of good governance, PM Modi said that people’s vote for the party for their combat measures taken against the virus crisis in the country is a sound proof of their support. “The way we have fought the Covid-19 pandemic from ‘Janta Curfew’ till today was reflected in these election results,” PM Modi said. “Every life saved from Covid is a success story for India,” he added.“Polls results have endorsed the way we have tackled the coronavirus crisis situation in the country,” the prime minister said.On NDA’s victory in Bihar, the prime minister said the formula behind the win was simple: “Sabka saath, Sabka vikas, Sabka vishwas”, which is BJP’s mantra.“If you ask me today about the Bihar election results, then my answer is as clear as the people’s mandate. It’s simple: ‘Sabka saath, Sabka vikas, Sabka vishwas’ has won. The development has won in Bihar. Truth and faith have won in Bihar,” PM Modi said.Further in his speech, PM Modi termed Bihar election results as “special” and said that during vote counting, BJP was the only party that witnessed its numbers go up despite being in power in the state for three terms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-rresults-2020-every-life-saved-from-covid-is-a-success-story-for-india-says-pm-modi-at-bjp-headquarters-in-delhi/story-JuT2sBH81pYxGcZXRqoVJI.html
11-11-2020||India||India’s decentralised but unified mechanism drove Covid-19 unique response strategy: Harsh Vardhan||India’s decentralized but unified mechanism to provide universal, accessible, equitable and affordable healthcare to one and all was the driving force behind the unique response strategy for Covid-19, Health minister Harsh Vardhan said on Wednesday. Addressing BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) health ministers conference, he said India’s Covid-19 response approach was pre-emptive, proactive, and graded. Starting with early screening and isolation of passengers, imposing lockdowns and creating containment zones to prevent over burdening of health facilities and personnel, propagating behaviour change as an integral move to contain the spread, and ultimately recognizing the imperative need for reopening of the economy in a phased, cautious and responsible manner, he said. Vardhan said while the Centre steered this movement with constant monitoring and evaluation, providing handholding support to the states to tackle this crisis holistically, respective state governments also undertook various unique strategies to keep their response mechanism agile and vigilant. “Our decentralized but unified mechanism to provide universal, accessible, equitable and affordable healthcare to one and all was the driving force behind our unique response strategy for Covid-19,” Vardhan stated. He said India has curated its response, keeping in mind the large population size. “Several technological innovations were also leveraged in our pandemic management efforts. While applications such as Arogya Setu and ITIHAS facilitate rapid contact tracing and surveillance, the interactive and dynamic Covid India Portal enabled real time tracking and monitoring,” Vardhan added. The iGOT portal (Integrated Government Online Training) was also launched as a training module for our frontline health workers, he said. “We worked round-the-clock to boost domestic production and expand our healthcare workforce, thus bridging major gaps in demand and supply of essentials such as testing kits, PPEs, ventilators etc. Furthermore, an Aatma Nirbhar Bharat movement has now been launched to become self-sufficient in all our capacities,”Vardhan said. He underlined the need for an aggressive roadmap and a strong show of solidarity to curtail any present and future risks threatening safety and wellbeing of millions of global citizens.  “There is also an impending need to share reliable and accurate data and any lessons drawn in the course of managing this pandemic, to eliminate any threat of emerging disease outbreaks and ensuring equitable and inclusive access to healthcare for one and all,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-decentralised-but-unified-mechanism-drove-covid-19-unique-response-strategy-harsh-vardhan/story-sqLOS09l1ygXzv4rMPeKBM.html

Kejriwal had lent his voice to the ‘Save Mollem’ campaign. Protesters have been opposing a trio of projects, a double tracking of a railway line, highway expansion and power line that will all slice through the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary and the Mollem National Park in the coastal state. “No state is as polluted as Delhi. They should look at that first. People in Delhi are desperate to breathe fresh air. You can go to Delhi for yourself and check. The coronavirus situation too is very bad, they are in the midst of a third wave,” Sawant, who recently returned from Delhi, said a press conference.“Instead of commenting on Goa, I want to tell Kejriwal to worry about Delhi first and not Goa,” Sawant said. “Goans camping day n nite to #savemollem and stop #coalprojects. FIRs done against many Goans incl (including) AAP volunteers. Muzzling protests and lodging FIR will not dampen [the] spirit of Goans to save Goa from being a coal hub. Govts shud (should) not implement projects against the wishes of people,” Kejriwal had tweeted joining the cause with various political leaders and celebrities. Sawant said that his government was also committed to the preservation of the ecological diversity and that his discussion with the Union minister of shipping in New Delhi centred around reducing the coal being imported viat the Mormugao Port.The railway line, by far the biggest of the three projects will come at a cost of diversion of 113.857 ha. of forest land and felling of 18,541 trees.The second project -- the four-laning of the existing two-lane highway was constructed by the Portuguese colonial government between Panaji in Goa and Belgavi in Karnataka will cost 31.015 ha of forest land and 12,097 trees. The third is a 400KV power line, 3.5 km of which passes through protected forest to augment power supply between Goa and Karnataka and to provide additional feed to Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worry-about-delhi-first-goa-cm-pramod-sawant-s-advice-to-arvind-kejriwal/story-kmrg1tPMMOjFHEpm6kv20L.html

11-11-2020||India||Why is Delhi is seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases? AIIMS director blames super-spreader events||All India Institute of Medical Sciences Delhi (AIIMS), director, Dr Randeep Guleria said on Wednesday that super-spreader events can be the reason behind the recent surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi. “What happens is if in a crowd one does not wear a mask, a person who may be asymptomatic and is highly infectious he can spread the disease to a large number of people in the crowd. If they get the disease, they will take it to the area they go to, their own family members, their relatives and they will again spread the disease. So you can have super-spreading events, and it is likely that this has happened in Delhi. There were crowds, people did not take precautions and they were super spreading events and this led to an increase in the number of cases,” Dr.Guleria told ANIA super-spreader event is one where a single person with the virus can come into contact with multiple other people and spread the virus to them. They have been gaining widespread attention following reports that Donald Trump’s pre-election fundraiser and his election night watch party might have been superspreader events, where members of his campaign were infected in significant numbers. In Kerala too, cases spiked after Onam celebrations. Agreeing that it is difficult to avoid crowds in the festive season, the AIIMS director warned that with the drop in temperature and rising air pollution levels there is a dire need to exercise caution. He also advised senior citizens and people with comorbidities to be extra vigilant during this phase and said there is an acute need for everyone to wear masks whenever they are in places with a considerable number of people. Talking about the sudden rise in the number of coronavirus cases in Delhi, he said, “We are seeing an increasing surge of cases in Delhi, and the numbers are increasing with time. The number of cases had come down to 2,000 from 4,000, and now they are going upwards of 7,000 and up to 8,000 in a day, this is also reflected in increased hospital admissions and to some extent in mortality.”As per the Union health ministry’s website on Wednesday, there are 41,385 active Covid-19 cases in the national capital, while 4,02,854 patients have been cured and discharged. Over 7,000 fatalities have been reported in the national capital so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-delhi-is-seeing-a-spike-in-covid-19-cases-aiims-director-blames-super-spreader-events/story-il5Pz8vhzZDI1iq6JXZhzL.html

At the time of arrest, Arnab and his wife had been accused of assaulting members of the police team that went to arrest him.A woman officer, part of the team of police officials had lodged a complaint against Arnab, his wife and son and two unidentified persons, accusing them of assault. A first information report was filed by the police under several provisions of the penal code including assault to deter a public servant from discharging his or her duty, intentional insult to provoke breach of peace, criminal intimidation and under the Damage to Public Property Act. Goswami had denied the charge, insisting that they had only protested their illegal arrest. “The basic contention is that no case is made out against him as the arrest itself is illegal. We are relying on the video recorded to put forth our contentions,” Arnab Goswami’s lawyer Shyam Kalyankar said,The prosecution has also filed a reply before the court opposing his request. The prosecution has claimed that Goswami had no fear for law and he may influence witnesses in the case if granted protection. The court is likely to hear the plea on Thursday.The request for pre-arrest bail was filed after the Supreme Court granted Arnab Goswami’s request for interim bail in an order that sought to protect the liberty individuals, The court ordered the release of Goswami and two others in an abetment to suicide case dating back to May 2018. The three are accused in an abetment to suicide case filed in May 2018 by the wife of architect Anvay Naik who died by suicide that year and left a suicide note naming Goswami , Niteesh Sarda, and Farooq Sheikh whose companies owed him money for services rendered.The Supreme Court, which heard Arnab Goswami’s appeal against the high court rejecting his bail request, underlined that it was dealing with a person’s liberty.“Across the country, if this court is not to interfere today, we are treading on a path of destruction of liberty....you may dislike a person’s ideology and challenge it but if this is what our States will do to nail persons, we have to put across this message to all High Courts to preserve the liberty of citizens,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arnab-goswami-granted-bail-by-sc-seeks-shield-to-prevent-his-arrest-again/story-BkKXGBxNjzV8RC1gMwbuVI.html

The journalist thanked the apex court for its judgement as he flashed victory sign to the crowd outside Taloja jail. “This is the victory of the people of India,” Goswami said.On November 4, Goswami was arrested from his residence in Mumbai’s Lower Parel by Alibaug police for allegedly abetting the suicide of an interior designer Anvay Naik, 53. The abetment to suicide case was filed by Naik’s wife in May 2018.Earlier on Wednesday, the Supreme Court court ordered the release of Goswami and two other accused in the 2018 suicide case, allowing the accused to be released from Taloja jail on personal bond of Rs 50,000.

The bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee said that the high court was wrong to reject interim bail pleas submitted by the accused. “We are of the view that the HC was in error of rejecting the application for grant of interim bail,” Supreme Court said on Wednesday while announcing its order.During the long hearing, Goswami’s lawyer, senior advocate Harish Salve accused the state of targeting his client.“We’re past FIR stage. FIR was lodged in May 2018 and after this matter was probed. The power to re-investigate was wrongly used,” Salve told the court. “We are dealing with a person’s liberty. Across the country, if this court is not to interfere today, we are treading on a path of destruction of liberty. You may dislike a person’s ideology and challenge it but if this is what our States will do to nail persons, we have to put across this message to all high courts to preserve the liberty of citizens,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/republic-tv-editor-arnab-goswami-walks-out-of-mumbai-s-taloja-jail-after-supreme-court-grants-interim-bail/story-PNJIt0hr1EsPLK2QpWVqYM.html

The Hathras incident (in Uttar Pradesh) was unfortunate, but will Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi come and meet the victims’ family here like they went to Hathras?” Patil asked.“We will not do anything against the Constitution.Toppling this government is not our culture,” the BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-thackeray-govt-would-not-last-full-term-bjp-maharashtra-chief-chandrakant-patil/story-qbEEVcsAaqvRgjseqk0a6H.html
11-11-2020||India||Inequality continues to rise in India: Report||Inequality started to rise in India and China substantially in the early 1990s and 2000s, while it was stabilised in China, it continued to rise in India, according to a report. “In China, the top-1 per cent captured eight per cent of national income in 1990 and rose to 14 per cent in 2019, while in India, the corresponding figures are 11 per cent in 1990 and 21 per cent in 2019,” the World Inequality Lab said in the report. It said while inequality started to rise in India and China substantially in the early 1990s and 2000s, it was stabilised in China but continued to rise in India. The report added that this suggests that development and higher growth rates do not necessarily mean more inequality in the distribution of growth. “As a matter of fact, national economic policies matter.” In both the countries, inequality increased substantially after the economic liberalisation of the 1980s and 1990s, it said. The report said communist countries like China and Vietnam display lower inequality levels than non-communist countries like India and Thailand. They still display much higher levels of inequality as compared to the western europe, the least unequal region worldwide, it added. China and Vietnam also appear to be more unequal than post-communist eastern Europe but somewhat less unequal than post-communist Russia, it said. According to the report, in the bottom 50 per cent, the population share of India as well as other South Asian economies have been expanding and contrasting to the sharp decline of the Chinese population share in this group. The World Inequality Lab is the open source for global inequality data, both within countries and between countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inequality-continues-to-rise-in-india-report/story-qfuwzp81SgWVlLarDWsyhN.html

It has been 25-long years when he left Khurja, district Bulandsheher in UP for city of dreams, Mumbai. And today, he feels blessed that within a year he is already shooting his second film in Lucknow. Manoj is directing ‘Dehati Disco’ at Piparsand in suburb of the city that stars choreographer Ganesh Acharya, Manoj Joshi, Manoj Sharma, Ravi Kishan and Remo D’Souza. “Earlier, no one was keen to shoot in UP. But today, instead of foreign locales, everyone wants to shoot in real locations like Mathura, Agra, Meerut, Varanasi, Kanpur and Lucknow. All big actors are shooting here. Besides, subsidy and ease of shooting are add-ons. Apart from four major artistes from Mumbai, all other cast is from UP,” shared the director. “Here we have lesser Covid cases compared to Mumbai, the weather is pleasant, and we have rustic location and great infrastructure-technical support which made Lucknow our first choice. Also, we got a real temple and village location which plays a character in the film. Our producer Kamal Kishor Mishra is also from Lucknow.” This is Manoj’s fifth film in UP. He has earlier, shot ‘Chal Guru Hoja Shuru’ in Khurja, ‘Prakash Electronic’ partly in Agra, ‘Sharma Ji Ki Lal Gai’ in Kanpur-Varanasi and last winter he was in Lucknow for ‘Khali Bali’ that stars Rajneish Duggal, Dharmendra, Madhu, Vijay Raj and Kainat Arora. Manoj recently, completed 25 years in Mumbai. “My first big project as a director was Altaf Raja’s chartbuster song ‘Tum Toh Thehre Pradesi.’ Then for Venus label I’ve directed thousand odd songs. Then I started assisting and editing films like ‘Yeh Dillagi’, ‘Tahelka’ and ‘Maa’. In 2010 I directed my first film ‘Swaha’. Now, this is my tenth film as director.” Started on Dussehra, ‘Dehati…’ has a 35-day long schedule in the state capital. “Set in a village, the film is about a competition between London return dancer played by Sahil Khan who is challenged by desi dancers (Acharya and his son played by master Saksham Sharma).” Talking more about his journey Manoj said, “Be it film industry or any other field for that matter, if you go from small town then the struggle is manifold as there is no one supporting you. And once you start working and make contacts it’s only then you get recognition. I feel one has to work extremely hard to get success here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/shooting-in-real-locations-is-the-in-thing/story-KRz6TD4F7Aww1lnAKkYu1J.html

As an actor it’s a feeling of absolute fulfilment for me. I have tried taking up work which is solely for family entertainment because cheap comedy with below-the-belt jokes is not my cup of tea,” he said.Last seen in the show ‘Madam Sir,’ Singh began his career with a fun stint in the show ‘Yum Hai Hum’. Later his character Pintu Bhabhi in ‘Jijaji Chhat Per Hai’ proved to be a turning point for him.Talking about his journey, Singh, who hails from Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh, said, “My love for creative arts brought me to Lucknow from my small town where it was all about farming. I joined Bhatkhande Music Institute to learn singing and later joined theatre in Lucknow including Padma Shri Raj Bisaria sir’s group, before shifting to Mumbai and getting a show for Doordarshan.”Currently in Lucknow, Singh is shooting for a feature film. “When I got this film, ‘Dihati Disco’, I was elated to learn it will be shot in Lucknow. It’s a beautiful film with a fun and spirited story where I play a villager. Choreographer Gansesh Acharya plays a pivotal role and Remo D’souza will be seen in an interesting stint,” he said.Singh said Lucknow is one of his favourite places. “The kind of food you get here and the kulladh tea, all of it is so delightful. I went to BNA roadside shops to reminisce about those theatre days and to savour samosas and chaat. I miss it in Mumbai,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-gratifying-to-make-people-laugh-in-tough-times/story-XNvvjFirI9kG3S93i1tV7M.html

But never shared this dream with anyone as I knew I’ll be mocked at. So, I completed my course in Bachelor of Mass Media and took up a job at a production house. Soon, I realized that this way I will never reach in front of the camera,” said the ‘Wrong Number’ actor. So, she quit her job and started auditioning. “Nothing much changed as after scores of auditions only one or two materialised. Finally, I decided to take up web sketches for better prospects. It’s actually very difficult to find a place in the industry on your own,” she said.Her long-nurtured dream needed that one break to get that instant recognition all actors think of. “It was in 2018 that I auditioned for ‘Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story’ and waited for a year for it to materialised. I used to have sleepless nights as it was such a big project that too under filmmaker Hansal Mehta and I desperately wanted it to go on floors and release.” Feeling delighted with her latest series getting good reviews and more work coming her way Anjali wants to work across mediums. Talking about her role, she said, “It was challenge playing a 30-year-old non-fictional character. The role had an enchanting charm and a beautifully sketched journey of a common man’s housewife, who stood by him in all his thick and thin. I’m working on a few interesting projects set for next year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-difficult-to-find-a-place-in-the-industry/story-2J6rSVqHrWe47glRk1Hl2L.html
11-11-2020||India||In Bihar victory, Nitish Kumar tweets thank you to PM Modi||Nitish Kumar, in his first comments, on Wednesday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the National Democratic Alliance’s win in the Bihar assembly election. “The people decide. I bow to them for giving the NDA a majority. I also thank PM Modi for his support,” the Bihar chief minister tweeted.The tweet came as PM Modi was addressing the party workers in Delhi after the Bihar results. “It is the win of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas,” said the PM, underlining the reasons for the NDA’s win.He said that the “silent voter” in Bihar has spoken and continues to bless the BJP.Defying exit poll predictions, the NDA retained power in Bihar. The NDA comprises the JD(U), BJP, Vikasshel Insan Party (VIP) and the Hindustani Awam Morcha Secular (HAM).The BJP emerged the second biggest party with 74 votes, one short of RJD’s 75.Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), however, ended up with 43 seats, a sharp drop from 71 in the 2015 elections. Together, they are well placed to form the government. The BJP insists that Nitish Kumar will remain the chief ministerial face of the alliance, a promise made before the polls. Nitish Kumar remained the pivot around which the JD(U) revolved. He centred on his inclusive development work and initiatives for the empowerment of women, Dalits and extremely backward classes (EBCs). At the last poll rally before the third phase of voting, Nitish Kumar did say that it was his last election. “This is my last election, all’s well that ends well,” the CM told the voters during campaigning in Purnea. The results do have ended well for Nitish Kumar, who has been on the winning side in every state election since 2005.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-victory-nitish-kumar-tweets-thank-you-to-pm-modi/story-jHdMUMUngCItTOQIi5ds0O.html

11-11-2020||India||‘Started with two seats...’: PM Modi reminisces in victory speech, says development only poll plank||In a speech oft-punctuated by the chants of BJP workers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday congratulated India for showing unparalleled trust in the process of democracy, charted our the road map ahead and reminded the party workers how success came to BJP. The speech was part of BJP’s grand celebration at its headquarters in New Delhi following the resounding victory in Bihar assembly elections and in the other bypoll elections. Thousands of BJP workers assembled at the headquarters in what was the first gathering of this scale amid the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. As he thanked the country, BJP workers in his speech, he also mentioned BJP chief JP Nadda — who delivered his first victory in Bihar after he took over the reins of the party — and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.“Thank you, not just because people voted for us but because we all celebrated this festival of democracy with great enthusiasm.The election may have been held in only some parts of the country but entire country’s attention was focused on news channels, Twitter and the election commission’s website,” he said.Also Read: In Bihar victory, Nitish Kumar tweets thank you to PM Modi“There is something that we have almost forgotten. Earlier, a day after polling, we used to get news of repolling, booth capture. But today we only read news of the increase in the percentage of votes, female voters,” the PM said.Thanking BJP chief JP Nadda for the victory, the Prime Minister said the implications of the results are far-reaching. “It wasn’t easy having elections. This expands on the results of the Lok Sabha elections. These elections are significant. We have won in the east in Manipur, in the Kutch desert. If you dedicate yourself to the country, try to do something new, you will get the results too. People see the hard work you put in, your intentions. So during elections, people suffer hardships to vote for you,” the Prime Minister said.Taking a journey down memory lane, PM Modi said there was a time when the BJP had only two seats. “And we started from two rooms. But today we are everywhere. How did this happen? The answer lies in the verdict of yesterday. People are relying on our development plank. Development will be our only poll issue,” PM Modi said adding that BJP is the only party that has kept on adding more seats — also in states where it has been in power, indicating that there is no anti-incumbency factor as well.“Good railways, better airports, bridges, internet connectivity, some will say, are not important in elections. People are telling political parties that this is not the case. This is going to be the basis of development. People who did not understand this...have lost their deposits,” PM Modi said.In his victory speech, the Prime Minister attributed BJP’s electoral success to BJP’s governance. “ When people think of governance, they think of BJP,” the PM said.A majority of exit polls, which predicted Mahagathbandhan’s victory in Bihar, attributed their miscalculation to silent voters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a reference to that and said that this has always been BJP’s strength. “Who are these silent voters? They are our mothers and sisters for whom the party is working relentlessly. Be it cooking gas or sanitary napkin, BJP has schemes for them and the work went on during the pandemic too.”Without naming Congress, the Prime Minister slammed the family-run parties from ‘north to south’ and said these parties are threat to democracy. “It is unfortunate that a national party has become a family party. In this situation, we have to remain more alert to strengthen the democracy inside the party. Otherwise, how will we trust each other to take the party ahead,” the Prime Minister said, urging the youth from across the country to join the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/celebrations-for-bihar-victory-at-bjp-headquarters-in-dehi-pm-modi-addresses-party-workers/story-bBiZtgFmMuUY54FM49T5pN.html

Crackers can be burst for only two hours in these six urban areas.”Anoop Nautiyal, the founder of Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities that works on environmental issues, said, “Air pollution is a silent killer. However, the issue in Uttarakhand may not be as grave as Delhi-national capital region (NCR). But pollution has increased drastically in the hill state in the past few years. We need to do much more than lift the ban for two hours to arrest the decline in air quality.”The state government should clarify what it means by “green crackers in a bid to ensure understanding and correct implementation of the (NGT) guidelines,” Nautiyal added.The NGT has directed cities with “moderate” AQI to only allow the sale of green crackers and restricted timings to burst them during the upcoming festivals.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) categorises AQI levels in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor; and 401-500 as severe. Green crackers have 30% lower emissions of toxic gases than traditional firecrackers and they do not contain barium nitrate, a metal oxide that increases both air and noise pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-green-cracker-sale-allowed-in-6-uttarakhand-cities-2-hour-window-for-bursting-them-during-festivals/story-CHAEMvStzortwYyqpSFj4L.html

This will provide them the autonomy to upgrade the standard of Ayurveda education, frame various courses as per emerging national and international demand and excel in modern research to generate more and more evidences, it said. The day is more an occasion of re-dedication to the profession and the society than one of festivities or celebrations, the statement said, adding that utilising the immense untapped potential of AYUSH systems of healthcare for providing effective and affordable solutions for India’s public health challenges is a priority of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-inaugurate-ayurveda-institutes-in-jaipur-on-november-13/story-5Mg3eLBDuJiTjCyeQVdJ5O.html

11-11-2020||India||BJP regains lost bastion in Gwalior-Chambal belt in MP bypolls||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Madhya Pradesh regained its lost bastions in the Gwalior-Chambal and the Malwa region in particular which kept the party away from power in the state assembly elections two years back, per votes polled by the party candidates in the bypolls held in 28 assembly constituencies. The bypoll results which were declared on Tuesday gave 19 of the 28 seats to the BJP and 9 to the Congress. Contrast it with the 2018 assembly elections, where the BJP could win just one of these seats.In the bypolls, the BJP won 9 seats out of 16 in the Gwalior-Chambal region while it made almost a clean sweep in the Malwa region where it won six of the seven seats. It won the remaining four seats in central MP, Bundelkhand and Vindhya regions. There was a huge difference in the poll percentage of the two parties. While the BJP got 49.46% votes polled, the Congress’ was almost 9% percentage points less than that of the BJP at 40.50%. The vote percentage of the BJP in the 2018 assembly elections was 41.33% which was almost equal to the poll percentage of the Congress (41.35) but voters’ mood in the two regions in particular denied the former a fourth consecutive term in power in the state. In the Gwalior-Chambal region which has 34 assembly seats, the Congress won as many as 26 in 2018 whereas the BJP, which had won 20 seats in 2013, had to be content with just 7 seats. Similarly, in the Malwa-Nimad region which has 66 seats and was supposed to be the saffron brigade’s strong bastion, the BJP’s strength was reduced to 28 seats in 2018 from 56 seats in 2013 assembly polls whereas the Congress got 35 seats in the region in 2018. It had won just 9 seats in the 2013 assembly polls. Political analyst Jayant Singh Tomar said, “The BJP’s debacle in the Gwalior-Chambal region in 2018 could be attributed to a major factor i.e. ‘My ka laal’ speech delivered by Chouhan in a meeting of SC/ST government employees in 2016 besides Congress’ promise for farmers’ loan waiver ahead of the polls. Chouhan had said no one could snatch reservation from them (SC/ST). “In the caste-ridden politics of the region, the speech deeply hurt sentiments of upper castes, traditionally BJP voters, who moved away. But in the past two years, anger in public dissipated and what overshadowed Chouhan’s speech was the Congress’ failure on the governance front in its 15 months rule.” He said, “Another major factor which gave an edge to the BJP in the bypolls in the region was having on its side senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia. Congress hardly had any leader in the region who could match the appeal and stature of Scindia. All these factors coupled with Congress’ failure in stitching a pre-poll alliance with smaller parties gave a chance to the BJP to regain its lost bastion in the region.” Political analyst Girija Shankar said, “Having made inroads in the BJP’s bastion in 2018 the Congress was expected to work on its gains in the two regions in particular to strengthen its base but the Kamal Nath government wasted its entire time of 15 months in power while being oblivious of the fact that BJP has a tremendous strength under the leadership of chief minister Shviraj Singh Chouhan to make a comeback anytime to regain its lost bastions.” The Congress alleged that the polls were not held in a “free and fair atmosphere”. State Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta said, “It’s difficult to say if the BJP regained its lost bastions. For, bypolls were not held in a free and fair atmosphere. There was massive misuse of government machinery and the BJP in power used all the tactics to ensure its victory. But despite all these manipulations, Congress won 9 of the seats which shows people were angry with the BJP government and they didn’t vote for the BJP.” State BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “Bypolls gave an opportunity to voters to undo what they had done in the 2018 assembly elections by giving slightly more seats to the Congress then. The bypolls have proved that the BJP continues to retain its base in the state on the strength of its policies and its leadership at the Centre and in the state. This will continue in the next assembly elections too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-scores-big-in-gwalior-chambal-malwa-in-madhya-pradesh-bypolls/story-J0oGOd1LFFfJGgNUhBDxbM.html
11-11-2020||India||This Diwali is all about a collective prayer to win over the pandemic||This Diwali is very different from all the other years because of the Covid-19 pandemic that has taken the entire world by storm. But musicians Shilpa Rao, Palak Muchhal, Rochak Kohli, Jubin Nautiyal, Armaan Malik and Payal Dev are not giving up on the spirit of the festival and are praying for the well being of everybodyShilpa RaoDiwali every year is all about catching up with friends and I have a massive party at my place each year but that is not possible this year. But again, we have the option of doing video calls etc. I usually make kheer every year, but during this lockdown, I have learned to make a lot more dishes so I will make those and send it to my friends. The most important message this Diwali should be to abstain from firecrackers. It is a civic responsibility this year as many people are coping with breathing and lung problems. We should all just reach out with food and love and companionship to all our family and friends this year especially those who are alone because of the pandemic. Wishing everyone a very happy Diwali and I hope we can overcome this crisis together.  Palak MuchhalThis Diwali will be different of course, but not that different in essence. We will be having our puja at home and we have already started making sweets etc., at home and we have also started decorations. My dada and dadiji are here, we managed to fly them out. Over all, there is a certain if not sadness, a feeling of numbness in the environment, even when we are stepping out for shopping, it feels like everybody is very sad. So, we are trying to keep the same spirit at home at least. I have a long list of thank yous this year because despite the pandemic, I have had a good year and I am very happy that everybody in my family is safe. I do pray that the suffering ends for the many people who are in a difficult situation right now. Rochak KohliI will be back from Goa to celebrate Diwali at home, and I will be leaving a day or two for Himachal Pradesh to shoot the video of my next song. So, this Diwali, even though, will be very different, I am just grateful that we are getting to celebrate this festival at least even if at homes. This entire year I have not worn any good clothes and have been only living in shorts, so I am very excited about wearing formals and seeing my family in formals, too, this Diwali. My sincere wish is that we do not pollute the environment this year because we have seen what happens when the environment decides to give it back to us — we have to deal with such pandemics and problems that we have no solutions to. My heart goes out to everybody who lost their means of livelihood this year and I hope they are able to get back on their feet soon. Jubin NautiyalThis year is going to as special as every year of Diwali just because I will get to spend the festival with my family and friends. We will not be bursting any crackers this year, it will be all about diyas and lights and music. There is going to be a lot of jamming this year. I will be inviting all my musician friends and we will be using some instruments to make music instead of making noise. Payal DevI haven’t planned anything as the lockdown is still ongoing, and the situation is not so good yet. So, I don’t know how this Diwali will be for us because we can’t go out and celebrate with our friends and family . Usually, we used to go to our hometowns to celebrate with our family which is also difficult this year. It will be very different this year, but we will definitely try to make some sweets and a good meal for my family. It will be a home Diwali with my daughter and husband this year.Armaan MalikThis year Diwali is going to be very different for me but for good reasons. I have not been spending Diwali with my family for the last two years due to work commitments, but this year, finally, I will be able to enjoy the festival with my closest people at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/this-diwali-is-all-about-a-collective-prayer-to-win-over-the-pandemic/story-DxcoMonL8aeVq32WNjzvAK.html

In case of violations, a penalty will be imposed or construction activity will be stopped temporarily, CPCB said on Wednesday.Punjab and Haryana should take immediate action to curb stubble burning and Delhi NCR should take immediate measures to curb biomass burning, the statement said, adding that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order on firecrackers is to be strictly followed. Also Read: Experts warn of double trouble in Delhi with rising air pollution, Covid-19The Commission on Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region (NCR) and adjoining areas decided on November 10 that the task of implementing the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap) will be temporarily given to CPCB until the newly constituted commission develops a mechanism for implementation of GRAP.CPCB said PM 2.5 concentrations in Delhi NCR exceeded 300 micrograms per cubic metres at 7 pm on November 8 and persisted for more than 48 hours till 7 pm on November 10. A declining trend in PM 2.5 concentrations was observed from noon of November 10. Air quality on Wednesday is in “very poor” category but is forecast to be in “very poor” to “severe category” on November 13 owing to adverse meteorological conditions. In view of the forecast CPCB has made these interventions.There has been confusion among agencies after the Centre issued an ordinance on October 29 to set up the new centralised agency with sweeping powers to monitor and act against sources of air pollution across five north Indian states. It replaced all ad-hoc committees and bodies created as per court orders including the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority that was formed to oversee measures to check air pollution in NCR in 1998 and had been monitoring the enforcement of emergency measures under Grap.While the commission had its first meeting only on Monday, the fifth consecutive day air quality was severe in Delhi, CPCB officials said they were not sure if emergency measures such as curbs on construction activities, restriction on use of personal vehicles and waste burning under the Graded Response Action Plan were to be implemented.“After the Commission came, we did not have legal mandate to hold meetings or enforce GRAP. The Commission gave us the responsibility only yesterday so we couldn’t take any measures on our own in the past few days,” a senior CPCB official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpcb-orders-closure-of-stone-crushers-asks-punjab-haryana-to-curb-stubble-burning/story-8mFmExQkGxynUP0mQkqhxK.html

Action will be initiated in accordance with law against such violators of the law as expeditiously as possible and practicable, after giving an adequate opportunity of being heard to the concerned parties,” the plea said.The plea, which was moved on Tuesday and is likely to come for hearing on Thursday, alleged that the respondents are equally responsible for restraining the illegal practices of online aggregators, which are freely being carried out under the eyes of these officials in utter violations of the rules and regulations laid down by statutes and the guidelines issued by the respondents from time to time ever since the outbreak of deadly Covid-19.It also said several illegal online aggregators are advertising freely by offering attractive packages for body check-ups including the test for Covid-19 through texts or various online modes and added that the petitioner himself has received advertisements of online aggregators through e-mail for getting tested.“It’s also submitted that it is an extremely serious issue that the online aggregators are operating without any authorization and approval. Besides, these online aggregators are not accredited by any accreditation agency. The existence of such illegal online diagnostic aggregators are posing serious health challenge as a large number of people are falling prey to the attractive health packages being offered by these illegal online aggregators,” the plea stated.“The acts of respondents clearly constitute the contempt of the court and appropriate contempt proceedings should be initiated against them for acting against the order dated August 6, 2020 of this court,” it added.The plea further alleged that the respondents’ officials have been playing with the precious lives of the innocent people by promoting unqualified, unregistered medical practitioners to sign the pathological report and exposing the common people to the mercy of untrained and highly incompetent medical/pathological professional.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contempt-plea-in-delhi-high-court-against-delhi-chief-secretary-others-for-inaction-in-regulating-online-pathological-labs/story-yNXA483sLRmRxEd9SY24NO.html

11-11-2020||India||Family members of Arnab Goswami meet Assam CM, Sonowal speaks to Uddhav Thackeray||Family members of Arnab Goswami, who got bail on November 11 in an abetment to suicide case after being in judicial custody for a week, have approached Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal asking him to look into Goswami’s security. Arnab Goswami hails from Assam’s Guwahati. Sonowal on Wednesday spoke to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray who assured the Assam chief minister of Goswami’s security. Goswami was lodged in the Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai. His family members claimed his life was under threat. As he was shifted from Alibag jail’s Covid-19 centre to Tiloja jail for allegedly using a mobile phone on Sunday, the 47-year-old journalist also claimed life threats. He said he was being assaulted by police. During his arrest on November 4 from his Lower Parel house, he complained of physical arrest. But an FIR was filed against Goswami and his family members for trying to stop police.On Wednesday afternoon, following a hearing that extended for hours, the apex court granted him bail in the 2018 case where designer Anvay Naik named him and two others for non-payment of crores, which allegedly led him to end his life. His mother also dies of suicide. Though the case was closed in 2019, it was reopened by an order of Maharashtra home minister. Uddhav Thackeray has assured Sonowal of Goswami’s security, the Assam CM tweeted before Goswami got bail. Talked to Maharashtra CM Shri Uddhav Thackeray ji and requested him for adequate security arrangements for renowned journalist Arnab Goswami. I talked to him as Mr. Goswami's family members approached me and intimated that there is not enough security provided to him. @OfficeofUT “Talked to Maharashtra CM Shri Uddhav Thackeray ji and requested him for adequate security arrangements for renowned journalist Arnab Goswami. I talked to him as Mr. Goswami’s family members approached me and intimated that there is not enough security provided to him,” Sonowal tweeted.A few days ago, Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari urged home minister to allow Goswami’s family members to see him. “The Governor also asked the Home Minister to allow the family of Arnab Goswami to see him and to speak to him. The Governor had earlier conveyed his concern over the manner of arrest of Arnab Goswami to the State Home Minister,” a Raj Bhavan release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/family-members-of-arnab-goswami-meet-assam-cm-sonowal-speaks-to-uddhav-thackeray/story-nLIlkb0pgXc00SsElffT3H.html
11-11-2020||India||Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami granted interim bail by Supreme Court in 2018 suicide case||The Supreme Court on Wednesday granted interim bail to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami who was arrested last week in connection with a 2018 abetment to suicide case. The court also asked the high courts to exercise their jurisdiction to uphold personal liberty.The bench, headed by Justice Chandrachud, granted Arnab Goswami and two other accused interim bail on a bond of Rs 50,000. The bench directed the Commissioner of Police to ensure the order is followed immediately.Senior lawyer Harish Salve, who was representing Goswami, argued that the power to re-investigate was being wrongly used. “We are well past the FIR stage. The FIR was lodged on May 5, 2018, and after this matter was investigated. The Power to re-investigation has been wrongly used, he said. His argument came in the backdrop of Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh ordering a re-investigation on the basis of a fresh complaint by the family of designer interior designer Anvay Naik, who along with his mother Kumud had died by suicide in May 2018. In a suicide note, Naik had alleged non-payment of dues by firms of the accused. A vacation bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee expressed concern over state governments targeting “individuals on the basis of ideology, difference of opinion” and said that they must realise there is an apex court to protect liberty of citizens. The top court observed that Indian democracy is “extraordinarily resilient” and the Maharashtra government must ignore all this (Arnab’s taunt on TV). “Whatever be his ideology, least I don’t even watch his channel but if in this case constitutional court’s do not interfere today, we are travelling the path of destruction undeniably,” Justice Chandrachud said, adding, “the point is can you deny personal liberty of a person on these allegations”.“We are seeing case after case where HCs are not granting bail and failing to protect personal liberty of people,” the court added. The news anchor had moved the top court on Tuesday challenging the high court’s order denying him bail. Goswami, and two other accused Feroz Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda, was arrested on November 4. They were produced before the court on the same day. The magistrate, however, refused to send them in police custody and remanded them in judicial custody till November 18.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arnab-goswami-gets-interim-bail-supreme-court-stays-bombay-hc-order/story-bX1TUytW5UeFsfVRqnWVNI.html
11-11-2020||India||Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla to visit Nepal||Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla is set to visit Nepal this month to take forward bilateral ties that were rocked by a border row earlier this year, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Wednesday. Shringla’s visit will come close on the heels of a two-day trip to Kathmandu last week by the Indian Army chief, Gen MM Naravane. During his meeting with Naravane on November 6, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli said the two countries could resolve all problems through dialogue. There has been no formal announcement regarding Shringla’s visit so far, and the people cited above said he is expected to be Kathmandu during November 26-27. The people added that officials of both countries had been working behind the scenes to put the bilateral relationship back on an even keel against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff in the Ladakh sector. India has also been keep a wary eye on China’s stepped-up efforts to increase its influence in Nepal, where Beijing has invested in infrastructure projects. Also Read: Foreign secretary Shringla holds bilateral meetings with Maldivian leadershipThis will be Shringla’s fifth foreign visit in the aftermath of pandemic-related travel restrictions. He visited the Maldives this week, and has also travelled to Bangladesh and Myanmar in the neighbourhood. Earlier this month, Shringla travelled to France, Germany and the UK. One of the people cited above said the upcoming visit to Nepal was in line with India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy and would provide the two sides an opportunity to give fresh impetus to bilateral ties after the border row over the Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadura areas. Every Indian foreign secretary usually visits key countries in the neighbourhood shortly after assuming office. The travel plans of Shringla, who became foreign secretary in January, were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Naravane’s visit, during which he was conferred the honorary rank of general of the Nepali Army in keeping with a long-standing tradition, was seen as a key part of efforts to improve the relationship. The army chief travelled to Nepal days after Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) chief Samant Kumar Goel made a low-key visit to Kathmandu during which he met Oli. India-Nepal ties were hit in May after defence minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a key border road to Lipulekh region, which is claimed by Nepal. Kathmandu responded by issuing a new map that showed Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura, all controlled by India, as part of Nepalese territory. This exacerbated the border row. India is yet to respond formally to several requests from Nepal for talks on the border issue and the people said the foreign secretary’s visit will prepare the ground for such a dialogue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreign-secretary-harsh-shringla-to-visit-nepal/story-oEfDv0iiGq8KAT4qacS0JM.html

The two brothers jumped aside to save themselves.“Soon after, the Bisoi brothers had an altercation with Suna and his friends. The two families were already at loggerheads over the last 4-5 years and had filed FIRs against each other. Suna left after the altercation only to return with some of his friends to Bisoi’s house and started assaulting the two brothers, their parents and maternal uncle with sharp weapons,” said Burla sub-divisional police officer Sishu Ranjan Mohapatra.It was after the miscreants left that locals informed the police who had admitted the family to Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR), Burla, where brothers Muna Bisoi (30) and Bulu Bisoi(34) died. Their father Pitabasa Bisoi (50), mother Sangita Bisoi (47), and maternal uncle Narendra Bhandekar (52) are critical.Police have detained the main accused and three other persons in this connection and seized the car allegedly used by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/old-rivalry-sparks-leads-to-double-murder-in-odisha-s-sambalpur-district/story-nLwwcuM6TyD5lXyzkIpAjJ.html

The summit between India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) will be held on the margins of the 37th summit of the 10-member grouping. Vietnam is the current chair of Asean. Leaders of all 10 Asean states will participate in the summit with India. The summit will review the status of the Asean-India strategic partnership and assess the progress made in key areas such as connectivity, maritime cooperation, trade and commerce, education, and capacity building, the external affairs ministry said on Wednesday.

The Covid-19 crisis, post-pandemic economic recovery and important regional and international developments will also be discussed at the summit. The Asean-India Summit provides an opportunity for the two sides to engage at the highest level, and Modi attended the last summit held in the Thai capital of Bangkok in November 2019. The Asean-India strategic partnership “stands on a strong foundation of shared geographical, historical and civilisational ties” and India’s “Act East” policy, underlining the centrality of Asean, reflects the importance New Delhi attaches to engagement with the grouping, the ministry said. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement, which the 10 members of Asean are set to sign with five other partners of the grouping, is also expected to figure in the discussions as several of the Southeast Asian states are still keen on roping in India for the pact, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. India pulled out of the proposed trade pact last year, saying it didn’t fit in with the country’s national interests. The members of Asean intend to sign the agreement with Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea, while leaving the door open for India to join at a later stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asean-india-summit-on-november-12-to-focus-on-boosting-trade-connectivity/story-GFuUMZuIN68LCA463VfiQP.html

A vacation bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee said though festivals were important, but “life itself has been imperilled now” amid the pandemic. It said the high court knew the local condition better and it should be allowed to do the needful. The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by one Gautam Roy and the Burrabazaar Fireworks Dealers Association, challenging the high court order last week banning the use and sale of firecrackers during upcoming festivals, including Kali Puja and Chhath Puja, to curb pollution. Kali Puja will be celebrated on Saturday. “We are all battling for life in this situation and all of us have elderly people in our home,” it observed. “We are in a situation where, at this time, preservation of life is more important and the high court knows what is required at the ground level.” It added that the high court had taken care of the interest of citizens, especially senior citizens who may have comorbidities.Also Read | UP govt to celebrate Diwali using lasers, digital technology amid firecracker ban The high court had directed that the ban would also be in force during the Jagaddhatri Puja, Chhath and Kartik Puja, adding that the guidelines -- which were in place during Durga Puja, such as no entry to pandals -- would also be in effect. It had lauded the state government for effectively implementing the court-directed guidelines during the Durga Puja and asked the police to ensure that the norms are strictly enforced on the other festivals as well.

Apart from dumping of muck, the agency also has the option of selling the debris generated or reusing it for construction purposes. For these options, it has to pay royalty to the state government. When the records were checked, we could not find any account for 1.53 lakh cubic meters of debris, either in terms of royalty being paid or dumped at dumping zones,” said Verma. She added that as no records were found and officials from the company were not able to give any proper explanation, it is being “suspected that the muck was dumped in the rivers.” “We have imposed a fine of over Rs 15 crore on the agency as we suspect that they dumped the muck in the rivers illegally,” Verma said. Last year, the road construction was stopped at five locations between Chamba and Dharasu as environmental norms were allegedly being flouted by the construction companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-fines-firm-rs-15-cr-after-it-fails-to-account-for-debris-on-char-dham-road/story-5G79I9yuubMLVX6AZBF1uO.html

11-11-2020||India||At Cabinet meet, ministers laud PM Narendra Modi for Bihar election win||Union cabinet ministers on Wednesday thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the victory of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Bihar assembly polls and the by-polls across the country. Sources claimed that all Ministers, who virtually attended the cabinet meeting, congratulated PM Modi and dedicated the victory of Bihar to his vision and support that he enjoys amongst the masses.It was one of the moments that made the meeting even more pleasant, stated one of the highly placed sources. “The Prime minister was smiling when he was congratulated on the victory. He was looking happy,” said another source.“Can he not be happy? He has all the reason to be. The victory wasn’t an easy one and his charisma did wonders for the party as well as for the NDA,” added another source with a broad smile.The Prime minister was the lead campaigner for the NDA alliance and addressed 12 rallies across the three phases of assembly polls in the state. Senior leaders in the party said that the core voters who used to vote for Nitish Kumar have thrown their weight behind PM Modi.“Be it Ujjawala scheme or water to every household, women were the main beneficiaries and did vote for PM Modi. Youth too voted for the Prime Minister. Our PM’s popularity is unmatchable,” said one of the sources explaining why BJP performed well in Bihar. While there were other agenda topics that were discussed at the meeting, it was the Bihar elections results that made ministers share a light moment with the Prime minister. The BJP performed well in Bihar and secured 74 seats out of 110 seats it contested. Whereas its ally, the JD(U) was able to win on 43 seats. On the other hand, Tejashwi Yadav-led RJD emerged as the single-largest party with party’s ally, the Congress, performing poorly in the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-cabinet-meet-ministers-laud-pm-narendra-modi-for-bihar-election-win/story-VOinY5QsMQEs26P7TD0gGI.html

Reacting to the abysmal performance of the LJP, Hindustani Aswam Morcha chief, former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi said the result was Paswan’s own doing as he attempted to cut the same branch where he was sitting on. “The branch has been cut, but he also feel. Apne chirag se bhasm ho gaye hain (he got burnt in his own light),” Manjhi said. HAM managed to win four seats, which — as part of NDA ally — contributed to NDA’s total tally.LJP had decided to go alone in this election and Paswan had said his only aim was to defeat Nitish Kumar. Going spearately, LJP fielded 137 candidates. During the campaigning, Paswan made it a point to appeal to voters to vote for BJP candidates where there is no LJP candidate. Speculations were rife whether Bihar will get a BJP-LJP coalition as JD(U)’s numbers were poor as well. JD(U), however, managed to win 43 seats. सभी लोजपा प्रत्याशी बिना किसी गठबंधन के अकेले अपने दम पर शानदार चुनाव लड़े।पार्टी का वोट शेयर बढ़ा है।लोजपा इस चुनाव में बिहार1st बिहारी1st के संकल्प के साथ गई थी।पार्टी हर ज़िले में मज़बूत हुई है।इसका लाभ पार्टी को भविष्य में मिलना तय है।Chirag Paswan, however, didn’t see the result as a defeat. “I am proud of all LJP candidates who fought without the help of any alliance. We received voters’ love. The vote share of the party has increased. The party organisation has got strengthened in every district. We will reap the benefits of it in future,” Chirag tweeted soon after the results were announced on Tuesday night. As many as 25 Bharatiya Janata Party rebel leaders had joined the LJP after being denied a ticket by the party. In 2015, the LJP had won two seats after contesting from 42 assembly constituencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-results-2020-paswan-annihilated-in-his-own-chirag-says-jitan-ram-manjhi/story-JcwDFnRuRgwQmKOWvcA5yI.html

A senior government official said that when data will be released Wednesday evening the Covid-19 tally would cross the one lakh mark. “Yesterday evening the total cases were a few hundred short of one lakh and today the number will be crossed. We have been getting more than 300 cases every day,” he said.The union territory’s Commissioner Secretary (Health), Atul Duloo said that J&K’s Covid-19 tally now stands at 99,844 which is 8,139 cases per million and recovery rate is 93.03 per cent. “Our mortality rate is 1.55 per cent and positive rate is 3.9 per cent,” he said.So far J&K has conducted 2,06,227 tests per million population which is more than double the national average that stands at 98,786. Till Tuesday night there were 5,415 active patients in the UT. The doubling rate of positive cases in Jammu and Kashmir in the last seven days stood at 130.1 which is less than the national average of 142.6 days.Dr Qazi Haroon Qazi Haroon, officer on special duty for Covid mitigation in Kashmir said that J&K is placed better as the graph of positive patients is declining.“We were expecting a bit of hue and cry due to the fact that normal seasonal flu will add to our miseries and will be labeled as Covid but so far things are well under control.”Dr Shafkat Khan, health expert and Jammu and Kashmir’s former nodal officer for Covid-19 said that the recovery rate and the people tested for Covid in the union territory seem far better than other states. “It is however, difficult to predict whether there is a next wave in the offing. The Government seems to have come a long way in augmenting the infrastructure and required logistics and is geared up for any such eventuality. It now entirely depends upon the precautions to be taken up by the people to prevent the further spread of the virus till a vaccine comes up.”However, many doctors say the number of positive patients could be more as dozens of patients are getting treatment at home. “I know many people who receive treatment at home for Covid-19 as they don’t want to go to hospitals and Covid centres. Yes the situation is better than what it was four to five months ago. Today we know many things about the disease which helps us in treating the patients either in hospitals or at home,” said a senior consultant who is treating Covid patients on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-s-covid-19-tally-nears-one-lakh-mark-but-govt-says-numbers-not-worrying/story-Nq2e3CVlX6K2pz5zAdDqyO.html

11-11-2020||India||Centre takes 1st step to level the field; to set ground rules for OTT, online news||In the first step to regulate digital content, the government has expanded the powers of the information and broadcasting ministry to start regulating over the top, or OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime videos and Hotstar and other digital content including online news.The change is part of a comprehensive exercise at the I&B ministry to enact a new law that would decriminalise offences under the 1867-vintage Press and Registration of Books Act and make it mandatory for news websites to get themselves registered with the Registrar of Newspapers of India (RNI). The proposed law is to be placed before the Union Cabinet soon.The presidential order amending the powers of the information and broadcasting ministry was issued on Monday, weeks after a public interest litigation was filed in the Supreme Court that sought directions to the Centre to set up a mechanism to monitor, manage and regulate content on video streaming platforms. The order brought films and audio-visual programmes made available by online content providers and news and current affairs content on online platforms under the purview of the I&B ministry.People familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times that the order is the outcome of an exercise that had been started in the government some time back and isn’t directly linked to the petition before the Supreme Court.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ordered for the change in the I&B ministry’s powers on May 30,” a senior government functionary said.He said the government had been receiving complaints about unregulated, sexually-explicit, vulgar and legally restricted content being put out by the OTT platforms and others. “But there was no mechanism to redress the grievances that people had,” the functionary said.The ministry of electronics and information technology, or Meity, the only department of the government that could have any jurisdiction over the digital media, is not equipped to monitor content but only the technical aspects.The information and broadcasting ministry is likely to require these platforms to enlist with the ministry to be able to operate in the country. This would imply that even international on-demand streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Videos would be required to register with the government and follow the ground rules for the videos that they stream, an official of the information and broadcasting ministry said. This would bring the treatment of foreign players on par with domestic players such as MX Player, Voot, Altbalaji, ZEE5, Sun NXT and Eros.Parallelly, the government has also finalised the draft Registration of Press and Periodicals (RPP) Bill that has been in the works for years. In its refurbished format, the proposed law would make it mandatory for news websites and online channels to register with the government.Officials said there was a need for a mechanism to ensure that digital content did not cross the widely-accepted redlines. While there is a Press Council of India headed by a retired judge to hear complaints relating to the print media, television news channels come under News Broadcasters Association (NBA).The changes, seen as an effort to level the field between the traditional media and the digital media space, also simplify the registration procedures. For instance, news websites and newspapers would not need to file a separate request to the district magistrate but only apply online to the Press Registrar General, which shall seek the feedback from the district magistrate concerned, before approving the request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-takes-1st-step-to-level-the-field-to-set-ground-rules-for-ott-online-news/story-65lF4I68qUpTBShqJDn3MN.html

Nevertheless, allegations of malpractice raised by Mahagathbandan leaders are deeply concerning. The hope of every Indian that elections are free, fair and impartial must not belied,” he added.The Election Commission of India (ECI) announced results of Bihar Assembly polls in the early hours on Wednesday with the BJP winning in 74 of the 110 seats it contested and JD(U) bagged 43 seats out of the 115 seats it fought.The other NDA constituents, HAM bagged 4 seats, while VIP got 4, making the NDA cross the figure of 122 seats in the 243-member Assembly needed to form the government.The RJD, however, emerged as the single largest party in the state by winning 75 seats while its main ally Congress could bag just 19 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmk-chief-m-k-stalin-congratulates-nitish-kumar-tejashwi-yadav-on-bihar-poll-results/story-6bwmyEqShA5Bbu4mWqwMHI.html

The talks were held on November 6 in which external affairs ministry’s Joint Secretary Naveen Shrivastava and Brigadier Ghai of Directorate General of Military Operations had taken part.In the second step to be carried out near the northern bank on the Pangong Lake, both sides were supposed to withdraw around 30 per cent of troops every day for three days. The Indian side would be coming close to its administrative Dhan Singh Thapa post while the Chinese had consented to go back to their position east of Finger 8.In the third and last step, the two sides were to withdraw from their respective positions from the frontline along the southern bank of Pangong Lake area which includes the heights and territories around Chushul and Rezang La area.The two sides had also agreed for a joint mechanism to verify the progress in the disengagement process through delegation meetings as well as using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).The Indian side is moving very carefully on the issue as there is a lot of trust deficit with China after the Galwan valley clash in June this year in which 20 Indian soldiers had lost their lives and many Chinese army soldiers, including their Commanding Officer, were killed by the Indian troops.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s trusted security team, including National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane and Air Force chief RKS Bhadauria, had taken strong military measures like occupying the dominating heights along the southern and northern bank of Pangong Lake on the LAC including the Ane La and Que La features.Also Read | Xi says SCO member states should resolve disputes, differences through dialogueChina had mobilised its troops in a massive deployment along the LAC and transgressed into multiple Indian locations including patrolling points 14, 15, 15 A, 17 and 17A and the Finger area in April-May timeframe in the 14 Corps area of responsibility with Lt Gen Harinder Singh as Corps Commander and Maj Gen Abhijit Bapat as the 3 Infantry Division Commander based out of Karu.India gave a huge response as it moved close to 60,000 troops for forward deployments apart from bringing in reserve divisions from the nearby Himachal Pradesh sector and plains.

Doraikkannu had co-morbidities and was on life support. He had been shifted from a government hospital in Villupuram. The death summary notes cause of death as septic shock and Covid induced pneumonia. Last week, Stalin had said in a statement that there is mystery surrounding Doraikkanu’s death and accused the AIADMK of corruption. Citing local reports Stalin claimed that money was kept in the late minister’s house for election related expenses and the ruling party had pressured the family to return the money which could be anywhere between Rs 300 and 800 crore. “Only after the family guaranteed to return the money was his death declared,” Stalin said in his statement adding that the income tax department and election commission must take action. “It is our bad luck that such a person is in the opposition,” Vijayabaskhar said, recalling that Stalin’s father M Karunanidhi was also treated in the same private hospital. He added that the state government provided all necessary medicines for DMK’s J Anbazhagan treatment before he also died due to Covid. DMK leaders said if the issue goes to court, the truth will come out. “Let them file,” said senior DMK leader and MLA M Subramanian. “Why hasn’t any minister said anything about the Rs 800 crore which we said is stashed by benamis? They are filing defamation only on the matter of us saying there is mystery in his (Doraikkannu’s) death. We have also said there is mystery surrounding Jayalalithaa’s death - why aren’t they filing defamation for that?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-health-minister-to-sue-opposition-leader-stalin-for-defamation/story-yRnxHZzUSKYiyNkR23leyH.html

11-11-2020||India||Covid-19 mortality rate in Maharashtra drops in last two weeks||Along with the steady fall in the daily caseload, positivity rate and improvement in the recovery rate, the weekly case fatality rate (CFR) of the Covid-19 cases has declined over the last five weeks in Maharashtra, the health department said.The weekly CFR which ranged between 2.51 and 2.67 for the first three weeks in October has fallen to 2.15 in the last two weeks.Maharashtra’s overall CFR, which was 2.63% is second highest in the country after Punjab (3.14%) and much above national rate of 1.48%. Though the national rate has been steadily coming down, Maharashtra’s CFR hovered around 2.64% for the last six weeks.The weekly CFR had increased to 2.51% in the first week of October (Sept 30-Oct 6), 2.54% in the second week (Oct 7-13) and 2.67 in the third week (Oct 14-20). It had dropped to lowest to 1.84 for two weeks (August 29 to September 13) only to rise thereafter. Again, it dropped to 2.03 last week (Oct 28 to Nov 3) and 2.28% this week (Nov 4-10).The state authorities have attributed the high CFR also to the transparency the state has been maintaining in caseload and the mortality rate. “If you compare the caseload and the fatality rate, Maharashtra leads the chart also because of the transparency we maintain. In many states in northern India and some of the neighbouring states, they have underreported the cases. They have not been conducting tests in the proportion of the spread of infection. It results in a low number of cases and in turn the mortality rate,” said a state health officer on the condition of anonymity.Dr Avinash Supe, head of the state death audit committee, said, “We have been able to bring CFR down through early detection and high testing, but it will remain hovering around 2% because of the age factor and the morbidities among the patients. We have suggested that the government conduct a death audit in each of the hospitals and also divisional scrutiny to explore reasons for high rates in any particular hospital. We have also suggested training and expert clinical advice to the doctors in rural areas through tele communication to avoid the deaths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-mortality-rate-in-maharashtra-drops-in-last-two-weeks/story-oSYuUOMN6RIrqpQFYNgvSJ.html

11-11-2020||India||People need to raise the bar for politicians | Opinion||Even as India is passing through multiple crises, the results of the Bihar assembly election have provided an opportunity to the people to ponder over the ways Indian politics is being conducted. Over the decades, the politics of vested interest pursued by political organisations of various hues have pushed aside people-oriented politics. While misleading sloganeering has overtaken real issues, the masses living in abysmal conditions are in a fix as to how to improve their plight. With every electoral exercise either at national or state level, the developmental agenda takes a back seat and all kinds of divisive agendas are pushed ahead. Bihar assembly election was no exception.It is unfortunate that while the world is moving ahead, the Indian nation is caught in a quagmire of problems filled with hatred and acrimony against each other. At a time when the country has been facing immense socio-economic problems, corruption and mal-administration have been holding its octopus-like grip over the entire system. How seriously corruption in our system has influenced our lives is an issue which has not been documented properly. People generally complain about corruption but fail to gauge the real impact it has had on our lives. Time has come that people are told about it in detail and not in general terms as has been done. The problem has assumed such alarming proportions that nothing less than a total war against this malaise is going to change the situation for the better.India is endowed with the most fertile land available anywhere in the world. We also have the largest arable irrigated land in comparison to any other country. Our water and other natural resources are comparable to the most advanced nations in the world. The quality of our human resource is second to none. We are a democratic country and freely exercise the power and authority to decide our own future. Despite all these positive factors, why do we not perform as well, if not better, than some of the other less endowed countries who became masters of their own destiny almost at the same time when we gained our independence?One can, of course, argue that the country has made tremendous progress in self-sufficiency in food production; we have one of the biggest armies in the world; we have the technological capability of manufacturing everything from a needle to satellites; our trained manpower is compared to the very best in the world etc. No disagreement with the above except the preponderating fact: We should have achieved much more than what we have done so far.There are numerous questions that we must answer. Why should nearly 30 percent of our population still continue to be below the poverty line and be cut off from the progress we have made? Why did we fail to set up the required number of schools and colleges to enable every child to have access to proper education? Who is responsible for nearly 35 percent of our population remaining illiterate? Why are our roads and other basic infrastructure facilities so bad? Why does most of our population remain deprived of basic facilities of sanitation and have almost no access to electricity for a large part of the year? Why are our civic facilities almost non-existent in most of our 6 million villages? And why are millions homeless? We have even failed to provide safe drinking water to our population. These are just some of the crucial areas where we could have done much better like other countries which have performed admirably. In fact corruption, mal-administration, lack of transparency in governance are core issues haunting the country but no political party is ready to discuss them. It is high time that people focus on social, political, economic and administrative reforms to abolish utter poverty and pave the way for all round development without compartmentalisation of various communities. For this to happen the central government needs to show leadership and take the state governments along and work together to get a roadmap prepared for developing our great nation.The Bihar results are indicative of people’s yearning for change but they could not find a proper alternative. Hence, they seem to have fallen back on the ruling dispensation. The reduced number of Janata Dal (U) lawmakers led by chief minister Nitish Kumar has given enough indication about anti-incumbency against the chief minister but there appears to be no hostility against BJP which was a partner in the same government. Henry David Thoreau in his famous essay titled “Civil Disobedience” wrote, “ I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government. Let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect, and that will be one step towards obtaining it.” The time has come for people to unequivocally convey in no uncertain term that they only want development minus corruption and there is no place for caste, communal and such other divisive forces in politics any more.(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.

11-11-2020||India||Odisha to introduce fish in nutrition programme of children and pregnant women||The Odisha government signed a memorandum of understanding ( MoU) with international non-profit organisation World Fish on Tuesday for a pilot programme to include fish and fish-based products in the supplementary nutrition programme for children, pregnant and nursing women and adolescent girls at 50 Anganwadi centres of Mayurbhanj district.The technical collaboration between the Odisha government and World Fish would run for five-years, Development Commissioner Suresh Mohapatra said.“Such innovation will go a long way in accelerating nutrition status in the state. Fish are commonly eaten by tribal communities and are culturally appropriate animal-source food,” said Mohapatra. Gareth Johnstone, director general of World Fish said technical experts from the NGO would support women SHGs in preparation of fish powder with help of Central Institute of Fisheries Technology, Cochin.Small fish like Indian Anchovy, Indian Sardine and lesser sardine would be given to the beneficiaries in powder form or in packets after being dried.Officials said the pilot study dovetails into the Odisha Nutrition Action Plan that outlines a multi-sectoral approach to reducing malnutrition. The ONAP launched in 2016, puts a special focus on reducing malnutrition among women and children from hard to reach tribal districts as well as high rates of stunting and underweight within these populations.At present, Odisha government is giving take home ration as well as hot cooked meals to children, pregnant and lactating women and adolescent girls under supplementary nutrition programme funded by Centre. Under take home ration, chhatua (a powder of roasted Bengal gram, wheat, groundnut and sugar), suji halwa, maize halwa, ragi halwa, jaggery laddoo, besan laddoo are given. Apart from this 3-4 boiled eggs are given to the beneficiaries every week while children are given hot cooked meals at the anganwadi centres. Fruits such as banana, papaya, guava, pineapple, watermelon, mango, orange and local berries are also given to children.But despite the nutrition programme, 47% of children from tribal-dominated districts in Odisha are stunted. That figure is higher than the national average of 38%. Officials said fish, especially small fish eaten whole, would be a rich source of nutritious animal-source food. Studies have shown that Omega-3 fatty acids in fish promote brain growth and eye health, vitamin B12 leads to healthy red blood cells and prevents anemia. Iron and zinc in fishes prevent iron-deficiency and help faster recovery from diarrhoea.The pilot project would integrate fish-based products into the diets of pregnant and lactating women, adolescent girls and children of tribal villages and determine the nutritional potential of adding fish to meals. While 15 gram of fish powder would be added to the daily curry of children at anganwadi centre, dried small fish would be given to the adolescent girls and pregnant women as part of take home ration. The fish powder and dried fish would be sourced from CIFT, Cochin.Women SHGs in the coastal fishing villages will also be trained for seeking business opportunities in solar dried fish and fish powder following food safety standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-introduce-fish-in-nutrition-programme-of-children-and-pregnant-women/story-O7voSGpep1ONb5pni2GZ3L.html

The Advertising Standards Council of India is for regulating the content of the advertisements and Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) monitors films, but there is at present no law or autonomous body governing digital content or Over-the-top (OTT) platforms. The Supreme Court had last month sought the Centre’s response on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) for regulating OTT platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video by an autonomous body. The PIL stated that digital content on these platforms is made available to the public at large without any filter or screening.A bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian had issued notices to the central government, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) and Internet and Mobile Association of India(IAMAI).None of the OTT/streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, and Hotstar have signed the self-regulation provided by the I&B ministry since February 2020, the plea had alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-brings-online-films-news-content-under-ministry-of-information-and-broadcasting/story-r9CN46LnObQqpA9V0GoXoL.html
11-11-2020||India||Congress wins Marwahi assembly bypoll in Chhattisgarh by huge margin||The ruling Congress won the Marwahi assembly bypoll by a huge margin of 38,197 votes on Tuesday. The seat, reserved for Scheduled Tribes (ST) candidates, falls in the newly formed Gaurela-Pendra-Marwahi district and the bypoll was necessitated after Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) MLA and former chief minister Ajit Jogi died in May this year. Congress candidate Dr Krishna Kumar Dhruw won the seat defeating his nearest rival BJP’s Dr Gambhir Singh by 38,197 votes. Dhruw secured 83,561 votes while Singh got 45,364 votes in the bypoll which was held on November 3. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel congratulated Dr Dhruw for his victory and claimed that the victory is of the people of Marwahi. “Marwahi’s by-election was not merely an election to elect an MLA, but was a test of public response against the deceit of the last 18 years,” Baghel said. The Marwahi constituency was the bastion of Jogi for the last two decades but this is the first time in the last 20 years Jogis were not in fray in Marwahi. On October 19, Ajit Jogi’s son and JCC candidate Amit Jogi’s nomination was rejected by the collector on the basis of a high-power committee’s report which found that Amit was not a tribal. The nomination papers of Jogi’s wife Richa Jogi, who had filed nomination for the same seat, were also cancelled by the district collector on the same ground Ten days before the polling, Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (Jogi) had extended support to the BJP candidate alleging that the ruling Congress had insulted Ajit Jogi. The JCC has four MLAs in the 90-member Chhattisgarh assembly. Later, two of the JCC MLA extended their support to Congress in a press conference in Marwahi. Chief minister Baghel led the Congress campaign and visited the constituency four times in the last one month while the BJP’s national vice president and former chief minister Raman Singh led his party’s campaign.The Congress highlighted several pro-farmer and pro-tribal initiatives of the state government including the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna, cow dung procurement scheme, distribution of forest rights certificates, and relief measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. The BJP in its campaign accused the Congress government of failing on all fronts and alleged that the law and order situation in the state has deteriorated. Meanwhile, JCC chief Amit Jogi claimed that the Congress won because the Congress government did not let a Jogi family candidate fight in this election. “The victory is the death of democracy,” Amit said in a statement. With this victory, Congress the tally of Congress in the 90-member state assembly has gone up to 70 MLAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-wins-marwahi-assembly-bypoll-in-chhattisgarh-by-huge-margin/story-qzqRrVtvuVadaPMWrfXiRL.html
11-11-2020||India||Contestants, campaigner, rebel: Dynasts don different mantles in UP bypolls||The Uttar Pradesh assembly bypolls saw dynasts essaying different roles. Some contested, others simply campaigned. The bypolls also had a dynast rebelling against the party and losing. Of the seven seats that went to the polls, the ruling BJP won six and the Samajwadi Party bagged one with both parties retaining the seats they had won in the 2017 UP assembly election.When Sangeeta Chauhan, a retired banker and the wife of former India cricketer and UP minister, the late Chetan Chauhan, was named by the BJP as its candidate from Naugawan Sadat assembly seat in Amroha, many had dismissed her as an outsider. Despite a see-saw battle during the initial rounds of counting, when Samajwadi Party candidate Javed Abbas kept catching up with her and, at times overtook her, Sangeeta Chauhan finally prevailed. Immediately afterwards, an emotional Chauhan said she would strive to fulfil the promises and works initiated by her late husband, whose association with Amroha was over two decades old. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had begun campaigning from Naugawan Sadat where deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya too had sought votes for the party. Far away from Amroha, another Sangeeta (Sengar), wife of former BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar, who was convicted in the rape of a minor and subsequently disqualified from the assembly, was at her residence in Unnao, watching the election results where the BJP’s Shrikant Katiyar was elected as the new MLA from Bangermau. The Sengar family had lobbied for a party ticket for Sangeeta from Bengarmau but after the bid failed to materialise, Sangeeta joined the campaign for Katiyar, the party nominee. Sangeeta Sengar is also a local BJP leader and district panchayat chairperson. “She campaigned as, despite his conviction, Kuldeep still has a considerable following in Bangermau and that is why even opposition parties refrained from attacking the BJP over the former MLA’s conviction and disqualification,” a local BJP leader from Unnao said. In Deoria, late BJP MLA Janmejay Singh’s son Ajay alias Pintoo rebelled against the party decision to deny his claim on his father’s seat. Ajay contested as an independent at the last minute, but failed to stop the BJP from winning. In the Ghatampur reserved seat, where a bypoll was necessitated due to the death of sitting MLA and minister Kamal Rani Varun, her family, which was also in the reckoning for a party ticket, supported the BJP. Kamal’s daughter Swapnil actively supported the party in the by-polls. In Bulandshahr, the BJP fielded its sitting MLA Virendra Singh Sirohi’s widow Usha and she won comfortably. In 2017 UP polls, Virendra Sirohi had won the seat. He had polled 1,11,538 votes and secured his victory over BSP’s Mohd Haji Aleem (88,454 votes), Shujaat Alam of Samajwadi Party (24,119 votes) and Bhagwan Sharma of Rashtriya Lok Dal (17,216 votes). This time Usha Sirohi’s main rival was Mohd Yunus of the BSP. Yunus put up a decent fight initially but the BJP finally won by an impressive margin of 21,702 votes The Samajwadi Party (SP) also backed 35-year old Lucky Yadav, the son of former MLA Parasnath Yadav, whose demise led to the by-poll in the Malhani assembly seat of Jaunpur. Despite trailing in the initial rounds of counting, Lucky Yadav prevailed against independent candidate Dhananjay Singh, a criminal-turned-politician. In 2017, Lucky’s father and former UP minister Parasnath had defeated Dhananjay by around 21,000 votes. Back then, Dhananjay had contested on the Nishad party ticket. “If there is any lesson, it’s this. That none is bigger than the party and dynasts who followed the party line have done well, others who haven’t have flopped,” said SK Dwivedi, a political expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contestants-campaigner-rebel-dynasts-don-different-mantles-in-up-bypolls/story-UWRd5dh19ubVxxBQfqAbhM.html

11-11-2020||India||SC hears Arnab Goswami’s bail plea in 2018 suicide case: What we know so far||Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami’s petition challenging Bombay high court order which refused to grant him interim bail in the 2018 abetment to suicide case was heard by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.A vacation bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee began hearing the case at 10:30 am. The high court had on Monday refused to grant interim bail to Goswami and two others and asked them to move to the local court.In his plea to the apex court filed through lawyer Nirnimesh Dubey, Goswami stated that “the balance of convenience is also in favour of the petitioner and he would suffer irreparable harm and injury” if the high court order is not stayed during the pendency of the present petition, according to news agency ANI. Goswami, who is currently lodged in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja jail, called his arrest and “illegal” detention a violation of his right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950.Apart from the Maharashtra government, Goswami has made the Centre, the Alibaug police station SHO, Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh and Akshyata Anvay Naik as parties to his appeal.The 47-year-old journalist has also filed a bail plea in the sessions court after the Bombay high court order.Shortly after the matter was listed for Wednesday morning, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president objected to the “extraordinary” listing of the Goswani’s petition and questioned the top court’s secretary general to disclose whether any order or direction to list the matter was issued by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) in this regard.Goswami, along with two other accused Feroz Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda, was arrested on November 4 in connection with the 2018 suicide abetment case of designer Anvay Naik and his mother Kumud. The designer, in a suicide note, had alleged non-payment of dues by firms of the accused. The three accused were later produced before a magistrate who refused to send them in police custody and remanded them in judicial custody till November 18.The Republic TV editor was initially kept at a local school which is designated as a Covid-19 quarantine centre for the Alibaug prison. He, however, was on Sunday shifted to the Taloja jail in Raigad district after allegedly being found using a mobile phone while in judicial custody.Pradeep Bhandari, a consulting editor with Republic news channel, on Sunday wrote to CJI SA Bobde urging him to take cognizance of shifting of Goswami to Taloja Jail to keep him allegedly with “hardened” and “underworld” criminals and provide “some sort of safety” to him. He said Goswami has said that “his life is in danger”.

11-11-2020||India||Delhiwale: A visit to Vishnu’s courtyard||The courtyard is flooded with daylight. The marble feels cold to the bare feet. A hand pump lies in the corner.This tranquil destination is one of the very few ‘aangans’, or traditional courtyards, of Old Delhi that an outsider can experience without worrying about intruding into the privacy of its dwellers. Simply because it’s not part of a house, but of a temple.Lakshmi Narayan Mandir, in Kucha Pati Ram, has to be among Delhi’s most beautiful temples—even if it’s rather small, and barely known. The arched entrance door and the long tunnel-like corridor leading into the temple give the first hint of its exquisite quaintness. The courtyard is lined by an arched verandah on either sides. A balcony railing on the upper floor runs about the entire length of the temple. Indeed, the entire space strongly resembles the old houses and havelis that are gradually disappearing from the face of the Walled City, giving way to modern-style apartment blocks.This morning, priest Anand Shukla is perched about the main shrine, consisting of idols of Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi placed inside a marble niche. “The temple is more than a 100 years old,” he says. He himself, a native of Lucknow, has been officiating as its priest for a year.A most distinguished aspect of the temple is that it is home to a God whose idol is rarely kept in temples. Lord Brahma, the four-headed creator of the world, is enshrined on one side of Vishnu. On the other side is the shrine of Varaha, one of Vishnu avatars—he too is rarely seen.The shrine has a series of small brass bells hanging from long chains, each wrapped in a red cloth so that devotees do not touch them.“Because of coronavirus,” the priest explains. Indeed, a bottle of hand sanitiser is placed on a wooden stool.One of the verandahs has a young priest. With arms folded, he is intently staring into the air in front of him, as if in deep thought, making one wonder about his inner life, spirituality, and how he got to chose this life.Meanwhile, a masked visitor in formal pants and shirt enters and offers a brief prayer at each of the three shrines.The temple opens daily with the morning aarti at 7.30 and closes with evening aarti at 7pm.On your way out, don’t forget to check out the letter box in the corridor. It’s painted red.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-a-visit-to-vishnu-s-courtyard/story-z1MLXYDkG3uNF2btgAjoCO.html
11-11-2020||India||Bypoll Results 2020: Voters keep faith in ruling parties||Voters imposed their faith in ruling parties in 10 states where bypolls were held for 30 seats. This tally excludes Madhya Pradesh, where the Bharatiya Janata Party won 19of the 28 seats on offer, consolidating its position in power.In the others, the BJP won 21 of the 25 seats it contested, winning all eight in Gujarat and six out of seven in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress won a seat each in Jharkhand and Haryana while losing seats it contested in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Karnataka.Gujarat (8 seats)The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, set to win all eight assembly seats in Gujarat, termed this a trailer of the 2022 assembly polls even as some Congress leaders wondered how they could not convert the “palpable public anger” into votes.Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said: “This is only a trailer” of the outcome of coming elections to the local civic bodies and the 2022 State Assembly polls.Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani said: “This was not expected. One doesn’t know whatever happened to the people’s anger. Perhaps we were lacking somewhere. We will start afresh.”The BJP candidates, mostly former Congress legislators deployed a campaign that effectively dismantled their erstwhile party’s charge of “gaddaars (traitors)”. They harped on the theme that as Congress MLAs they could not effectively meet the public’s development aspirations.Describing this as the tipping point of the campaign, political scientist and veteran journalist Hari Desai said: “People are no longer bothered about political affiliations or loyalties, but more about who delivers for them in the immediate context. Congress tried to corner them (its ex-MLAs) on this, but couldn’t do much.”The BJP now has 111 lawmakers in the 182-member Gujarat assembly. The Congress has 65, four are others and two seats are vacant.Uttar Pradesh (7 seats)The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) retained six assembly seats while Samajwadi Party (SP) won one in the by-election to seven assembly seats . The BJP won the Bangermau, Deoria, Ghatampur, Tundla, Naugawan Sadat and Bulandshahar seats; it won all of them in 2017 too. For the SP, it was also a repeat performance of 2017 election as it retained the Malhani seat in Jaunpur. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress failed to open their accounts.Terming the victory an endorsement of the BJP government’s performance, CM Yogi Adityanath said the state government has worked for the welfare of the people during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The people have given their blessings by ensuring the victory of BJP candidates on six seats,” he said. The division of votes among Opposition parties — the SP, the BSP and the Congress made the task easy for the BJP.SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, BSP national president Mayawati and Congress UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi did not campaign for their party candidates.Jharkhand (2 seats)The ruling allies Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and the Congress retained assembly seats in the bypolls on Tuesday, even as Basant Soren, youngest of the three sons of JMM patriarch Shibu Soren, became the third person from the state’s first family to become a member of the assembly. In Bermo assembly seat, Jai Mangal Singh, son of Congress veteran Rajendra Singh, won by over 14,000 votes, defeating former BJP legislator Yogeshwar Mahto Batul. The seat fell vacant after Rajendra Singh, who was representing the seat for the sixth time died in May.Basant Soren, 41, defeated former BJP minister Lois Marandi by over 6,400 votes in party stronghold Dumka, the constituency vacated by his elder brother and incumbent chief minister Hemant Soren. Sita Soren, wife of late Durga Soren, eldest son of Shibu Soren, represents Jama seat in the Jharkhand assembly. JMM chief Shibu Soren is currently a member of the Rajya Sabha. The ruling JMM-Congress-RJD combine won a comfortable majority in the assembly polls in December.Manipur (4 seats)Of the four by-elections held in Manipur, the BJP won three and a party-supported independent candidate won the fourth seat, helping it cross the majority mark in the 60-member assembly having effective strength of 58. With these wins, the BJP now has 29 MLAs in the house. BJP candidates won from Wangoi, Wangjing Tentha and Saitu seats and independent Y Antas Khan won from Lilong. The BJP had already won Singhat assembly seat unopposed.Karnataka (2 seats)The ruling BJP won both the seats for which by-elections were held, wresting Sira from the JD(S) and Rajarajeshwari (RR) Nagar from the Congress. It created history by recording its first ever victory in the Sira assembly segment Dr C M Rajesh Gowda winning with a margin of over 12,000 votes.In R R Nagar, N Munirathana emerged winner with a margin of over 58,000 votes against his nearest Congress rival Kusuma. The elections were necessitated by the death of Sira JD(S) MLA B Satyanarayana in August and the resignation of RR Nagar Congress MLA Munirathna from the assembly last year. The BJP now has 119 lawmakers in the 224-member state assembly.Odisha (2 seats)The ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) retained the two assembly seats. BJD’s Bijaya Shankar Das defeated BJP candidate Rajkishore Behera by 30,000 votes in Tirtol seat in Jagatsinghpur district and in Balasore, party candidate Swarup Kumar Das defeated BJP rival Manas Kumar Dutta by close to 9,000 votes. The deaths of Balasore’s BJP MLA Madan Mohan Dutta and Tirtol’s BJD legislator Bishnu Charan Das necessitated the by-elections.Chhattisgarh (1 seat)The ruling Congress won the reserved Marwahi bypolls by a margin of 38197 votes on Tuesday. The bypoll was necessitated after Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) MLA and former chief minister Ajit Jogi died in May. The Congress candidate, Dr Krishna Kumar Dhruw won the by poll defeating his nearest rival BJP’s Dr Gambhir Singh by 38,197 votes. “Marwahi’s by-election was not merely an election to elect an MLA, but was a test of public against the deceit of the last 18 years,” chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said.Nagaland (2 seats)The ruling Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) retained the Southern Angami-I Assembly seat as its candidate Medo Yhokha won the by-election by a close margin of 598 votes. In Pungro-Kiphire, BJP hopeful Lirimong Sangtam was defeated by independent candidate T. Yangseo Sangtam who secured 8,747 votes. INC candidate Khaseo Anar polled only 347 votes out of 27013. In the house of 60, the NDPP has 20 MLAs, its ally BJP has 12, opposition NPF has 25 and two others are independents.Telangana (1 seat)The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday recorded an emphatic victory in the by-elections to Dubbak assembly constituency in Siddipet district by winning the seat, albeit with a slender margin of 1,470 votes.BJP candidate M Raghunandan Rao secured 62,772 votes as against 61,302 votes polled by TRS candidate Solipeta Sujatha, widow of former MLA S Ramachandra Reddy, whose death necessitated the by-elections. Congress candidate Cheruku Srinivas Reddy, son of former Dubbak MLA Ch Mutyam Reddy, finished a poor third with 21,819 votes. With this victory, the strength of the BJP in the state assembly goes up to two - Rao will join T Raja Singh of Hyderabad in the house.Haryana (1 seat)The opposition Congress on Tuesday retained the Baroda assembly seat after its candidate Indu Raj Narwal defeated BJP nominee and Olympian wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt by a margin of 10,566 votes. This is the second time that Dutt has lost from the constituency. In the 2019 assembly poll, he had lost by about 4,800 votes to Congress candidate Krishan Hooda. The Baroda bypoll was necessitated following the death of Hooda in April. He had won the constituency thrice in 2009, 2014 and 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bypoll-results-2020-voters-keep-faith-in-ruling-parties/story-NuY2xph4505AzhEC7tTmUK.html
11-11-2020||India||BJP gets 19 seats in Madhya Pradesh, seals assembly majority||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) achieved a major victory in bypolls held to 28 legislative assembly constituencies, winning and leading in 19; the Opposition Congress, which won 27 of these seats in the 2018 state assembly elections, could win or lead in just nine.The bypolls were necessitated by 25 Congress MLAs resigning from the state assembly — 22 (all loyalists of Jyotiraditya Scindia, who quit the Congress in March to join the BJP) and three in July — and due to death of three more (two from the Congress and one from the BJP). Of the constituencies that saw by polls, 16 fall in the Gwalior-Chambal region.Analysts said the results are significant for several reasons: one, the BJP has got a clear majority in the 230-member state assembly by increasing its strength from 107 to 126 MLAs ; two, it is a victory for Scindia, who campaigned for many of the candidates; and three, the BJP’s margin of victory on many of the seats was high.Of the lawmakers who quit the Congress in March and subsequently joined the BJP, 12 were made ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government. The win allows them to remain ministers.The BJP won nine out of 16 seats in the Gwalior-Chambal region, and six of the seven seats in Malwa.Senior BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Scindia’s influence was clearly visible in the results in Guna, which is Scindia’s own parliamentary constituency, where his party won all three seats.This, experts said, was a repudiation of the personal and bitter campaign waged by the Congress against him.“People have given a befitting reply to the policies of Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh and policies of corruption and anti-development. I bow to the people of Madhya Pradesh and the workers of BJP for their blessings and support in this election,” said Scindia.Outside his area of direct influence, the BJP didn’t perform as well. For example, in Morena, the BJP won two out of five seats.With the BJP’s victory, chief minister Chouhan and Scindia, who led the BJP’s campaign from the front and dubbed themselves the “Shiv-Jyoti Express” have emerged stronger within the BJP, political analysts said.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “This victory is of people of Madhya Pradesh, their trust in the BJP and also of democracy, development and social justice.”Admitting the party’s defeat former chief minister Kamal Nath said: “We respect the public’s mandate. We made our efforts to convey our message to people. I am thankful to voters. We will discharge our duties as a responsible Opposition and will continue to fight to protect the interests of people and the state. We will review the results. I hope that BJP government will take care of interest of farmers, youth, women and others.”Congratulating the BJP candidates on their victory and expressing his gratitude to all the voters, Scindia said: “I strongly believe that all the winning candidates will always be eager to ensure development of their constituencies.”Political analyst Girija Shankar said, “The by poll results have silenced all the critics of Chouhan and Scindia. They have emerged stronger in the BJP. Scindia has proved once again that he is a true mass leader.”“The results also suggest that people are still angry with the Congress and Nath for not fulfilling their poll promises.”The Congress won the 2018 elections in the state and formed the government, which fell earlier this year on the resignation of the lawmakers.Political analyst Jayant Singh Tomar said the Congress may have suffered because of its “negative campaign.“It appeared as if the party had nothing to say about its governance for 15 months,” he said.Senior state Congress leader Manak Agarwal said the party would review its performance and “take corrective measures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-gets-19-seats-in-madhya-pradesh-seals-assembly-majority/story-JIsnO4RBbYttlPnyanw8JJ.html
11-11-2020||India||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: How to read the Bihar results||Defying exit poll predictions, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has retained power in Bihar. At the time of going to press (11:45 pm), the NDA had wins/leads in 124 out of the 243 assembly constituencies in the state, two above the halfway mark of 122.The Mahagathbandhan (MGB) had wins/leads in 111 ACs. The NDA comprises the Janata Dal (United), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Vikasshel Insan Party (VIP) and the Hindustani Awam Morcha Secular (HAM). The JD(U) and the BJP have allocated seats from the HAM and VIP from their own quota.Click here for complete Bihar election coverage The MGB has the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and the three left parties, namely the Communist Party of India Marxist Leninist Liberation (CPI-ML), Communist Party of India Marxist (CPI-M) and the Communist Party of India (CPI). An HT analysis shows that the headline numbers on seat shares hide a lot of nuances which define the 2020 Bihar contest.This was a really close electionWhile the NDA has a 5.3 percentage point lead over the MGB in terms of seat share, they had almost identical vote shares of 37.21% and 37.23%. To be sure, this is not the first time that a winning party/coalition has got a disproportionately higher seat share than its vote share. For example in the Congress managed to surge ahead of the BJP in the 2018 Madhya Pradesh elections in terms of seats, despite getting a lower vote share than the latter. The NDA’s vote share is the lowest for the winning alliance in Bihar since the 2010 assembly elections, and only slightly higher than 36.1% vote share of the NDA in the elections held in 2005 October. The vote share of parties outside the two major alliances has increased to 25.6%, 1.5 percentage points more than the 2015 assembly elections. The fact that the non-NDA non-MGB parties have won just 3.3% of the ACs, the lowest since October 2005, shows that they have acted largely as spoilers in these elections.See Chart 1: Vote share and seat share of NDA, RJD plus and others in BiharThe NDA got its act together from the second phase onwardsA phase-wise analysis of the elections suggests that the NDA gained a massive momentum after the first phase. While the MGB won 67.6% of the 71 ACs in the first phase, its strike rate dropped to 44.7% and 26.9% in the second and third phase. For the NDA, strike rates improved in each phase; from 29.6% in the first phase to 54.3% and 66.7% in the second and third phase. This pattern suggests a silent counter-polarisation behind the NDA, indication that its strategy of attacking the MGB by evoking memories of “jungle-raj”; a term often used to attack poor governance when the RJD was in power from 1999 to 2005, has paid rich dividends. The fact that the MGB was shown as gathering momentum as the polls progressed might actually have aided this counter-consolidation. An HT analysis of gender-wise voting pattern shows that women vote might have played a big role in the NDA’s victory.See Chart 2: Phase-wise strike rateAn election of churning in both identity and ideologyAn established way of analysing elections, especially in the crucial states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh has been to use the binary of social identity versus Hindutva. While the forces of Mandal, a term used for parties which have had their core support base among other backward classes (OBCs), such as the RJD and the Samajwadi Party, have banked on a dominant OBC plus Muslim consolidation, the BJP has tried to build a rainbow Hindu coalition to counter this strategy. In Bihar, the JD(U) has been an integral component of the BJP’s strategy of building a disparate Hindu coalition against the RJD’s Muslim-Yadav support base. Both the Congress and the left got pushed out in this realignment of political forces.The 2020 Bihar elections suggest a churning on both the identity and ideology fronts. The fact that the BJP has performed much better than the JD(U) shows that the votaries of Hindutva are increasingly asserting that the BJP should replace the JD(U) as the senior partner in the NDA in Bihar. An almost mirror image of this phenomenon can be seen in the All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen’s (AIMIM) impressive performance in the Muslim dominated Seemanchal region of Bihar. It shows that a significant section of Muslims have given up on being supporters of the RJD and are willing to do business with a party which champions their identity, even at the risk of bringing the BJP to power. In the five ACs where the AIMIM has won is leading, MGB candidates were in the third position in four ACs, whereas the NDA was in the second place.Similarly, the fact that the left parties, which are expected to have a more coherent ideological critique of the BJP, have outperformed both the RJD and the Congress in terms of strike rate in the MGB, suggests that merely evoking identity or adopting a centrist plank, might not be enough to counter the BJP’s political appeal in today’s age.See Chart 3: Party-wise strike rate of NDA and MGB partners||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-assembly-election-2020-how-to-read-the-bihar-results/story-7R4bxFrRhUuoHf3Mo6Tp7K.html
11-11-2020||India||PM Modi takes dig at Pakistan during virtual SCO meeting||Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a swipe at Pakistan at the virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) on Tuesday, saying it is unfortunate that repeated attempts were being made to violate the grouping’s charter by raising bilateral issues. Modi also said connectivity initiatives should be built around respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, and reiterated that India stood ready to help all nations fight the Covid-19 crisis with its vaccine production and distribution capabilities. The SCO heads of state summit, chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin, was held virtually owing to the pandemic. It was the first time that Modi and President Xi Jinping shared the same platform since the India-China standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) emerged in the open in May. Modi, who spoke in Hindi, said India believes in peace, security and prosperity, and has always opposed terrorism, illegal arms smuggling, drug trafficking and money laundering, he added. Without naming Pakistan, he said: “It is unfortunate that repeated attempts are being made to unnecessarily bring bilateral issues to the SCO agenda, which violate the SCO Charter and Shanghai Spirit. Such efforts are contrary to the spirit of consensus and cooperation that defines SCO.” India has reacted sharply to Pakistan’s repeated efforts, often with support from its traditional ally China, to raise the Kashmir issue at multilateral bodies such as SCO and the UN Security Council since the special status of Jammu and Kashmir was scrapped in August last year. In September, India walked out of a virtual meeting of national security advisers of SCO after the Pakistani representative projected a map that inaccurately depicted the borders of the two countries. Russia, which chaired that meeting, subsequently informed India that the Pakistani representative had gone ahead with the action despite being asked not to do so. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who spoke after Modi, criticised India without naming the country. Khan praised China, including for its assistance for tackling the pandemic and its support for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is opposed by India as it passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Noting that SCO was established to ensure security across Eurasia, Khan said, in an apparent reference to Kashmir: “SCO stands for strict observance of this principle and the principles of the UN charter such as equality and sovereignty of states, respect for territory integrity, sanctity of borders, non-aggression, non-use of threat of force and people’s right for self-determination.” Khan further said “unilateral and illegal measures to change the status of disputed territories in violation of the UN Security Council resolutions run counter” to SCO’s objectives, and such steps must be opposed. Modi said the International North South Transport Corridor and Iran’s Chabahar port reflect “India’s strong resolve towards connectivity”. He added, “India believes that to further deepen connectivity, it is necessary to move forward with the core principles of respecting each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-takes-dig-at-pakistan-during-virtual-sco-meeting/story-zlgfG0WUup4DkKwu736cpM.html

On July 20, Odisha had last reported less than 1,000 cases. Odisha has now 3.03 lakh Covid-19 cases of which 1507 have succumbed to the virus.The state government has already banned burning of firecrackers till November-end and extended closure of schools till end of December. However, the daily positivity rate has now dropped below 3 per cent even as more than 43,000 tests are being done daily. The government is now planning to go for population-based testing strategy to curb the spread of the virus more effectively.Health department officials said while the testing strategy till now was based on the disease burden in the districts, it has been decided to conduct tests in proportion to the population of a particular area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wary-of-second-covid-19-wave-odisha-capital-bans-marriage-processions/story-m5kmotBeSh32iRybxqZTTO.html
11-11-2020||India||BJP juggernaut steamrolls Gujarat by-elections, wins all 8 seats||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, which has won all eight assembly seats in Gujarat, termed its performance a trailer of sorts before the 2022 assembly polls whereas the Congress wondered how it could not convert the “palpable public anger” that it had claimed to have spotted, into votes.The counting for votes in the by-election for eight assembly seats in Gujarat was held on Tuesday. Right from 8 a.m. when counting began on Tuesday, BJP candidates maintained clear leads over their Congress rivals, except in Karjan in Vadodara district and Morbi in Morbi district where it expected to overtake the BJP. That hope too was short lived.The Congress had been counting these two seats among the sure-shot victories that it could score. The BJP had maintained it would get all but one. As the BJP broke into celebrations right in the afternoon when its candidates established formidable leads, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani told reporters, “This is only a trailer”. It was a reference to the upcoming elections to the local civic bodies and the 2022 assembly polls.The by-elections, held for Abdasa (Kutch district), Karjan (Vadodara), Morbi (Morbi), Gadhada (Botad), Dhari (Amreli), Limbdi (Surendranagar), Kaprada (Valsad) and Dang (Dangs), were necessitated after the eight Congress MLAs resigned ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections. Five of them were given BJP tickets and all have won.Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani appeared to be on the verge of breaking down when he conceded his shock and surprise at the poll outcome. “This was not expected. One doesn’t know whatever happened to the people’s anger. Perhaps we were lacking somewhere. Well, we will start afresh,” he said.Gujarat Congress chief spokesperson Manish Doshi said, “We were up against the police and money muscle of a ruling party which had made even a by-election a prestige issue. We will need to figure out how to face this unequal challenge.”Claims and rebuttals aside, the turncoat BJP candidates on five seats deployed a campaign that effectively dismantled the Congress charge of “gaddaars (traitors)”. They harped on the theme that they had crossed over since they were not able to meet the public’s development aspirations as long as they stayed in the Congress and their shift to the ruling party would obliterate this disadvantage.Political scientist and veteran journalist Hari Desai believes this pitch tipped the campaign. “People are no longer bothered about political affiliations or loyalties, but more about who delivers for them in the immediate context. Congress tried to corner them (its ex-MLAs) on this (party loyalty), but couldn’t do much because of this,” he said.The BJP candidates, who had crossed over from the Congress, didn’t mince words. BJP’s Karjan candidate Akshay Patel had cited various examples how his shift from the Congress to the BJP had helped people. “About Rs 25 crore of our Karjan sugar factory was stuck in the State Government and I couldn’t do much. Soon after I joined the BJP, this work was instantly done.”In the Adivasi constituency of Kaprada in south Gujarat, Jitubhai Chaudhary spoke about how he couldn’t get government approvals for grants as long as he was in the BJP. “But now things would be easy after my joining the BJP.” All the five former Congress MLAs turned BJP candidates made this a key point.Veteran political and social scientist Vidyut Joshi said the Congress needs to address the “larger malaise.”“The Congress in Gujarat today has a few leaders and an almost absent grassroots network. You bring in Hardik Patel as the working president or replace any leader, it won’t serve any purpose till you have a force that mobilises the voters to the polling station on the D-day,” he said.Newly-appointed state BJP president CR Paatil’s entire focus, like in his own Navsari Lok Sabha constituency where he won in 2019 with the country’s highest margin of 6.89 lakh votes, was on the “Page Pramukhs (key coordinator of every page on the electoral rolls)” and making them accountable. This is the BJP’s - and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s - time-tested strategy. “You need a match to this strategy, but there are no traditional Congress wings like Seva Dal and Youth Congress working in tandem,” Joshi pointed out.Congress brought in maverick Patidar leader Hardik Patel, who, to his credit, has continuously been on the move even after the 2017 assembly elections, but he could not do much either in front of the BJP’s juggernaut. For the same reason, absence of a well-oiled machinery down to the last man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-juggernaut-steamrolls-gujarat-by-elections-wins-all-8-seats/story-PZHBwDbR2PeoWx8XyBzn1J.html

11-11-2020||Editorials||The message from Bihar | HT Editorial||The Bihar elections have thrown up a simple, yet complex, outcome. The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is set to return to power with Nitish Kumar as chief minister — but the terms of the relationship between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Janata Dal (United) have changed in favour of the former. The Mahagatbandhan (grand alliance) of Opposition parties, will remain in the Opposition — but Tejashwi Yadav has put up a credible performance. And other forces have primarily played the role of weaning away votes from both major alliances. There are five key messages from the results. One, despite the distress caused by the lockdown, which led to hundreds of thousands of Bihari migrants returning home, there is a fundamental trust that a large segment of citizens have in Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Make no mistake — if Mr Modi had not been the face of the alliance, it would have been difficult for the NDA to retain its base and offset the resentment against Nitish Kumar. The fact that the BJP has emerged the senior partner in Bihar, and has also won a majority of by-polls across the country, including in Madhya Pradesh, also indicates that voters are not holding the party responsible for the economic and humanitarian crises caused by Covid-19. The BJP’s hegemony remains intact. Second, social identities matter. There is an evolution in caste-based identity politics, but it is clear from the contours of the outcome that Muslims and Yadavs largely consolidated behind the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Both polls and media reports captured this energy and enthusiasm of the Opposition’s base. But given the often adversarial and conflictual relationship between caste groups on the ground, if there is consolidation on one hand, there is a counter-consolidation on the other. And there was a silent surge of sections of upper castes, extremely backward classes and Dalits behind the NDA — for they feared a return of their rivals to the power structure — supplemented by women voters across castes who reposed faith in Nitish Kumar for his gender-sensitive politics. Third, economic distress is on the popular agenda. The RJD may have failed to oust the NDA — but Tejashwi Yadav, in his father Lalu Prasad’s absence, ran an energetic campaign focused on “economic justice” and has emerged a key leader in his own right. The fact that the promise of government jobs became an agenda of competitive politics is a reflection of how young voters in Bihar are now seeking reforms that can generate employment within the state — this is what is being seen, including by the NDA voters, as the incumbent government’s weakness so far. But while this triggered disillusionment and voters wanted change, the nature of that change was equally important. And this is where Mr Yadav failed to reassure the electorate that his tenure will be different from his father’s or provide a firm road map of how he would control the anarchy that often marked the RJD’s rule in the past. Unconvinced of the nature of change, voters stuck to the status quo. Four, ideological categories have limits in explaining outcomes. In the same election where the BJP, representing what is defined as the Right in the Indian political lexicon, has performed well, the Left forces — of all shades, including the radical variants — have also done remarkably well; in the same election where the RJD has seen Muslim consolidation in large measure, the Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen has put up a respectable performance based on the Muslim vote; and in the same election where economic distress was salient, caste remained a dominant factor.Finally, the 2020 outcome marks the beginning of the transition to the next generation of leaders and newer forces in Bihar. Despite Nitish Kumar’s return, politics in the state will now revolve around preparing for a post-Nitish Kumar landscape. This will generate tensions within the NDA as the BJP asserts itself; it will lead to political experiments, including possible emergence of new forces; it will make Tejashwi Yadav a man to watch out for; and it will keep Chirag Paswan in the mix for he damaged Mr Kumar even if he failed to achieve much on his own. A churn is underway, within the larger backdrop of seeming continuity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-message-from-bihar-ht-editorial/story-QghY0RXudDqX21O2XS9FmK.html
