But the whimsical presidents of the United States, Brazil and Philippines all espouse politics that stem from their personalities. Modi, by contrast, is the disciplined face of a movement that has spent 100 years re-arranging society. He will be that much harder to beat.The movement that created Modi, Hindu nationalism, was itself created 100 years ago. The spark was the introduction (by the British conceding to nationalist demands) of elections in the 1920s. The cornerstone of any definition of democracy, elections, are premised on individual equality. Every person has an equal vote. But although race and other identities have always played some role in Europe and America, the social and economic lives of Indians were entirely structured around venn diagrams of region, language, caste, and religion. Elections in India were thus a high-stakes gamble. Would democracy rewire Indians into voting as individuals with interests, rather than groups with identities?The opposite is what happened. Instead of crystallising into individuals, India’s myriad groups now had an incentive to harden their boundaries. Perhaps the first community that understood how destabilising elections can be to traditional group identities were rich Muslim aristocrats, many of them from the United Provinces (today’s Uttar Pradesh). They saw clearly that elections would reduce Muslims to a permanent “minority”. Their response was the creation of the All India Muslim League, with the sole aim of diluting one-person-one-vote to shield Muslims from the Hindu majority. Elections set of a different panic among early Hindu nationalists. They welcomed one-person-one-vote but focussed on creating a Hindu “vote-bank” that could dominate elections. Late 19th century Hindu thinkers had been concerned with the question: “What is Hinduism?” This was replaced by the question that VD Savarkar used as the eventual subtitle of his famous essay on Hindutva: “Who is a Hindu?” It is no coincidence that Savarkar was following the elections of the 1920s when he wrote his essay. And the first institutions of Hindu nationalism — the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Hindu Mahasabha —were also creatures of the 1920s. Their challenge now remains the same as it was then: To persuade India’s 966 million Hindus to vote as one religious group.Many of Prime Minister Modi’s policies can be traced to this focus on a religious majority that electoral individualism funnels into democratic power. Take his government’s decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. Article 370 of the Indian Constitution had enabled special laws that shielded the state’s 8.5 million Muslims from the voting might of 100 times as many Indian Hindus. Now, by simply letting more Indians from other states move to Kashmir, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) hopes that separatist sentiments will dissolve, demographically. This is the same numbers game behind Modi’s other policy: The Citizenship (Amendment) Act. By increasing (even if feebly) the number of Hindu citizens, the BJP enhances its social majority.Modi’s many critics imagine ways to beat him at his own game. They dream up social coalitions of Dalits (16%), tribals (8%), Other Backward Classes (roughly 42%), and Muslims (15%) to isolate the upper-castes (less than 20%) who they consider the hidden hand behind the BJP. While this mathematical equation has been memorised in university seminars and newsrooms, evidence from 40 years of elections points to a new arithmetic.Tribals and OBCs began turning to the BJP from the 1980s. These were the fruits of decades-long branching out by the RSS and BJP, aware of the electoral limits of their upper-caste roots. Modi, from a lower-caste community of oil extractors, is the apotheosis of this self-awareness. He has done at least as much for reservations as any PM before him. This has not gone unnoticed. In the 2019 elections, Modi won over more SC, ST, and OBC voters than his rivals. The Modi vote is a bridge that spans the Hindu hierarchy.This caste inclusion comes mixed with an advertised rebuff to Muslims. Tensions between Hindus and Muslims are a historical fault-line that Hindu nationalism did not invent. But it has fallen to Modi to emphasise these differences. He revives the memory of ancient invasions as a foil to culturally unite today’s Hindus. The glue that fuses Modi’s Hindu alloy together is as much his outreach to lower castes as a primal fear of Muslims.These sharp edges have led some to portray the BJP as anti-democratic; fascist even. But why end elections, when it is the organising principle that shapes your politics? Hindu nationalists may be illiberal, but they are comfortable with free and fair elections, the bedrock of any democracy. It is a comfort made cosier by the fact that traditional Hinduism does not provide for a “Hindu State” that can replace democracy. Unlike the Islamic Caliphate or Christian Papal State, the Hindu State is an elected one.The second slur hurled at the BJP is that they are “conservative reactionaries”; upper-caste men whose customary power is being threatened by the rise of the lower orders. But, apart from the fact that the lower orders seem to vote otherwise, this misses ways in which Hindu nationalism breaks from the past. While traditional Hinduism had contempt for lower castes such as Modi, his new Hinduism courts their votes. And while its older avatar made room for a range of rites, Modi’s India seeks to standardise Hinduism while fomenting suspicion of Muslims.This radicalism — part roomy, part cramped — is what makes Modi so hard to beat. That and one hundred years of re-engineering society to harness the power of the individual vote. Settle yourself in for a long haul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/modi-the-creation-of-a-100-year-movement/story-XKueQ6MhlKuG4Jg2yGmyLN.html
28-11-2020||News||The farm logjam isn’t intractable. Resolve it||In its pursuit of economic prosperity, India tends to gloss over two vital facts. One, farm growth can cut poverty twice as fast as industrial growth. Two, a one per cent rise in agricultural output raises industrial output by 0.5% and national income by 0.7%. In other words, in nations where a large of number of people continue to rely on farming, the economy is structurally tied to the farm sector. If one looks at the overall performance of Indian agriculture over the past six decades, it appears to have done reasonably well. Food production has increased by more than five times, from just 50 tonnes in 1950-51 to an estimated 295.67 million tonnes in 2019-20. This helped to overcome the scary Malthusian prospect of food output not keeping pace with population growth. But that’s about all India’s agriculture has been able to achieve. The rate of investment in agriculture in the 1980s and 1990s was 8-12%. These years roughly coincide with the sixth and tenth five-year plans. With such low spending, farm growth hobbled at 2.4% or so. In contrast, public investments in other sectors were over 35%. This low-investment phase in agriculture was reversed only with the 10th and 11th five-year plans (2002-07 and 2007-12). Indian farmers receive lower-than-international prices for their produce because of increasing costs of cultivation, dysfunctional markets and the government’s obsession with keeping food prices low. This has worsened agriculture’s terms of trade, measured as a ratio of prices of agri-products to prices of manufactured items. The crisis, therefore, is not one of low production, but of low prices. The fading of the Green Revolution has triggered social consequences. Pastoral communities, such as Jats and Gujjars participated heavily in the 1857 War of Independence, resulting in the British co-opting them with a lot of quasi-ownership of land. They, therefore, benefited richly from the Green Revolution. Falling returns from farming have stoked violent agitation by these groups for a portion of India’s reservation pie. The minimum support price (MSP) policy, which offers guaranteed prices mainly for rice and wheat through government procurement, benefits farmers only in a handful of states. The 70th round of National Sample Survey showed only 13.5% of paddy growers and 16.2% of wheat growers received MSPs. While MSPs have incentivised foodgrains over other crops, they have given rise to serious imbalances of water and land resources, surplus stocks and shifted land away from crops, such as pulses and oilseeds, necessitating imports. Also, MSPs, administered prices, as they are, tend to distort market prices. A new deal to fundamentally reshape agriculture was, therefore, imperative. The Narendra Modi government had few options but to liberalise the sector by enacting three farm laws in September. The laws allow businesses to freely trade farm produce outside the so-called government-controlled mandi system, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers fear the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by corporations and pave the way for the government to stop buying staples at MSPs. A law barring sale of all farm produce below MSP, a key demand of farmers, makes little economic sense. If it is not profitable for traders to buy at federally-fixed MSP, and it is made compulsory, then the private sector will simply exit the markets. On the other hand, the government cannot be a monopoly buyer of all produce. So, the assumption behind the new changes is that free competition in agricultural markets will ultimately result in a market-clearing price, at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, resulting in an equilibrium. Good economics needn’t mean bad politics. Farmers must realise there are limits to government procurement at support prices. To convince farmers, the government has to devise a mechanism that will sufficiently protect farm incomes when markets fail. There are many policy options available, which are outside the scope of this analysis. But that is the only way forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-farm-logjam-isn-t-intractable-resolve-it/story-vYRDoHfSnhPoCDZsZE2jtL.html

As per the records provided by the traffic police, till November 25, action was taken against 4,646 auto drivers and a total fine of ₹2.32 lakh collected.The highest number of 570 cases was registered in Kalwa followed by 517 in Kalyan and 358 cases by Kapurbawadi while Ambernath had merely 55 violation cases against the auto drivers followed by 118 in Vithalwadi and 137 in Rabodi.Balasaheb Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic), said, “We had received several complaints from the commuters about auto rickshaw drivers ferrying more than two commuters. As per the norms of social-distancing, only two commuters can travel in an auto at a time. Most share autos from railway station carried four to five commuters, thus we initiated the special drive. A fine of ₹500 was imposed on the drivers who were caught ferrying more than two commuters.”With the unavailability of adequate public transport, most residents opt for share autos to reach home from the station. Patil said, “This being true, it is certainly not advisable to sit in close proximity of each other as it is a sure way of passing the infection. We would appeal to the commuters to wait for next auto or bus instead of overcrowding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-32l-fine-collected-from-auto-drivers-ferrying-more-than-two-passengers-in-thane/story-InnQGethaRVgs7lQvYrkiI.html
28-11-2020||Chandigarh||Wildbuzz: A cobra’s polite reminder||Golfers playing the tricity greens occasionally stumble upon a shed snake skin. They are wary of venturing close, fearing that the discard’s owner may be lurking and tempted to take a nip at a rippling ankle. The skin is evidence of a snake’s presence, a reptile most often not seen due to its furtive, nocturnal existence. Like a leopard and its revelatory pugmarks, a snake is ghostly, it is here and yet not there. Freshly-discarded skins of Spectacled cobras are lying to the left of the ladies’ tee box at the 6th hole and another one just ahead of the tee for the 7th hole at the Chandigarh Golf Club. Hawk-eyed caddies spotted the skins and tipped off their sahebs, leading to a jittery surprise at the spot and a mental note for the future not to hit an errant ball into that spot of scrub roughs!This was followed by banter at the 19th watering hole and a recall of snake anecdotes, the caddies’ wagging tongues being a principal source of such lore. Speculation followed on species identity, whether it was venomous, and cues were the distinctive impression of scales on discarded skin. Snakes shed periodically as their body outgrows the skin, which does not keep pace with the reptile’s growth. When discarding, the snake inches its way through the old layer until it is completely removed, inside out, much like peeling off one’s sock! What appears uncanny is that the skin is found in one perfect piece (try skinning a Kinnaur apple in one, unbroken peel!). The fragile discard – like crumbling, flaming autumn leaves on winter’s pyre – returns to nourish the soil that had birthed it.I sought a perspective from herpetologist and Padma Shri awardee Rom Whitaker. “Since snakes are territorial (have a specific home range), they may indeed return to where they shed their skins. Also, a male snake will follow the scent trail of a female and may show up where a female had shed her skin. There are ancient myths that snakes live forever since they are able to shed their skins and thus ‘renew’ themselves. If you look closely at a shed skin, you will see that even the eye cap is shed, which is like a snake changing its contact lenses!” Whitaker told this writer.  La Vie En Rose ‘Life in happy or rosy hues’, is the title of a French song immortalised by Edith Piaf. But life was hardly happy last week for tricity citizens due to the cold wave. Poor granny’s teeth chattered like a typewriter’s clatter as winds armed with the sting of snows swept down from Himachal Pradesh and beyond.If you wondered what stoic Himachalis were weathering high above and what unseen devil was causing your discomfort in the plains, here is a picture that could thaw a 1,000 words from the frozen sea within. It was taken on Thursday at a highlander’s cottage garden ringed by orchards of apple and shrouded in half-a-foot of snow in the village of Bahu, Banjar valley (Kullu).A bunch of velvety vine roses set in snow like rubies glowing in a white jewel case, the photo kindled warm fires in the landscape of the imagination. “Snows came early but are beneficial as they are white manure for apples. The more it snows, the better for apples though our lives get tougher. My garden roses bear snow bravely and will not wilt till such time as their branches snap under repeated snowfall,” Atheist Deepak, the iconoclast photographer, told this writer. For orchard owners, snow struggles and robust roses evoke a bitter-sweet metaphor: the best roses oft come with the most prickly thorns.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-a-cobra-s-polite-reminder/story-ZLWhzVzayzcEe75t9homiN.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||Despite warnings, heavy vehicles use narrow bypass road in Kalyan||Heavy vehicles continue to use the narrow and weak bridges along the Govindwadi bypass road despite the directives to use the road only for light vehicles.The authorities have put up a sign board on the bypass preventing heavy vehicles from taking the route.However, a huge trailer truck passing along the bypass early this week met with an accident followed by which one side of the road was shut for more than two days.This led to traffic congestion on the Patripool Rail Over Bridge (ROB) that connects to the bypass road.The container was carrying a 100ft-long huge drum, the bottom of the container rammed into the speed breaker at the bypass road. “The repair work was initiated on Wednesday and by evening, the trailer was shifted from the bypass road,” said Sukhdev Patil, senior police inspector, Kalyan traffic police.The Govindwadi bypass road was opened to the vehicles in February 2017 by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). However, heavy vehicles were prohibited due to a narrow and weak bridge falling on this bypass road.Sreeniwas Ghanekar, a social activist from Kalyan, said, “When the authority has put up a board saying that heavy vehicles cannot be allowed, how come these vehicles ply on the bypass road. The work on the bypass road is still under way and there is no safety measures taken by the authority as heavy vehicles keep plying on this road.”Shashikant Sontakke, chief engineer, MSRDC, said it was the job of the traffic police to stop the trailer.He added, “There are two narrow bridges on the bypass road, out of which work on one was completed while the repair of the other bridge is under way. We have clearly stated that no heavy vehicles can ply on the bridge. The traffic police should ensure it is imposed.”The traffic police, however, stated that these vehicles are allowed at night despite the directives. “The heavy vehicles can be allowed between 11pm and 5am, which is why the trailer was allowed,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-warnings-heavy-vehicles-use-narrow-bypass-road-in-kalyan/story-YleGqIgmAPMz50WhlvPxTI.html

28-11-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: Blended learning models are here to stay||Today, we cannot imagine education systems without technological interventions. The penetration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in academic affairs has scaled up during the Covid-19 pandemic as millions of students have been driven out of their academic space and kept confined at their homes.In such a situation, academic institutions have embraced online teaching. Access to classes have been provided to learners and their teachers through available gadgets. Now virtually a part of academic life, it looks as if this system of teaching will now blend with the traditional classroom mode. Online teaching was the immediate solution to academic disconnectivity when the Covid-19 virus struck. It might, however, not be accepted as the complete replacement for classroom teaching, especially for professional and practical courses and other subjects requiring hands on skill development and training.Education is not about memorising facts and spewing everything out during examinations. It is aimed at overall development of students, which can only be attained in an organised academic setup. Undoubtedly, the crossover to online teaching caused by the tectonic shift of the pandemic will be long lasting and/or permanent. Thus, technological interventions would be best put to use after academic activities resume in physical classrooms, with routine didactic learning approach. In the post Covid situation, blended learning model (BLM) with face-to-face education augmented by online teaching is likely to be the new normal. Technology enabled learning deliverables through gadgets supplemented with frontal instruction method will offer a futuristic model of education, taking in its ambit the best of both methods. In BLM, the role of educators will also be transformed. They will act as facilitators, guiding learners in practical application of knowledge, monitoring their performance and providing a blend of assorted content formats, making learning dynamic and vibrant entity. Topics that are difficult to grasp will be covered in class and other content made available online for students to cover at home. This will also help teachers provide personalised attention to the students. In BLM technology enabled monitoring of students’ presence and performance through Learning Management System will help teachers get customisable learning modules based on the competency and learning behaviour of students in a student centric teaching and learning environment. Use of educational technologies encompassing augmented reality and virtual reality will make practical learning more immersive and realistic and will cover up for loss of practical training in exigencies. BLM will also give learners the flexibility to grasp things at their own pace as they will be free to access the same content multiple times, to chisel their practical skills. This will also allow them to remain connected to their institutions and teachers when they study from home. The benefits? Students will become proficient in self learning as they can, guided by the teacher, prepare at home for next day’s interactive discussion in class. This will teach youngsters soft skills such as t time management, accessing the right information and independent decision-making and will also develop critical analytical thinking, confidence, as well as team work.

The patch on this 1.5 km road was unfinished due to the land dispute.The officials of Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) claimed that the work would be completed in a month.This pending portion of the 1.5km road had been causing congestion on the Patripool bridge as the commuters taking the parallel road had to take another narrow lane to reach the bridge.Executive engineer Jagdish Kore said, “The work on the remaining stretch of the road has already started. It will be taken up with topmost priority as it connects the Patripool bridge and once the bridge is ready, this road should also be open for the vehicles.”The Patripool ROB was dismantled in November 2018 and is presently under construction by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). The bridge is expected to be ready by January 2021.“This portion of the road was pending due to a land dispute that has been resolved by the civic commissioner,” added Kore. The land belonged to a private party and there was a dispute between the party and the civic body over compensation.This particular road helps connect Kalyan-Thakurli-Dombivli cities. Presently, those going towards Thakurli take the parallel road through a narrow lane that passes by the Kachoregaon.“The Thakurli parallel road, which was built for easy connectivity between Kalyan and Dombivli, did not serve the purpose due to the pending portion. Vehicles taking the parallel road used to flow freely on the road and later get stuck at the Kachoregaon road as the entry of the road that connects the bridge was not ready,” said Umesh Pawar, 30, who takes the parallel road to connect Dombivli for work.The Thakurli parallel road had been built with the purpose of giving road connectivity when the railway service is disrupted.The KDMC had passed the project to concretise the road in March 2013. However, the work for the parallel road began a year later as it faced land acquisition hurdles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pending-work-on-thakurli-parallel-road-gets-kalyan-dombivli-civic-body-nod/story-qKaZiFRi6o4xwTCmSAF3ZJ.html
28-11-2020||Noida||Two Delhi Police constables among nine held for fraud in competitive examinations||Two Delhi Police constables were among the nine people held by the Noida police on Saturday for allegedly operating a gang, which provided scribes for writing competitive examinations in place of real candidates.According to police officials, a call was received on the police helpline number at 8.15am from an examination centre in Sector 62, complaining that the invigilator had caught three people for impersonating candidates for a Delhi police entrance examination. “A team from Sector 58 police station rushed to the examination site, and the three candidates were taken into custody. Upon questioning, they revealed details of a racket in which several other people were involved,” said Luv Kumar, joint commissioner of police, law and order. The mastermind of the racket was identified as one Ravi Kumar, who was posted as an inspector with the income tax department. His nephew, Dinesh Jogi, who was also a part of the gang, was nabbed on Saturday. “Jogi claims to be an ASO (assistant section officer) for the ministry of defence, who is waiting for his joining letter after taking his examination in 2017 through the same fraudulent method. He runs the gang on the behalf of his uncle’s. His accomplice, Arvind, is also an ASO for the home ministry and worked for the gang. He would bring in both candidates, looking for someone to take examinations on their behalf, and scribes looking to earn quick money,” said assistant commissioner of police, Zone 1, Rajneesh Verma. The fake scribes were identified as constables Manjeet Singh (batch of 2018, currently suspended) and Ravindra Kumar (2008 batch). Police officials said that they took help from their relatives to act as solvers on behalf of candidates and would keep aside their uniforms to avoid suspicion. “The suspects used a mobile application that would produce a photograph similar to the candidates. Using this they would develop a fake identity card which would then be used for online competitive exams,” said Kumar. A candidate was also among the nine people held by police on Saturday. Police officials said that the gang has already impersonated at least 100 candidates over the past three years for different exams. “Their fees also varied from one examination to another but on average they charged ₹10 lakh per candidate which they distributed among themselves,” said Kumar. Noida Police has also recovered incriminating chats between the suspects along with voice recordings in their phones discussing plans for the operation. “There are several other people involved in the scam. We are working on tracing them. We will also identify the examinees who have used their services,” said Verma. The suspects were booked for fraud and forgery along with relevant sections of the UP Public Examinations Act. Several sets of fake documents, mobile phones and ₹2.1 lakh were recovered from their possession. Police officials said the suspects will be taken into custody for further investigation.Despite repeated attempts, a spokesperson from Delhi Police could not be reached for comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/two-delhi-police-constables-among-nine-held-for-fraud-in-competitive-examinations/story-yYRgPacgj78TaGgSevMSsN.html
28-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Plantation drive held in Sector 77||Noida: The Noida authority on Saturday carried out a plantation drive in Sector 77, following the demand from residents. The drive was held along the newly paved footpath on a busy road in Sector 77, in which nearly 100 saplings were planted. The area of Sector 77 with several high-rises has a large green belt proposed. Authority officials said that the green belt will be worked upon in coming months and over a thousand saplings are to be planted. “The residents had raised demands that the road in Sector 77 now has pavements, it must also get trees. So, we provided the saplings and the tree guards. The plantation drive was held with around 100 saplings and the local residents also participated,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty, Noida authority. The saplings of Jamun, Peepal, Neem and Pilkhan were planted, the officials said. Singh said that soon the work will start on the vacant green belts of Sector 77 and some neighbouring sectors. “The concept of green belt is to save the high-rises from the dust, while also maintaining the green cover. There is a large patch of proposed green belt within Sector 77 that has several high-rises. We have done the tender process of building the boundary wall, and then the plantation will begin,” said Singh. The residents stated that while the road in Sector 77 where plantation was carried out is a preferred spot for a number of joggers and walkers, and there was not a single tree except for two Neem trees at a corner. “The plantation drive was long pending and much needed. We expect that the fresh plantation, though it will take some years for them to grow, will help combating pollution which is one of the major issues in the city,” said Amit Gupta, a resident of Sector 77 and member of Progressive Community Foundation (PCF), a citizens’ group. Swaranjeet Singh, a resident of Sctor 79, said, “The entire stretch of road looked barren without trees. The entire region, especially this stretch, was in desperate need of a proper tree cover.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-plantation-drive-held-in-sector-77/story-GwcYYHWRJSsxroYB374MCK.html
28-11-2020||Noida||Soon, Covid-19 static testing booths can be located through app in UP||Ghaziabad: The state government has sought location details of the static booths from the districts where Covid-19 testing is taking place. Officials of the Ghaziabad health department said that the information is sought for the purpose of development of a mobile application through which anyone can get location of the nearest Covid-19 testing centre. The Ghaziabad district at present has 30 locations where Covid-19 testing is conducted by the government. Of the 30 centres, 13 of them are static booths where residents can walk-in and get themselves tested free of cost. However, locating a static booth for testing is a major issue in the district, the officials said. “For the purpose, we have been asked to send details of all the 13 static Covid-19 testing centres, along with coordinates. This is being done as there is a proposal for development of an app through which anyone can locate the nearest testing booth and walk-in for testing,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. Presently, the 13 static testing booths are located at Indirapuram, Vaishali, MMG Hospital, Women Hospital, ESIC Hospital at Sahibabad, Kamla Nehru Nagar, Vijay Nagar, four community health centres and a primary health centre at Bhojpur, among others. “Locating a testing centre is an issue, and the app will be helpful for residents to locate the nearest centre. It is proposed that all the testing centres across the state will be available with location on the app. There have also been directions that the static centres will be operational from 10am to 4pm each day,” Gupta added. The state government has already focussed on carrying out increased testing across the state and has directed that the proportion of the RT-PCR and rapid antigen kits should be in proportion of 40% and 60%, respectively, as against one-third and two-third previously. In the latest directions issued by UP chief secretary RK Tiwari, there is a focus on containment exercise in which the areas having positive cases has been defined for strict perimeter control. The direction states that in case of a single positive case, radius of 50 metres will be subjected to perimeter control while the area will be 100 metre radius in case of cluster where more than one cases surface. The officials have already been directed to map areas based on last 10 days where cases of infection have increased and have been asked to take up focussed surveillance in order to isolate the positive cases. The directions with regard to surveillance said that if, within 24 hours, three houses within a radius of 50 metres of each other have a positive case, then the entire area that falls under the radius will be identified as a cluster and a minimum of 100 houses in each such cluster will be subjected to focussed surveillance. “To enhance the surveillance activities, there were earlier 861 teams. Now, 140 more teams have been formed. The teams are tasked to carry out door-to-door surveys and identify suspected patients who will be tested. Further, the contact tracing of positive patients has also been increased as there are directions to increase it to about 25 per positive patient,” Gupta said. According to official records, the district had 22,570 positive cases till November 25, and 352,275 contacts have been traced for 22,386 positive cases with a rate of 15.73 contacts traced per positive case. However, during the period November 12 to 25, the health department is tracing an average of 24.6 contacts per positive case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/soon-covid-19-static-testing-booths-can-be-located-through-app-in-up/story-L8AW4Ov8WVZ03vsBP2TREI.html

In a letter issued by UP chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari, it has been stated that after analysis of the Covid-19 figures of different districts, it was found that the cases are on the rising trend in several districts that include the NCR districts of the state.“As even common people can have respiratory problems during the winter, it may serve a rider for increasing the Covid-19 complications. Therefore, maximum precautions must be taken in the coming two months,” stated the letter issued on Friday. The government has also asked the district magistrates and divisional commissioners to make all the L-2 and L-3 Covid-19 facilities well-equipped with adequate ICU and high dependency unit (HDU) beds. “All these beds must have uninterrupted oxygen facilities. The capacity of beds must be increased at all the L-1 facilities, so that they could be used at the time of any emergency,” the letter said. The district officials have also been asked to ramp up effective and qualitative contact tracing. “The administration must ensure effective mapping of those areas, from where more cases are being detected. Based on this mapping, focussed surveillance in those areas must be ramped up and it has to be ensured that maximum number of RT-PCR tests must be done in those high-risk areas,” the letter said. Mentioning that digital mapping is being successfully done in Gautam Budh Nagar district with the help of ‘Google Earth Pro’ application, the letter has asked other districts to follow this methodology. “The ratio of RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests must be maintained to 40:60. The Covid-19 testing facilities must be increased in all the districts,” the letter stated. When contacted, GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that there is no dearth of beds in the district, even in the L-2 and L-3 facilities. “Apart from increasing the testing, stress is being laid on proper contact tracing. In the present situation, early and timely tracking and providing adequate treatment are the main goals before the administration. Despite having adequate beds for Covid-19 patients, all private and government hospitals have been asked to increase the number of ICU and HDU beds,” he said.In GB Nagar, there are a total of 2,411 Covid-19 beds in various hospitals. Of these beds, 1,212 were occupied till Friday. Suhas also said that the administration’s main focus is on reducing the number of deaths and curing the maximum possible number of infected patients on time. “For that, we have adapted the ‘tracking, testing and treating’ method. The health workers have been told to find out 25 contacts of one infected patient. We are testing nearly 5,000 people every day. While recovery rate in GB Nagar is still over 90%, the current case fatality rate (CFR) is around 0.36%, which is much better than the state’s overall CFR of 1.42%,” the DM said. District chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri said that the health workers have been asked to increase the daily testing to over 7,000. “To check the rise in new positive cases in the district, the health officials and workers have been categorically asked to keep strict surveillance in the crowded areas,” Ohri said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/anticipating-surge-in-covid-19-cases-state-govt-asks-districts-to-ensure-availability-of-different-kinds-of-beds/story-gNm5YnLt4nY5VbrNgp0iIL.html
28-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad witnesses marginal increase in test positivity rate post-Diwali||Unlike the national Capital which recently saw a spike in Covid-19 cases during and following the festive season, Ghaziabad’s increase in positivity is relatively marginal.Positivity, or test positivity rate (TPR), is the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases per 100 tests and is a crucial metric that denotes the prevalence of the virus. According to recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control there.In the case of the Capital, which had never reached this threshold and the lowest it had ever been was 5.34%, the rise was documented from the last two weeks of October and touched a high of 15.3% on November 15. It has since been decreasing and reached 9.13% on Thursday.Against this, Ghaziabad, from November 5 to November 14 (the 10 days to Diwali), conducted 37,365 tests and returned a TPR of 3.47%. In the next 10 days, they had tested 44,971 samples and returned a TPR of 3.69%. The total TPR till November 24 (till data available) was 4.21%, a slight decrease from the 4.3% on October 31.“We can say that there is not much variation (in TPR), but the trend is on the rise. The Chhatt festival ended recently (November 21), and we have deployed teams to test residents who stepped out. More cases may arise then. The wedding season too is on in full swing and will continue till next month,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, Ghaziabad. “We have also increased testing in sensitive areas and also focussing on enforcement with the help of drones (as per a high court ruling on crowded areas). So, our focus will be to watch the trend of cases till mid of December. In city areas I have directed to deploy 10 drones to keep an eye on people in markets while other local bodies have also been asked to deploy at least one drone for surveillance on people coming out without masks and not maintaining social distancing.” As part of their ‘post-festival strategy’ Ghaziabad aims to increase testing from 4,000 tests per day to at least 6000. “Ideally, the testing should be about 8,000-10,000 tests per day. Since it is winter and pollution is also high, we have more Covid patients coming in and most require L-3 (tertiary care for severe cases) treatment,” said Dr Ashish Agrawal, president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. Recently, a new 100-bedded paid Covid-19 private hospital was inaugurated at Lohiya Nagar which also has 30 ICU beds and is the fourteenth private hospital in the district to provide dedicated treatment. “With the new hospital in place, the number of beds has gone up to 1109 in private hospitals. Overall, we have 240 ICU beds which also include 34 ICU beds in government hospitals,” said an officer from the district health department who wished not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-witnesses-marginal-increase-in-test-positivity-rate-post-diwali/story-jxS4KzG21jEgcmkSD3S6WK.html
28-11-2020||City||Son, his friend held for Yamunanagar mason’s murder||Almost a week after a 50-year-old mason was found dead on a road in Yamunanagar, police on Saturday arrested his son and his friend for the crime. The accused were identified as Shantti of Kansali village and Ravi Kumar alias Sonu of Sasoli Majra village. The body of the mason, Arjun of kansali village, was found with his throat slit on an under-construction satoli road near sector 18 on November 20. Police spokesman Chamkaur Singh said Shantti had told police that his father used to frequently fight with his mother and sisters. “My father had an extramarital affair with a woman and sometimes he didn’t come home at night. Due to this, there was a lot of trouble at home and my family was very upset. Once he had kicked me out of the house. Ravi got me a room on rent in his village and I was staying there. I had told Ravi about my father’s actions,” Shantti had told the police. “I had stolen a bike from Pansari Bazar and wanted to chase my father to kill him. Later, on November 19, Ravi helped me and in the evening we chased my father, caught him and I stabbed him with a knife near his neck. I also slit his throat and fled,” Chamkaur said quoting Shantti.CIA-2 incharge Mahruf Ali said the weapons used in the incident are yet to be recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/son-his-friend-held-for-yamunanagar-mason-s-murder/story-xRThjhrykuA48Fl220pHLI.html
28-11-2020||Noida||Uganda invites investment from Noida entrepreneurs||Kezalla Mohammed Baswali, the deputy high commissioner of Uganda to India, said on Saturday that the country has created immense investment opportunities for Indian entrepreneurs. Addressing the India-Uganda SME trade connect, organised under the aegis of the Noida Chapter of Indian Industries Association (IIA), Baswali said that with its consistently improving infrastructure and welcoming population, Uganda can be explored as one of the best places for investment. “Uganda’s investment climate continues to present important opportunities for Indian investors. With an open market economy, ideal climate, ample arable land, young and largely English-speaking population, and at least 1.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil, Uganda has immense scope for the Indian entrepreneurs, especially those from the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector,” he said. Talking about the textile and apparel industries in Noida, he said that since Uganda produces one of the best grades of cotton, investment in the textile sector can be particularly attractive for Indian investors. “The Indian entrepreneurs can also invest in manufacturing, tourism, electronics, infrastructure and education sectors. Since the geographical location of Uganda provides a strategic commanding base to trade and investment and 75% of its population is under 30 years, it provides an educated and skilled labour force for the investors,” he said. Echoing similar views, Birungi Sophie, the first secretary of the High Commission, said that the liberalised economy and 100% foreign investment permitted in Uganda, ensures free inflow and outflow of capital to the investors. “Uganda’s conducive investment environment guarantees duty and quota-free access into the US, under the AGOA Act. Foreign investors can avail two incentives here – general and sector-specific. While the first one is based on import and export, the sector-specific incentives are given to investment projects in priority sectors, such as agro-processing, horticulture, food processing, textiles and garments,” she said. She further said that a 10-year-long income tax exemption is given to the free zone developers and operators, having an investment capital up to 50 million USD. Among others, who addressed this meet, were IIA (Noida) chairman Kulmani Gupta, his deputy Umesh Batra and Rekha Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/uganda-invites-investment-from-noida-entrepreneurs/story-sTSny4ccsDlL4uz7zqaP4M.html

More than two lakh farmers reached Delhi through Haryana and the state government can register FIR against us at various police stations. We are not afraid of cases, we will continue our battle till the Union government takes back its laws. If the government can’t take back these laws, then they should kill us with bullets,” he added.200 farmers booked at Kaithal As many as 200 farmers from Punjab have been booked by the Kaithal police under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly violating the prohibitory orders and damaging public property by forcing their way through Haryana-Punjab border during their march towards Delhi.

28-11-2020||City||Women march at par in farmers protest||A large number of women from Punjab have been marching along with farmers towards Delhi to protest against the Centre’s three agriculture laws.The farmers are staying put at the Tikri (Bahadurgarh) and Singhu (Sonepat) borders between Haryana and Delhi with thousands more set to join them and their leaders yet to take a call on shifting to the Burari ground, a place earmarked for their agitation by police. Most women activists affiliated with the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) are moving in tractor-trolleys driven by young farmers. The trolleys have mobile charging facilities, blankets, warm clothes and carpets. The women, most aged 40 or above, are in separate tractor-trolleys.HT travelled with a group of these women activists from the outskirts of Rohtak to Sampla. The women farmers get up early in the morning by 5:30am and prepare tea for protesters before starting their journey towards Delhi. At around 1:00pm, they prepare lunch and the dinner is provided by Haryana farmers mostly since last two days.Joginder, BKU (Ughran) Mansa chief, said over 40,000 women activists have joined their protest against the Centre’s three farm laws. “The women farmers will hold demonstrations with us till the government takes back these laws. We are moving towards Delhi with arrangements of essential commodities,” he added.Gurjeet Kaur, a woman farmer from Mansa district, said she along with other women has been a part of the agitation for the last two months. “We had started our journey on Thursday. These farm laws will affect us deeply. I, along with my grandson, are participating in this agitation. We will hold demonstrations until the government takes back these laws,” she said.Another woman farmer, Satpal Kaur, said her family cultivates crop on three acres of land. “This fight is for the entire farming community. Whenever we need money to pay the school fee of children or if someone falls ill, we used to take the help of arhitiya (commission agent). However, after the implementation of these laws, private players will come into play. Our permanent ATM (referring to Arhitiya) will be ended and we would have no source of money in a serious situation,” she added.Another woman Palo Kaur said,“It is better to die due to Covid-19 rather than poverty. We will observe a dharna at the Tikri border till our demands are met. We want to make it clear that no one can end the MSP and mandi system in Punjab. I have joined the protest with my son ,who is pursuing MPhil. Instead of creating jobs for our children, the government has brought these laws to snatch our lands. The government has no plan to tackle stubble burning, drug abuse and unemployment but they come up with these laws to drive the rural economy into distress.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/women-march-at-par-in-farmers-protest/story-r2X1xPLFQhYCAIo076eDiJ.html
28-11-2020||Noida||A day after breathing easy, air quality in Noida drops sharply||After a day of experiencing “moderate” air, the city’s air quality started deteriorating once again on Saturday as the incidence of farm fires increased. The pollution level in the city surged despite the presence of strong winds, mostly due to the rise in the number of farm fires and the winds carrying them.According to pollution monitoring agencies, the city’s air quality may fall further as the wind speeds drop in the coming days. On Friday, the city had experienced its cleanest air in the past two months, with the air quality in the “moderate” category. According to the weather analysts, the northwesterly winds, which flow from Punjab and Haryana bringing in pollutants due to stubble burning, will continue over the next couple of days. This will also lead to a slight drop in the mercury. “The wind speed was good on Saturday and the region saw northwesterly winds at speed of 20 kmph. Since the winds are cold and will continue for the next two days, the mercury is likely to fall by two degrees,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) reading of the city was 223 as against 125 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 226 as against 129 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 240 as against 166 a day earlier. Meanwhile the fine particles or pollutants also recorded a rise in their overall volume over the past 24 hours. Particulate matter (PM) 2.5 for the past 24 hours in Noida was recorded at 104.70 micrograms per cubic metre against 64.98 units a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 101.23 units against 63.87 units a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Ghaziabad was 112.24 units as against 78.49 units a day earlier. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 units. According to the system of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is likely to deteriorate further due to rise in the number of forest fire – from around 50 on Thursday to over 400 on Friday. “The boundary layer transport-level winds are northwesterly and effective stubble fire counts with sufficient potential as estimated from SAFAR-multi-satellite products are marginally increased (around 499). The AQI is forecasted to marginally deteriorate and will be in the poor to very poor category for the next two days. It is likely to further deteriorate and very poor category is forecasted for 1st December(sic),” read the SAFAR statement on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/a-day-after-breathing-easy-air-quality-in-noida-drops-sharply/story-QvvbcPlDLj4xuVmxcySQYO.html
28-11-2020||Chandigarh||Guest Column: India’s Beth Harmon would need to be a brave one||As the world remains glued to the surprise Netflix hit of 2020, The Queen’s Gambit , the long drawn question of why female players perform worse than their male counterparts has resurfaced with greater vigour. While researchers including psychologists and mathematicians have not been able to establish a definite correlation, both male and female players themselves have had useful (or maybe not!) insights to contribute to the matter.According to the universal FIDE (World Chess Federation) Ratings, there is a stark gap between men and women in the rankings with only one female player in the world’s top 100 players. Closer home, India has only two females out of 66 Grandmasters.Here, the multiple struggles girls face in the chess world make the likelihood of their breaking the glass ceiling tougher.Commonly ascribed causal factors hindering favourable outcomes for female players include externalities such as societal pressure, travel issues including safety and often extra costs of being accompanied by a guardian, and instances of discrimination or harassment.Lower participation rates are one of the many reasons that women don’t make it to the top. Simply put, if a classroom only has 10 girls out of 50 children, then the probability of a girl finishing first is just 20% and that of a boy doing the same is 80%. But by this logic, we would definitely expect at least one girl to make it to the top five, which is not always the case in chess.Strength does not mean having an athletic builtOn the personal front, apparently girls have lesser physical strength to maintain the stamina and accuracy for four to six-hour matches and gruelling 10-hour training days. Although maintaining fitness is extremely important in chess, not having an athletic built does not act as a deterrent in one’s performance up until a very advanced level.Many also argue that girls are more caring and lack the fighting spirit. A majority of chess players regard this as an ‘innate’ feature of female players. However, it has more to do with the way girls are conditioned from the time they are toddlers. Our expectations from girls are sky high in terms of behavioural and emotional conduct while boys are allowed mischief even when they could be doing something potentially wrong. Girls are shunned for getting themselves in a risky spot while boys are applauded for the same.“We’re raising our girls to be perfect and we’re raising our boys to be brave” was mentioned by Reshma Saujani, an American lawyer and politician, and founder of the tech organisation, Girls who Code.Shedding light from a different perspective, Beth Harmon in The Queens’s Gambit actually benefited from staying away from ‘normal’ life and aloof from the generic code of conduct as she did not have to live up to society’s norms of being ‘perfect’. She did not shy away from claiming that she was the best candidate to win even before the tournaments began.The story is different for girls in the real world. While competing in the U-16 Open (boys) Category in the Commonwealth Championships a few years back, I found it hard to imagine that I could actually win the gold even after I had defeated the top seed and was leading the pack. The gender conditioning of fear and self-doubt always lurks subconsciously. And so it happened, low confidence while playing in the boys’ section did not help me win the medal in the tournament. Later that year, while competing in the World Under-20 Open (boys) Championship, a European player casually mentioned during post-game analysis, “You are not like most other girls”. I would rather say, most girls are made risk-averse even before they find what lies on the other side of the spectrum.No treading on the path less travelledThis is another reason why girls drop out early on from the sport. Those who are already good at mathematics and science prefer to pursue a safer field than chess as it requires one to tread on the path less travelled and have a higher risk appetite. Even if the monetary aspect is taken care of, they would still prefer academics as there are lower stakes and they would not have to think about the consequences of failing miserably. Essentially, we are wired to take the risk averse stance on and off the board even if it’s something we do not really want.Nevertheless, there have been a few cases when young girls in our country have managed to prevail over innumerable hindrances, thereby becoming a source of inspiration for others. Vaishali R, 19, has managed to win medals in the Open section in many category tournaments. Divya Deshmukh, a rising star whom I worked with during the Indian junior camps, used to crack positions even faster than the boys who were technically supposed to be better than her.The wrangle here is not whether girls have the ability to ever match up to boys or not, it is whether we are willing to foster and train them to do so. A sport that has been male-dominated for the past 100 years can definitely turn into an equal opportunity one in the next 10 years if there is enough stimulus for girls to falter and strike again, and to do so over and over again for as long as it takes.India is woefully placed at 122 out of 162 countries in the Gender Inequality Index (GII) released by the United Nations Development Programme. The report forecasts that it may take 202 years to close the gender gap in economic opportunity.Establishing more female achievers in any sport would go a long way in improving the overall status of women and further creating a positive outlook for the country.India’s Beth Harmon would have to shed the timidity and be a valiant fighter on the battlefield, breaking all the shackles that she has grown up with.The author is an international chess player, Woman FIDE Master and FIDE Instructor, who is studying BA (Hons) economics at the Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi University.

28-11-2020||Noida||31-year-old man dies after being hit by speeding truck in Indirapuram||A 31-year-old man was killed and his car caught fire after being hit by a speeding truck driving on the wrong side of the road near the Shipra underpass in Indirapuram during the wee hours on Saturday. The cops said that the injured man was rushed to the hospital before the car got charred in fire. The front portion of the truck also suffered major damage due to fire. The cops identified the deceased as one Punit Agarwal, a native of Lucknow, who was a resident of Sector 74 in Noida and working as a manager with a private company in the city. The police said that he was returning to Noida at around 2.45am and was about to take turn at the underpass when his car was hit by the truck. “The truck was driving on the wrong side and there was a massive head-on collision between the two vehicles. The driver in the car sustained severe injuries and he was rushed to a hospital where he succumbed to his injuries later. The fire soon engulfed the entire vehicle. The front portion of the truck was also damaged,” said Anshu Jain, circle officer (Indirapuram). The cops said that the truck driver fled the spot after the incident. The truck had a registration number of Moradabad. “We have received a complaint from the family and will soon register an FIR. The truck driver will also be nabbed soon. The man died of injuries but not of burns. He was pulled out before the car was engulfed in flames,” she added. There were certain social media posts that stated that the man was burnt in the accident. The police, however, denied these claims. The fire department officials said that they had to rush three fire tenders to the spot at around 3am to douse fire. “The cops from a PCR van pulled the injured man out and rushed him to a hospital for treatment, where he succumbed to his injuries at about 4.25am. We have the medical report, which states that he did not suffer any burn injuries. Soon after the incident, the car caught fire. However, the injured man was pulled out in time,” said Sunil Kumar Singh, chief fire officer. “After the fire assumed major proportions, it completely gutted the car, while the front portion of the truck was also burnt down. Our fire tenders were able to douse the fire,” he added. The officials said that the deceased was staying in Noida, with his wife, mother and a two-year-old child.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/31-year-old-man-dies-after-being-hit-by-speeding-truck-in-indirapuram/story-joMSzz6NlIGYUvoPm0pfkN.html
28-11-2020||Noida||Six killed in two road accidents on Yamuna Expressway||Six people were killed in two separate road accidents on the Yamuna Expressway on Saturday morning in areas under Beta 2 and Jewar police jurisdictions. In the first incident, four men travelling from Agra were killed, while a fifth person was severely injured when the SUV they were travelling in rammed a roadways bus at 6.45am on the Yamuna Expressway.“We were travelling from Azamgarh to Delhi. Nearly 2 kilometre from the zero point on the expressway, an Innova car rammed into our bus from behind. Luckily none of the 40 passengers on board were injured. Those in the car were in a very poor state,” said Vijay Bahadur Singh, the bus driver. The passengers then called the police helpline (112), after which a team rushed to the spot. Police officials said that the car was so badly mangled that it took them a long time to rescue the passengers. By the time they were pulled out, four men had already succumbed to their injuries, while the fifth person was rushed to Kailash hospital where he continues to remain critical. The deceased were identified as Ashish Chauhan (Ghaziabad native), Alok Kumar (Faridabad native), Manigandan Maikan (Maharashtra native) and Firoz (Agra native), while the injured man was identified as Prince Pal, 22, a native of Faridabad. Police officials suspect that the Innova was travelling at a very high speed and the driver may have dozed off behind the wheel leading to the crash. “The car was in a very bad state. We have informed the families of the victims and the bodies have been sent for autopsy. Prince is still very critical,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, Vishal Pandey. Police officials said that the men worked for an event organizing company and were returning to the city after an event in Agra when the accident took place. The second incident took place around 3.15am when an SUV coming from Bihar was hit by a private double decker bus that was coming from the wrong side. The incident took place 32.7 kilometre from the zero point. “There were two men in the SUV who died on the spot. One of our patrolling vehicles saw the crash and raised the alarm.

28-11-2020||Noida||BKU supporters to camp at UP Gate to decide on next course of action||Members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), led by their leader Rakesh Tikait, broke police barricades at the UP Gate border with East Delhi on Saturday afternoon and later decided to make a night stay below the UP Gate flyover in Ghaziabad. However, the gathering of farmers on Saturday was estimated at about 500 as against the mammoth gathering, observed in October 2018, during the Kisan Kranti Yatra at the same venue. The BKU members said that on Saturday, they broke the barricades put up at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border at the UP Gate in order to enter Delhi. There was hardly any resistance put up by the Ghaziabad Police. Later, BKU members decided to return to UP Gate flyover area in Ghaziabad to stay for the night. “After breaking the barriers, we took our vehicles up to the Ghazipur area where the Delhi Police had deployed dumpers. So, we returned back to the UP Gate. We have decided that we will make a night stay below the UP Gate flyover as we decide on the strategy to enter the national Capital,” said Rajvir Singh, state vice-president, BKU. The area below the UP Gate flyover is the same site where the BKU members and farmers on October 2, 2018, had clashed with the Delhi Police while trying to enter Delhi over their 15-point agenda, including a demand of a blanket loan waiver, revoking NGT’s ban on 10-year-old diesel run tractors in NCR, reduction in electricity tariff, implementation of MS Swaminathan Commission recommendation on remunerative prices and payment of sugarcane arrears, among othersOn Saturday morning, the Ghaziabad Police had made arrangement for a large-scale deployment of police personnel at the UP Gate and also at Delhi-Meerut Road, from where the BKU groups entered Ghaziabad district from Meerut in a bid to reach Delhi as part of ‘Dilli Chalo’ protest. “There was no untoward incident at the UP Gate and the farmers have opted for a sit-in below the UP Gate flyover. They have planned to stay for the night. In view of this, we have decided to divert traffic. Commuters coming from Mohan Nagar will not be allowed to take a left turn towards UP Gate. Instead, they will have to go to Kaushambi from where they can enter Delhi,” said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police, City 2. . “The commuters travelling on NH-9 will also not be allowed to come down to the UP Gate flyover. Instead, all vehicles will be diverted over the flyover. This arrangement will be in place till farmers continue their protest at UP Gate,” he added. Traffic congestion on Delhi-Meerut RoadDelhi-Meerut Road witnessed congestion on Saturday afternoon as traffic from Ghaziabad moving towards Meerut was diverted to the Upper Ganga Canal (UGC) Road, instead of being allowed to go straight to Modinagar and Meerut as a precautionary measure. “We were stranded for over an hour at Muradnagar as traffic was moving at slow pace. The other side of the Delhi-Meerut Road was without any traffic and cops were using it for letting the farmers move towards the UP Gate,” said Arun Tyagi, a commuter from Modinagar. The cops said that the traffic was diverted to the UGC Road in wake of procession of the farmers coming in from Meerut. “The BKU members and their supporters were diverted towards the UP Gate.Traffic on the other side was also diverted towards the UGC Road. The diversion only lasted for about two hours after which traffic normalised. The farmers had an estimated strength of about 400 to 500 and were moving in 40 to 50 vehicles,” said Neeraj Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). The farmers reached the UP Gate by about 3.30pm, where they decided to camp for the night. “We will sit here and decide on our next course of action.The barrier will now be removed and people will be able to go smoothly to Delhi. There were no discussions with farmers over the issue of minimum support price. If need be, we will go to Delhi and witness the Republic Day on January 26,” Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of BKU, told reporters at UP Gate. Meanwhile in Gautam Budh Nagar, another group of farmers trying to go to Delhi was intercepted at the Yamuna Expressway on Saturday afternoon.“They were stopped near Jewar, after which they camped at the side of the Expressway. There wasn’t any traffic disruption and it was a peaceful gathering. No police action was needed,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 3, Vishal Pandey.The farmers dispersed after handing over their memorandum to the police and administration officials. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and parts of western UP have been trying to enter Delhi in a bid to raise voice against the farmer’s bill and the minimum support price system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bku-supporters-to-camp-at-up-gate-to-decide-on-next-course-of-action/story-1XdPumuaXzbIU94oSDkqAI.html
28-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram collects record 25,000 samples in a day for Covid-19 tests||Long queues of people were witnessed outside several testing centres and camps on Saturday, as the Gurugram district administered a record number of 25,000 Covid-19 tests – the highest ever in a single day. The voluminous sampling size contributed 25 percent to the overall tests (more than one lakh) conducted in Haryana in 24 hours. It exceeded the target of more than 10,000 samples set by the district health department in observance of the sampling day. In Gurugram, at least 25,101 samples were collected on Saturday, more than double the previous highest number of tests (10,200) administered on November 21. Of these, 20,112 were through gold front-line Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method and only 4,989 were rapid antigen — 19.8 percent of total tests. Both the test numbers were highest so far. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Gurugram health department has conducted a total of 505,314 tests so far. On Saturday,the sample collection started from six in the morning at wholesale food grain and vegetable market in Khandsa. At Sadar Bazar, sample collection started around 10am, when locals from nearby areas, shopkeepers and customers started pouring in to get themselves tested. Teams from NGOs were deployed to manage the crowd who queued up for testing. Testing announcements were being made at timely intervals. Likewise, at a testing centre near sector 15, long queue was seen on the road. As many as 50 testing camps were held on Saturday.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Nobody was forced to get tested. People are now aware of the disease and are voluntarily choosing to get tested without inhibitions.” The total count of Covid-19 infections in Gurugram reached 48,619 on Saturday, with 668 new cases being reported. The test results of 15,287 samples are awaited. Record testing at state levelEven at the state level, Haryana’s 22 districts together collected a record number of 12,1227 samples, much higher than the set target of more than 50,000 in a day. It included highest sample collection in Gurugram, followed by Faridabad (10,459), Rohtak (10,311) and Rewari (9000). On an average 30,000 tests were being conducted across the state daily.On November 25, the state health department had set a target to administer over 80 percent RT-PCR tests to detect new cases and their timely isolation. This, officials believed, will help in lowering the positivity rate as Haryana is consistently among the ten worst-affected Covid-19 states in the country. Five districts – Gurugram, Rewari, Faridabad, Rohtak, Sonepat — are reporting maximum cases every day. Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department complimented the districts for the record testing through a tweet. The state chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who was also in Gurugram on Saturday, also emphasized on respiratory hygiene and mask discipline to be followed by people to help check the spread of the viral infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-collects-record-25-000-samples-in-a-day-for-covid-19-tests/story-5pTS8qeVph8SrON1lEyvZL.html
28-11-2020||Gurugram||Air quality slips back into ‘poor’ category due to slow winds, falling temperature||The city’s air quality slipped back into the “poor” category on Saturday, recording a reading of 204 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s(CPCB) daily air quality index (AQI) bulletin — a significant deterioration from Friday’s AQI reading of 107, which was in the “moderate” category. Experts attributed the deterioration to slow wind speeds and the falling temperature.The level of ultrafine particulate matter having a diameter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5) — the city’s primary pollutant — was recorded at 109 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) on Saturday, as per the data by CPCB’s air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan in Sector 11. The concentration of PM2.5 pollutants on the previous day stood at 167ug/m3. According to the early air quality warning system for the National Capital Region (NCR), the air quality is likely to remain in the “poor” to the lower end of “very poor” category on Sunday. Air quality is expected to remain in the “very poor” category on Monday. Sachin Panwar, a city-based independent air quality scientist, said that the AQI is expected to deteriorate further as the temperature falls gradually. “The winds were not strong enough to disperse the pollutants. At the same time, the morning temperature is decreasing day by day. Once fog starts persisting in the morning hours, accumulation will increase and air quality will become bad,” said Panwar. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the air quality would deteriorate in the coming days due to slow wind speed. “From November 30, the wind speed is likely to slow down. Now, because a western disturbance is passing, the winds have picked up speed, but it will slow down again. The temperature will also go down once the western disturbance passes,” he said. The minimum temperature of Gurugram settled at 10.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday, same as the previous day. The city recorded a maximum temperature of 24.6 degrees Celsius on Thursday, marginally less than 25.1 degrees Celsius the day prior. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, the maximum temperature will hover around 26 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature is expected to stay at 10 degrees. As per the weekly forecast, clear skies will prevail on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-slips-back-into-poor-category-due-to-slow-winds-falling-temperature/story-RZ5IQbECQYe6jVsHZj5QxM.html
28-11-2020||Gurugram||DTCP directed to install fire system, power connection at housing project in Sector 92||Chief minister(CM) Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday directed the department of town and country planning (DTCP) to work with fire department to ensure that fire fighting system is installed at the Sare Home project in Sector 92. The CM was hearing the complaints raised by the members of the residents’ welfare association, who alleged that the project was incomplete and that there were a number of deficiencies with the project, like a non-existent fire fighting system. Furthermore, two phases of the project were yet to be delivered and electricity connection was frequently disconnected due to non-payment of bill by the developer. After hearing the submission on the matter, the CM also issued directions that a separate power connection should be issued to the project in the name of RWA. “The issue of fire-fighting system and electricity supply should be resolved by the DTCP after coordinating with the departments concerned,” he said. RS Bhath, district town planner (enforcement) submitted that the original licence of the project was in the name of Ramprastha Developers, which had entered into an agreement with Sare Homes, which, in turn, had brought foreign investment. Hearing this, the CM stated that firefighting system should be installed from the assets of original license holder, namely Ramprastha Developers.“We will be working to resolve these issues and also submit a report regarding taking over of the project as per the rules of town planning department. A report will be submitted within a month,” Bhath said. A spokesperson for Ramprastha Developers said that the land of the project and its development rights were taken over by Sare Home Developers years back. “We have nothing to do with this project anymore,” he said. A senior Sare Home executive said that at present the project has been taken over by Haryana-Real Estate Regulatory Authority(H-Rera), Gurugram. “The directors were employed on a rotational basis but the project is being overseen by the regulatory authority now,” he said. Pravin Malik, president, Sare Homes RWA, said that the only solution to the issue is a government takeover of the project so that it can be completed. “Around ₹200 crore has still to be given by buyers to complete the project but they don’t know who to make payments to. There is no director of Sare Home presently. The project will get completed only if the government intervenes,” he said. During the meeting, the CM also directed the Municipal Cororation of Gurugram (MCG) to start development works like water, electricity, sewerage, roads in the next one month in Palam Vihar, Gurugram, on the site where the EWS plots have been allotted. The CM said that the EWS Township should have all the facilities and it should be ensured that the work is completed by March 31, 2021.Khattar also ordered the re-carpeting of the road in front of the under-construction Bishnoi Bhawan in Sector 31. The MCG officers also apprised the CM that a budget of ₹38.74 lakh has been approved for construction of this road in Sector 31 and tenders would be floated for the same in the next two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-directed-to-install-fire-system-power-connection-at-housing-project-in-sector-92/story-zEkHmsCjz5QrZzidSSj09K.html
28-11-2020||Gurugram||No Haryana farmers participated in Delhi Chalo protests: CM||Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday said that Haryana farmers had not participated in the Dilli Chalo protest against the farm laws, alleging that the farmers’ stir was a conspiracy of other political parties and organisations in Punjab, which is ruled by the Congress. The chief minister, who addressed the media in the city, even hit out at Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for avoiding talks with him in the last three days. “The movement was started by farmers of Punjab. There is some connection with certain political parties and unions. Farmers of Haryana did not participate in this agitation of marching to Delhi,” said Khattar, who was in the city on Saturday to address the grievance redressal meeting. “Haryana police during the agitation exercised complete restraint and did not use any force. They only tried to stop them from going to Delhi in such a large number,” he said during the press briefing.The two chief ministers — Bharatiya Janata Party’s Khattar and Congress’ Singh — have indulged in a war of words on Twitter since the beginning of the farmers agitation on November 26. Khattar accused Singh of inciting farmers and running away from talks. In response to that, Singh took potshots at the Haryana CM saying he should have tried to talk to the farmers before the protest began. The issue snowballed after farmers from Punjab and Haryana were stopped from entering Delhi through the Delhi-Haryana border, especially Jhajjar and Sonepat on Friday.“Going in large numbers to Delhi is of no use. Instead Punjab farmers should send their 10-15 representatives to talk to the Central government in this matter as negotiation is the only solution,” said Khattar.The protest by farmers is against the three farm laws passed in the parliament in the monsoon session — The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. Farmers want the new laws to be repealed and demand minimum support price (MSP) for all agricultural produce to continue. Khattar said that the Punjab government was playing politics in the matter and said that officials from Punjab CM’s office were seen leading the agitation and were at the forefront. Referring to his tweets made in the last two days, he said, “It is an abnormal situation as for the first time in six years a chief minister is trying to talk to another chief minister and is being avoided. I tried to talk to my counterpart in Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh, several times during the last three days but he avoided taking my calls. I dialled him two to three times, and thereafter several calls were made from our exchange, but every time the chief minister’s staff told us that he is busy and will connect with us in a short while.”Slamming Khattar, Punjab chief minister Singh called the allegation baseless and demanded an apology. He said, over 50,000 farmers from Haryana joined the march, as per the Punjab intelligence and Centre’s intelligence report. In a press statement issued by the Punjab government based on interviews given to the media, Singh said, “Khattar is lying that he tried calling me earlier and I did not respond. But now, after what he has done to my farmers, I will not speak to him unless he apologises and admits that he did wrong with Punjab’s farmers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/no-haryana-farmers-participated-in-delhi-chalo-protests-cm/story-MJBXp3Rxn75lcObF7u3Q8K.html
28-11-2020||Gurugram||Driver arrested for using fake toll slip while trying to cross Sirhaul border||A 31-year-old driver was arrested while he was trying to cross the Gurugram-Delhi border at Sirhaul by allegedly producing a fake slip purportedly issued by South Delhi Municipal Corporation toll plaza on Thursday night. Police said the suspect was using forged slips for the last many months. According to the police, a gang has been selling fake passes for several months and is believed to have duped the toll operator of crores of rupees. The company is yet to verify the total number of forged slips used by commuters. The police said that so far, the toll slips that have been duplicated were printed by a person in Gurugram. They used to print at least 60 such fake slips every day.The incident came to light on Thursday night while the driver was stopped while trying to cross the toll around 9.30pm,. The toll operator checked the slip and found the series to be different. The operator informed his seniors following which police was called to the spot and the driver was handed over to them. The suspect was identified as one Tajinder Singh of Ropad in Punjab. He worked as a driver with a private company in Gurugram and was going to drop an employee to Delhi when he was nabbed, said police. KK Rao, commissioner of police, said that during questioning, Singh revealed that he used to buy fake toll slips for Rs 10 from one of his friends who printed such slips. These slips helped him save paying the toll amount of around Rs 100. “We have formed teams and have identified the kingpin,” he said. Later, police said they arrested the kingpin of the gang — identified as Jitender singh hailing from Alwar in Rajasthan — on Friday night from sector 29. He used to print these slips along with one of his partners.Police has recovered one printer and CPU from his possession.Investigators, however, said they are yet to identify the total number of people involved in this scam. The police said they received a complaint from MEP Infrastructure Developers, the contractor for collecting municipal toll, alleging that a driver was trying to pass through with a fake slip. The police said MEP officials had also found similar fake slip when they had, randomly, stopped three cars to check their slips. They found the slips to be duplicate and confirmed the same by checking the serial numbers, which revealed that the slips were printed with similar ink and the printer used was also different. “The staff informed a senior officer and contacted the police control room. A PCR was sent from Udyog Vihar police station and the suspect was taken for questioning,” said Rao. A case under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forging document) and 120B (conspiracy) of the IPC was registered at Udyog Vihar police station on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/driver-arrested-for-using-fake-toll-slip-while-trying-to-cross-sirhaul-border/story-CQtaBpPpDw4IUxOU622ixI.html
28-11-2020||Gurugram||Policy for division of large plots to be tabled soon: Khattar||The Haryana government will soon unveil a policy for the division of large plots with a provision that every part of plot must be divided into a minimum area of 100 square yards. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced this on Saturday, while presiding over a meeting of district public relations grievance committee in Gurugram.“A policy on this matter will be tabled in the next cabinet meeting and the minimum area of a plot has been fixed at 100 square yards,” Khattar said. Khattar made this announcement while hearing an issue pertaining to the existing town planning scheme, which was formulated in 1966-67. Officials said that at that time, the colonies, which were developed or came under this scheme, also included the plot size but the maps of the properties were not passed at that time. The problem arose when the owners of the houses on these plots wanted to divide the property but the municipal corporation refused to approve the maps citing old rules. The matter was raised in the grievance committee by two residents of Shivaji Nagar, in which the complainants submitted that their grandfather had built a house on a 153 square yard plot in 1971, which was later transferred to both the brothers. As the house was old, the brothers decided to reconstruct the property and submitted an application to get approval from the MCG. The civic body, however, declined the application, citing the old rule, the complainant submitted. While addressing this problem, the CM said that for such cases, the state government has almost formulated the new policy, which will be tabled in the next Cabinet meeting.The CM also issued directions to register a case against those making illegal constructions in New Colony, Gurugram, and the construction should be removed as per the demolition order issued by MCG. These directions were issued on the grievance raised by a complainant, who submitted that illegal construction at a site was being carried out despite sealing by MCG. Khattar also said that similar action would be taken on complaints where illegal construction is being carried out despite sealing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/policy-for-division-of-large-plots-to-be-tabled-soon-khattar/story-0fU0Hb2IheSncerHYpMNfP.html
28-11-2020||City||Farmers’ agitation: Sealing of Delhi borders leaves Ludhiana industrialists on tenterhooks||Sealing of the Delhi borders due to the farmers’ agitation against the agriculture bills has left industrialists in Ludhiana in a state of uncertainty. Transportation of goods to the National Capital via road has come to a halt for the last three days, causing them heavy losses, industrialists say. Representatives of the hosiery and cycle industry rued that the lockdown, then the “rail-roko” agitation and now sealing of the Delhi borders was taking a toll on their business. Darshan Dawar, president of the Ludhiana Woollen Manufacturers Association and Knitwear Club, said, “It is peak season for the hosiery industry and sealing of Delhi borders will affect business at large. A large number of traders in Delhi purchase goods from Ludhiana and will cancel orders if delivery is delayed. Not only Delhi, but movement of goods to other states, including Madhya Pradesh, has also been affected.”Industrialists said the failure of the central and state governments to find a solution for the impasse, was resulting in heavy losses for them.DS Chawla, president of the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), said, “Around 50% of the bicycle industry has already been hit due to the farmers’ agitation. We are not being able to procure raw material as transporters are not accepting orders. They fear untoward incidents at the borders of Punjab and Haryana.”Transporters said the Delhi borders were completely sealed for the last three days and some vehicles had also got stuck on the way.Jagdish Jassowal, media secretary of Ludhiana Goods Transport Association, said, “Delhi’s borders are sealed for the last three days, now allowing movement of goods vehicles. Some vehicles also got stuck on the way, so no new orders are being accepted for now. To reach other states, truckers are taking alternative routes from Haryana.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-agitation-sealing-of-delhi-borders-leaves-ludhiana-industrialists-on-tenterhooks/story-A5QFZWXzQDF721WoJFwL4M.html

28-11-2020||Delhi||‘Very unfortunate’: AAP on Centre blaming rise in Covid-19 on Delhi govt in SC||The AAP on Friday termed as “very unfortunate” the Union Home Ministry’s remarks in its affidavit filed before the Supreme Court blaming the Delhi government for the rise in COVID-19 cases here, saying the Centre has chosen to play “dirty politics” at this critical hour. The Centre on Friday blamed the Delhi government for rising COVID-19 cases in the national capital and said that despite “repeated exhortations”, it did not take steps to enhance testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 tests for a long time.In a statement, the Aam Aadmi Party said the comments of the Centre about Delhi government in its affidavit before the Supreme Court are “very unfortunate”. “It is extremely unfortunate that the central government has chosen to play dirty politics in this critical hour. “The affidavit seems to have been drafted by a BJP spokesperson rather than by the Union government which is meant to work in collaboration with the states at the time of a pandemic. The affidavit is also factually incorrect.” The AAP claimed that Union Home Minister Amit Shah had promised to provide 750 ICU beds within 72 hours during a meeting held on November 15.  “Till date, only 200 beds have been provided. We hope the Centre will provide the rest of the beds soon. The central government has deprived Delhi of all funds, provided to other state governments during this epidemic, on the flimsy premise that Delhi is a UT. Therefore, we hope that the central government will do something concrete for Delhiites rather than play the blame game,” it said. In its affidavit, filed before the top court, the Ministry of Home affairs (MHA), said “while there were regular advertisements on achievements of Delhi government, including on dengue prevention and control, no ads on COVID-appropriate behaviour were to be seen. The people, at large, were also not apprised about this through regular outreach measures.” It said, “That despite repeated exhortations in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases, the Delhi government did not take steps to enhance testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 RTPCR tests for a long time.” A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R S Reddy and M R Shah took the Centre’s affidavit on record and observed that “things are going from bad to worse but no concrete steps are being taken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/very-unfortunate-aap-on-centre-blaming-rise-in-covid-19-on-delhi-govt-in-sc/story-UVTSvLsJoF9P0Y2KHe7fgI.html

28-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: Confusion reigns over government school fees||To pay or not to pay – parents of children studying in government schools of the district are confused with announcements of state government offering relaxations for school fees amid the Coronavirus pandemic.With December 1 set as the deadline to deposit the registration and continuation fee for Classes 10 and 12, the school authorities are on their toes to collect the fees from parents.School principals have stated that a large number of students have not deposited the fee, including amalgamated, sports and PTA charges, as their parents are under the false assumption that the state government has waived all charges. However, during the recent three-day virtual parent-teacher meetings, teachers had informed the parents that only the funds deposited in the treasury with regards to tuition fee, absentee fine and school leaving certificate have been waived and not other charges.There are 900 students in Classes 9 to 12 at Government Senior Secondary School, Dhandari Khurd, and majority of them have not submitted the school fee till November. In every parent-teacher meeting, the school authorities have been informing parents to deposit the fee, but to no avail.Speaking over confusion among parents, district education officer, secondary, Swaranjit Kaur, said, “I am not aware of the issue. School principals must clarify to parents through virtual meetings that the funds deposited in the treasury have been waived by the government and not all charges.”Principal Ujjalveer Singh, said, “There are over 570 students in Classes 10 and 12 and many have deposited the board registration fee but parents are not ready to deposit the school fee. The charges are minimal and parents have been asked to pay it on a monthly basis but despite repeated requests, they have not deposited it citing financial constraints.”As per the rules, government schools can charge Rs 15 each as sports fund and parent-teacher association fund and Rs 20 as amalgamated fund monthly from students of Classes 9 and 10. While from Classes 11 and 12, the school authorities can charge Rs 20 each for sports fund and parent-teacher association fund, Rs 25 as an amalgamated fund.The board registration and continuation fee for Class 10 are Rs 900 and Rs 1,170 for Class 12.Schools hold meet to ask parents to deposit feeA chemistry lecturer of a government school, said, “For the last three days, we are holding parent-teacher meetings to inform parents regarding the performance of their child. During the meetings, we have also asked them to deposit the school fee but the majority of them believe that the state government has waived all the charges. To address the issue, the education department must issue a statement as these funds are used to maintain the school infrastructure and pay water and electricity bills.”At Government Senior Secondary School, Multipurpose, which has a strength of 3,300 students in Classes 9 to 12, over 50% of students have not deposited the fee. The teachers are contacting the parents daily and asking them to deposit the board class registration fee as the last date is approaching and if not submitted in the given time then they will have to pay the late fee charges as well.School principal Navdeep Romana, said, “All class teachers are directed to collect the registration fee from students. The last date to deposit the fee is nearing and if a student has to appear for the board exams, we have informed parents to deposit the fee.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-confusion-reigns-over-government-school-fees/story-dJENXEwBC4rG41tjvhWawI.html
28-11-2020||City||2,320 complaints resolved as ‘Know your case’ resumes in Ludhiana after eight months||Eight months after police suspended the “Know Your Case” scheme due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it resumed the service on Saturday across all 29 police stations in the district.Police claimed to have resolved 2,320 complaints through the day, while another 423 people were given information about progress on their cases and complaints. Police also handed over case property, which was seized in different cases.As part of safety measures against Covid-19, police made special arrangements to maintain social distancing among the people. Hand sanitisers were also provided and help desks were set up to properly guide people and avoid crowding.Launched on November 28, 2019, the scheme was suspended by the police commissioner on March 20 in view of the Coronavirus outbreak in the region. Police had also called off public dealings after some cops tested positive for the virus. Thereon, the public was advised to drop complaints in complaint boxes installed outside police stations or send these via e-mail. This led to pendency of many cases, both new and old.Inderbir Singh, a resident of Dugri, said he had a dispute with a tenant, who owed him rent and electricity dues for six months. He had filed a complaint regarding this, but it was left unaddressed due to the pandemic.On Saturday, he got to visit the police station and the dispute was resolved, with the tenant issuing cheques for the dues.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Gurpreet Singh Sikand said 162 cases of matrimonial dispute were also resolved at the women cell.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal said any complainant desirous of knowing the status of their complaint, case or petition can visit the police station or unit concerned from 10am to 2pm on the designated Saturday. Gazetted officers, along with the SHOs, investigation officers and in-charges of the units will remain present. Investigation officer will apprise the complainant of the case status, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-320-complaints-resolved-as-know-your-case-resumes-in-ludhiana-after-eight-months/story-JJphrtwRhhiJeQiBh90U7N.html
28-11-2020||City||Ludhiana’s Covid-19 death toll surpasses 900 in 244 days||The district’s death toll due to Covid-19 breached the 900 mark on Saturday with five more residents losing the battle to the virus – eight months after Ludhiana recorded its first casualty on March 29.Besides, 100 residents also tested positive, taking the case tally to 22,642. Among these, 869 cases are still active, while 20,868 people have recovered.The latest fatalities include a 75-year-old man from Haibowal, a 68-year-old woman from Latala village, a 65-year-old man from Jagraon and a 63-year-old man from Dhandran Road. The fifth patient died at PGIMER, Chandigarh, and the details were awaited, health department officials said.The spike in death rate After the first Covid casualty on March 29, Ludhiana had recorded another three in April and five more in May. As the lockdown restrictions were lifted, allowing borders to reopen and economic activity to resume, the Covid fatalities rose to 12 in June. The situation worsened in July that saw 67 deaths. August saw the death rate spiralling in Ludhiana, with 323 people succumbing to the virus in a month. There was no bend in the curve until the end of September either, as 330 more deaths were recorded. The district saw some relief from the pandemic in October when the casualties came down to 96 – a 70% drop in the monthly fatality rate.Similarly, as of November 28, 65 deaths have been recorded in Ludhiana.But, health department officials caution that though there was a brief lull, the Covid-19 casualty graph was again witnessing an uptick, so there was no room for complacency.“The recent spurt in cases as well as deaths is a clear indicator that the second wave has arrived. Earlier, during the first wave, the virus had first spread in Delhi and three weeks later, we saw the cases burgeoning in Ludhiana as well,” said Dr Bishav Mohan, member of the Covid-19 task force formed by the state government. He urged residents not to disregard the significance of social distancing, wearing masks and frequent hand sanitisation while being in public.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said Delhi was a clear example of what apathy towards the pandemic can do. “Disregard towards safety protocols only led to another spurt in cases there. We have to ensure not to repeat this mistake in Ludhiana. Until the vaccination programme begins, social distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask are the only ways to prevent infection,” said Dr Bagga.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-s-covid-19-death-toll-surpasses-900-in-244-days/story-pj6XhIGeSh6QPC6KDCw7BP.html
28-11-2020||Lucknow||UP races to meet cold chain target for 1st phase of Covid-19 vaccine||The Uttar Pradesh government is aiming to create 2,03,938 litre space for cold chain maintenance at temperatures between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius for the first phase of the Covid-19 vaccine. This 2.03 lakh litre space includes 87,801 litre ordinarily used for routine immunisation. The first phase of Covid-19 vaccination is expected to immunise over four crore people in the state with the focus on frontline corona warriors, including health workers. Uttar Pradesh has a population of about 23 crore.So far, 80,733-litre space has been created, according to official data. Now, work is going on in 75 districts for creating an additional 1,23,205 litre cold chain space.For the Covid-19 vaccine alone, 1,16,137 litre space has to be created in the first phase in December.Construction work is going on in 22 districts for making exclusive vaccine depots, while repair work is underway in 27 others.For the districts, the target Covid population is taken in proportion to the state Covid population, which is seven times the number of beneficiaries for routine immunization. The number is roughly equal to 20 per cent of the districts’ population, according to state government officials.Also read: SII to apply for emergency authorisation of Covid-19 vaccine in 2 weeksThere are 97,000 doctors registered in Uttar Pradesh and over 65,000 of them are active in practice, according to the state medical faculty data. Apart from doctors, there are nurses, pharmacists, ward boys, lab technicians, cleaning staff and clerks working in hospitals. They are expected to among the first to be vaccinated for Covid-19.Dr AP Chaturvedi, state immunisation officer, said, “We have not been told how many vaccine vials will be coming, but the infrastructure will be ready in time.”“Vaccines will come in batches and we will ensure they are dispatched from the depots,” said Dr Chaturvedi.“As soon as the vials arrive, they will be sent out from the depots for vaccination, making space for more batches to be stocked,” said an official.Walk-in-freezers, walk-in-coolers, cold chain boxes and deep freezers are to be provided by the union government.Who will be next after healthcare workers? After healthcare workers, people above 60-65 years of age could be vaccinated.“The risk of complications from Covid-19 is up to 50 per cent higher in the elderly and those with comorbidity. As the majority of the elderly suffer from some type of comorbidity such as diabetes or high blood pressure, vaccinating them will be a wise decision,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary-general, Association of International Doctors and expert in geriatric medicine.The population of the elderly is over 6 crore in the state and over 5 lakh in state capital Lucknow. The vaccine storage equipment will have electronic vaccine intelligence networking (EVIN) devices that record temperature in which vaccines are stored and if the range is broken, a message is sent via an SMS to the authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-races-to-meet-cold-chain-target-for-1st-phase-of-covid-19-vaccine/story-GGFrqPY2CkYmv100aHucWP.html

28-11-2020||Bangalore||Karnataka BJP chief says no talks of replacing CM Yediyurappa||The BJP’s Karnataka unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel on Saturday reaffirmed that there has been no talks in any of the party forums on leadership change in the state, as speculation about the high command mulling over replacing Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa refuses to die down.“There have been no discussions on leadership change.There have been speculations in this regard for the last three to four months and I have been saying this constantly,” Kateel said.Speaking to reporters in Mangaluru, he questioned whether discussions have taken place in this regard and at what level. “Who has raised the issue of leadership change? Who has questioned it? Has our national president or national office bearers or core committee members or our legislators have spoken in this regard?” he asked.There have been rumours in some quarters in recent times that the BJP is weighing the option of leadership change in Karnataka considering the age of Yediyurappa, who is 77.The state BJP has repeatedly rejected such speculations, but some within the party like senior MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal have openly talked about his replacement.The recent move by Yediyurappa like-recommending inclusion of the Veerashaiva-Lingayats community as OBC under the central list, which has been deferred, is being seen by many within BJP circles as a move by the CM to further consolidate his position as the leader of the community considered as BJP’s core vote bank, amid such speculations.On cabinet expansion or reshuffle, Kateel said the Chief Minister along with national leaders will decide on who should be in the cabinet and all party legislators will abide by it.Echoing similar views,Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan too said, the chief minister will decide in consultation with the high command.The statement from the party president and the DCM has come amid some aspirants openly expressing their resentment about the delay in the cabinet exercise.Ministerial aspirant and MLC MTB Nagaraj expressed unhappiness about delay in his induction into the cabinet.“It has been six months since we became MLC. Chief Minister has been saying that induction will happen, but the delay has caused some resentment naturally,” he said.Other BJP MLCs A H Vishwanath and R Shankar, who along with Nagaraj had rebelled against the Congress-JD(S) coalition government and faced disqualification, which helped the BJP come to power, too have expressed similar sentiments.They too have asked Yediyurappa to keep up the promise by making them ministers in return for their “sacrifice”.As per the agreement, Yediyurappa has already inducted 10 rebels into the cabinet after they won subsequent bypolls on the BJP ticket.Now the the three MLCs along with newly elected Rajarajeshwari Nagar BJP MLA Muniratha (also a rebel) are now waiting for their turn.With cabinet expansion delaying, a section of this group had met at a hotel last night and held discussions.They are said to be miffed about one among them, Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, who has made repeated visits to the high command lobbying for the induction of MLC C P Yogeshwar, who is not from the group.Yediyurappa on Friday told reporters that he has spoken to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the cabinet expansion, and the central leadership will convey their decision soon, and that the exercise may take place in two- three days.The cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope walk for the Chief Minister, considering that there are too many aspirants, from the party old guard too along with Congress-JD(S) rebels who are now BJP legislators.The cabinet currently has 27 members, and seven berths are still vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/karnataka-bjp-chief-says-no-talks-of-replacing-cm-yediyurappa/story-OuvdLWcOlSpFhU7HrtVpEL.html

Overall, more than 50 percent beds are available. So, we are in a slightly better situation,” he told reporters. The minister said there were some problems related to oxygen supply in Delhi on Friday which have been resolved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-detects-4-998-covid-19-cases-from-record-69k-tests-positivity-rate-drops-to-7-24/story-bUs0QwVq6EsbYDFfooct8I.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||‘Significant improvement in Mumbai’s air quality after Cyclone Nivar’: Researchers||After three days of poor air quality, an increase in wind speed and a rise in minimum temperature due to partly cloudy conditions led to a significant improvement in Mumbai’s air quality. The pollution index was at 123, falling under the moderate category.The System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) and the India Meteorological Department (IMD), both said air quality improvement was an after effect of the remnants of Cyclone Nivar, which made landfall over the east coast as a very severe cyclonic storm north of Puducherry late on Wednesday and subsequently weakened and dissipated as it moved over peninsular India.According to SAFAR, Mumbai’s AQI was 201 (poor) on Wednesday, 252 (poor) on Thursday and also the worst air quality in eight months, 218 (poor) on Friday. It dropped back to the moderate category on Saturday and is expected to be 120 (moderate) on Sunday.Also read: SII to apply for emergency authorisation of Covid-19 vaccine in 2 weeksGufran Beig, project director, SAFAR and scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, said, “Under the influence of the remnants of cyclone Nivar, winds over coastal and interior Maharashtra suddenly became fast between late Friday night and early Saturday morning which helped disperse pollutants that accumulated closer to the surface. A marginal rise in morning temperatures also helped reduce the carrying capacity of pollutants in Mumbai’s air.” Beig added that depending on the intensity of winds, the AQI was expected to fluctuate within the moderate category for the next three days.Mazgaon (242) and Chembur (208) were the most polluted locations in the city on Saturday with poor air quality while Navi Mumbai (71) and Worli (88) had the cleanest air under ‘satisfactory’ category. According to the IMD, the minimum temperature in south Mumbai increased to 24 degrees Celsius, 2 degree Celsius above normal on Saturday while the suburbs recorded 23.2 degrees Celsius, an increase of 3.2 degrees Celsius since Friday.“Mostly due to post-cyclone Nivar effect, almost the entire state was under cloud cover on Saturday as the remnants of the system pushed a lot of moisture, contributing to high clouds, which can lower the visibility, lead to some drizzle and lower temperatures too,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director-general, western region, IMD. He said light drizzling was reported from Solapur and other areas in interior Maharashtra could witness drizzling as well.Meanwhile, the maximum temperature in south Mumbai fell below the normal mark on Friday at 31.7 degrees Celsius, 1.3 degree Celsius below normal. The day temperature in the suburbs dropped from 34.4 degrees Celsius to 33.3 degrees Celsius which was close to normal. The weather bureau has predicted a partly cloudy sky for Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/significant-improvement-in-mumbai-s-air-quality-after-cyclone-nivar-researchers/story-w5QfBzixgD5JFjLLJ8ggjK.html

28-11-2020||City||Naib tehsildar faces DA case too,vigilance watered-down inquiry||Jalandhar Nearly a month after Punjab vigilance bureau arrested tainted Zirakpur naib tehsildar, Varinder Singh Dhoot, and four others in a corruption case on November 2, HT has learnt that Dhoot faces another case of disproportionate assets which is pending with vigilance headquarters, after Jalandhar vigilance ‘watered-down’ the investigation and recommended departmental action. The corruption case goes back to 2017, when Dhoot was Majri naib tehsildar. He, in connivance with subordinate revenue officials and private individuals, is accused of fraudulently selling 99 acre of shamlat land in Seonk village. The exchequer lost crores of rupees in this, vigilance had claimed.In 2017 itself, the Jalandhar vigilance had started a probe into Dhoot’s alleged disproportionate assets. The department accused him of buying prime properties, some in the name of his family members, spending crores of rupees on a palatial house and buying 25 acre in Hoshiarpur district.In December 2017, Jalandhar vigilance inquiry found that Dhoot had immovable and movable property, which was more than his known sources of income, through corrupt or illegal methods. Vigilance claimed Dhoot spent around Rs 50 lakh more than his income between 2009 and 2015, with the total expenditure detected at Rs 2.45 crore. Following this, the Jalandhar vigilance recommended a First Information Report (FIR) against Dhoot to Mohali headquarters, after legal opinion.In October 2019, nearly two years after this recommendation, Dhoot filed a representation before vigilance headquarters seeking a re-probe into the disproportionate asset case of 2017. This was allowed, and the Jalandhar vigilance again prepared an expenditure report of Dhoot from 2009-2015, and calculated it at Rs 2.25 crore. This was Rs 18.6 lakh more than his income and fell within the government mandated guideline of less than 10%. Now, the Jalandhar vigilance wrote to the state revenue department for departmental action.“The matter has been pending with the state vigilance for its final decision,” an official said, adding Dhoot also underwent an expensive kidney transplant in Singapore in 2018, was politically well-connected and a close confidante of a prominent politician of Hoshiarpur.The departmental inquiry report against Dhoot showed that 66 land deeds were registered under his name on November 2, when he was not even present in office.Jalandhar vigilance SSP Daljinder Singh said, “We have not given any clean chit to Dhoot. There were some technical issues and the matter is still pending.” Vigilance bureau assistant inspector general Ashish Kapoor, who is the investigating officer of the corruption case, refused to comment.Vigilance bureau director LK Yadav said, “I am not aware of the specifics of the inquiry against Dhoot. We will take our decision as per law and no culprit will be spared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/naib-tehsildar-faces-da-case-too-vigilance-watered-down-inquiry/story-fO0wtCMK6pixOQJNHvEwfO.html
28-11-2020||City||Battery operated bicycles and trikes to be included in Delhi’s EV policy||New Delhi: The Delhi government’s electric vehicles (EV) policy – aimed at reducing air pollution in the Capital – is being revised to include a segment on battery-operated bicycles and trikes, said a senior government official on Saturday, adding that the government has drafted a proposal to offer monetary incentives on their purchase.While the policy was notified by the government in August this year, the amendments are yet to be notified. The proposed revision includes cycles both in the passenger and cargo categories.A vehicle will be considered as a passenger electric bicycle if it is an electrically assisted pedal cycle with a motor with a maximum speed of 25 km per hour, said the draft pertaining to the proposed revision in the policy which HT has seen.“A purchase incentive of 25 per cent of the maximum retail price up to a maximum of Rs 5000 per vehicle will be provided to buyers of passenger e-cycles with a fixed additional incentive of Rs 2000 to the first 10,000 e-cycles,” said the document.The incentive will be available to individual buyers as well as bicycle sharing service providers, it said. An e-cycle will be considered the equivalent of a normal bicycle and will be allowed to use cycle lanes, wherever available, said the document.It further said, the incentive policy will also cover cargo e-cycles, which can be either two-wheeled or three-wheeled “trikes”. In case of cargo cycles, the purchase incentive will be 33% of the maximum retail price with a cap of Rs 15,000.The EV policy aims to ensure that by 2024, e-vehicles account for at least 25% of all new vehicle registrations in the capital. It also aims to help achieve the transition of at least 50% of all two-wheelers engaged in last mile delivery to the electric segment.In case of electric two-wheelers, the maximum incentive on purchase has been fixed at Rs 30,000 while in case of e-cars it is up to Rs 1.5 lakh per vehicle. For e-rickshaws, an amount of up to Rs 30,000 is the incentive for purchase. Buyers have to pay the full amount during purchase and later claim reimbursement from the government, for which the government had launched a website.In October, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal Arvind Kejriwal had enlisted boosting the EV policy in his action plan to combat air pollution in the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/battery-operated-bicycles-and-trikes-to-be-included-in-delhi-s-ev-policy/story-NNg8jtQEjsjuQncUuuWqeP.html

Speaking to reporters through virtual press conference minutes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to SII’s facility in Pune on Saturday, Poonawalla said, the vaccine, post-authorization, will initially be distributed in India and then to African countries. “We are in process of applying for emergency licensing in the next two weeks. We will have to wait and see when we get the authorisation,” said Poonawalla while responding to a question on Covishield vaccine’s distribution in the country. “The vaccine will be distributed initially in India and then we will look at COVAX countries which are mainly in Africa. The United Kingdom and European markets are being taken care of by AstraZeneca and Oxford. If they need our help for scaling up production capacity, we are always there to support them.”The SII, the world’s largest vaccine maker, has signed an agreement to manufacture the vaccine developed by the Jenner Institute of Oxford University in collaboration with British-Swedish pharma company AstraZeneca. University of Oxford and AstraZeneca on Monday said that their Covid-19 vaccine was up to 90 per cent effective in late-stage clinical trials, raising hopes for the arrival of shots in India by the end of the year. Also read: PM Modi reviews Covid-19 vaccine progress in Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and PuneAccording to Poonawalla, the Covishiled vaccine has proved effective during trials. “What we found in Covishield during trials globally was that there was zero hospitalisation and 60 per cent reduction in sterilizing immunity.” Poonawala said during PM Modi’s visit to the manufacturing facility at SII, various issues about pricing and logistics as well as pros and cons of other vaccine candidates were discussed. The SII is currently producing 50-60 million doses per month and plans to scale up to 100 million doses by January next year. “We are producing 50 to 60 million doses per month and post-January, it will be scaled up to 100 million doses a month. We have built the largest pandemic-level facility in Pune and our new campus in Mandri. That was also showcased to the PM with a tour around the facility and a lot of detailed discussions,” Poonawalla further mentioned. On signing any deal with the government of India, Poonawalla said there has been no contract signed with centre yet. “As of now, we don’t have anything in writing on how many doses they will purchase but as indicated by the health ministry, they would need 300-400 million doses by July 2021,” said the SII CEO.Poonawala also claimed the Oxford drug can be transported easily at normal refrigerator temperatures, unlike some of the other candidates which require extreme cold storage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-serum-institute-to-apply-for-emergency-authorisation-in-next-2-weeks/story-ii8plpbkdSwksb2c6J0aIP.html

While TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is expected to hold rallies in some of the districts where Adhikari has a support base starting with West Midnapore on December 7, the chief minister will also hold a virtual meeting with all district-level leaders on December 4. On Saturday, Abhishek Banerjee, TMC MP and the chief minister’s nephew and poll strategist Prashant Kishor held a meeting with party leaders of Malda district. Adhikari was an observer of five districts including Malda and East Midnapore overseeing party’s organisational network in the districts. TMC leaders from East Midnapore have been directed to remain present in the December 7 rally. “The party leadership not only wants to take a stock but also wants to boost the morale of the party workers ahead of the polls after Friday’s double setback,” said a TMC leader. The ruling party received a double blow on Friday with not just Adhikari quitting the cabinet, further widening his gap with the party, but another party veteran Mihir Goswami joining the BJP. Also read: PM Modi reviews Covid-19 vaccine progress in Ahmedabad, Hyderabad and PuneBJP MP Arjun Singh had said a few days ago, “If Adhikari joins the BJP, the government will fall. The TMC party will come to an end.”Even though senior leaders of the party said that both Adhikari and Goswami and a few other party leaders are seemingly peeved with Kishor and his way of functioning, the TMC still sounded hopeful and upbeat. “Suvendu is still a party member. So talks can still be held. His mother is unwell so it may take some time. But I am hopeful,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP, who had earlier held at least two rounds of talks with Adhikari. Party insiders said that some of the TMC leaders from Malda were absent in the meeting called by Abhishek Banerjee and Kishor in Kolkata on Monday. Among the absentees was TMC’s Rajya Sabha MP Mausam Benazir Noor.Meanwhile, the BJP sharpened its attack against the TMC with state president Dilip Ghosh saying that the TMC would meet its end within a month.“Didi has failed in disaster management of the state and is now busy with the disaster management of the party. In a month from now, the TMC will come to an end. Goswami’s joining is just the beginning of TMC’s end,” Ghosh said, adding that BJP national president is likely to come to Bengal around December 8. The TMC, however, lashed out against Ghosh saying that he was daydreaming. Even though Adhikari was not available for his comments, he is scheduled to hold a non-political rally in West Midnapore on Sunday. Abhishek Banerjee is also scheduled to hold a rally on Sunday in South 24 Parganas. Meanwhile, supporters of Adhikari came up with fresh posters in Hooghly district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-pulls-ups-socks-bjp-ups-ante-after-suvendu-adhikari-quits-cabinet/story-2ahuK0PFUCJc0H9gC3OkaN.html

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed Delhi’s overall AQI on Saturday at 231. On Friday, the air quality had improved to reach 137. IMD scientists said that the wind speed had slowed down slightly on Saturday compared to Friday, but it was still enough to have facilitated pollution dispersion. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said the average wind speed during the day remained around 8-10kmph. On Friday, however, the wind speed had peaked to around 15 kmph during the day and on Thursday night too the wind speed was high. “The average wind speed recorded on Thursday night was also around 8kmph, which is rare because winds tend to slow down at night. During the day too, the winds have been favourable for the dispersion of pollutants. Today (Saturday), the wind speed was high but not as high as it was on Friday, thus the increased AQI,” Soni said. Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), data shows that on Friday 499 fires were spotted over Punjab and Haryana, and its contribution to the Capital’s PM 2.5 levels was around 4%.Soni also said that the air quality is expected to remain between moderate and poor range till November 30, after which there is a forecast for deterioration. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, also said that gradually wind speed will deteriorate from Sunday. “Over the last few days because of the impact of a western disturbance over the hills, the winds have picked up speed, but it will slow down again,” he said. Srivastava said that the temperature in Delhi and NCR is also expected to fall in the coming days because of the continuing snowfall in the regions of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh and parts of Uttarakhand.On Friday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official recording for the city, was 10.1 degree Celsius. The maximum temperature was 26.4 degree Celsius. “The normal minimum temperature for the first week of December is around 9-9.5 degrees Celsius. We are expecting the temperature this time to be a couple of degrees lower. From November 30, the minimum is likely to be around 7-8 degrees Celsius,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-quality-dips-due-to-poor-wind-speed/story-bEWX1WogDuI737tTrXfl3L.html

After that, the repair and restoration work will be taken up on a priority basis.” Janta Vashat and Parvati have four large water tanks that have a capacity between 170 to 172 megalitres per day (MLD) water storage. Suraj Lokhande, a social worker said, “The water tanks in Parvati need immediate repairs failing which a major disaster is likely to happen. When will the administration wake up? Only after disasters? The slabs are broken, and it is a pathetic sight that reflects the casual approach of the administration. We will resort to agitation if our demands are not met and the repair work must be done according to the highest standards of safety.” The wall of the water tank located in Janta Vasahat in survey no 109 has developed a wide crack and weakened considerably with no repairs in sight. The water tanks supply water to Bibvewadi, Taljai, and the entire Western Pune region covering a population of 8 lakh. Similarly, the old water storage tank in Parvati also needs immediate restoration work and repairs. Daljeet Goraya, a member of the NIBM citizens watch committee said, “The PMC is spending crores of rupees on unnecessary expenditure and it shows that it does not have money. We have a right to an adequate and 24-hour water supply. Mohammad wadi and Undri are facing a water crisis for over a decade and it seems the PMC does not want any work to be done and keeps them in such a situation that they buy water from private persons. It is a water-profit business that is preventing water supply in the area. The water tanks are dry and it is a dead investment.” Jehangir Dorabjee, owner of Royal Heritage mall said, “The water tanks are of now used to citizens who are bereft of the benefit as there is water supply connection to the storage. Undri-Mohammadwadi areas are reeling under severe water crisis and water supply alone can bring about a change in the area. A huge investment has been made towards the construction of the water storage tanks some two years ago and they are lying unused till date.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/dilapidated-water-tanks-pose-risks-need-urgent-repairs-say-activists/story-ndj63XgiK3PJ4rtE3RcVPI.html
28-11-2020||Pune||GMRT observatory, located near Pune gets international recognition||The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), one of the world’s largest and low-frequency radio observatories, has been selected as an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Milestone facility. The facility is only the third IEEE Milestone recognition for an Indian contribution. The previous two Indian contributions, recognised by the world’s largest technical professional organisation recognised in 2012, are for the pioneering work done by Sir JC Bose to demonstrate the generation and reception of radio waves in 1895, and for the Nobel Prize winning discovery of the scattering of light named “Raman effect” by Sir CV Raman in 1928. With GMRT users covering over 40 countries and the fact that it was designed and built entirely in India, the IEEE India office and IEEE Pune section initiated a proposal to nominate the observatory for the prestigious international recognition. The proposal was submitted in cooperation with National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) Pune , which is a part of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, to IEEE in early 2020, after an initial review of the history and accomplishments of the GMRT by a team from IEEE India. After a rigorous review process, including appraisal by international experts and additional information from NCRA, the proposal was first put up before the history committee of the IEEE which cleared it for approval in October 2020. It was later submitted to the IEEE board of directors for final approval, which was granted on November 23. Harish Mysore, senior director, IEEE India operations said, “IEEE has recognised 212 milestones worldwide for their scientific and engineering contributions. GMRT is the third IEEE Milestone in India. This IEEE milestone not only recognises the contributions of scientists and engineers of India, it also helps to attract young talent towards fundamental Science and Engineering.” Prof Yashwant Gupta, centre director, NCRA, said, “It is indeed a very proud and special moment, not just for GMRT and NCRA (and the global astronomy community), but also for the entire Science and Technology fraternity in the country, to see a modern, made in India facility earn this international recognition. It is also a fitting tribute to the late Prof Govind Swarup, who was the driving force behind GMRT, and all the team members whose efforts over the last 30 years or so made GMRT a reality, culminating in the successful upgrade of the facility that we completed last year. We look forward with great anticipation to the IEEE Milestone dedication ceremony.” Prof Toshio Fukuda, president and CEO of IEEE for circulation to the media said, “IEEE milestones recognise important landmarks in the global pursuit of excellence in Science and Engineering which have significantly advanced technology for the benefit of humanity. I am pleased that the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) programme of India has been recognised as an IEEE milestone, acknowledging its contributions to the important work of exploring the universe through Radio Astronomy. I congratulate all of the scientists and engineers who have developed and operated GMRT with such great distinction.” The IEEE Milestone will be formalised at a special dedication ceremony that will involve unveiling of the bronze citation plaque at the GMRT premises. The event is planned in 2021 after the Covid-19 pandemic situation allows ease of travel to India, and the IEEE president and other officials are expected to participate, in addition to several dignitaries from academia, industry and the Government of India. Noted scientist Prof Raghunath Mashelkar while congratulating NCRA said, “This is fantastic news. My heartiest congratulations to the entire NCRA family, both the past and the present. What makes it special is the fact that the only other time this happened was when the pioneering work of JC Bose and CV Raman was recognised almost a century ago.” Premier scientific body IEEE is the world’s largest technical professional organisation dedicated to advancing technology in all areas related to electrical and electronics engineering. The IEEE Milestones programme honours significant technical achievements and excellence for the benefit of humanity found in unique products, services, seminal papers and patents, which have global or regional impact, in all areas associated with IEEE. India’s pride GMRT is one of the largest and most sensitive low frequency radio observatories in the world. It is operated by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), Pune which is a part of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. It consists of an array of 30 antennas of 45 m diametre each, spread out over a 30 km region about 80 km from Pune, with sophisticated electronics and computing for processing the data from all the antennas. The facility was conceived of and proposed in the late 1980s, built and made operational during the 1990s, and opened for use by the global astronomy community in 2002.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/gmrt-observatory-located-near-pune-gets-international-recognition/story-1ELACKRARb6x1bMy9HdOsI.html

28-11-2020||Pune||No bank accounts leave sex workers in Pune worried about receiving Rs 15,000 aid from MVA govt||A visible elation was reported among sex workers in the Budhwar peth area when they got to know that the government of Maharashtra has decided to provide financial help of Rs 15,000 for a period of three months from October to December 2020. However, many are now worried of the transfer of funds since they do not possess an active bank account. The Uddhav Thackeray led Maha Vikas Aghadi government’s decision to provide financial help to sex workers was a welcome move since they were facing an unprecedented financial crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the data shared by the state, Pune district has 7,011 sex workers and around 1,000 children between the age group of six to 18 years, completely dependent upon their mothers, while the government has identified 31,000 beneficiaries across the state. “This financial aid was first requested via a petition in the Supreme Court by the Durbar Mahila Samanvay Samiti, West Bengal, which is a collective of sex workers in Sonagachi,” said Tejasvi Sevekari, executive director of Pune based NGO Saheli. The organisation approached the court to get Covid relief for sex workers. The Supreme Court in September announced that all the states should take the onus and disbursing Rs 5,000 per sex worker per month from October to December 2020. In Maharashtra, it was taken further proactively by the women and child development department who had lent a hand during the lockdown by providing ration kits to the women in few of the red-light areas. Sevekari pointed out a hurdle sex worker faced is that many of them do not have an active bank account, and according to the state government resolution, the sum of Rs 5,000 per month would only be disbursed through banks. “If a community-based organization were to be part of the disbursement committee, we could help in verifying the sex workers and also ease out the problems of many of the workers who are not on the list provided to the government,” said Sevekari. “According to the list, there are 7,011 sex workers in Pune district but this list is ever increasing, what happens to those women who are not on the list? How does one determine or verify whether they have an active bank account or even have opened one,” asked Sevekari. Before the announcement, NGO Saheli in fact began a program through the national network of sex workers Sahayak Setu in helping sex workers disseminate information on assistance through government welfare schemes. “We were helping them to procure their Aadhaar cards and other proper identification options to help them open their accounts in banks, which while surveying we found that not many had accounts,” she said. Seema Thapa has been in this business for 10 years and has never felt the need to open a bank account. “I would simply keep the money with me and spend it as I wanted to. It has been six months that I have had no work, no business and was happy when I was informed that the government will be giving us money, but now I am disappointed as I do not have a bank account or any identification card to open an account,” Thapa said. Babita Sheikk who has been a sex worker for eight years assertively said, “I have a bank account but it is used to only send money to my relatives in the village and I hardly keep any savings. I have loans, which I borrowed from the brothel keeper for basic needs, hence money is never enough to be called savings.” Seema Waghmode, founder member of Kaya Kalp and executive member of Maharashtra State Aids Control Society (MSACS) who is heading the committee for the disbursement of the financial aid said, “It is a difficult task since many of the sex workers do not have bank accounts nor possess any identification or UID card. We have in fact launched a process whereupon we have given them a form to authenticate that they are in this business. The city has about 4,000 sex workers within the red-light area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/no-bank-accounts-leave-sex-workers-worried-about-receiving-rs-15-000-aid-from-mva-govt/story-HFfYBiEnTtef6Cblw1XmbM.html
28-11-2020||Chandigarh||Will hold protest at Jantar Mantar in heart of Delhi not Burari: BKU (Ugrahan)||Continuing its direct dissociation with the joint forum of the 30 farmer unions of Punjab, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan), one of the most active unions in the state, on Saturday decided not to enter the national capital till the evening. Union president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the supporters have gathered at Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar on Delhi’s outskirts till a decision is taken. “Our leadership has unanimously rejected the plan to hold a protest at the Nirankari ground in Burari. Other unions may have agreed but we are against the decision to change the venue. We will hold a rally at Jantar Mantar to register our resentment against the new farm laws,” he said. Also read: Thousands of farmers stay put at Delhi’s borders, traffic disruptedLEFT-LEANING UNION AWAITS DIRECTION Supporters of this Left-leaning union had left for Delhi in large numbers on Friday after entering Haryana from Doomwali in Bathinda and Khanauri in Sangrur. “We are deliberating with leaders of the farmers’ joint forum from Punjab and other states to resume the culmination of Dilli Chalo at Jantar Mantar,” he said. Union’s Bathinda district president Shingara Singh Mann, who coordinated the march from Doomwali, said 5,000 vehicles carrying activists, dry rations and other logistics were on their way from Bathinda and Sangrur. A large group of Ugrahan faction of the BKU reached Meham in Rohtak, 200km from the Doomwali border, early on Saturday before restarting the march. “After breaking barricades at Dabwali on Friday, we reached a grain market at Meham. Our supporters faced challenges at a Ghaggar bridge near Sirsa and heavy barricading by the police near Agroha in Hisar. We are now headed towards Delhi border and will park at Bahadurgarh till a decision is taken,” Mann said. CRITICISM LED TO U-TURN As members of the joint forum of farmers entered Haryana from various points on Thursday after facing tear gas and water cannons from the police, the Ugrahan faction started a peaceful dharna at Doomwali and Khanauri borders. However, it had to change its plan to hold a sit-in for a week after the activists criticised the BKU leadership for its decision. On Wednesday, Ugrahan criticised the joint forum for holding a rail blockade and prolonging the agitation, affecting the industry, farmers and common man due to the suspension of rail traffic for two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/will-hold-protest-at-jantar-mantar-in-heart-of-delhi-not-burari-bku-ugrahan/story-iSYXlkoExpwMR2OcviGqMI.html

The actor’s row with the Maharashtra government escalated further when the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolished her office in Bandra’s Pali Hill for “structural violations”.In the latest development in the row, the Bombay High Court on Friday ruled that the BMC officials involved in the demolition acted out of malice and also appointed a valuer to assess the quantum of damage, according to news agency PTI.Also Read: ‘Don’t threaten,’ says Fadnavis after Thackeray’s ‘don’t compel me to come after you’ jibeMeanwhile, Republic TV editor Arnab Goswami was granted bail by the Supreme Court on November 11 after being arrested by Alibaug police on November 4 for allegedly abetting the suicide of 53-year-old interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother Kumud in 2018. The apex court on Friday said the bail granted to the journalist would be operative for another four weeks.“We are dealing with a person’s liberty.

28-11-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra govt achieved nothing in one year: Fadnavis||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday attacked the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government as it completed its first year in office, saying it has failed on all counts. He said the government has been unable to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, resolve farmers’ issues, and has made no progress in development projects.“The Maha Vikas Aghadi government has achieved nothing in this one year,” he said. He added they say they will run the government for five years but have failed to deliver on governance. “The achievements of this government are only halting all development works in the state.”Fadnavis listed the projects his government initiated but which have been stopped. He asked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to stop threatening the opposition and show governance instead. Thackeray on Friday warned the opposition against personal attacks and vindictive politics while slamming the BJP over attacks on his family. In an interview with HT, he called personal attacks “low and perverted tendency of their [BJP] politics”.Fadnavis said the BJP does not make personal attacks and nor does it target families of political opponents. “We have never made personal attacks. If we are talking about personal attacks, Shiv Sena leaders have attacked my wife but I have never made a fuss over it. The BJP does not believe in personal attacks, but if the family is in politics, then political questions will be raised against them,” he said. Fadnavis advised Thackeray to behave like a chief minister and not issue threats.He cited the Supreme Court’s ruling granting journalist Arnab Goswami’s interim bail in an abetment to suicide case and the Bombay high court’s observation that Mumbai civic body’s action to demolish a part of actor Kangana Ranaut’s bungalow was illegal and smacks of malafide intentions.Fadnavis added they are not demanding the president’s rule but the two rulings highlight “a breakdown of constitutional machinery and abuse of power”. “We do not subscribe to the thoughts of Arnab Goswami and Kangana Ranaut but we are against the attitude of suppressing those who speak against the government.”Fadnavis said MVA constituents, Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and Shiv Sena, lack coordination and called it an “unnatural” alliance. “They [Shiv Sena] remember the promise that was not given [by the BJP] for the chief minister’s post, but they have forgotten promises they made to the farmers. The government has not provided any help to the farmers…”Shiv Sena quit an alliance with the BJP last over the chief minister’s post and formed the government with Congress and NCP’s help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-led-maharashtra-govt-achieved-nothing-in-one-year-fadnavis/story-nCksXNRjf7AMCpRNH0nw6N.html

28-11-2020||Chandigarh||Farmers from Punjab, Haryana hold up supplies to Delhi by blocking its borders||Thousands of farmers protesting the Centre’s agriculture laws stayed put at the Singhu and Tikri border points for the third consecutive day on Saturday amid heavy police presence even after being offered a north Delhi ground to hold peaceful demonstrations.The agitating farmers also burnt the effigy of Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar at Tikri border. Assuring that the MSP will continue, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar reiterated that the central government was ready for talks with the farmer unions’ leaders on December 3 to resolve their issues.After spending a cold night at the Tikri (Bahadurgarh) and Singhu (Sonepat) borders between Haryana and Delhi, the farmers said they will block roads connecting Delhi and disrupt supplies if their demands are not met. The farmers said they wanted to demonstrate at Ramlila Ground in Delhi but the police have allowed them to protest at Nirankari Samagam Ground in Burari. With tractor-trailers parked on either side of the highway at Singhu border, Johal Singh, a farmer from Ludhiana district, said: “If we start protesting at Nirankari Samagam Ground, no one will care. Delhi sirf tab sunti hai jab unka ration pani bandh karte hain (The Union government will listen only when we will block the supply of essential items).” Refusing to enter Delhi, farmers at Tikri border gathered in the middle of the highway. Punjab’s farmers, who camped at Jind’s Julana for the night, have resumed their march to Delhi. As many as 30 farmers unions protesting at Singhu border held a meeting on Saturday and decided not to enter Delhi. Rakesh Bains, media in-charge BKU (Charuni) said they will hold demonstrations at Singhu border on Saturday night. “ We will wait for other farmers and take decision about further planning on Sunday,” he added.Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Singh Hooda reached Bahadurgarh to extend support to the protesting farmers.Issuing an advisory, a spokesman of Sonepat police said, “The farmers have blocked the national highway 44 by parking their vehicles on the road. The commuters should avoid travelling via national highway 44 and use the NH-71A to reach Delhi via Gurugram, Buana, Narala and Safiyabad.”Meanwhile, the famous Amrik Sukdev dhaba at Murthal has started free meals for farmers. A spokesman of the eatery said they have started free food for farmers for the sake of humanity. “The farmers are growing food for the entire nation and now, it’s our turn to feed them till the agitation continues,” he added.The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee is also offering meals to the farmers. Traffic eased on Chandigarh-Delhi highway, diversions in Sonepat The traffic movement along the Delhi-Chandigarh highway was eased on Saturday, a day after barricades were removed along the Sadopur/Lalru border on the Ambala-Chandigarh expressway. The Ambala police had sealed the border near Kamboj Filling Station on November 26 and 27. SP Rajesh Kalia had on Friday evening ordered the removal of barricades on the borders—Sadopur and Shambhu (Ambala-Patiala). Deputy superintendent of police (headquarters) Sultan Singh said the traffic movement has been eased and no farmer is being stopped. “There are a very few farmers crossing the Shambhu or Sadopur borders with clothes, food or other items for their fellow protesters, who have reached Delhi or are at the Haryana-Delhi borders,” he said. Assistant superintendent of police, Sonepat, Nikita Khattar said the traffic from Sonepat to the border is completely blocked and multiple diversions have been created near Bahalgarh, Rai, Gannaur and other areas to ease the traffic bound for Delhi and beyond.

28-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra surgeon held for patient’s ‘unnecessary’ examination gets bail||Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on Thursday granted bail to a surgeon from Maharashtra’s Akola, who was earlier booked and arrested for alleged rape and sodomy while conducting ‘unnecessary’ clinical examination of a patient.Police in Akola booked the doctor for outraging modesty, rape and unnatural offence following a complaint lodged by the patient. The 33-year-old woman, a resident of Khamgaon tehsil of Buldhana district, alleged that she had been to the doctor for treatment for severe abdominal pain for the past two years.She said she had got a sonography done on the advice of the doctor and visited him at the hospital on November 3 with the report. She claims the doctor inserted his finger in her private parts and also touched her inappropriately.Offended, as she felt the examination to be unnecessary, the patient said she slapped the doctor and rushed out of his check up room. She first reported the matter to her mother and then approached the police. Police registered an offence on the basis of her complaint and immediately placed the doctor under arrest.Also Read: Man who stabbed Agra dentist held after encounterThe surgeon then approached the high court claiming that a surgery was required to be conducted on the patient and for that purpose a thorough clinical examination was necessary. He claimed that the case falls within exception 1 to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which lays down that a medical procedure or intervention shall not constitute rape.In support of his contention, the doctor had also submitted an expert report stating that in some instances of lower abdominal pain, the surgeon has to consider an ovarian mass before anything else and to rule out conditions of swelling in fallopian tube and ovary, ovarian tumor and cyst, a vaginal examination is necessary.Also Read: BJP attacked my family... I’ve not stooped to their level, says UddhavIn view of his claim, justice Pushpa Ganediwala had called for a report from a panel of experts from the Government Medical College, Nagpur and granted bail to the surgeon following the submission of the panel’s report.The expert panel stated that examination of private parts of female patient having chronic abdominal pain is “a part of complete clinical evaluation in medical practice” and in a given case, “the doctor may decide to examine other systems or body parts, including breasts to arrive at a diagnosis.”In view of the report, justice Ganediwala ordered the surgeon to be released on personal bond of Rs 50,000, with one surety in the same amount.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-surgeon-held-for-patient-s-unnecessary-examination-gets-bail/story-ZDGdsE2hj5wFMVGud9BVoN.html
28-11-2020||Delhi||Thousands of farmers stay put at Delhi’s borders, traffic disrupted||The Delhi Police’s proposal to allot the Sant Nirankari Ground in Burari as a protest site for farmers demonstrating against three contentious central laws did little to ease the situation on Friday with only a few of them accepting the offer to march in but others deciding to stay put at the borders. The few farmers who arrived at the Burari ground were those who had gathered at the Tikri Border. They cooked and camped at the huge ground along the Outer Ring Road even as the police kept watch. But a large number of protesters continued to camp at that border point through the night. At the Singhu border, which opens into Sonepat, none of the farmers accepted the offer and the impasse continued. As a result, key arterial roads remained closed for traffic through the night, causing massive disruption for commuters, including those wanting to enter Haryana from the national capital or vice-versa. “The farmers…are undecided about whether or not they should accept the Burari ground as the protest site. Since many of these groups look to be leaderless, it is difficult for us to have a conversation with them and arrive at a consensus,” said a senior police officer.Thousands of farmers protesting the Union government’s new farm laws pushed their way into Delhi on Friday after skirmishes with the police, which fired tear gas and used water cannons to stop them but later agreed to a peaceful demonstration within the city.The farmers who refused to accept the police’s offer on Friday said that they would settle for nothing less than the Rashtrapati Bhawan or a place close to the corridors of power. The police offer was made after a series of clashes at the borders with officials using tear gas shells and water cannons to disperse the agitators and putting up barded wires and barricades to deter them. On Friday, the police also closed two other border roads -- the Dhansa border and the Jharoda Kalan border -- for traffic as a precautionary measure, even through there were no protesters there. Santosh Meena, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka), said that while the Dhansa border (which sees little traffic anyway) was opened on Friday evening, the Jharoda Kalan border was opened only for traffic towards Haryana. “The incoming traffic at Jharoda Kalan is open only for emergency traffic,” Meena said. “If someone is ending up at the Jharoda Kalan Border, we are asking them to enter through the Tikri Border,” said Meena on Saturday morning.On Friday, when protesters at landed at the city’s gates, they insisted on being let in, and it resulted in multiple conflicts between them and the police at the Singhu and Tikri borders. “But now the farmers themselves don’t want to enter the city,” said another senior police officer.Farmers have demanded a repeal of three laws enacted by Parliament in September which, together, allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales and lay down new rules for contract farming. Farmers say the reforms would make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations, erode their bargaining power and weaken the government’s minimum support price (MSP) system, which offers cultivators assured prices from the government, largely for wheat and rice. Agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and railways, food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal held day-long negotiations on November 13 with leaders of several farmers’ groups in an attempt to end over two months of a politically challenging agitation.

28-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt did nothing despite warning of Covid surge: Centre tells SC||Delhi, third among the top ten states with most Covid-19 active caseload in the country, took no effective steps despite being aware of the expected surge in cases in November with the confluence of winter, festival season and a spike in pollution, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Friday.In an affidavit detailing the circumstances that led the Union home minister to personally monitor Delhi’s preparedness on account of the rising Covid-19 cases in November, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) said, “The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) was aware that the confluence of winter, festival season and pollution were likely to witness a surge in cases. This foreknowledge ought to have led to strict enforcement and IEC measures being instituted well in time. However, this was not done.”It was on November 15, when the Union home minister Amit Shah stepped in and took a joint meeting of officials in the capital and spruced up efforts to augment the medical infrastructure by way of adding ICU beds, ramping up testing facilities, contact tracing, surveillance, and availability of medical workers.Pointing to the alleged deficiencies in the actions taken by Delhi government as observed by the home ministry during several rounds of meetings held over the past months, the affidavit disclosed that the Arvind Kejriwal government was informed in advance by an expert group headed by VK Paul, member NITI Aayog that Delhi should anticipate for a surge of around 15,000 cases per day in November and accordingly must provide for about 6,500 ICU beds.“Against this recommendation, GNCTD did not take any timely measures to increase the ICU beds from the present level of around 3,500, thus causing a sudden pressure to come on the health and medical infrastructure in Delhi,” stated the affidavit filed by MHA joint secretary Sandeep Kumar Jindal.Also Read: States must rise above politics to check Covid spread, says SCThe affidavit also faulted the Delhi administration for not taking steps to enhance testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 RT-PCR tests for a long time. Patients who were under home isolation were not properly traced. In addition, “house to house surveillance, contact tracing, quarantining and clinical management were also not done properly, which led to the spread of infection,” the affidavit added.According to the figures made available by the MHA, with 9.2 million Covid-19 cases, of which 0.44 million are active, India is faring “remarkably well” in restricting the spread.Also Read: India to manufacture 100mn doses a year of Sputnik: Moscow institute“Recovery rate has gone up to 93.7%. Average cases per day have reduced by 50% since the past eight weeks. Our case fatality rate remains low at 1.46% compared to the global average of 2.36%…We will continue making efforts to reduce fatality rate to less than 1 per cent and accelerate our efforts in reducing the positivity rate which stands at 6.9%,” the affidavit stated.This was largely attributable to 10 states which constituted 77% of the active caseload of the country. Delhi’s active case load is 8.5% of the national tally. Maharashtra leads with close to 19%, Kerala 14.7%, followed by Delhi, West Bengal, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-did-nothing-despite-warned-of-covid-surge-centre-tells-sc/story-7AoTEUd6E2cNKOMH7iEpuJ.html
28-11-2020||Delhi||Farmers let into Delhi after clashes at border||Thousands of farmers protesting the Union government’s new farm laws pushed their way into Delhi on Friday after skirmishes with the police, which fired tear gas and used water cannons to stop them from coming into the Capital, but later backed off and agreed to a peaceful demonstration within the city.Several layers of barriers could not keep the protesters – mostly from Punjab, demanding a repeal of three laws enacted by Parliament – as they pelted stones and broke barricades to push through with their “Delhi Chalo” march.The new laws allow agribusinesses to freely trade farm produce without restrictions, permit private traders to stockpile large quantities of essential commodities for future sales, and lay down new rules for contract farming. The farmers groups, however, say that the laws are quiet on minimum support prices and will encourage monopolies and make them vulnerable to exploitation by big corporations.Delhi Police agreed to let the farmers march into the Capital after hours of a stand-off at some entry points. While thousands – gathered at Delhi’s Tikri border (it opens into Bahadurgarh) – proceeded in trucks to Burari after they were allowed to stage demonstrations at the Sant Nirankari Ground, a larger group of agitators gathered at Singhu border (it opens into Sonepat) stayed put as it couldn’t build consensus on whether to accept the police’s offer or continue the march to the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Jantar Mantar, or some other venue close to the corridors of power.By Friday morning, thousands gathered in trucks, tractors and trailers as they set up tents and camps. The police, too, camped on the other side through the night as large cement slabs, mud-filled trucks, barricades, and barbed wires separated them.The stand-off at the Singhu border began around 8.30am, when a group of farmers tried to remove the barricades. The police responded by firing tear gas shells that appeared to temporarily contain the farmers. At around 9.30am, farmers at the Tikri border made a similar attempt. The police resorted to the use of water cannons and tear gas shells.A little before 2pm, farmers managed to remove the barbed wires and then used ropes to tie the cement barriers to pull them out of their way at the Singhu border. They then brought down the iron barricades and threatened to march into Delhi.The developments came a day after thousands of farmers from Punjab broke barricades and forced their way into Haryana, braving tear gas shells and water cannons on their way to Delhi, which prepared for a law-and-order challenge as well as traffic disruptions. The farmers threw several barricades from an overbridge into the Ghaggar river, facing tear gas shells by law enforcement personnel. Traffic was disrupted in many parts of Delhi on Friday. The Delhi Traffic Police posted a series of tweets, asking people to avoid outer Ring Road, Mukarba Chowk, GTK road, NH-44 and Singhu border in view of the march.Punjab farmers, representing over 30 farm bodies, previously announced they planned to go to Delhi through several routes – Lalru, Shambhu, Patiala-Pehowa, Patran-Khanauri, Moonak-Tohana, Ratia-Fatehabad and Talwandi-Sirsa. Tension remained high at all border points on Friday evening.As the issue snowballed on Friday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said no government in the world can stop farmers fighting the “battle of truth”. In a tweet in Hindi, Gandhi said the PM should remember that whenever arrogance takes on truth, it gets defeated. “The Modi government will have to agree to the demands of the farmers and take back the black laws. This is just the beginning!” he tweeted with the hashtag ‘IamWithFarmers’.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh welcomed the Union government’s decision to allow the farmers to enter Delhi to exercise their democratic right to protest. “They should also now initiate immediate talks to address farmers’ concerns on the #FarmLaws and resolve the simmering issue,” he said on Twitter.Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar was quoted by ANI as saying: “The government has always been ready to discuss issues with farmers. We have invited farmers’ organisations for another round of talks on December 3. I appeal to them to drop the agitation in view of Covid-19 and winter.” The scenes from both borders on Friday morning were of mayhem.At Singhu, a man climbed into a mud-laden truck – deployed by the police to keep farmers away – found the ignition key inside, and drove it into a water cannon parked nearby. As a group of policemen tried to stop him, he went on to ram a parked private bus and push it for nearly 100m before being apprehended. At another spot on the same border, a group of men climbed onto a tear gas machine vehicle and twisted the barrel to face the vehicle. The police responded by cane-charging them, firing several tear gas shells, and using water cannons on them. While some farmers crushed the shells with their feet, a few others wrapped them in cloth and hurled them back at the police.Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer north), said that the situation was in control. “We had to use some force to contain them, but the situation was in control the entire day,” said Sharma.The farmers were not keen on returning to their homes. “Some farmers have come from 400km away. We have dealt with the Haryana Police for long distances and covered roads dug out to keep us away. We are not going to back off at the last lap of our march,” said Saj Rinku, a farmer from Moga.“After discussion with farmer leaders, the protesting farmers have been permitted inside Delhi to hold peaceful protest at Nirankari Ground in Burari. The Delhi Police appeals to them to maintain peace,” said Eish Singhal, Delhi Police spokesperson.Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal said: “We have been allowed safe passage to Delhi.”Before being allowed through the Tikri border, farmers clashed with the police and tried to remove a truck, which was placed as a barricade, by tying it to a tractor with the help of a chain.At the Singhu border, the police said they couldn’t find the farmers’ group leaders to discuss the next course of action. The farmers said that they did not have consensus on whether or not to accept the Burari offer. “We have not come all the way from Punjab and Haryana to be sent to an empty ground far away from the centre of Delhi. We could as well have sat at our homes. We’ll either march up to the Rashtrapati Bhavan or somewhere closer, or continue our protest at this spot. Our leaders are talking among themselves to decide,” said Dalveer Singh, a farmer from Ludhiana.In Burari, farmers began gathering by Friday evening. The police and government agencies also began preparing the ground by bringing in mobile toilets, water tankers, tents. Hoshiyar Singh, a 65-year-old farmer from Ropar, Punjab, said they reached Nirankari Ground around 4pm. “We had been detained near Bangla sahib on Thursday night. Police later released us and we came here. Our other farmer friends are at Singhu Border and they plan to stay put until we get Ramlila Ground as the site to protest,” he said.RS Mani of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University said: “Farmers fear the reforms will disturb the minimum support price mechanism. Since the government sets MSPs, farmers are fair to demand actual realisation of those MSPs. But fears of any imminent threat to the MSP system seem exaggerated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/farmers-let-into-delhi-after-clashes-at-border/story-nKUU6pigcI4faslSzJsqoI.html
28-11-2020||Kolkata||Setback to TMC as leader quits cabinet||West Bengal transport minister and senior Trinamool Congress leader Suvendu Adhikari resigned from the state cabinet on Friday, dealing a blow to the Mamata Banerjee-led government in run-up to the assembly polls due in five months.Adhikari sent his resignation letter to Banerjee and emailed a copy to governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at 1.05pm, fanning speculation that he might quit the party and make his next political move. Adhikari, however, made no move till 8pm to indicate that he would step down as a legislator or leave the TMC. Senior party leaders maintained that Adhikari did not drop any hint that he might join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and efforts were on to reach out to him. BJP leaders did not claim that the 50-year-old legislator was ready to switch sides either.A senior TMC leader said on condition of anonymity that the differences between Adhikari and the party leadership widened after he wanted it to field candidates of his choice on 65 assembly seats spread across several districts. This was unacceptable to the leadership. While Adhikari avoided the media on Friday, Banerjee called a meeting of senior leaders in the evening and informed the governor that the resignation had been accepted and she would take charge of the three departments that he was looking after. Adhikari and his family have played a key role in the growth of the TMC in East Midnapore. The Kanthi and Tamluk Lok Sabha seats, most of the assembly segments comprising these and many local bodies, are controlled by the leader, his two brothers and their father, 78-year-old Lok Sabha member Sisir Adhikari.Adhikari, a legislator from Nandigram in East Midnapore, had resigned from the post of chairman of the Hooghly River Bridge Commission on Thursday. On Friday, he also resigned from the Haldia Development Authority of which he was the chairman. “I do hereby tender my resignation from my office as Minister. Steps may be taken for its immediate acceptance,” Adhikari wrote to Banerjee. “I still believe that he will not quit the party. He was aggrieved with certain decisions of the party. Quitting the cabinet was his personal decision. I don’t know why he took it. We will try to talk to him,” said TMC lok Sabha member Saugata Roy who had been holding talks with Adhikari over the past few days. The TMC suffered another blow on Friday evening when Mihir Goswami, the rebel legislator from the Cooch Behar South seat, joined the BJP in the presence national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya. Goswami resigned from the TMC a few hours before joining the Opposition camp. Senior TMC leaders told HT earlier this month that Adhikari was unhappy with organisational decisions taken by the CM’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor who was roped in after the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. On November 10, Adhikari threw a veiled challenge to the party while addressing a public rally in Nandigram. “Political observers are waiting for me to announce my political programme. They want to hear me talk about the roadblocks I am facing and the path I am going to take. I will not announce my political programme from this sacred platform. I will speak from a political platform,” he said at the rally. “The days of the Mamata Banerjee government are numbered. Adhikari has dealt a blow to the ruling party,” said Vijayvargiya. He refused to comment whether Adhikari was going to join his party. While joining the BJP, Goswami said, “I am happy to announce that today I am joining the BJP. I would like to call this a crusade against immoral and incorrect happenings in our state... My decision is driven by the corruption and reign of contract firms. We hope to see north Bengal rising again under the leadership of our beloved prime minister Narendra Modi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/setback-to-tmc-as-leader-quits-cabinet/story-N6aFYlpsyV7CpmdPBMtwfM.html
28-11-2020||Delhi||5,482 new cases, positivity rate below 9% for 3rd day in Delhi||On an average this month, the positivity rate recorded by rapid antigen tests was almost 17 percentage points lower compared to the more accurate RT-PCR test, according to data shared by health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday, as Delhi added fewer than 5,500 cases for the third straight day. Over 23% of the samples tested using molecular tests like RT-PCR, CBNAAT and TrueNat returned positive this month, as compared to 5.8% of those tested using the rapid antigen test. Although cheaper and faster, the rapid antigen test sensitivity can be as low as 50%, meaning it can throw up false negative reports for half of the patients who have the infection. The highest positivity rate this month – which is an average of both molecular and rapid antigen tests – was recorded on November 15 when 15.33% of the samples returned positive. This was then a 140-day high. The positivity rate crossed 15.2% on November 8 as well, as per data shared by the Delhi government. However, as per the data shared by the Delhi health minister, molecular tests recorded a positivity rate of 30% on November 7, reported in the health bulletin a day later. A positivity rate this high was seen in Delhi only during the surge in cases in June-July before the introduction of the rapid antigen tests. The highest positivity rate reported in the city was on June 13 when 36.9% samples had returned positive. Only 5,776 tests were conducted on the day in comparison to over 60,000 tests that are being conducted in the city at present. “From a positivity rate of 30% on RT-PCR tests on November 7, it has now come down to about 15%, almost half. The positivity rate on rapid antigen test has also gone down by a third,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Friday. Meanwhile, the total positivity rate in Delhi remained below 9% for the third straight day on Friday, as 5,482 samples tested positive, of the 64,455 tests conducted on the day.Delhi has consistently been adding fewer than the peak of above 7,000 fresh cases a day it saw during the second week of November.As per the Delhi health bulletin on Friday, 98 deaths were added to the city’s overall fatality count, taking the overall toll in the city to 8,909.“I do not think we can compare the positivity rates of the two tests as such, but the rapid antigen test is known to be only 50 to 60% sensitive even when the test is done properly. And if there is a 17% difference in the positivity rates of the two tests, it clearly shows we are missing out on diagnosing as many people through the less sensitive test. ,” said Dr Shobhaa Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/5-482-new-cases-positivity-rate-below-9-for-3rd-day/story-pscndX8N28iBUCUpauZKHN.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||BJP attacked my family... I’ve not stooped to their level, says Uddhav||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray completed a year in office as head of a Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Friday. It has been a torrid year, with political attacks by his former ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party, a health crisis in the form of Covid, which laid Maharashtra low, and poor relations with the Centre. On Friday Thackeray,  60, spoke to reporters on a range of issues. Edited excerpts: Let them keep predicting; they are busy and happy. I do not want to spoil that. The time in which we are running the government is different (because of the pandemic). The world has faced such a situation after a century. Whoever was running the government before did not face such difficulties. Even though the party or ideology of people running the government is important, it is the duty of the government either at the Centre or in the state to work impartially. From September, the Centre stopped the supply of things such as PPE kits and N-95 masks. This led to an increase in the state’s financial burden by around Rs 250-300 crore. Also, the GST and tax devolution dues of around Rs 38,000 crore are still pending with the Centre. We also did not receive any cooperation in handling natural calamities such as the Nisarga cyclone, the floods in Vidarbha, and incessant rainfall. We need a plan as there are five companies making vaccines. What temperature does it have to be stored at? How many doses are required? So far there is no clarity on anything. When GST came we raised some of the issues through BMC . Mumbai, for instance, has a special status in terms of the scale of tax it generates. Therefore Mumbai should get additional help to further develop the city. If there are any lacunae in GST, it should be fixed to make it a foolproof system. If this is not possible, then the old tax regime should be brought back. If by centralising something, justice is not given to all (states) then what is the point of doing it.During the budget session (in 2019), the Covid-19 started spreading in the state, so we had to curtail it (the session). While everything was shut, the Maharashtra government signed memorandums of understanding worth ₹50,000 crore. We have decided to target investment worth ₹1 lakh crore in one year. It is important to note that though the wheels [of economic activities] slowed down, they have not stopped. We will see the fruits of our efforts in the coming days.We started with a decision on developing Raigad district and allocated funds for this. Another big decision was a farm loan waiver up to ₹2 lakh crore. Whatever promises we made, we have nearly fulfilled all of them. The farm loan waiver was a big decision. We don’t make announcements of doubling and tripling farmers income or say acche din aayenge. Running government through remote control is a separate thing. Here three parties are there and the government runs by a coalition. Such discussions are pointless. I do not want to waste time on such topics. We had requested him to do it at the earliest. Like reopening of temples (the Governor had written to Thackeray on this) we expect him to take fast decisions on these matters related to democracy as well. No, that is never my intention. I work passionately and speak on issues passionately. I never make personal attacks or speak with malicious intent. Like they have attacked my family with vengeance… When we were with them we were good to them, we used to campaign for them without which their ballot boxes would not fill up. Now see the manner in which they are attacking our family and perverted tendency of their politics. I have not stooped to their level and attacked them. That time you (Fadnavis) did not see brother’s janam kundali? Now you realised it? We have your kundalis as well.Firstly, using the word inflated bill is incorrect because during lockdown [physical] metre readings were not done. Average bill of three months was sent to consumers. Everybody thought that the average bill that came was high, including me. I want to say here that there was no increase in tariff. Wherever there are complaints, it is being checked and I am told that once the metres are checked people do understand that this is an average bill as per their [past] usage. Even then, if people have complaints, they are being attended to. Do not mislead people with the use of the word ‘inflated’. The pending recoveries are worth ₹60,000 crore. We are not getting much help from the Centre, our dues are not coming from the Centre, and we are facing a financial crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-attacked-my-family-i-ve-not-stooped-to-their-level-says-uddhav/story-h8ga60cwuZAlKaJmzhTLoN.html

28-11-2020||Gurugram||Woman kills 4 daughters, attempts suicide||A 35-year-old woman, apparently suffering from depression for over six months because of fights with her husband because the couple did not have any male children, allegedly slit the throats of her four daughters with a kitchen knife on Thursday night, and later attempted suicide, the police said. Police in Nuh (about 40km from Gurugram) said they received a call from the woman’s husband on Friday morning, informing them about the murders of his daughters,who were between six months and eight years old. The woman was found unconscious in the house, police said. She is in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital in Nalhar, where a police team has been deployed to record her statement once she is in the condition to give one. A case under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the woman at the Punhana police station.HT is not naming the accused or giving exact locations because the crime could be linked to mental illness.Vivek Choudhary, deputy superintendent of police (Punhana), said that the husband was away on Thursday night on a condolence visit because a family in the vicinity had lost three members in a road accident. “He returned at around 3am on Friday, and knocked the door. When his wife did not open it for a while, he tried to prise open a window. He saw two of his daughters lying in a pool of blood on a bed in one of the rooms,” he said. Choudhary added that once the husband raised the alarm, relatives and neighbours broke down the door. They found the bodies of two other daughters on another bed in the hall, and the woman lying in her bedroom. All the girls had injury marks on their necks. There were two injury marks on the woman’s neck. She allegedly attacked herself with a kitchen knife after she killed her daughters.The neighbours found that was no entry from outside, and the main gate and the room was locked from inside, so they did not suspect role of any outsider,” the DSP said. The husband told the police on Friday that his wife was depressed because they did not have a male child. The two were married since 2012. Police said the woman had another daughter from and earlier marriage -- the girl lives with her father and the woman wanted to bring her to live with her family, but the husband did not allow it. Some neighbours, however, told the police that the couple often fought, and the husband blamed his wife for not delivering a son. “She was under tremendous pressure to produce a son,” a neighbour told HT on condition of anonymity. The husband denied allegations that he wanted a male child, and said that he was attached to all his daughters and loved them dearlyDSP Choudhary said the bodies of girls were handed over to the father after the post-mortem examination. The doctors confirmed that their throats were slit, and they died due to excessive bleeding. “We are conducting investigation and a team of forensic experts was called to the spot. Fingerprints and other samples were collected by them. We haven’t given a clean shot to the husband yet, and he is under the scanner,” Choudhary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/woman-kills-4-daughters-attempts-suicide/story-bbLpbmQSDeSiucwKgl0juJ.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||PMLA court sends Cox and Kings Group promoter to ED custody till December 3 in money laundering case||The special court set up to try cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) has remanded Ajay Ajit Peter Kerkar, the promoter of global tours and travel company Cox and Kings Group (CKG), to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) custody till December 3 on Friday, a day after he was arrested. The role of Kerkar and his company emerged when the central agency was probing the alleged financial irregularities and money laundering linked to the Yes Bank fraud case. The ED, which arrested Yes Bank’s founder Rana Kapoor in March, has been scanning the transactions made by the bank to its borrowers.Kerkar has previously denied all the allegations against him. According to ED, its preliminary investigations had revealed that Cox and Kings Group had defaulted Rs3,642-crore loans taken from Yes Bank. The loans sanctioned from Yes Bank were driven by Kapoor after bypassing the norms, the ED had alleged. In June, ED officers had raided five premises belonging to the senior management of the Cox and Kings Group, and last month, the agency had arrested the travel company’s chief financial officer Anil Khandelwal and internal auditor Naresh Jain. While seeking Kerkar’s custody, public prosecutor Sunil Gonsalves argued that the loans given by Yes Bank to the Cox and Kings Group were diverted by Khandelwal and Jain in connivance with Kerkar. “Funds were diverted to a firm named Ezeego, which is another entity of the Cox and Kings Group. The depositors’ money, which went to Ezeego through Cox and Kings, and from there to the group’s other entities Redkite and Promytheone, were further diverted to various overseas accounts. The balance sheets were manipulated to avail more loans from two more banks,” argued Gonsalves. He had contended that ED had to ascertain for whom the funds were diverted, as the Cox and Kings Group had 30 subsidiary companies and for this, it needed Kerkar’s custody. The defence advocate has opposed ED’s request on the grounds that a case has been registered by Kerkar against Khandelwal and Jain at Nagpada police station on the charges of money laundering. The advocate argued that the custody of the accused with the ED was not essential as Kerkar has been falsely arraigned in the case. However, the ED said that Kerkar had lodged complaints against Khandelwal, Jain and others with an ulterior motive to camouflage his role in the case. Investigations have pointed out that Kerkar was the mastermind behind siphoning off the proceeds of crime and hence an additional Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) was registered on November 23 against him. After hearing both the sides, the court felt that the alleged irregularities need to be investigated for which Kerkar’s custodial interrogation is needed and remanded him in ED’s custody for six days. Meanwhile, in a related development, the economic offences wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police registered the fifth first information report (FIR) against Cox and Kings Group for allegedly cheating HDFC Bank of Rs50.71 crore. The banking (fraud) unit-2 of EOW booked Kerkar, along with Urrshila Kerkar (who is also a promoter of the travel firm), directors, auditors and others executives of Cox and Kings Group on the complaint of Rajit Matloob Quereshi, an authorised representative of HDFC Bank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmla-court-sends-cox-and-kings-group-promoter-to-ed-custody-till-december-3-in-money-laundering-case/story-PCS1s17LMdHjcoT1AelCbM.html

28-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC extends licence fee waiver, parking contractors to continue||With the municipal corporation extending partial waiver of licence fee owed by parking contractors for three more months, they will continue to manage the parking lots in the city. Expressing their inability to clear dues piling up since September, the contractors had threatened to withdraw their services if MC didn’t give them relief. There are two paid parking contractors that manage 89 parking lots in the city.Succumbing to the contractors’ threat, at its General House meeting on Friday, the civic body decided to allow partial waiver of licence fee – ranging from 45% to 65% - for September, October and November. Thereon, MC will charge the full fee from December.“In case they decide to withdraw their services hereon, the exemption allowed would stand cancelled,” said MC commissioner KK Yadav. Vikas Pandey, manager, Pashchatya Entertainment Pvt Ltd, parking contractor for Zone 2, said, “With the MC relief in place, we will continue with the parking contract. But, we are awaiting a formal communication in the matter.”Relaxations in the pastIn the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown, MC had already given a complete licence fee waiver for April and May. Thereafter, contractors were allowed to deposit 35% to 45% of the licence fee for June 1 to August 31.Notably, in the last General House meeting, the members had decided not to give any more relaxations from September. They had contended that financial activity in the city had picked up, since markets and offices had been allowed to open. Contractors yet to offer smart facilities Even though the House on October 29 had directed the contractors to introduce smart features within 30 days, the contractors haven’t provided these yet. The hiked parking charges are contingent upon contractors offering smart features. Pandey said, “Certain features can only be offered through the use of Chinese products, which we want to avoid. But, we are trying to start these as soon as possible.” After the new rates kick in, parking fee for the first four hours will remain the same as the flat rates charged right now: Rs 5 for two-wheelers and Rs 10 for four-wheelers.Thereafter, these will be doubled. The charges will further be doubled if vehicles are kept parked beyond 12 hours. However, there will be free entry for pick and drop in the first 10 minutes.Illegal water connections at villages, colonies to be regularisedThe MC House also approved the regularisation of illegal water connections in all colonies and villages, including 13 villages transferred to the civic body. The consumer will have to deposit one-time charges within 90 days. A rebate of 10% will be allowed if deposited within this period, failing which a penalty of 15% will be charged up to the date of regularisation. The rate of regularisation for domestic connections ranges between Rs 50 and Rs 200 per month and for non-domestic connections, from Rs 400 to Rs 800 per month. For the water connections outside the village lal dora, the mayor was authorised by the House to constitute a committee to examine the issue and give recommendations thereon. When the House was taking up the issue of allowing water connections outside the lal dora, the Congress councillors rushed to the well of the House with placards. They demanded that the use of smart watches be stopped, water tariff be reduced and outsourced employees be regularised. Rehab colonies: MC mulls regularisation of building violations MC decided against issuing any notices for existing building violations at rehabilitation colonies, and to constitute a committee to prepare a one-time regularisation policy for large-scale violations. Various rehabilitation colonies in Vikas Nagar, Mauli Jagran, and Sectors 52 and 53 house around 4,300 allottees, who stand to gain from MC’s decision. The corporation also decided that any new violations hereafter will invite action. MC commissioner KK Yadav directed the officials concerned to rein in any new violations at these colonies. As per the MC General House resolution, the mayor has been authorised to constitute a committee, comprising a councillor and MC officials, which will examine all cases of the violations of the buildings bylaws, and terms and conditions. It will then recommend a one-time policy, including rates therein for regularising these violations. In violation of allotment terms, 90% of the licencees have sold out the transit sites on general power of attorney. There are also rampant violations of the building bylaws in the shape of construction of unauthorised cantilevers, toilets, additional storeys and rooms. Under “Licensing of Tenements and Sites and Services in Chandigarh” rehabilitation scheme, transit sites in Vikas Nagar, Mauli Jagran, and Sectors 52 and 53 were allotted in 1998 by the UT estate office to residents of various slums. In 1995, the work of rehabilitation of colonies was transferred to MC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-extends-licence-fee-waiver-parking-contractors-to-continue/story-9lkzCIrdXIX2lHkB0z91wK.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid cases rise, no tests yet at Thane entry points||Like the twin cities of Kalyan-Dombivli, Thane city, too, has seen a gradual increase in the number of Covid-19 cases since the start of the week. Though the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has claimed to be ready for the second wave, no arrangements have been made yet at the city’s entry and exit to test people travelling by road from Rajasthan, Gujarat and Goa.As per the state guidelines, travellers from these three states need to be screened at the railway stations, bus stops and city entry points. The corporation, though, has been testing outstation passengers at railway stations for more than two months, there is no system yet in place to test those travelling by road.An officer from TMC requesting anonymity said, “We have been testing all the outstation passengers at Thane station for the last couple of months. The details and symptoms, if any, of the passengers are noted. Even if their test result is negative, our team keeps a tab on those passengers with symptoms after a few days. We have set up testing counters in both east and west sides of the Thane station so that no passenger leaves the station without being tested.” The testing at the city’s entry points was done earlier when the cases were high. The corporation is now formulating a system for the same. TMC will not be testing at city entry points as of now. Dr Raju Murudkar, medical health officer, TMC, said, “We have taken a decision to not have testing at city entry points as of now. The situation is well under control and doing this would just add to the pressure. It will also increase traffic at these points on a daily basis as we will have to make provisions for ambulances to park here as well. Instead, we have asked all assistant municipal commissioners to be alert and identify travellers and regular commuters within their wards.”On the other hand, the corporation had initiated testing centres during the night at railway stations. However, hardly 0.4 per cent tested positive throughout November. Covid testing at night began on November 1 at Thane railway station. Till now, around 8,275 antigen tests have been conducted, out of which 33 tested positive.“The possibility of passengers arriving at night getting infected and being the cause for the virus to spread led us to conduct testing at night as well. However, hardly 0.4 per cent has turned positive throughout the month during testing at night. This clearly shows that the situation is under control in the city,” said Sandeep Malvi, TMC deputy civic chief.Meanwhile, Thane city has a total of 50,545 cases while the death toll has reached 1,183. Currently, there are 1,588 active cases in the city and the doubling days are at 244.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-cases-rise-no-tests-yet-at-thane-entry-points/story-fPMv8mYcU1MQjnz25UCKQK.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||Central Railway approves new plan for stalled Palava Jn flyover work||The work of Palava Junction flyover, which was stalled, received a push after the Central Railway (CR) approved its revised plan on Friday.The junction, which falls on the Kalyan-Shilphata stretch, is one of the vital links of the stretch. Heavy congestion is regularly reported at the junction. This flyover from Desai creek to Katai toll naka will ease the congestion in future.Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde assured that the work of the flyover will resume in a month.“This is the final plan for the project, which has been approved by the railway. Now, the work can be resumed and completed without hurdle. This approval was one of the crucial stages of the project,” said Shinde.The work of the flyover was initiated in December 2018. However, it was later stalled due to the awaited Dedicated Freight Corridor project that will pass the flyover from below. The authority building the corridor had approached the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), asking to leave space for the corridor.“Due to this demand, the plan of the flyover had to be changed. The revised plan had to be sent to railway for approval,” added Shinde.The flyover has 45 foundations, out of which the work of 37 foundations is completed. Out of the 45 pillars required for the flyover, 12 are ready.Last year, a 20-year-old national-level carrom player Jhanvi More, died after she was run over by a tanker while crossing the junction. Following this incident, a need for the flyover was highlighted by the residents as the junction has several commuter crossings. The junction is located near the Palava City, a housing complex with thousands of residents.The flyover, once built, will ease congestion on the road below, thus allowing pedestrians to cross the road safely.Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer of CR, confirmed the development on the project. He said, “The new plan for the flyover is approved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/central-railway-approves-new-plan-for-stalled-palava-jn-flyover-work/story-58SI5BNAp4TMgdqSwEIO2J.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||2022 mini-Assembly polls in Maharashtra: Real test for Shiv Sena||After parting ways with ally Bharatiya Janata Party, the Shiv Sena rode to power in Maharashtra on the back of an alliance with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). Although Shiv Sena leaders maintain that it has not abandoned Hindutva, the stance of the party has softened over the year since it came to power. The 180-degree turn to forge an alliance with the two parties it fought against for decades will prove to be a major roadblock in growth or a gamble that will pay off in time? The Shiv Sena will get an answer to this question in less than two years as 10 civic bodies, including Mumbai, and zilla parishad (district councils) in 27 districts go to polls in what are described as mini-Assembly polls. Party makeover The Shiv Sena, under the leadership of Uddhav Thackeray, has deviated from his father Bal Thackeray’s style of politics. Uddhav wants the party to be a moderate version of what it was and reach people across the state, going beyond its traditional strongholds. He also decided to head the government when he got the opportunity. Political analysts point out that this shift in thinking in the party, coupled with the anger of being ditched by the BJP on CM’s post, brought about this new political dynamic in Maharashtra. Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said, “The political makeover is crucial for its future. The old character of the Sena, which was parochial and aggressive, is gone now. However, the Sena will not disown its Marathi identity and Hindutva ideology. With regards to Hindutva, Sena’s Hindutva’s was always different from BJP’s; even Balasaheb [Thackeray] acknowledged it in his later days.” The Sena has faced criticism from various quarters on aligning with Congress-NCP for the sake of power. The Sena intends to keep Hindutva identity intact, but the BJP, which has a far more reach across the country, has been able to use the Hindutva plank far better, say experts. Political gain For the Shiv Sena to gain politically, observers said it will have to stick with the NCP and Congress to beat the BJP. Sanjay Raut, Sena leader and an architect of the three-party alliance, has stressed the long-term intention of the party, with his remarks that the MVA will remain together not for the next five years, but 25 years. Jondhale added that the Thackeray government will have to resolve the socio-economic issues, including those of farmers, related to caste, employment, and infrastructure and industrial development in the state, if they want people to look beyond the ideology. Pratap Asbe, another political analyst, said, “As long as the MVA allies are together, they can counter the BJP. But they will have to stay together in local self-government polls. The key issue which could emerge in ZP elections is seat-sharing. If they remain together, they will win or else the BJP will gain to some extent.” There could be a triangular contest between the Congress, BJP and Sena to wrest control of the Aurangabad civic body, which is now controlled by the Sena. Last month, Congress minister Amit Deshmukh said the Congress had always gone solo in local polls and this year too workers want to go solo. However, Jondhale doesn’t see fissures appearing in MVA, even if the Congress goes solo in local polls. “The Congress has a grassroot network across districts. The trio will remain together till the next Assembly election. The glue of political power is very strong,” he said. “If the government succeeds in solving socio-economic problems, it will guarantee power. Uddhav Thackeray has won the goodwill of the people. Post-pandemic, he will have to start delivering on promises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2022-mini-assembly-polls-in-maharashtra-real-test-for-shiv-sena/story-rN8b3fiwOJ35TrwlisKlWK.html
28-11-2020||City||Covid’s second wave: Experts convene meeting to deliberate countering measures||Deliberations were held on countering the possible second wave of Covid-19 in Punjab and discuss management strategies with state’s top doctors and bureaucrats from private and government institutions. Dr KK Talwar, adviser, health and medical education and research; Husan Lal, principal secretary, health; DK Tiwari, principal secretary, medical education and research; Tanu Kashyap, MD, PHSC; Dr GD Puri, dean, PGIMER; Dr Kamal Kajal, associate professor, PGIMER; Girish Dayalan, Mohali DC, and Aashika Jain, IAS, were among those present. Dr Talwar appreciated the quality healthcare services being provided in Mohali which drew patients from Panchkula, Chandigarh and Himachal to seek treatment at Mohali health facilities. The seamless co-ordination between government and private hospitals under direct supervision of Mohali DC was also lauded. Increasing sampling and arrangement of adequate bed capacity was stressed upon. Reducing case fatality rate (CFR) was deliberated upon at length. The doctors also shared practical tips and best medical practices which would be helpful for all hospitals in reducing death rate. L1 facilities have been discontinued statewide considering low occupancy rates. It was decided that home isolation for asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic patients will be promoted. Home isolation kits are to be distributed among the needy patients. In order to help the patients recover quickly and strengthen their immunity, post-Covid care kits have also been prepared by the state government which are to be distributed generously. Private hospitals were requested to initiate home counselling services for patients under home isolation. An appeal was also made to them to charge genuinely. All private hospitals have been asked to fill ventilator support proforma and infrastructure availability performa so that the expert committee could analyse the same and help them in every way possible. It was informed that the health institutions should fill death audit forms so that the experts may have a fair analysis of deaths taking place in Punjab and tackle CFR. All hospitals were suggested to attend the weekly live sessions conducted by Dr KK Talwar and other experts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-s-second-wave-experts-convene-meeting-to-deliberate-countering-measures/story-n07q5xngR6zAnnGi2HFiGL.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||Inter-state vehicle theft racket busted in Navi Mumbai, five arrested||In a case similar to what you see in movies, the Navi Mumbai crime branch busted an inter-state gang that duped people by offering to rent their vehicles to corporate houses and hotels.The police went undercover as tenants and waiters in different housing societies and hotels to trap the gang members. The gang opened bogus companies, took possession of the vehicles along with their documents and later shut shop and sold the vehicles in Gujarat.Vehicles worth ₹2.2Cr have been seized and five persons including the prime accused have been arrested in the case.The central unit of the crime branch has recovered 20 vehicles worth ₹1.21Cr while nine vehicles worth ₹81L have been seized by Gujarat police as they had been used in various crimes.Navi Mumbai police commissioner, Bipin Kumar Singh, said, “The gang members would open an office and appoint 4-5 unsuspecting employees. One of the accused, Ayan alias Rahul alias Anthony Paul Chettiar, a hotel management diploma holder, would then go to another state and search on social media apps for people wanting to rent their vehicles. He would call them and discuss the rental offer and send them to the bogus company office.”The other two accused, drive Satya Prakash Verma alias Babu, 30, a Virar resident and Ashish Pujari, 32, a graduate from Palghar, would sign the contract with the client and take possession of their vehicles and original documents. They would then start giving them monthly rent.Singh added, “Unknown to the owner, the vehicle would be immediately sent to their accomplices in Gujarat, where they would be sold in 3-4 days at throwaway price. With the money accrued, they would pay the rent of the vehicle for 2-3 months and win the confidence of the customers, thereby dragging more people in the net. They would then suddenly close their office, switch off their mobile phones and vanish.”Following a similar incident in Nerul this year, the case was entrusted to the crime branch. The gang members regularly changed their numbers and locations to evade arrest. Singh said, “The crime branch learnt that Babu was residing in Bhoisar with his wife. On making inquiries, the team learnt that his wife was alone at home. A police squad then rented a flat in the same building and kept a watch on him for a week. After a week, Babu returned home and was immediately nabbed by the police. On interrogation, he confessed to his involvement in the crime and also revealed the whereabouts of his accomplices. He was arrested on November 6.”Babu revealed that accused Ashish and Ayan were in Bangalore. A team led by Gajjal immediately left for the city.They learnt that they were staying in a hotel. “One of our constables dressed up as a waiter and worked in the hotel. When the accused came to their hotel room, he alerted the team and the duo was nabbed on November 7,” the commissioner said.Based on further investigations, the crime branch then arrested Mohammed Wasim Shaikh, 33 and Javed Shaikh alias Mama, 46, both from Gujarat, on November 19. Police learnt that the vehicles had been sold in Surat, Ahmedabad, Vapi, Daman, Valsad areas. The gang had opened offices at Nerul, Marol – Andheri and Yerwada in Pune.Singh, said, “The prime accused, Ayan, used a Dubai SIM card to mislead the investigating agencies. He would be in Bangalore and make WhatsApp calls and had managed to evade arrest so far.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/inter-state-vehicle-theft-racket-busted-in-navi-mumbai-five-arrested/story-z7dvAoKZAJs8X9egMF1pBM.html
28-11-2020||Chandigarh||Opposition insists on winter session, Himachal cabinet to take final call||After leaders failed to arrive at a consensus on whether the state assembly’s winter session should be deferred in view of the pandemic at the all-party meet on Friday, the Himachal Cabinet will take a final call on the matter next week. Opposition leaders, primarily the Congress and CPI (M), were in favour of going ahead with the assembly. Leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri said, “The Opposition feels there is no reason to defer the session. The decision to hold the session from December 7 to 11 has already been taken by the Cabinet and has been approved by the governor. Many issues need to be discussed urgently. Around 400 questions have already been listed.” The meeting was presided over by parliamentary affairs minister Suresh Bhardwaj. “Traditionally the winter session of the state assembly is held in December. However, given the spike in Covid cases, many legislators had suggested deferring the session and the issue was also discussed informally in the cabinet. The Opposition is of the view that the session should be held and I will inform the chief minister about the same. The final decision will be taken by the Cabinet,’ he said. It is possible that if the winter session is convened it may be held in Shimla instead of Dharamshala, as customary, given the situation. Bhardwaj said the Cabinet will also take a call on the venue of the session, in case it is held.” Agnihotri said, “Earlier, it was being speculated that the winter session may be deferred till March 18, which would make it the budget session. The session is to be called within six months but there is no other possibility as the code of conduct for panchayat polls will come into force around December 15.” “When elections are being held in the country there is no reason that the assembly should not be convened. We recently wrapped up polls in Bihar and panchayat polls are about to begin in Jammu and Kashmir,” he said, adding that marriages and other social gatherings were also going ahead as planned amid the pandemic. Covid will be one of the main issues that will be discussed, along with hike in electricity tariffs, bus fares, national highways, and expansion of railway lines, said the leader of Opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/opposition-insists-on-winter-session-himachal-cabinet-to-take-final-call/story-phRMgiD8YO5bwIIKmisjQL.html

A bomb squad was called in to detect the source of explosion.The explosion took place at 8.30am. Neighbours heard the explosion and informed the fire brigade. The fire brigade, along with Regional Disaster Management Cell (RDMC) and bomb detection squad, reached the spot.The impact of the blast was so huge that the walls and windows of the flat collapsed. The door was broken along with its frame. The window grills, too, were unhinged while the electronic equipments like computers and music system were damaged, informed Santosh Kadam, chief of RDMC, Thane.Kadam said, “The bomb squad found that the cause of explosion was the leakage in hose pipe of the gas cylinders in the office. The pipe was ruptured and due to the pressure, the explosion took place. The room was completely closed with no ventilation, thus leading to heavy damage.”Rabodi police station senior police inspector, R Shirtode, said, “We conducted an examination of the room with the help of a dog squad and did not find anything suspicious in the explosion. It is confirmed that it was due to gas leak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/explosion-from-gas-leak-in-vacant-thane-flat-causes-panic/story-fnOwRDymSzQ7hBs3bWddKN.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli civic bodies reduce rentals by 75% for theatre||After Thane, the municipal corporations of Kalyan and Navi Mumbai have now reduced rentals of the play theatres in the city by 75 per cent to give a boost to the theatre industry.The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has announced a cut in charges by three-fourths for booking the civic body’s Vishnudas Bhave auditorium in Vashi for plays. The auditorium is the biggest and the most popular in the city.The decision came after a meeting popular between Marathi actor and producer Prashant Damle, on behalf of Jagtik Marathi Natyadharmi Nirmata Sangh, and NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar. He had sought reduction in the auditorium charges to provide relief to the theatre industry.The reduction in charges has been ordered for the period of next six months i.e. till May 31, 2021 or till the 50 per cent capacity norm is in force, whichever is earlier. It will be applicable to Marathi theatre-related programmes. Bangar said, “The Covid pandemic has affected all industries including theatre. It is an important part of Maharashtra culture. Hence, we have decided to give it a boost by charging just 25 per cent of the regular rates for booking.” The state government has allowed auditoriums to open with 50 per cent capacity. Obviously, it will be difficult for the organisers to match the revenue with the costs due to reduced patrons and increasing the ticket rates is also not feasible at present The Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has also decided to reopen its two auditoriums with an exemption of 75 per cent on its basic rent for those organisers charging ₹300 per ticket. Those charging more than ₹400 per ticket won’t be given a discount. The Acharya Atre auditorium in Kalyan and Savitribai Phule auditorium in Dombivli have been shut since March 23 in the wake of the pandemic. “The organisers will have to follow all the social-distancing norms while they organise a programme,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner, KDMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/navi-mumbai-kalyan-dombivli-civic-bodies-reduce-rentals-by-75-for-theatre/story-NqyXLObnhSYSC9wnuD771O.html
28-11-2020||Chandigarh||Former Himachal CM Shanta Kumar supports ‘one nation, one election’||Veteran BJP leader Shanta Kumar on Friday said the Prime Minister’s call for ‘One nation, one election’ needed to be urgently implemented in order to save public money. “The Prime Minister’s suggestion will help save public money as Lok Sabha and Assembly polls will be held together. Under the present system, the country is always in the middle of some election. This slows the pace of development. Bihar elections ended recently and now West Bengal assembly polls are round the corner,” he said. The two-time Himachal chief minister said, “India is at the top of Global Hunger Index. In a country where 16-crore people sleep on an empty stomach, spending such a huge amount on elections should be considered a crime.”He said the issue was also raised when Atal Behari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister. “The only objection that was raised was what should be done in case a government is brought down with the help of a no-confidence motion.” Former vice-president Bhairon Singh Shekhawat had suggested that whoever brings the no-confidence motion should also move a motion to form alternative government.“He suggested that if the no-confidence passes the floor test and motion for alternative government is defeated the assembly should be dissolved for the remaining time and President’s Rule should be implemented,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/former-himachal-cm-shanta-kumar-supports-one-nation-one-election/story-tluQj6DLErVp6OUE59g56L.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||Hema Upadhyay murder: Court in Mumbai issues warrant against father of accused||The sessions court on Friday issued a bailable warrant to Ramadhar Sukhai Rajbhar, father of Vijay Rajbhar, one of the accused in Hema Upadhyay murder case, for not producing the tempo used in the crime before the court. “We sought warrant as Vijay’s father Ramadhar failed to appear before the court and also did not make any submission about production of the tempo or its photograph before the court,” said special public prosecutor Vaibhav Baghade. Hema and her lawyer Haresh Bhambani were allegedly smothered with a chloroform-laced cloth at Vidhyadhar Rajbhar’s warehouse on December 11, 2015. The killers packed the bodies in cardboard boxes and dumped them in a Kandivli sewer. The prosecution alleged that the Vijay’s tempo was used for taking dead bodies. The police, during investigation, seized the tempo in front of the independent witnesses. After the investigation on October 21, 2016, Rajbhar was allowed to take custody of his son’s tempo. The court had, however, imposed strict conditions wherein Rajbhar was asked to execute indemnity bond of ₹5 lakh. The court also said, “He [Rajbhar] shall not transfer, or create third-party interest over the above referred tempo and shall produce the same as and when required by this court or the police station concerned.” The prosecution is examining independent witness before whom the tempo was seized. During recording of evidence, the court asked that the tempo be produced for identification and summons were issued to Rajbhar. He, however, informed the court that Vijay’s wife had sold the tempo. In view of this, the court asked Rajbhar and prosecution to obtain photographs of the tempo. The prosecution, on Friday, informed the court that no photographs of the tempo were taken. Meanwhile, Rajbhar remained absent from court on Friday. Hence, the warrant was issued by the court on the request of the special public prosecutor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hema-upadhyay-murder-court-in-mumbai-issues-warrant-against-father-of-accused/story-Py67JCIGKYGx8SOVr0y8uN.html

In a statement, Rathore said the anti-farmer policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have forced the farmers to raise their voice. “Farmers who serve the nation by providing food have now become the victim of these oppressive and anti-farmer polices of the government who are trying to enslave them by implementing such laws,” he said.He said the farmers are worried about their future and their concerns are completely reasonable. “Farmers as well as people of this country have the statutory right to speak up and agitate against any decision of the government,” Rathore said, adding that this agitation will be the reason for downfall of the egoistic and authoritarian government at the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/legal-rights-of-farmers-are-being-violated-by-bjp-himachal-congress-chief/story-VJ2uuOPKopwdJgjTtacPCN.html

On November 9, the GMCH-32 had implemented Time Bound Designation (Up-gradation) Scheme, 2020, under which an assistant professor is eligible for designation as an associate professor after five years of regular service as an assistant professor and an associate professor is eligible for designation as a professor after four years of regular service through Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) or designated associate professor under the TBDS. However, the designated associate professors under TBDS would be considered for designation as professors only after the regular associate professor through UPSC is designated as professor under TBDS in the same department. The faculty welfare body and doctors who have been promoted under the said scheme have said that they support TBDS completely. “The faculty welfare body wishes to state that due to some vested interest of very few faculty members, rumours are being propagated everyday. The TBDS is for the benefit of entire faculty of GMCH, as many members are facing stagnation for more than 10-15 years,” the faculty body said in a release. It further added that the association would like to state that TBDS has been promoted by the ministry of health for all medical colleges in the country where time-bound promotion is not included in the recruitment rules. It does not affect the seniority of any faculty member selected through UPSC, it said. However, the opposing doctors, mostly appointed through the UPSC, have made representations to the hospital as well as the UT administration stating that super-confidentially and retrospectively implementing TBDS 2020 which is based exclusively on four-member committee’s recommendations contravenes the principle of natural justice. “Redesignating faculty from 2008 along with the grant of experience (amounting to promotion) without any criteria (APAR/research publications/interviews) makes merit a casualty which will have far-reaching implications,” another group of doctors in a representation has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/new-promotion-scheme-fissures-begin-to-appear-among-gmch-32-faculty-members/story-zNulqyUeyIfGF3mOuWequI.html

28-11-2020||Chandigarh||No provision to create separate Covid wards for VIP’s in HP: Health secretary||The health department on Friday ruled out any possibilities of setting up separate wards for Covid-19 infected VIP’s in Himachal Pradesh.“No provisions to create separate wards for VIP’s can be made. Everyone will have to avail the same facilities,” health secretary Amitabh Awasthi said while replying to media queries on the demand for setting up VIP wards in Covid care centres in the state. “No one in this pandemic can be treated separately,” he added. Awasthi, who faced a volley of questions about the mismanagement in the hospitals and Covid centres in Himachal, admitted to certain lapses but simultaneously gave assurances on improving infrastructure for battling the disease. He said there was no dearth of oxygen in hospitals.He cautioned that the next three weeks are crucial as there has been a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases in the state and the situation was similar in other north Indian states including Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Chandigarh. He said social gatherings, marriages and political functions after the ‘Unlock’ led to a surge in infections. “The cabinet had discussed about the Covid situation in detail and all ministers were of the view that political rallies will not benefit anyone,” he said.Awasthi said makeshift hospitals in Shimla, Mandi and Nalagarh will be readied within next 15 days. “ We have adequate infrastructure and facilities in the state to treat patients,” he said, adding that civil hospitals in Rohru and Rampur have now been upgraded as Covid Care Hospitals. “It was done so that patients from far flung areas could easily reach these nearby hospitals instead of travelling to Shimla. The government also warned of action against the doctors, paramedics and medics on non-covid duties who were reluctant to treat patients with other diseases. The doctors found negligent of their duty will not be spared and strict punitive action will be taken against them,” Awasthi said amid reports that non covid patients are being sent back without diagnosis from Indira Gandhi Medical Hospital and Deen Dayal Hospital. He said 30 more ambulances have been added from the districts to supplement the emergency services. Besides, instructions have been given to district administrations to hire four wheel drive ambulance in snowbound areas including Shimla, Rohru, Rampur, Kullu, Lahaul & Spiti and Kinnaur districts. “Any complaints about 108 ambulance provider regarding poor response will be dealt strictly,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-provision-to-create-separate-covid-wards-for-vip-s-in-hp-health-secretary/story-ri7X9NT4QR3pXxHMCFnI1K.html

Also present on the occasion were MC joint secretary Kinnu Thind; chief engineer, local government, Mukesh Garg and Kuljit Singh Bedi. As per the agreement of 2017, it was decided that GMADA will pay ₹50 crore every year for the maintenance of parks, but in the past three years, the area development authority only paid ₹9 crore. Sidhu apprised housing and urban development minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, principal secretary, housing and urban development, Sarvjit Singh and GMADA chief administrator Pradeep Kumar Agarwal, of the allotment of funds by GMADA to the MC. The minister said that ₹86.37 crore would be spent on development works in various housing societies, upgrading markets, augmentation of main sewer line under AMRUT scheme, installation of 50 open-gym equipment, construction of playground for children, laying of paver blocks, construction of community centre at Phase 3B1, and buying a new tree pruning machine among others.

28-11-2020||Mumbai||Will bring in ₹1lakh-crore investment in a year: Maharashtra CM||On the eve of the first anniversary of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of the Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in an interview to Hindustan Times on Friday, looked back at his year in office, speaking on varied topics, including his target to attract businesses, the Centre-state relationship and the future of the allies. He also targeted his former ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), over the vindictive politics over the past few months. Edited excerpts: The Opposition has been predicting that your government will collapse any time, but you completed a year. How do you see your tenure as the CM? Let them keep predicting, they are busy and happy doing it. I do not want to spoil that. The time during which we are running the government is different (referring to the Covid-19 pandemic). The world has faced such a situation after a century. Whoever was running the government so far hadn’t faced such a difficulty. You can understand the challenges. You have to see how we are trying to handle the situation. I am coming in front of people and telling them what to do. I am satisfied that the people of Maharashtra consider me a part of their family. We have some goals, which will be completed in the next few years. Do you think the state has got as much co-operation as you would like from the Centre in dealing with the pandemic and otherwise? Even though the party or ideology of people running the government is important, it is the duty of the government either at the Centre or in the state to work impartially without any discrimination. From September, the Centre stopped the supply of things such as PPE kits and N95 masks. It led to an increase in the state’s financial burden by ₹250-300 crore. Also, the GST and tax devolution dues of ₹38,000 crore are still pending with the Centre. Besides, we did not receive expected cooperation in handling natural calamities such as cyclone Nisarg, floods in Vidarbha and incessant rainfall in western Maharashtra and Marathwada. In some cases, the Central teams have not come to assess the damages despite our requests. If the teams have not come, when will we get the assistance? Recently you asked for a national policy for Covid-19 vaccine distribution. Is there a fear of inequitable distribution given the Centre-State equation? We need a plan as there are five companies making vaccines. What is the ideal temperature for storage? How many doses are required? So far, there is no clarity. A few days ago, PM Narendra Modi convened a video-conference, but still there is no clarity over distribution and other details. Do you think the GST system has become a tool for the Centre to corner states? What needs to be done to retain the state’s autonomy? When GST was introduced, we had raised some issues through BMC to maintain its autonomy. Mumbai has a special status in terms of the scale of tax it pays, so the city should get additional help for further development, it is the job of the Centre. If there are any lacunae in the GST, they should be fixed to make it a foolproof system. If it is not possible, then the old tax regime should be brought back till a new system is adopted. If by Centralising something, all (states) don’t get justice, what is the point of doing it? Within months of taking over, the state was faced with the Covid crisis. How does the government plan to revive the financial condition of the state in the coming year? During the budget session, the coronavirus started spreading in the state, so we had to curtail it. Since then, we are battling the financial crisis. While everything was shut, the Maharashtra government signed memoranda of understanding worth ₹50,000 crore. Of the MoUs signed in June, preliminary work on 60-70%, in terms if allotting land etc, of them has been done. The remaining work will also be done in the coming days. We have decided to bring in investment worth ₹1 lakh crore in one year. It is important to note that though the wheels [of economic activities] had slowed down, they had not stopped. We will see the fruits of our efforts in the coming days. What were your government’s major achievements in this one year? We started with a decision on development of Raigad district and allocated funds. Another big decision was farm loan waiver up to ₹2 lakh crore. We introduced Shiv Bhojan [subsidised meal] at ₹10 [per plate]. It is now being given for ₹5. This is a big [decision]. We have fulfilled nearly all promises we made. Farm loan waiver was a big decision. We don’t make announcements of doubling and tripling farmers’ income or say ‘acche din aayenge’. I take them [farmers] into confidence and make them aware of the situation on the ground and go forward. We have a new idea ‘vikel te pikel’ (sow that sells) to make markets available for farmers. Your family has so far run governments with remote control. How was your experience running a coalition government with two parties? Running a government through remote control is a separate thing. Here, we have three parties and the government runs by a coalition. You moved the Metro car depot from Aarey Colony to Kanjurmarg, will this not lead to cost escalation? Secondly, a private developer has claimed rights on the land and there are other issues over the land. How will you overcome these obstacles? These are old issues. Some people claim to study, but their study never ends. We understand the situation immediately and take a decision. People will not regret this decision. They [Opposition BJP] will oppose it, but not the people. I will give a detailed presentation [soon] on what we have done. Moving the car shed to Kanjurmarg could have been done earlier. But committees were appointed unnecessarily and reports were made. What do we want to achieve? The environment is equally important. Show me one city which has a forest right at its centre. It is not just a forest with trees, it has wildlife, complete eco-system, right from microorganisms to leopards. We don’t want to carry out development by destroying life there. Today, we have developed to such an extent that we are not able to show our faces to anybody. We have had to wear masks, this is our development. We are taking the depot to Kanjurmarg and it will be beneficial to more people. No part [of the project] or money will go waste. The Opposition says that PM Modi is upset with you because you became a member of legislative Council after his intervention, but never acknowledged it in public… Such discussions are pointless. I do not want to waste time on such topics. The Governor has still not cleared the MVA’s nomination of 12 candidates to the Upper house of state legislature. Is there another tussle between the government and Raj Bhavan? We had requested him to do it at the earliest. We had written to him to take a decision in 15 days. Like reopening of temples (as governor had written to Thackeray), we expect him to take quick decisions on matters related to democracy as well. Will the MVA contest the BMC and other municipal corporation polls in an alliance? Definitely, we will contest together. The Vidhan Parishad (legislative Council) polls next months are being contested as a coalition. While attacking the Centre over GST and other issues, you took on the BJP government on the political front. It is being said that Uddhav Thackeray is standing up to the Central government led by PM Modi. No, that was never my intention. I work passionately and speak on issues passionately. I never make personal attacks or speak with malicious intent, like they attacked my family with a vengeance… When we were with them, we were good to them, we used to campaign for them without which their ballot boxes would not fill. Now see the manner in which they are attacking our family and the perverted tendency of their politics. I have not stooped to their level and attacked them. Whatever I say is for the good of my people and will continue to do so. Last year during elections, Devendra Fadnavis called you his elder brother and you had called Modi your elder brother… That time, you (Fadnavis) did not see brother’s janam kundali? Now you realised it? We have your kundalis as well. What happened to the plan to give relief to the people over the inflated electricity bills. Has the state backtracked? Firstly, using the word inflated bill is incorrect because during lockdown [physical] meter readings were not done. The average bill of three months was sent to consumers. Everybody, including me, thought that the average amount was high. I want to say here that there was no increase in tariff. All complaints are being looked at. I am told that once the meters are checked, people understand that this is an average bill as per their [past] usage. Even then, if people have complaints, they are being attended to. Do not mislead people with the use of the word inflated. The pending recoveries are worth ₹60,000 crore. We are not getting much help from the Centre, our dues are not being cleared and we are facing a financial crisis. Even though the crude oil prices have come down, the Centre has not slashed thm. We are not doing anything of that sort. There should not be any misunderstanding. The PM has recently spoken about the ‘one nation, one election’ as part of Centralising things. As of now, that plan is on the backburner. It has not come up yet. There are several other issues that need attention as of now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-bring-in-1lakh-crore-investment-in-a-year-maharashtra-cm/story-BoqGPbxfA4fa9Y9O3gX9dI.html

The teams found that the industrial units were found flouting prescribed waste management rules at their premises.“The two units were found to be mixing the dry and wet waste and dumping it without treatment. Therefore, we imposed ₹50,000 as penalty on each of the violators. Our drive is to encourage bulk waste generators to segregate their waste and treat the wet waste as per rules,” said Indu Prakash Singh, OSD, Noida authority.The Noida authority on November 23 started crackdown against the bulk waste generators.The authority’s health department teams imposed ₹1.35 lakh penalty against three bulk waste generators for flouting rules on the very first day of their campaign.Noida produces around 900 metric tonnes of waste daily. And as per the Waste Management Rules of 2016, the housing complexes or other buildings, which are built on 5,000 square metres of land or above or produce 100 kilograms of waste per day need to treat it at their premises as they are considered to be bulk waste generators. The authority wants all bulk waste generators to follow rules and treat their waste within their own premises.This is the first action to be taken against the bulk waste generators ahead of 2020-21 Swachhta survey. The authority wants to improve on all aspects of urban sanitation so that it can perform better in the cleanliness index, said authority officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-slaps-1-lakh-penalty-on-industrial-units-for-flouting-waste-management-rules/story-htD5gq49SKKShRmsYpFXtO.html

The DM said that he has the officials two days to answer whether the animal has left the area or not. The animal was spotted at the official residence of the vice-chairperson of Ghaziabad development authority on Tuesday morning. “I have given the forest department two days to give conclusion whether the animal is present in the area or left. Further, they have also been asked to give status of the search. People in nearby localities are afraid and we need to assuage them,” said DM Ajay Shankar Pandey. On Friday, a video on social media showed a leopard on the boundary walls of a building. The video was shared widely particularly among Ghaziabad residents. It was later found that it was in Nainital.“That created panic among residents. They are afraid to go for a walk. We have no answers from the officials on whether the animal is still in the area,” said Ajay Sharma, Sanjay Nagar councillor. “Residents cannot keep waiting for days to get reply and need to know the status of the animal,” said Colonel (retired) TP Tyagi, president of flat owners’ federation. District magistrate said that he has directed action against those who shared the video of the animal. “We also deployed drone and also carried out search at the school and nearby areas but the animal could not be traced so far. It seems that it has left the area and probably strayed here from areas like Muradnagar or Dadri. Our teams comprising of about 30 personnel are still searching but we have not come across any trace that preyed some other animal during the stay. It seems that it has left the area,” said Ganga Prasad, conservator of forests (Meerut).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/leopard-still-untraceable-ghaziabad-district-magistrate-seeks-conclusion-report-in-two-days/story-Njl6kGT2AQsnAPOOB1RLeO.html

28-11-2020||Noida||Noida experiences cleanest air since September 27||Noida: The city on Friday experienced the cleanest air in the last two months as the wind speed picked up, dispersing pollutants. The air quality of Noida, which was “very poor” on Thursday and “severe” on Wednesday, touched the lower end of the “moderate” category as per the central pollution control board’s (CPCB) air quality index(AQI). While Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida had earlier seen “moderate” air quality even earlier on November 17, the AQI for the three cities was the lowest since September 27. According to the weather analysts, although the northwesterly winds, which flow from Punjab and Haryana and bring in large volume of pollutants, the number of farm fires in these states has reduced. “The wind speed increased on Friday, reaching to almost 15-20 kmph in the afternoon, while it remained around 10 to 15 kmph for the rest of the day. Parts of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh also saw patchy rains. While the instances of stubble burning have already reduced, the rains further washed away the pollutants, due to which the region experienced relatively cleaner air,” said Mahesh Palawat, director, private weather forecasting centre Skymet. He added that the wind speeds may drop slightly over the next two days. According to the CPCB’s AQI, the city recorded a reading of 125 as against 301 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 129 as against 296 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad was 166 as against 289 a day earlier. As per the records, while the AQI of Noida, Ghaziabad and Greater Noida had been under the ‘moderate’ category on November 17 and throughout the first week of October, Friday’s air quality was the cleanest since September 27. The AQI on September 27 was 116 for Noida, 120 for Greater Noida and 140 for Ghaziabad. The city also witnessed a drop in the level of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in the air. For the past 24 hours, PM 2.5 was recorded at 64.98 micrograms per cubic metres against 170.20 micrograms a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 63.87 micrograms against 164.01 micrograms a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Ghaziabad was 78.49 against 178.85 a day earlier. According to the system of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI is likely to deteriorate slightly within the moderate category. “The AQI is forecasted to stay in the ‘moderate’ to ‘poor’ category for the next two days. Surface winds are forecasted to decrease by November 30 and the air quality will hover between ‘poor’ to the lower end of the ‘very poor’ category,” stated SAFAR in a statement on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-experiences-cleanest-air-since-september-27/story-zJILG0H1kuioItsqqTN8VN.html

The woman in her complaint has alleged that the doctor behaved inappropriately with her during her check-up.“It seemed that he was under the influence of alcohol. When I was getting my ultrasound done, he tried to touch me inappropriately multiple times after which I became uncomfortable. His conduct during the procedure was wrong and unprofessional,” said the woman in her police complaint.The woman later informed a cousin about the whole incident. When the cousin tried to confront the suspect, the doctor allegedly misbehaved with him as well and threatened him with dire consequences, besides assaulting him. The woman later filed a complaint with Dadri police following which a case was registered against the doctor under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code.Police officials said that a probe in the matter is underway and it is yet to be confirmed whether the doctor was intoxicated at the moment or not.“It seems that the woman had gone there for an ultrasound and the doctor molested her. Soon after the incident, she filed a complaint and the man was booked. The doctor is absconding and we are on the lookout for him. We will nab him soon,” said Rajveer Singh Chauhan, station house officer, Dadri police station.Police officials also said that it seems that the suspect might have a prior criminal record as well but that can only be confirmed once the suspect is taken into custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/pregnant-woman-molested-by-doctor-in-dadri-police-launch-probe/story-lsNBVeLioCOaQlzKaw4NQM.html
28-11-2020||Noida||In less than a year, UP government proposes to roll back powers from Noida, Lucknow police chiefs||In what comes as a body blow to those expecting a full-fledged police commissionerate in Gautam Budh Nagar, the Uttar Pradesh government has sought feedback from the district magistrate (DM) over a proposal to restore certain powers back to them.The commissionerate system was introduced in January this year with the view of improving law and order in the district. As part of the process, power conferred by sections 133 and 145 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was transferred to the commissionerate from the DM. Lucknow was the other city to get a commissionerate with similar provisions.While section 133 provided for procedures in urgent removal of unlawful obstruction that harms the health or physical comfort of the community or construction that may cause conflagration or explosion; section 145 deals with disputes arising out of land and water bodies between the individuals or groups.UP additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi said that since both these sections deal with disputes related to land, it comes under the jurisdiction of the lekhpals who is a district officer. “As lekhpals directly report to the DMs, we have proposed to restore these powers to the DM. Also, there are lot of pending cases under these sections in both Lucknow and Gautam Buddh Nagar.” However, records over the last two years had a different story: Between January 1, 2019 and January 12, 2020 (when the power was vested with the DM), only four notices were served to the parties under section 133 and action was taken in 13 other cases. Since the introduction of police commissionerate on January 13, six notices have been served and actions have been taken in 22 cases so far under this section. There has been no action based on section 145 under both regimes during the period.Unlike the full-fledged police commissionerates in Delhi and Mumbai, the ones in Noida and Lucknow do not have powers of issuing gun licences, excise permits and imposition of the National Security Act (NSA). The proposal to return these powers were conveyed to the DM in a letter dated November 10 from the state home department. When contacted, neither the DM Suhas LY nor police commissioner Alok Singh wished to comment on the matter.Deliberate weakening of system: Former copsFormer UP DGP Vikram Singh termed the proposal “weird” and suspected that certain officials were out to deliberately weaken the system. “The commissionerate system provides unified organisational command structure and the power to manage problems created by urban growth such as encroachments, anti-social activities and drug peddling among others,” he said. “This is how the police can use their professional understanding to improvise according to ground realities. The consequences of reducing the rights of UP police commissioners by withdrawing their powers under sections 133 and 145 of CrPC will be catastrophic. Instead, attaching Ghaziabad and other neighbouring metropolitan areas to GB Nagar police commissionerate, is the need of hour.” He said that without giving full powers to the police commissionerate, controlling crime will remain a mirage. “I am really surprised that proposal has been initiated. Their hands are virtually tied as they do not have the power to act against criminals under the Arms Act. In a bona fide police commissionerate system, the power of allocating and cancelling the arms’ license is vested with the police commissioner of police. If they don’t get these powers, the police system becomes weaker and can never be up to the expectation of the people,” Singh said. Singh further pointed out that under the new system, the responsibility of maintaining law and order must be vested with the CP for more clarity on the chain of command as well as for better accountability. “A bona fide CP serves as single-point of responsibility when it comes to law and order as he is directly and completely accountable to the state government. It should never be dependent on different authorities,” he said. Former Delhi CP Ajai Raj Sharma agreed. “It is a retrograde move against a system that has proved its worth and merit in last 11 months,” he said. Sharma said that the move will boost the morale of criminals. “Property disputes are the main reason behind murders and breach of peace, particularly in rural areas. The chief minister must take a hard call at this juncture,” he said. No difference: Former bureaucratsFormer UP chief secretary Yogendra Narain said the move would hardly impact the police’s autonomy. “The state government began (the commissionerate system) as an experiment in the field of law and order. Like any experiment, it must have a place for rectification to strengthen the system. These are petty issues for the larger canvas of police commissionerate. And even in the execution of these powers (of the DM), police have a bigger role in execution. I personally do not feel anything wrong,” he said. Former Bihar cadre IAS officer Vijoy Prakash feels that it is up to chief minister to take the call. “It’s not about how much power a police officer should be given or how should the governance balance the power. Instead, it is about who can use the powers in the best way for the benefit of common people,” he said. Lawyers, residents weigh inUnder the Police Act of 1861, the district superintendent of police is to report to the district collector. Supreme Court lawyer Rajesh Kumar said that under the commissionerate system, the police commissioner does not report to the DM and also has powers of executive magistrates. “These include issuing orders for preventive arrests or imposition of section 133 and 145 of CrPC. It gives freedom to the police from civil administration and creates an integrated command structure with powers of regulation, control, and licensing,” he said. Resident’s associations in the city also said that the Noida police commissionerate must be given full powers. PS Jain, member, Confederation of NCR residents’ welfare associations (CONRWA) said while government has done a commendable job with the introduction of new police system in GB Nagar, more needed to be done. “The law and order situation can only improve, if the police system has a single power centre. All the powers of traffic encroachment and issuing fine, besides powers under Sarai Act, Arms Act and Gunda Act, must be vested with the CP like other commissionerates of the country,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/in-less-than-a-year-up-government-proposes-to-roll-back-powers-from-noida-lucknow-police-chiefs/story-Ttkos6eIvomwzcTTQFAw1N.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||NTCA approves release of tigress Avni’s cub into the wild: Maharashtra forest department||The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has approved the release of the female cub of alleged man-eater tigress T1 back into the wild at Pench Tiger Reserve, in Nagpur. The decision was taken during a meeting between NTCA and Maharashtra’s forest department on Friday.The cub, T1C2, is now a sub-adult (two-and-half years old) tigress and has been in captivity in a 4.5-hectare (ha) enclosure at Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) since December 22, 2018. T1C2 was captured after T1, popularly known as Avni, was shot dead by a father-son hunter duo after it was said that she killed 13 people in Pandharkawada forest in Ralegaon, Yavatmal. Avni’s male cub (T1C1), which the department failed to capture in 2018, was last spotted in Yavatmal’s Pandharkawada forest area in December 2019, but there have been no sightings since, said the forest department.The release of T1C2 is being planned for this winter. “There was a very positive response from NTCA about T1C2’s release. We are planning her release as soon as possible after we get the minutes of the meeting from NTCA. It will be done in winter as it is the right time for the release of such tigers in the wild,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra. A senior forest official, requesting anonymity, said three locations were shortlisted for release: Navegaon-Nagzira Tiger Reserve (NNTR) in Gondia, Gadchiroli; Pench Tiger Reserve in Nagpur; and Melghat Tiger Reserve in Amravati. “We narrowed down to Pench as the most suitable area for the tigress’ release as there is a high prey base, the animal is already used to the area, and the staff is better trained than other areas. NNTR was not chosen as it has too many villages and does not have a good prey base for tigers.”NTCA officials could not be reached for comment.T1C2 was initially to be released into the wild post-monsoon in 2019, but the frequency of kills did not meet NTCA’s standard operating procedure for tigers in the wild. However, on July 3, during a meeting chaired by Kakodkar with forest officials and the committee constituted in November 2018 to oversee the cub’s capture, it was decided the cub was fit for release.“T1C2 is presently healthy and continues to show all traits of a tigress that can hunt and kill in the wild as well as learnt how to mark her territory. We are confident she will be able to survive well on her own,” said Kakodkar.10-YEAR-OLD BOY KILLED IN LEOPARD ATTACK AT BEEDA 10-year-old boy was killed in a leopard attack in Kinhi village, Ashti tehsil in Maharashtra’s Beed district on Friday. Forest officials are trying to trap the animal. The incident took place when the boy, Swaraj Bhapkar, was playing at his uncle’s farm. The leopard attacked him and dragged his body a few metres away from the farm. Bhapkar is the 24th human kill by leopards in 2020, the highest in at least 10 years. The year has also recorded 159 leopard deaths in Maharashtra, which is the highest in five years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ntca-approves-release-of-tigress-avni-s-cub-into-the-wild-maharashtra-forest-department/story-l2mjnbS43ncPfC3FuZQWKJ.html
28-11-2020||Noida||Greater Noida court denies custody of dogs to abusive owners||The district and sessions court of Surajpur in Greater Noida denied custody of three dogs to its owners while hearing a case of animal cruelty. Observing that if handed back to the owners the pets could be subjected to barbarism and cruelty again, the judicial magistrate Shashank Gupta said the dogs will continue to live under the care of a city-based NGO. In August, a 30-year-old Nigerian who lived in a rented apartment in a Greater Noida highrise with his wife was arrested and a case was registered against him under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. This happened following a viral video that purportedly showed the man thrashing his brown American Pitbull Terrier in his apartment’s balcony. Police took his dogs – a male pitbull, a female pitbull and a Labrador pup – and gave them to People For Animal (PFA) to care. While the suspect was later granted bail, his wife approached the court in September seeking custody of the three dogs. “It has been observed that if the custody of animals is given back to the applicant then there is possibility of animals being subjected to barbarism and cruelty. The animals are being given proper care at the NGO. Thus the court denied the appeal of handing the custody back,” read the judgement dated November 24, a copy of which was made available on Friday and seen by HT. “It’s one of the rare case and historic judgement by Honourable Surajpur court denying custody to the abusive family. Precedent has been set against animal cruelty,” said Kaveri Rana, president, PFA- Gautam Budh Nagar. Vishal Gautam, PFA’s legal counsellor said that in most of such cases the animals are often handed back. “In my knowledge, there had been only one case in the state where the custody of a cattle was taken from its abusive owner. This is the first such case in Uttar Pradesh where the custody of dogs had been denied to the abusive owner on base of animal cruelty,” said Vishal Gautam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-court-denies-custody-of-dogs-to-abusive-owners/story-FO6V0zrUoXq7f68Pj5YjgP.html
28-11-2020||City||Fear implication in dowry case, Ludhiana realtor who killed family wrote in his suicide note||A day after it was found that realtor Rajiv Sunda, 60, had ended his life the same day that he had hacked his family members to death with an axe, police have booked his son’s father-in-law and brother-in-law for abetment to suicide.As per the police, Rajiv had left behind a suicide note in which he had alleged that Ashok Gulati, his son’s father-in-law, and Gaurav Gulati, the brother-in-law, were threatening to implicate him in a dowry harassment case.In the two-page note, which has been recovered from his house, Rajiv mentioned that the duo had taken ₹7 lakh from him in the past two years and were demanding ₹10 lakh more. When he refused to give them the money, they allegedly threatened to implicate him in a dowry case. Rajiv further wrote that as the police tend to favour women in such cases, he feared he would be sent behind bars under false charges. So he wanted to end his life after killing his family members. Rajiv also demanded stern action against Ashok and Gaurav Gulati, in the note.Accused refute allegationsAshok Gulati and Gaurav Gulati, who have been booked under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code, have refuted the allegations. They said that in fact it was Rajiv who had barred Garima from visiting them, without any reason. Inspector Paramdeep Singh, PAU station house officer, said that on the basis of the suicide note, police have booked the father-son duo under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code. No arrests have been made so far.The Sunda family, including Sunita Sunda, 58, son Ashish Sunda, 35, daughter-in-law Garima Sunda, 32, and grandson Suchet, 12, had been found hacked to death in their house on Tuesday morning. The railway police had found a body on the railway tracks the same day, but it was not until Thursday that police found out about it and ascertained that it was Rajiv Sunda’s body.‘Garima had hinted at something untoward happening to her’Garima’s father and brother have told the police that she had hinted that something untoward may happen to her but they dismissed it as a family feud and told her to settle it on her own. “However, we had no idea that she was going to be murdered,” said Gaurav Gulati, her brother.Garima had lost her mother to a cardiac arrest on October 13. She had stayed at her parents’ house for some days after her mother’s death. As per relatives, she had been frequenting her parents’ house even after all the cremation rituals were over. Garima is said to have told her relatives that she had sensed a change in the behaviour of her father-in-law and feared something untoward was going to happen to her. They had pacified her and told her that they would keep in touch with her over phone. Ajay Kumar, a relative, said that on Monday night, they had talked to Garima over the phone and she sounded okay. The next morning they were shocked when Garima’s son Suchet made a frantic call to Ashok, saying that his grandfather was beating them. Before they could reach to their rescue, the accused had already murdered Garima, her husband, son and mother-in-law.The house in Mayur Vihar where the brutal crimes took place remains locked. The neighbours are still in shock over the incident. They said they were aware that Rajiv Sunda was a reserved man but never thought he would kill anyone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fear-implication-in-dowry-case-ludhiana-realtor-who-killed-family-wrote-in-his-suicide-note/story-XzYX7yr8rrtUC0AzgDdP0M.html
28-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad administration may put an end to Covid testing at the borders||The Ghaziabad administration is thinking about putting an end to Covid-19 testing at borders as the administration has come across only a single positive case during the three days of testing, which started on November 24. The figures of the district health department have revealed that out of the 441 tests conducted so far, only a single person tested positive.The testing at the borders started on November 24 and was taken up at UP Gate, as well as two other borders near Delhi’s Dilshad Garden. The officials said that since the results are not encouraging, it will no longer be feasible to carry out the tests. “The testing is being carried out at the borders as of now. But, we have achieved hardly any success. We will ask the teams to conduct tests for another couple of days and will relocate them to other areas. The positivity rate of such random testing is very less, which is similar to the positivity rate of the post-festival focussed testing, which was taken up on the directions of the government,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “We will be increasing testing only in high-incidence areas. Our post-festival testing strategy is to check the spread of infection in places that already have a high incidence rate,” he added. Under the focussed testing strategy, between November 19 to November 30, the heath teams have taken up 11,288 rapid antigen samples, which yielded only 96 positive cases with a positivity of about 0.85%. “The positivity rate of the focussed/targeted testing during the pre-festival period was also very less at about 0.38%. Likewise, the positivity rate during the post-festival targeted testing was hardly any better. On the other hand, the positivity of rapid antigen testing is ranging from 1.5% to 3% on a daily basis at our testing centres,” said an officer from the health department, who wished not to be named. “As per our analysis, most of the positivity or positive cases are found in urban areas like Indirapuram, Vaishali and Sahibabad, where population density is high and people are moving about for work on a daily basis. During the focussed testing in slum areas, we did not find a single case in three days,” the officer, said. The 96 positive cases in the post-festival focussed testing were found in areas like Vaishali, Indirapuram, Sahibabad, Kavi Nagar and Crossings Republik, while no cases were detected in urban slums, Dasna jail or observation homes. “Even if the test results in focussed testing have shown low positivity, it shows that infection is concentrated only in certain pockets. As such, increased testing and surveillance are needed in these areas. The officials should therefore increase testing and focus on high-incidence areas,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. The residential segments of Indirapuram, Carte (Shastri Nagar, Chiranjeev Vihar etc), Sahibabad-2 (Rajendra Nagar, Lajpat Nagar etc), Raj Nagar and Vaishali have emerged as top five contributors to the Covid-19 tally in Ghaziabad district as per the mapping done on directions of the UP government for focussed surveillance. The five segments contribute about 56.82% share of 1,260 Covid-19 cases, which have come in during the 10-day period between November 11 to November 20. The mapping was done on directions of the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-administration-may-put-an-end-to-covid-testing-at-the-borders/story-LjvDyMOut561hKUOUbVyUK.html
28-11-2020||Noida||GBN farmers stopped at EPE amid heavy police presence||Many farmers in the district going to Delhi were stopped by the Greater Noida Police at the Eastern Peripheral Expressway on Friday afternoon as the national capital had closed its borders to protesters since the previous night.Farmers in Haryana and Punjab called for a ‘Delhi chalo’ movement on November 26-27 against the farmers’ laws enacted last month, which they claim threaten the minimum support price (MSP) system. Last night and Friday morning, these protesting farmers were met with water cannons, police barricades and tear gas near the Haryana-Delhi border.Uttar Pradesh farmers too had been responding to the call and the state police put up barricades to prevent a large presence on the UP-Delhi border as well. On Thursday, a small group attempted to go to Delhi, but was stopped at Pari Chowk. On Friday, farmers from Meerut, Muzaffarnagar and Gautam Budh Nagar reached the Eastern Peripheral Expressway around 11.30 am.“We were stopped near the Sirsa village where police had set up barricades on both sides to keep us from going forward and forcing us to set up camp there itself,” said Sunil Pradhan, media coordinator, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU).Tractors, cars and other vehicles were also parked at the Expressway forcing police to divert traffic from the Sirsa village exit of the expressway towards the next entry point. Traffic was only lightly affected and Noida Police tweeted that traffic was smooth across the DND, Kalindi Kunj and Chilla bordersA large contingent of police was deployed at the expressway.“PAC forces were deployed as a precaution. Traffic was slow but moving continuously due to checking on both sides of the border. But there were no security or law and order concerns but we will continue to remain on alert nonetheless,” said ADCP, zone 1, Kumar Ranvijay Singh.At the camps, farmers shouted slogan against the central government and chants “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan”, however there had been no clashes with the police.With the Delhi Police finally relenting and allowing those at the Haryana-Delhi border to enter and protest in the outskirts of the Capital, farmers on the UP site too dispersed to gather more protesters. “We are now being joined by more farmers from Meerut and Muzaffarnagar where there have been protests against the farmers’ policies and we will together proceed to Delhi via NH 9 now that we have been permitted to go to Delhi,” said Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson, BKU.Police officials said that the movement was peaceful and there had been no law and order issues.“We stopped them and diverted traffic for the couple of hours that they (protesters) were there. They dispersed around 4pm,” said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, Vishal Pandey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gbn-farmers-stopped-at-epe-amid-heavy-police-presence/story-T7DQWAW5jshryaHVK0gVrI.html
28-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt knew of Nov surge in Covid cases, did nothing: Centre to SC||New DelhiThe Union government on Friday told the Supreme Court that Delhi took no effective steps to control the Covid situation despite being aware of an expected surge in November with the confluence of winter, the festival season, and a spike in pollution. The contention drew a sharp reactions from the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which said the Centre was playing “dirty politics”.In an affidavit detailing the circumstances that led Union home minister Amit Shah to personally monitor preparedness in Delhi on account of rising cases in November, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) said, “The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) was aware that the confluence of winter, festival season and pollution were likely to witness a surge in cases. This foreknowledge ought to have led to strict enforcement and IEC measures being instituted well in time. However, this was not done.”On November 15, Shah conducted a joint meeting of officials in the Capital and spruced up efforts to increase medical infrastructure by way of additional ICU beds, ramping up testing facilities, contact tracing, surveillance, and availability of medical workers.Pointing to the alleged pitfalls in the Delhi government’s action observed by the ministry during several rounds of meetings over the past months, the affidavit said the Arvind Kejriwal government was informed in advance by an expert group headed by VK Paul, Member NITI Aayog, that Delhi should anticipate for a surge of around 15,000 cases a day in November and must provide for about 6,500 ICU beds.“Against this recommendation, GNCTD did not take any timely measures to increase the ICU beds from the present level of around 3,500, thus causing a sudden pressure to come on the health and medical infrastructure in Delhi,” stated the affidavit filed by MHA joint secretary Sandeep Kumar Jindal.The MHA accused the Delhi administration of not taking steps to enhance testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 RTPCR tests for a long time. “Patients who were under home isolation were not properly traced. In addition, house-to-house surveillance, contact tracing, quarantining and clinical management were also not done properly, which led to the spread of infection,” the affidavit added.In response, the Aam Aadmi Party termed the central government’s affidavit in the Supreme Court as “unfortunate” and “dirty politics”.The party accused the Centre of not giving adequate funds for Covid-19 management and alleged it was yet to provide at least 550 more ICU beds in Delhi, which they said was assured by Amit Shah on November 15 in his meeting with chief minister Kejriwal and lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal. “Comments of the central government about the Delhi government in its affidavit before the Supreme Court are very unfortunate. It is extremely unfortunate that the central government has chosen to play dirty politics in this critical hour. The affidavit seems to have been drafted by a BJP spokesperson, rather than by the Union government, which is meant to work in collaboration with the states at the time of a pandemic. The affidavit is also factually incorrect,” AAP said in a statement.It added, “However, the Delhi government is worried about the well-being of its people and will continue to work together with all governments and all agencies as it has been doing so far. We hope that the central government will also refrain from playing dirty politics. Mr Amit Shah (had) promised to provide 750 ICU beds within 72 hours in the meeting held on 15 November. Till date, only 200 beds have been provided. We hope the Centre will provide the rest of the beds soon.”“The central government has deprived Delhi of all funds (that have been) provided to other state governments during this epidemic on the flimsy premise that Delhi is a Union Territory. Therefore, we hope that the central government will do something concrete for Delhiites rather than play blame game,” AAP said.The Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the matter.Delhi government officials, who did not wish to be identified, said the government had scaled up tests from around 20,000 per day to around 60,000 per day in September when the city witnessed a sharp spike in cases.The Capital at present is going through a third surge. While the highest number of cases in a day (8,593) was recorded on November 11, the highest deaths in a day (131) were on November 18.“Overall positivity in Delhi is coming down since 7 Nov. This is 8.65% now as compared to 15.26% on Nov 7. For the last 7 consecutive days cases are less than 7,000,” Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said in a tweet on Friday.Jain shared data that showed that between November 1 and 25, a total of 1,314,385 Covid-19 tests were conducted in Delhi – of which 457,683 were RT-PCR tests and the rest rapid antigen.According to figures made available by the ministry in the affidavit, with 9.2 million Covid-19 cases of which 0.44 million are active, India is faring “remarkably well” in restricting the spread. “Recovery rate has gone up to 93.7%. Average cases per day have reduced by 50% since the past eight weeks. Our case fatality rate remains low at 1.46% compared to global average of 2.36%…We will continue making efforts to reduce fatality rate to less than 1% and accelerate our efforts in reducing the positivity rate which stands at 6.9%,” the affidavit stated.This was largely attributable to 10 states that constituted 77% of the active case load for the country. Delhi figures at the third place constituting 8.5%to the national tally. Maharashtra leads with nearly 19%, Kerala (14.7%), followed by Delhi, West Bengal, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-knew-of-nov-surge-in-covid-cases-did-nothing-centre-to-sc/story-x1H53GG4itHgqffVQETK5N.html
28-11-2020||Delhi||After govt no to police request, AAP leaders camp at Burari farmers’ protest site||The Delhi government on Friday rejected Delhi Police’s request to convert nine stadiums into temporary prisons as farmer groups demanding the roll-back of three contentious farm laws reached the Capital. This was the first time in recent years such a request was turned down, police said. Later in the day, when a gathering of protesting farmers was allowed at the Nirankari ground in north Delhi’s Burari, leaders of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were spotted, helping with basic arrangements ranging from food and drinking water to setting up temporary toilets.On Thursday, when Delhi Police stepped up security at the borders to stop the protesters from approaching the city, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had spoken out in support of he farmers, upholding their constitutional right to peacefully protest and urging the Centre to roll back the laws.The three laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. AAP had voted against the Bills earlier this year in both the Lok Sabha (in which the part has one MP) and the Rajya Sabha (three MPs).A large number of protesting farmers are from Punjab, where AAP is the principal opposition party and its lone Lok Sabha MP is from that state.On Friday, Delhi’s home minister Satyendar Jain said in a letter to Delhi Police, “The demands of the farmers are justified. The central government should accept them. It is a peaceful protest. It won’t be appropriate to jail farmers for that. Peaceful protest is a constitutional right of every Indian citizen. They cannot be jailed for that. We deny the Delhi Police’s application for permission in this regard.”A copy of the letter was shared by AAP on its social media handles.Senior government officials said Delhi Police had sought permission from the Delhi home department through a letter on Wednesday. Jain later told the media, “Jailing them isn’t the solution to the issue. Their demands must be accepted.”Soon, several other leaders of the party weighed in.AAP leader Harpal Singh Cheema, who is Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly, said, “Arvind Kejriwal was the only chief minister across the country who led a ‘dharna’ at Jantar Mantar against the three anti-farmer agriculture laws. Arvind Kejriwal had demanded an immediate repeal of the laws. I thank him for today’s decision.”AAP’s Greater Kailash MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj said: “It is the constitutional right of farmers to protest. It’s beyond imagination how the central government could think of jailing them for that.” The ruling party’s Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha was also at the Nirankari ground, making arrangements.“While you can see the BJP government using water cannons on those who are responsible for feeding each and every one of us, the Arvind Kejriwal government has made arrangements of drinking water tankers for our farmers. The Delhi Jal Board appointed nodal officers to ensure proper supply and arrangement of drinking water for the peaceful protestors at Burari ,” said Chadha, who is also vice-chairperson of the Delhi Jal Board.Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot directing officials to set up temporary toilets and sheds in the open ground for the farmers and ensure Covid-related regulations are followed.BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, said: “The BJP understands farmers better than any other party. AAP should look at the condition of farmers in Delhi. In Delhi, farmers are charged road tax for tractors, which are considered commercial vehicles. Most states exempt farmers from such taxes. The Delhi government has promised 50% over MSP for wheat and paddy. They should tell Delhi farmers how much wheat and paddy have the government procured in the last few years at the MSP. The Delhi government charges Rs 8 per unit for water connections used for irrigation, whereas other states provide subsidy on such bills.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-govt-no-to-police-request-aap-leaders-camp-at-burari-farmers-protest-site/story-FPfd9AEXHiHa1vD3XxgUZM.html

28-11-2020||Delhi||Traffic crawls at Delhi borders with Haryana as police intensify checks||Traffic crawled in many parts of Delhi on Friday after Delhi Police closed several border points with Haryana in view of the ‘Delhi Chalo’ march by farmers who are protesting the farm bills. The Tikri, Dhansa and Jharoda Kalan borders that connect Haryana were closed for traffic movement due to the demonstration and commuters were asked to take alternative routes, Delhi traffic police said. Vehicles were also diverted from Mukarba Chowk and GT Karnal Road. Taj Hassan, special CP (traffic), said the traffic situation was chaotic on highways passing through the Singhu Border and Tikri Borders. “These two are main arterial roads, so the traffic was bound to be badly impacted,” Hassan said. In contrast, border routes connecting Delhi and UP were less affected. “Since there is checking at all border points, traffic movement has been slow in those places,” said Hassan. The officer said motorists could still enter Haryana through the Rajokri, Mahipalpur and Auchandi borders route or the Eastern Express Peripheral Highway towards Kundli. Even on borders opened for motorists, there was heavy deployment of police, which were checking each vehicle before allowing entry. This exercise slowed down traffic at the borders and adjoining arterial roads, with vehicles lining up at checkpoints. Even within the city limits, police check points were set up around Dhaula Kuan, Peeragarhi, Punjabi Bagh and Vasant Vihar. While the closure of the Singhu and Tikri borders heavily impacted motorists, it were poor labourers who suffered the most as they walked long distances in the absence of any public transport. “We were travelling from Panipat to Delhi for work and had to walk nearly 30 kilometers,” said Santosh Singh, a labourer who crossed the barricades at the Singhu Border on foot with a group of other men and women. At the Sirhaul border, Gururgam and Delhi police eased checking to prevent traffic congestion after a traffic snarl of more than two kilometres was reported from both sides of the expressway. Traffic congestions were also reported from the borders connecting Gurgram from Kapashera, Aya Nagar and Mandi in the morning. Astha Modi, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), said, “There was a jam at the border on both sides on Friday morning after which we spoke to Delhi Police and decided to remove the barricades. Nishant Kapoor, a daily commuter to Gurugram, said, “Police should have checked only suspected people. They were checking the identity of all commuters due to which traffic piled up on the stretch.” Another daily commuter to Delhi, said the traffic situation at the Sirhaul border is an everyday affair and for the last three years, the situation has almost remained the same. “Even if there is no fresh development, the stretch witnesses congestion, barricading or no-barricading,” said Ankita Singh. The police said they had deployed 928 personnel at 123 checkpoints across the city connecting nearby districts with the state and Delhi. In Noida, many farmers in the district going to Delhi were stopped by Greater Noida Police at the Eastern Peripheral Expressway on Friday afternoon as the national capital had closed its borders to protesters. “We were stopped near Sirsa village where police had set up barricades on both sides to keep us from going forward and forcing us to set up camp there itself,” said Sunil Pradhan, media coordinator, Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/traffic-crawls-at-delhi-borders-with-haryana-as-police-intensify-checks/story-7AypDDmNmbhV8P9FKdc3jL.html
28-11-2020||Mumbai||Seaplane to return to the Maldives month after operations begin, service temporarily suspended||Less than a month after Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the seaplane service from the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad to Kevadia, the service has been temporarily suspended due to maintenance issues in the seaplane. The aircraft — a 19-seater Twin Otter 300 — will be sent back to the Maldives on Saturday as it is the property of a Maldivian company, said sources in the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA). Launched on October 31, the seaplane service between the Sabarmati riverfront and Kevadia was aimed at boosting tourism to the Statue of Unity. It is the first seaplane to operate under the government’s Udey Desh ka Aam Naagrik (UDAN) project. The service is being operated by Spice Shuttle, a fully-owned subsidiary of SpiceJet, which wet-leased the seaplane from Maldives Island Aviation Services (MIAS). MIAS is owned by the government of Maldives, making both the aircraft and its crew the property of a foreign entity. A spokesperson for SpiceJet confirmed the seaplane service has been suspended. “Seaplane operation has been temporarily suspended due to mandatory aircraft maintenance. Since the maintenance facility (dry and wet dock) is still under construction at Ahmedabad, the aircraft has to be sent to our lessor’s facility at Maldives. The operation will resume once the aircraft is back. The maintenance facility at Ahmedabad should be ready soon which would ensure that future maintenance is done here itself.” the spokesperson said.The airline further clarified that the maintenance had been planned beforehand although seaplane services had to be suspended for two days in the first week of operation, due to maintenance issues. “We didn’t take any bookings beyond November 27 as this was pre-planned,” said the spokesperson. Sources in MoCA said the Maldivian aircraft may be replaced. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) did not comment on the matter.Aviation safety consultant captain Mohan Ranganathan said, “No aircraft goes for maintenance within one month of flying, which means that they did not get the paperwork done as required.” Raising questions about whether due process was followed while acquiring clearances for the service, he further said, “It is obvious that the facility was initially inaugurated for publicity. While giving all the permits to an airline, the authority has to ensure that the company is financially viable and that crew and maintenance staff is available. Unless this is confirmed in writing by the airline, approvals are not given. This implies that the aircraft did not have a proper certificate of airworthiness (CofA).” SpiceJet has been conducting seaplane trials in India since 2017. While under the first phase, trials were conducted in Nagpur and Guwahati, the second phase involved trials held at Mumbai’s Girgaum Chowpatty. The airline had earlier said it had secured 18 seaplane routes under UDAN, including services between Ahmedabad and Kevadia; Agatti and Minicoy; and Agatti and Kavaratti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/seaplane-to-return-to-the-maldives-month-after-operations-begin-service-temporarily-suspended/story-3Duw033CXlQHHU0QtGDM4I.html
28-11-2020||Delhi||17 teachers, volunteers in door-to-door survey test +ve , says association||Seventeen teachers and volunteers engaged in the Delhi government’s door-to-door Covid-19 survey in Bawana have tested positive for the disease over the past few days, the Delhi MCD teachers’ association said on Friday. The association said they have written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, alleging that all those roped in for the survey were neither provided with adequate safety kits nor was enough precaution taken during the training sessions where people crowded together.The association demanded safety equipment and exemption for people over the age of 50, pregnant women and those serious co-morbidities -- and threatened to withdraw from the survey if their demands are not met.The Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for a comment.Ramnivas Solanki, general secretary of the association, said samples of those deployed for the survey in Bawana in North district were taken on November 24 by district health officials and the report confirming 17 of them positive came on Thursday evening.A Delhi government teacher who tested positive said, “Three teachers from my school were infected. The training of teachers for the survey on November 19 was conducted in a small school playground where around 200-300 people gathered. There was hardly any space for social distancing. A few days later, I started having symptoms like cold and fatigue. The government should not put us at risk this way.”The Delhi government had on November 20 started a door-to-door survey to screen people for Covid-19, encourage more testing, and to ascertain the number of high-risk individuals, including the elderly, pregnant women, and those with comorbid conditions. The survey is expected to cover around 5.8 million people – more than one-fourth of Delhi’s total population of around 20 million – mainly in more than 4,500 containment zones and localities in 11 revenue districts.According to the association, as many as 15,000 teachers of government schools and 13,000 from municipal schools are involved in Covid-related duties. Civil defence volunteers and home guards too have been involved.“We were given masks, sanitisers and a pair of gloves. When we are going house to house, in narrow lanes during the entire day, a mask alone is not enough. I bought a face shield and a box of gloves myself. However, I believe coveralls must be provided,” said a volunteer, who did not wish to be named. Solanki said teachers have been deployed for Covid work without proper safety measures. “Municipal teachers have not been paid for four months and are still working. The government cannot put the families of so many people at risk as it defeats the purpose of the survey itself,” he said.North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash on Friday said the Delhi government must first conduct Covid tests of teachers, etc., before deploying them for survey work. “There is fear among the teachers and other volunteers as well as their families who are at risk. Prior tests must be carried out,” said Prakash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/17-teachers-volunteers-in-door-to-door-survey-test-ve-says-association/story-ToKary4IuB57byNsKuOXPN.html
28-11-2020||Kolkata||Rahul Gandhi seeks opinion from Bengal leaders on alliance with Left against TMC, BJP||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday held a virtual meeting with leaders of the West Bengal unit and sought their opinion on allying with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its Left partners for the assembly elections due in about five months. Gandhi also sought reports on party’s poll preparedness in the state. Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and senior state leaders took part in the meeting. “Rahul Gandhi asked for our opinion on an alliance against the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). We conveyed our thoughts to him. That is all we can say right now,” Chowdhury told HT on Friday night. Also read: China says first Covid-19 case reported in Wuhan, doesn’t mean virus originated here“The issue of sharing seats with the Left will be discussed at a later stage,” he added. The Congress and the Left had contested the assembly polls as allies in 2016 but could not make a dent in the vote bank of the TMC. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, they did not have an alliance and lost major chunks of their vote share. While Congress managed to retain two Lok Sabha seats, the CPI(M) lost all. Over the past two years, many Congress and Left legislators have defected to the TMC and the BJP. Commenting on TMC’s heavyweight leader Suvendu Adhikari quitting the cabinet on Friday, Chowdhury said, “Whether he will join the BJP is up to him. I am happy to see chief minister Mamata Banerjee being paid in her own coins. She engineered defections in our party over and over again to weaken us. History has a nasty habit of repeating itself.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/rahul-gandhi-seeks-opinion-from-bengal-leaders-on-alliance-with-left-against-tmc-bjp/story-JGnOymzbs7F5ppEFemDasL.html

The rise in cases is because of more number of tests, which had reduced to under 50,000 during Diwali. We have increased per day testing to between 90,000 and 100,000, and so the cases have increased by around 2,000,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope.Health experts had already expressed concerns about cases rising after Diwali, and the state government has directed local authorities to be vigilant and be prepared for a potential second wave of Covid-19. However, the government is yet to decide if another lockdown or further restrictions need to be imposed to control the situation.Also read: Covid-19: In Mumbai, number of people not wearing masks almost doubled in last 2 weeks, says BMC“Everything depends on the numbers.

28-11-2020||Delhi||Severe to moderate in two days: Winds clean Delhi air||With strong winds and stubble fires in Punjab and Haryana coming to a close, Delhi’s improved drastically on Friday, falling from the severe zone to the moderate zone in just two days. In fact, the air quality in at least eight stations improved to satisfactory on Friday, a rarity for the city during this time of year. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that Delhi’s overall AQI on Friday was 137, considered to be in the moderate zone. From Wednesday, when the AQI was in the severe category, at 413, it improved to 302 (very poor) on Thursday, according to CPCB recording. An AQI in the range of 0-50 is considered ‘good’, 51-100 ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 ‘moderate’, 201-300 ‘poor’, 301-400 ‘very poor’ and 401-500 ‘severe’.In Lodhi Road, Aya Nagar, Pusa, Shadipur, Alipur, North Campus (Delhi University) and Indira Gandhi International Airport monitoring stations, the AQI scale turned light green, denoting satisfactory air quality, at different hours of the day. The level of PM2.5 (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) at 6pm was 62ug/m3, just two notches above the acceptable standard. The levels of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometres) also fell to 122.3ug/m3 at 6pm on Friday. In India, the safe standard for PM 10 is 100ug/m3. IMD scientists said that even though the wind direction continued to be north-westerly, travelling from Punjab and Haryana, the impact of stubble fires were next to negligible on Friday on Delhi’s air, said VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre. He added that high wind speeds from Thursday night, which continued through Friday, helped improve the city’s air significantly. Union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), data shows that on Friday 136 fires were spotted over Punjab and Haryana, and its contribution on the Capital’s PM2.5 levels was around 2%. “The average wind speed recorded on Thursday night was also around 8kmph, which is rare because winds tend to slow down at night. During the day too, the winds have been favourable for the dispersion of pollutants,” Soni said. Soni also said the air quality is expected to remain between moderate and poor range till November 30, after which it is forecast to deteriorate. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the wind speed on Friday had reached 15kmph and wind speeds are expected to be high on Saturday too. “From November 30, the wind speed is likely to slow down. Now, because a western disturbance is passing the winds have picked up speed, but it will slow down again,” he said. Srivastava said the temperature in Delhi and NCR is also expected to fall in the coming days because of the continuing snowfall in the regions of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh and parts of Uttarakhand. On Friday, the minimum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official recording for the city, was 10.2 degree Celsius. The maximum temperature was 27 degree Celsius. “From Saturday, the minimum temperature will start reducing by one or two degrees and reach around 7 degree Celsius by November 30,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/severe-to-moderate-in-two-days-winds-clean-delhi-air/story-1FsyYIu28G6TBLYXOxzsoJ.html

The land will now be handed over to the devotees of Guru Ravidas for temple construction.As per the Gazette notification, the land use of a 400 square metre plot has been changed from “recreational” to ”public and semi-public”. The change is land use was approved by the DDA in September in a meeting chaired by Delhi’s lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal, who is also chairman of DDA.The DDA officials said after all the necessary approval, the land use has been changed in the Master Plan of Delhi-2021.In August last year, the DDA had demolished the temple, located at the city forest, in pursuance of a Supreme Court order. This had led to larges-cale protest by the devotees of Guru Ravidas in Delhi and several parts of north India. In November 2019, the Supreme Court had allowed construction of the temple at the same location.A DDA official said the process to allot the land to devotees will be initiated once they register themselves as a society or committee. “According to rules, the land can only be allotted to a committee and there is no committee as such registered at present,” the official said, on condition of anonymity.MR Balli, general secretary of the 11-member committee that was constituted following the Supreme Court order, said the devotees are in the process of registering themselves as a society under the Societies Act. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a delay in getting the society registered as our members are spread across the country. But we will very soon get it done, as we want the temple to be rebuilt at the earliest,” he said.He further said, “DDA officials had told us that they have initiated the process to change the land use. But we are not aware of the notification being issued.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/dda-notifies-change-in-land-use-of-plot-in-city-forest-for-ravidas-temple-construction/story-7cySrHAPwNtRU0OStQhAcO.html

The councillors also staged a protest and raised slogans against the civic body at the micro forest developed by MC at the banks of Buddha Nullah near Chand cinema on Friday. A group of councillors including Inder Aggarwal, Parabhjot Kaur, Surinder Atwal among others visited Buddha Nullah to apprise the monitoring committee of ground reality. However, they accused the MC officials of changing the route of the NGT team so that the BJP councillors could not meet them.Leader of BJP councillors Sunita Rani said, “The civic body is doing nothing to improve the condition of Buddha Nullah and swings into action a few days ahead of the NGT team visit. Illegal fish markets have been set up alongside the stream and no concrete action is being taken against violators even when they dump the waste into the nullah. The fish market was removed from the area just before the NGT team’s visit.”Former deputy mayor RD Sharma said, “Garbage is accumulated in the nullah at different points and even the banks are not clean. The MC swung into action only two days ago and got a few areas cleaned where the team had to visit. However, nothing concrete is being done to provide a long-term solution to stop the dumping of waste into the stream.”The MC officials, however, said that the NGT team decided the route plan. The government is working to reduce the pollution levels of Buddha Nullah and has planned a Rs 650-crore project for the same. Despite repeated attempts, MC Commissioner, Pardeep Sabharwal could not be reached for comment. Former senior deputy mayor launches campaignFormer senior deputy mayor Parveen Bansal along with his supporters have initiated a campaign to reduce the pollution in the nullah. Bansal said that they will also take up the matter with Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat over the issue.Bansal said, “During my tenure, I had removed encroachments alongside the nullah. However, the MC has done nothing after that. Now, we have initiated a campaign, Buddha Nullah- A mission. We will also involve the public and ask for their suggestions through social networking sites. These suggestions will be put in front of Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/buddha-nullah-pollution-bjp-councillors-accuse-ludhiana-mc-of-misleading-ngt-stage-protest/story-pbMFtgmB858NKJcRd6lFLP.html

28-11-2020||Pune||Leprosy detection drive in Pune hit by Covid cases overload||The district administration is launching a special drive to detect unreported leprosy cases in the district under the “Leprosy-free Pune” programme. The annual drive was affected this year as the administration was handling Covid-19 cases. With the district machinery overburdened with the coronavirus situation, detection of new leprosy cases and providing medication and treatment to existing patients were not carried out. Timely treatment provides relief from future complications for patients. While more than 600 new leprosy patients could be detected in the district during last year (2019-2020), this year only 118 new cases were reported.Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO), zilla parishad said, “As per the guideline by the health and family welfare department, central ministry, to avoid complications for patients suffering from leprosy, timely detection and treatment is essential. It is also important to prevent any more social boycott or misunderstanding regarding leprosy. To prevent further spread of leprosy, we will conduct a door-to-door survey to detect patients having initial symptoms and also provide free medication to existing patients who could not get regular medical attention due to the pandemic.” Dr Hukumchand Patole, assistant coordinator, health department (leprosy), said, “The detection and reporting of leprosy cases have been hampered and so this survey will help us find those cases which are unaware or are not reporting to us. If they are detected on time then under various schemes the government provides free timely treatment and medications too. Due to the Covid pandemic, the staff which is responsible for detection were unavailable and also rural hospitals were converted into dedicated Covid hospitals.” Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who chairs the Maharashtra Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said, “Early detection and timely treatment can help in eliminating leprosy. It is a shame that we have not been able to eliminate the ailment even in 2020 when the goal was set to eliminate this disease back by 2018. Leprosy was always considered a tropical disease and so it was never prioritised. During surveys, we found that even kids were infected, which is why we could never meet our goal.” District collector Rajesh Deshmukh said, “I appeal to residents to coordinate with the squad during the survey. It is important that patients are detected on time and they receive the right treatment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/leprosy-detection-drive-in-pune-hit-by-covid-cases-overload/story-N2Yv5L3xShgsGUCfvx6QXK.html

If they lose, the Republican-ruled chamber will go to the Democrats, who already control the House of Representatives.Friday’s ruling on Pennsylvania by the three-judge bench of the 3rd circuit courts of appeal was one more setback for the president, whose lawsuits have been dismissed and derided by courts.“Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy,” wrote judge Stephanos Bibas in the ruling. “Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.” Bibas is a Trump appointee, and the other two judges were all appointed by Republican presidents.The lawsuit seeking to block the state from certifying Biden’s victory was earlier dismissed by a lower court that said its fraud allegation was “without merit” and “like Frankenstein’s monster, has been haphazardly stitched together”.Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis tweeted after Friday verdict, “On to SCOTUS!” She was referring to the Supreme Court.Along with his legal efforts, Trump has also sought to rope in Republican legislatures in the battleground states to overturn the election. He tried unsuccessfully in Michigan and has now pinned his hopes on state legislators in Pennsylvania, who are running with the same discredited charges.Trump is fast running out of time. He has until December 8, the last day for states to certify the election outcomes. Electors of the electoral college granted to both him and Biden will vote on December 14 to formalise the results. Biden has beaten Trump 306-232 in electoral votes.Trump returns to the campaign trail in Georgia, a solidly Republican state won by Biden this time, amid wild poll fraud and corruption allegations levelled by him and his lawyers against Republican leaders of the state - governor Brian Kemp and secretary of state Brad Raffensperger.Both of them have been voters and supporters of the president, but find themselves in his crosshairs for backing his baseless election fraud claims. Republican senators seeking re-election, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have sided with the president for fear of angering his supporters. The Republican Party is at war with itself there.If Perdue and Loeffler lose, the Senate will be a 50-50 tie between Republicans and Democrats who hold 50 and 48 seats respectively after the November 3 elections. With vice-president Kamala Harris as the tie vote, Democrats in that case will seize the chamber.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-loses-yet-another-legal-battle-will-campaign-in-georgia/story-zIWFnqdzhv8WkfRGLP0y3L.html

Previously, it was forbidden to leave home for more than an hour and travel more than a kilometer from the place of residence.Meanwhile, stores resuming their operations should follow stricter sanitary rules -- they need at least eight square meters (86 square feet) of space per one customer. Beauty salons and hairdressers are required to provide services only by the previous appointment.The second stage of easing coronavirus-related restrictions is set to begin on December 15 and envisages a curfew instead of quarantine and lifting a ban on the citizens’ movement across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-begins-to-gradually-ease-covid-19-related-restrictions/story-nKG5YNszW4gLqRMQGt0xfO.html

The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, is returning to London to restart face-to-face talks this weekend. There are still major issues to be resolved around access to British fishing waters, security arrangements and competition.If a deal can be agreed, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to put it to parliament before Christmas. His majority of 80 in the house means any deal is likely to go through even if the Labour party abstains from voting. But Starmer believes the consequences of a no-deal Brexit from the transition period would be too dire for the party to simply abstain and stand on the sidelines, the Guardian said, without citing sources. The paper said Starmer is likely to avoid using language such as “supporting” the deal and will make a speech setting out more details of how Labour sees Britain’s future place in the world.David Frost, who’s leading the UK’s Brexit negotiating team, was downbeat on the chances of securing a deal this week. “Some people are asking me why we are still talking,” Frost tweeted. “My answer is that it’s my job to do my utmost to see if the conditions for a deal exist. It is late, but a deal is still possible, and I will continue to talk until it’s clear that it isn’t.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-s-labour-party-could-back-brexit-deal-says-report/story-dZ2QGtubMOFfVSDe4mYesL.html

28-11-2020||World||Iranian scientist killing could trigger serious confrontation with Israel. Here’s why||The killing of a top Iranian scientist could snowball into a serious confrontation in the region as the Islamic Republic has vowed to avenge the death. Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran’s most senior nuclear scientist, was killed in an ambush near Tehran on Friday, triggering strong reactions from country’s top leadership.Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday accused Israel of assassinating the scientist, who was long suspected by the west of masterminding the secret nuclear programme for the country. “Once again, the wicked hands of the global arrogance, with the usurper Zionist regime as the mercenary, were stained with the blood of a son of this nation,” Rouhani said in a statement published on his official website.Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called for “definitive punishment” of those behind the assassination of the scientist, calling Fakhrizadeh as “the country’s prominent and distinguished nuclear and defensive scientist.”Hossein Dehghan, the military adviser to Khamenei, vowed to “strike as thunder at the killers of this oppressed martyr”, suggesting Israel’s hand behind the assassination. Taking to Twitter, Dehghan said that Israel seels to intensify the pressure on Iran for a “full-blown war” in the last few days of the Trump administration.Also Read | Iran’s supreme leader vows revenge over slain scientistWhat is JCPoA or Iran nuclear deal?The United States, Russia, China, Germany, Britain and France entered a deal with Iran in 2015, agreeing to provide sanctions relief in lieu of preventing the nation from developing nuclear weapons. Later in 2018, US President Donald Trump announced Washington’s withdrawal from that Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA), calling it “the worst deal ever”.Since then, the Trump administration has continued to impose sanctions on Tehran as a part of its “maximum pressure” campaign. However, US’ withdrawal prompted Iran to renege on its commitments made under the nuclear deal and escalated its uranium enrichment.Also Read | Who is the Iranian scientist killed in Tehran?Why is Iran suspecting Israel?Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Iran of continuing to seek nuclear weapons and warned about a secret atomic warehouse. “Remember that name, Fakhrizadeh,” Netanyahu had said in 2018, referring to the now slain scientist. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspected the alleged atomic warehouse site in February 2019 and found traces of uranium. IAEA published a report on Iran’s nuclear activities and the implementation of its commitment under JCPoA.The global watchdog reported that Iran has stockpiled more than 12 times the amount of enriched uranium permitted under the nuclear deal. The UN agency observed that the presence of multiple uranium particles of anthropogenic origin at a location not declared to it still needs to be fully and promptly explained by Iran to allay any possible concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-scientist-killing-could-trigger-serious-confrontation-with-israel-here-s-why/story-GqTZOLLAoxeaFDZ7bOeVrL.html
28-11-2020||World||Protests to erupt over security law as France reels from police violence||Dozens of rallies are planned Saturday against a new French law that would restrict sharing images of police, only days after the country was shaken by footage showing officers beating and racially abusing a black man.The case shocked France with celebrities and politicians alike condemning the officers’ actions, and has brought debate over President Emmanuel Macron’s law to boiling point.Macron on Friday called the incident an “unacceptable attack” and asked the government to come up with proposals to “fight against discrimination”.One of the most controversial elements of the new law is Article 24, which would criminalise the publication of images of on-duty police officers with the intent of harming their “physical or psychological integrity”.It was passed by the National Assembly last week -- although it is awaiting Senate approval -- provoking rallies and protests across France.Rally organisers are calling for the article to be withdrawn, claiming that it contradicts “the fundamental public freedoms of our Republic”.“This bill aims to undermine the freedom of the press, the freedom to inform and be informed, the freedom of expression,” one of Saturday’s protest organisers said.Trade unions are expected to join the demonstrations, with members of the yellow vests -- whose sometimes violent protests in 2018 and 2019 shook the country -- also expected. In Paris, the authorities had demanded that organisers limit the rally to a single location, but on Friday evening officials authorised a march.And in a sign that the government could be preparing to backtrack, Prime Minister Jean Castex announced Friday that he would appoint a commission to redraft Article 24.Under the article, offenders could be sentenced to up to a year in jail, and fined 45,000 euros ($53,000) for sharing images of police officers.The government says the provision is intended to protect officers from doxxing and online abuse, but critics say it is further evidence of the Macron administration’s slide to the right.But media unions say it could give police a green light to prevent journalists -- and social media users -- from documenting abuses.They point to the case of music producer Michel Zecler, whose racial abuse and beating at the hands of police was recorded by CCTV and later published online, provoking widespread criticism of the officers’ actions.In another instance, journalists on the ground at a French migrant camp witnessed and recorded police brutality on Monday as the Paris area was cleared.In a letter seen by AFP, Paris police chief Didier Lallement wrote to officers ahead of Saturday’s demonstration that “in the coming days, the coming weeks... there’s no doubt you will face difficulty, doubt, even anger and fear”.But he insisted that he could “count on the integrity, sense of honour and ethics” among the force.Protests over police brutality have already taken place elsewhere in country.In the southern city of Toulouse demonstrators took to the streets on Friday evening brandishing placards with slogans like “police everywhere, justice nowhere”.In western Nantes police said around 3,500 rallied, while organisers put the crowd at 6,000-7,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-to-erupt-over-security-law-as-france-reels-from-police-violence/story-dtwexpSq1pmYLS9jLU7zWJ.html

An issue with a batch of testing chemicals meant their test results were void,” a department spokesman said in an emailed statement.“Swift action was taken to notify those affected and they have been asked to take another test, and to continue to self-isolate if they have symptoms.”The laboratory error that led to the problem was an “isolated incident” and was being investigated, the statement said.The government has announced an extra 7 billion pounds ($9.31 billion) for its Covid-19 testing and contact tracing system as part of an expanded programme of mass testing.The NHS Test and Trace system has been heavily criticised after a series of high-profile failures since its launch earlier this year, and ministers concede it has not performed as well as they had hoped.In September, nearly 16,000 positive case records were lost from the system for several days – causing a delay in contact tracing. The government blamed a “legacy” file system that cut off records after about 65,000 rows of data.Reuters analysis and interviews with contact tracers have shown issues with the system, and that when looking at non-household contacts, the proportion that is successfully traced is lower.The United Kingdom has had about 1.6 million coronavirus cases and over 57,500 deaths, according to a Reuters tally https://tmsnrt.rs/3cBeEYg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-testing-error-wrongly-tells-1-300-people-they-have-coronavirus/story-akr5aRtLp0NtM4hJlhKWVM.html

The people want political leaders to help them, not constantly fight for power,” Muhyiddin said.Malaysia is facing a new wave of coronavirus infections, with cumulative cases rising more than four-fold since September to more than 60,000 as of Friday.

28-11-2020||World||Joe Biden’s win means some Guantanamo prisoners may be released||The oldest prisoner at the Guantanamo Bay detention center went to his latest review board hearing with a degree of hope, something that has been scarce during his 16 years locked up without charges at the US base in Cuba.Saifullah Paracha, a 73-year-old Pakistani with diabetes and a heart condition, had two things going for him that he didn’t have at previous hearings: a favorable legal development and the election of Joe Biden.President Donald Trump had effectively ended the Obama administration’s practice of reviewing the cases of men held at Guantanamo and releasing them if imprisonment was no longer deemed necessary. Now there’s hope that will resume under Biden.“I am more hopeful now simply because we have an administration to look forward to that isn’t dead set on ignoring the existing review process,” Paracha’s attorney, Shelby Sullivan-Bennis, said by phone from the base on Nov. 19 after the hearing.“The simple existence of that on the horizon I think is hope for all of us.” Guantanamo was once a source of global outrage and a symbol of US excess in response to terrorism. But it largely faded from the headlines after President Barack Obama failed to close it, even as 40 men continue to be detained there.Those pushing for its closure now see a window of opportunity, hoping Biden’s administration will find a way to prosecute those who can be prosecuted and release the rest, extricating the US from a detention center that costs more than $445 million per year.Biden’s precise intentions for Guantanamo remain unclear. Transition spokesman Ned Price said the president-elect supports closing it, but it would be inappropriate to discuss his plans in detail before he’s in office.His reticence is actually welcome to those who have pressed to close Guantanamo. Obama’s early pledge to close it is now seen as a strategic mistake that undercut what had been a bipartisan issue.“I think it’s more likely to close if it doesn’t become a huge press issue,” said Andrea Prasow, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch.The detention center opened in 2002. President George W. Bush’s administration transformed what had been a sleepy Navy outpost on Cuba’s southeastern tip into a place to interrogate and imprison people suspected of links to al-Qaida and the Taliban after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.US authorities maintain the men can be held as “law of war” detainees, remaining in custody for the duration of hostilities, an open-ended prospect.At its peak in 2003 — the year Paracha was captured in Thailand because of suspected ties to al-Qaida — Guantanamo held about 700 prisoners from nearly 50 countries. Bush announced his intention to close it, though 242 were still held there when his presidency ended.The Obama administration, seeking to allay concerns that some of those released had “returned to the fight,” set up a process to ensure those repatriated or resettled in third countries no longer posed a threat. It also planned to try some of the men in federal court.But his closure effort was thwarted when Congress barred the transfer of prisoners from Guantanamo to the US, including for prosecution or medical care. Obama ended up releasing 197 prisoners, leaving 41 for Trump.Trump in his 2016 campaign promised to “load” Guantanamo with “some bad dudes,” but largely ignored the issue after rescinding Obama’s policies. His administration approved a single release, a Saudi who pleaded guilty before a military commission.Of those remaining, seven men have cases pending before a military commission. They include five men accused of planning and supporting the Sept. 11 attacks. Additionally, there are two prisoners who were convicted by commission and three facing potential prosecution for the 2002 Bali bombing.Commission proceedings, including death penalty cases related to the Sept. 11 attacks, have bogged down as the defense fights to exclude evidence that resulted from torture. Trials are likely far in the future and would inevitably be followed by years of appeals.Defense attorneys say the incoming administration could authorize more military commission plea deals. Some have also suggested Guantanamo detainees could plead guilty in federal court by video and serve any remaining sentence in other countries, so they wouldn’t enter the United States.Detainee advocates also say Biden could defy Congress and bring prisoners to the US, arguing that the ban wouldn’t stand up in court.“It’s either do something about it or they die there without charge,” said Wells Dixon, a lawyer for two prisoners, including one who has pleaded guilty in the military commission and is awaiting sentencing.The remaining detainees include five who had been cleared for release before Trump took office and have languished since. Advocates want the Biden administration to review the rest, noting that many, had they been convicted in federal court, would have served their sentences and been released at this point.“Whittle it down to the folks who are being prosecuted and either prosecute them or don’t, but don’t just hang on to them,” said Joseph Margulies, a Cornell Law School professor who has represented one prisoner. “At great expense, we walk around with this thing around our necks. It does no good. It has no role for national security. It’s just a big black stain that provides no benefit whatsoever.” Over the years, nine prisoners have died at Guantanamo: seven from apparent suicide, one from cancer and one from a heart attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-win-means-some-guantanamo-prisoners-may-be-released/story-JnoNzLz4UDpLX7DQBddzHP.html
28-11-2020||World||England’s hospitals could be overwhelmed without new tier lockdown system, says minister||Hospitals in England risk being overwhelmed if lawmakers do not support the government’s new plan for restrictions, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said on Saturday. More than 20 million people across large swathes of England will be forced to live under the toughest category of Covid-19 restrictions when a national lockdown ends on Dec. 2. Lawmakers are due to vote on the restrictions the day before.But a growing number of lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative party have voiced opposition to the tiered restrictions plan.Some argue that the areas they represent have low infection rates but the toughest rules, while others say the new measures will cause unnecessary economic harm to local businesses. Defending the government’s plans in an article in The Times newspaper, Gove said “difficult decisions” were necessary to confront the crisis. The virus “is no respecter of constituency boundaries and the hardships we are facing now are unfortunately necessary to protect every single one of us, no matter where we live,” he wrote.The level of infection across the country remained “uncomfortably and threateningly high,” Gove said, noting that the number of hospital beds filled with infected patients was not far from its peak earlier in the year.He said that from the current high base, the National Health Service would be under severe threat if infections started to rise again, and tougher measures were needed to manage the virus when the current lockdown ends. “These new tiers, alongside the wider deployment of mass testing, have the capacity to prevent our NHS being overwhelmed until vaccines arrive,” Gove said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-s-hospitals-could-be-overwhelmed-without-new-tier-lockdown-system-says-minister/story-t16Rc7uCsdqxy04SO4sI3K.html

It says there is no issue of sovereignty to be resolved over them.China has also been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing’s concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.Beijing’s rising assertiveness against counter claimants in the East and South Sea has resulted in unprecedented agreement across the Indian-Pacific.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-condemns-china-s-claim-of-sovereignty-over-senkaku-islands/story-IBK9ZRezFqs9S5NxBZyvoL.html

28-11-2020||World||Justin Trudeau’s office mistakenly sends out statement rebuking Oppn leader in a conversation before it actually happened||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called out Opposition leader Erin O’Toole and his Conservative Party for spreading “misinformation” about the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a readout issued by the PMO. But there was a problem with that statement - it was issued before the two leaders had their conversation. An embarrassed PMO later had to clarify that the draft had been mistakenly circulated. The actual account of the dialogue was far more amicable, as it read that they “discussed the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as vaccine distribution in Canada” other than the incoming Joe Biden administration in the US, and the fate of two Canadians being held by China.The original readout which “raised concerns around Covid-19 misinformation being promoted by Conservative members of parliament” was sent 45 minutes before the scheduled time of the call and the final conciliatory version issued late in the evening.That faux pas came even as Trudeau’s government is facing mounting criticism over its slow reaction to the pandemic, particularly with regard to timely procurement of a vaccine by Canada and the lack of manufacturing facilities within the country, leading to reliance on imports.That matter has become even more of a lightning rod since Canada recorded a single-day high of cases on Friday, at 5,963, taking the total to 358,774 with the death toll at 11,894.Trudeau has now assured Canadians that all those who want to be vaccinated will be able to get a shot by September next year, while public health officials asserted that doses will start flowing in by the first quarter of 2021.Those assurances came as the government also announced a military commander will lead the massive distribution effort. Major-General Dany Fortin, presently chief of staff to the Canadian joint operations command, has been given that task while a new unit, the national operations centre, has been established within the Public Health Agency of Canada. The centre will coordinate the vaccination effort and will be supported by Canada’s armed forces.“Canada is well prepared for large-scale rollouts of vaccines, but this will be the biggest immunisation in the history of the country. We must reach everyone who wants a vaccine, no matter where they live,” Trudeau said, according to CBC News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-s-office-mistakenly-sends-out-statement-rebuking-oppn-leader-in-a-conversation-before-it-actually-happened/story-m6H7SRox7MCDb3PNARvImK.html

We will continue to use all our sanctions tools to prevent Iran from advancing its missile capabilities,” Pompeo said.The companies are Chengdu Best New Materials Co Ltd and Zibo Elim Trade Co, Ltd. in China and Nilco Group, which is also known as Nil Fam Khazar Company and Santers Holding and Joint Stock Company Elecon in Russia for transferring sensitive technology and items to Iran’s missile programme.President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the landmark Iran nuclear deal in 2018. After withdrawing from the Iranian nuclear deal, Trump has asked all countries to reduce their purchase of oil from Iran to zero or face secondary sanctions.Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. Pompeo said all countries need to be vigilant to efforts by Iran to advance its missile programme.“These measures are part of our response to Iran’s malign activities. These determinations underscore the continuing need for all countries to remain vigilant to efforts by Iran to advance its missile programme,” Pompeo said.“We will continue to work to impede Iran’s missile development efforts and use our sanctions authorities to spotlight the foreign suppliers, such as these entities in the People’s Republic of China and Russia that provide missile-related materials and technology to Iran. The sanctions imposed include restrictions on US government procurement, US government assistance, and exports and will be in effect for two years,” he said.Pompeo said the imposition of sanctions against these foreign entities is consistent with the efforts of the US to use all available measures to prevent Iran from advancing its missile capabilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-sanctions-on-russian-chinese-companies-for-supporting-iran-missile-programme/story-0dR3rQuGdhcjg3TkUZoO0N.html
28-11-2020||World||Los Angeles virus restrictions to halt nearly all gatherings||Los Angeles county on Friday announced a temporary ban on gatherings of people from different households under a new “safer-at-home order” triggered by a spike in Covid-19 cases, with religious services and protests exempt.The order affecting the United States’ second-largest city will take effect Monday and last at least three weeks, until December 20, the county’s public health department said.“In the new Order that goes into effect on Monday, residents are advised to stay home as much as possible,” said a statement.“All public and private gatherings with individuals not in your household are prohibited, except for faith based services and protests, which are constitutionally protected rights,” it added.Densely populated Los Angeles county has suffered over 7,600 coronavirus deaths -- more than a third of California’s fatalities -- although Covid-19 is increasingly prevalent in the Golden State’s remote rural areas.California last week imposed a night-time curfew across much of the state, while Los Angeles county on Wednesday barred dining at restaurants but allowed delivery to continue.The order comes as Los Angeles county’s average new daily cases passed 4,500 for the week, triggering the tougher measures.The “safer-at-home” measures are not as severe as the city’s first lockdown in March, which saw almost all businesses close their physical premises.But the new order reduces occupancy limits at various businesses that can remain open, including shops, spa and libraries.All schools can remain open unless they record outbreaks.“These targeted measures are in effect for the next three weeks and still allow for many essential and non-essential activities where residents are always masked and distanced,” said public health director Barbara Ferrer.“We know we are asking a lot from so many who have been sacrificing for months on end and we hope that L.A. County residents continue following Public Health safety measures that we know can slow the spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/los-angeles-virus-restrictions-to-halt-nearly-all-gatherings/story-IxOtgmIwLkua0Ie1wBMPwM.html
28-11-2020||World||Iran accuses Israel, US in assassination of nuclear scientist||Iran accused Israel and the US of being behind the assassination of one of its top nuclear scientists on Friday and vowed revenge, sharply escalating tensions in the Persian Gulf in the final weeks of Donald Trump’s presidency.Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was the head of research and innovation at Iran’s Ministry of Defense and widely seen as having a major role in the country’s nuclear program. He was killed close to the Damavand campus of Islamic Azad University, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of central Tehran, the semi-official Tasnim news reported.“Terrorists murdered an eminent Iranian scientist today. This cowardice -- with serious indications of Israeli role -- shows desperate warmongering of perpetrators,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a tweet, without offering any evidence for Israel’s involvement.Iran’s army said the US also bore responsibility, according to the Iranian Labor News Agency. The Minister of Defense, Amir Hatami, told state TV the killing was “clearly linked” to the US assassination of General Qassem Soleimani by drone in January.The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment, as did officials at the Pentagon. The Central Intelligence Agency didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether the US had knowledge of plans to carry out an assassination.Trump re-tweeted a New York Times report on Fakhrizadeh’s killing without comment, as well as a tweet by an Israeli journalist who called the killing “a major psychological and professional blow for Iran.” Also Read |  ‘Serious indications of Israeli role’ in killing of scientist, says Iran FMPhotos published by the semi-official Fars news agency, purportedly from the scene, showed blood splattered on the street next to an Iranian-made black passenger car with the window down on the driver’s side. The car’s windshield had been shattered by several bullet holes.Fakhrizadeh’s death following the killing of four other Iranian nuclear scientists since 2010, with Tehran usually blaming the intelligence agencies of its arch foes, Israel and the USWhile Israeli officials didn’t comment, the country has long viewed Iran’s nuclear research efforts as one of its biggest national security threats. Israel has vowed to take any measures necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear warheads, weapons Tehran says it has never sought to develop.‘Stuxnet’ AttackThe US and Israel are also widely believed to have worked together on a cyber attack which struck centrifuges linked to Tehran’s nuclear program about a decade ago.Netanyahu had singled out Fakhrizadeh in an April 2018 presentation he gave on Iran’s nuclear program, claiming that the scientist was the director of a secret project to develop nuclear weapons.The United Nations’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has said “Project Amad” was mothballed in 2003, and Iran dismissed Netanyahu’s presentations at the time as “lies and war-mongering.”The assassination of Fakhrizadeh comes at a sensitive time in Iran as Trump’s defeat in the Nov 3 US election offers an opportunity to reset ties with the West after years of economic and military confrontation.Call for RevengeHis death could trigger the sort of popular anger that followed the targeted killing of Soleimani in a US drone strike in Baghdad ordered by Trump. Iran fired missiles at bases housing American troops in Iraq in response to that attack, causing no fatalities but raising fears of a slide to war between the two adversaries.Iranian forces also inadvertently shot down one of their own passenger airplanes in response to the Soleimani strike.Zarif urged the international community to condemn the latest attack, while the head of Iran’s armed forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, called for the assassination to be avenged.In a letter to the UN Security Council, Majid Takht Ravanchi, Iran’s ambassador to the UN, urged the organization to condemn the attack and warned the US and Israel to refrain from any “adventuristic measures,” especially during the American presidential transition.Axios reported this week that Israel’s government had instructed the military to prepare for a possible US strike against Iran during the remainder of Trump’s term, though it said the order wasn’t based on intelligence or an assessment that the US would order an attack.Fakhrizadeh was also named in a March 2007 UN Security Council Resolution as having been involved in Iran’s “nuclear or ballistic missile activities.”Friday’s killing comes close to the 10th anniversary of the assassination of another scientist, Majid Shahriari, who was killed in a car bombing on Nov 29, 2010.Car BombingA number of Fakhrizadeh’s security guards were wounded in the Friday attack, in which his car was shot at before a Nissan laden with explosives detonated about 15 to 20 meters away, Hatami told state TV.Also Read | Who is the Iranian scientist killed in Tehran?Hatami said Fakhrizadeh was involved in an air-defense project for detecting spy aircraft without using radar systems and that “Israel was well aware of his role in affairs that could confound” Israel. Iran’s expanding missile program is a key concern for both the US and Israel, but it’s the nuclear issue that has drawn the greatest scrutiny.Iran broke limits on the amount of low-enriched uranium it was allowed to store under the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers after Trump exited the accord in 2018 and imposed sweeping economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic.Tehran’s store of low-enriched uranium increased to about 2,443 kilograms (5,386 pounds) from 2,105 kilograms, according to the latest report by the UN monitors. That’s enough to create three bombs if Iran chose to enrich the material to weapons grade.President-elect Joe Biden has said the US could re-enter the nuclear agreement if Iran returns to compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-accuses-israel-us-in-assassination-of-nuclear-scientist/story-vQxWyFjsV26Xvfo8MNjaVO.html

A faction of the party, led by former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ has become strident in its opposition to Oli. HT learns that Oli has told his supporters he is open to a split in the party – an eventuality China has been working to avert. China has been seen as playing the role of a peacemaker in the NCP in the past.The prime minister’s change in stance comes at a time when he is making a concerted effort to mend ties with New Delhi and get the two countries to start discussions on differences over Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh.Also read: No change in foreign secy’s Nepal visit, say officials amid buzz over PM Oli’s futureA Nepal watcher in India said the shift in PM Oli’s approach could be attributed to an attempt to reclaim the nationalist agenda that was the mainstay of his campaign that resulted in the NCP’s win in 2018. That China lately appeared indifferent to his continuation in the government if this helps avoid a split in the party is also believed to have contributed to Oli’s stand.Interestingly, Chinese defence minister General Wei Fenghe is visiting Nepal over the weekend and it is expected that some of the conversations that he has could be linked to the NCP’s affairs.“Gen Wei will spend four hours at army headquarters,” a diplomat in Kathmandu said on condition of anonymity, suggesting that the Chinese outreach to the army could also be linked to the political flux in the government.Also read: India could resume foreign secretary-level dialogue with Nepal. There is one conditionThrough November, Oli has faced unusually sharp attacks from Prachanda who had put out a 19-page document hugely critical of the prime minister.

28-11-2020||World||French president ‘very shocked’ by alleged police beating of Black music producer: Report||French President Emmanuel Macron is “very shocked” by images purporting to show a Black music producer being beaten up and racially abused by Paris police, BFM TV reported, quoting comments given to it by the presidency.French authorities are investigating allegations that the music producer, who has given his identity as Michel, was assaulted and racially abused during a police check after CCTV footage of the incident was released.Also Read: Violence erupts in Brazil after Black man beaten to death at Carrefour storeThe beating inside the entrance of a building was captured on closed circuit television and mobile phone footage which circulated online and was headline news on French TV channels.The alleged attack on Michel risks inflaming racial tension with allegations of repeated police brutality against Black and ethnic communities at the forefront of many people’s minds after the death of Black American George Floyd in Minneapolis in May sparked the “BlackLivesMatter” movement.Paris police had already faced criticism this week after social media photos and videos showed officers hitting protesters as they cleared out an illegal migrants campsite in a central Paris square.The music producer told reporters he was jumped on by police at his studio in Paris’s 17th arrondissement on Nov. 21.He said he had been walking in the street without a face mask - against French Covid-19 health protocols - and, upon seeing a police car, went into his nearby studio to avoid getting a fine. However, he said, the police followed him inside and began to assault and racially abuse him.Also Read: Europe needs its own sovereignty in defence, even with new US govt: Emmanuel MacronInterior Minister Gerald Darmanin told France 2 television on Thursday that the officers would be sanctioned if the alleged wrongdoing was confirmed.The incident occurred amid controversy over a draft law that would limit journalists’ ability to show images of French police officers at work. In response to protests and complaints from free expression advocates, the prime minister’s office said on Thursday it would set up an independent commission tasked with proposing a new version of the legislation.Some “BlackLivesMatter” protests broke out in Paris in June, a month following the death of George Floyd after a white police officer knelt on his neck in the street for nearly nine minutes in the course of arresting him. The outrage generated by Floyd’s death has resonated in France, in particular in deprived city suburbs where police often clash with youths from ethnic minority backgrounds. The protests in Paris in June focused on unsolved cases of people dying during police operations, such as Adama Traore, who died in police detention near Paris in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-very-shocked-by-alleged-police-beating-of-black-music-producer-report/story-6YDWvvCSBIoKRZvBrOHSfL.html
28-11-2020||World||‘10 Covid-19 vaccines could be available by mid-2021’: Global pharma group||Ten Covid-19 vaccines could be available by the middle of next year if they win regulatory approval, but their inventors need patent protection, the head of the global pharmaceutical industry group said on Friday.Vaccines by Pfizer and BioNtech, as well as Moderna and AstraZeneca have shown promising results in large clinical trials, but there is no question of “cutting corners”, said Thomas Cueni, director-general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA). Also Read: First Covid-19 case reported in Wuhan, doesn’t mean virus originated here: China“So far 3 we have 3 out of 3 were hits. I would expect that we will see something similar with Johnson & Johnson, I would expect that we would see similar positive results with Novavax, and many others, Sanofi Pasteur, GSK are in there, Merck,” he said.‘Big Pharma’ and biotech firms have invested heavily in research and development and in boosting manufacturing during the pandemic to be able to roll out vaccine doses, Cueni told a Geneva news briefing.It would be a mistake to lift patent protection to allow compulsory licensing and try to make vaccines requiring such complex quality assurance without expert staff and quality control procedures, he said.“We will hopefully by the next summer have probably 10 vaccines which have proven their value. But all of them really need to be submitted by rigorous scientific scrutiny by the regulators.”At the World Trade Organization (WTO), India and South Africa have proposed allowing a temporary waiver to allow compulsory licensing for patented products during the pandemic. The United States, European Union and Switzerland and others have rejected it, trade officials say.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayCueni, asked about the proposal, said: “For me this questioning of IP is really primarily politics, but it’s politics which is not helpful because it would send very negative signals in terms of disrespect to the system which allowed the world to react so fast and so responsibly.”Vaccine manufacturing plants often need 50 quality assurance staff making hundreds of checks during production, he said, emphasising that the companies would not exploit the pandemic.Cueni said that IFPMA archives showed there had never been a compulsory license granted for a vaccine and pointed to the difficult technology and know-how. Nearly every member company had committed to “not-for-profit” or socially responsible pricing during the pandemic, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-covid-19-vaccines-could-be-available-by-mid-2021-global-pharma-group/story-clFmEqi56iXDDYbIAjL4WJ.html

He noted the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany have mass vaccine-production facilities but Canada does not.Opposition parties criticized Trudeau for not ensuring Canadians get priority access to vaccines.Trudeau said Friday he expects vaccines to start arriving early next year — but what month Canadians will get the first doses remains an open question.“The race to get to the starting line first, I can understand, but this pandemic doesn’t get over until we reached the finish line,” Trudeau said.“What really matters is when we get to cross the finish line and the fact that the doctors highlighted that if all goes according to plan, we should be able to have a majority of Canadians vaccinated by next September, puts us in a very good stead.”Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada’s deputy chief medical officer, said it would be by the end of next year but said Trudeau’s timeline “is in the same ballpark.”Top Canadian health officials said Thursday Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate could be approved in Canada next month and if all goes according to plan 3 million Canadians could get shots by the end of March. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is meeting Dec. 10 to consider whether to give the go-ahead to Pfizer.Canada has a purchase deal to buy at least 20 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine.Ontario Premier Doug Ford hopes to get the first doses in January.“I can’t emphasize enough with the prime minister that the clock is ticking,” Ford said.Toronto is on lockdown and the country’s largest province of Ontario reported a record 1,855 cases on Friday.“We’re in for some of the toughest days of this pandemic,” Trudeau saidTrudeau said Canada, which has a population of 37 million, has signed deals that could give Canada the most per capita vaccines in the world. And he said the Canadian military will play a role in distribution of the vaccine. An army general will oversee it.“This will be the biggest immunization in the history of the country,” Trudeau said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-pm-trudeau-expects-most-of-canada-to-be-vaccinated-by-september/story-2kamZSoD4zHZfQN6vYVAxN.html
28-11-2020||World||Court tells Donald Trump: ‘Calling vote unfair doesn’t make it so’||A federal appeals court on Friday flatly dismissed President Donald Trump’s claim that the election was unfair and refused to freeze Joe Biden’s win in the key state of Pennsylvania.In a scathing review of the Trump campaign’s arguments that the president was cheated in his November 3 reelection bid, three appeals court judges unanimously said that allegations of unfairness were not supported by evidence.“Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so,” the court said.In appealing a lower court ruling, the Trump campaign claimed discrimination, the judges noted.“But its alchemy cannot transmute lead into gold,” the court said.It was the latest in more than two dozen court defeats around the country for the Trump campaign and Republicans who have alleged fraud and other misconduct contributed to the president’s loss.Trump persists in arguing that Biden’s clear victory is invalid.“Just so you understand, this election was a fraud,” he told reporters on Thursday.Last week a Pennsylvania state court rejected arguments by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani that the millions of votes in the state should be thrown out due to fraud.The judge in that case, however, embarrassed Giuliani by forcing him to admit that none of his precise claims before the court involved fraud or anything more than technical issues in overseeing the vote count.On Tuesday the Pennsylvania government officially certified Biden’s victory in the state, and the Trump campaign appealed to federal court to have that certification frozen.But the appeals court said Trump’s campaign had nothing substantial to argue.“Its allegations are vague and conclusory,” the judges said.“It never alleges that anyone treated the Trump campaign or Trump votes worse than it treated the Biden campaign or Biden votes.”With Biden’s national lead in the popular vote and the electoral college now virtually unassailable, the court indicated that another appeal, to the US Supreme Court, would go nowhere.“The campaign has already litigated and lost most of these issues,” the court said.“The campaign cannot win this lawsuit. It conceded that it is not alleging election fraud.”Nevertheless, Jenna Ellis, a Trump campaign lawyer who worked with Giuliani on the case, tweeted their intent to appeal.“The activist judicial machinery in Pennsylvania continues to cover up the allegations of massive fraud ... On to SCOTUS!” she said, referring to the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/court-tells-donald-trump-calling-vote-unfair-doesn-t-make-it-so/story-Sw9a6uvTLrhgAbjw4ZOfVJ.html
28-11-2020||World||UK asks regulator to assess vaccine||The UK government has requested Britain’s medicines regulator to assess the suitability of Oxford and AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine for temporary supply, as soon as the makers submit the necessary safety, quality and efficacy data.The UK will be one of the first countries to receive the vaccine, if authorised, with AstraZeneca expecting to have up to 4mn doses ready by the end of the year and 40mn by the end of March 2021, the deparment of health and social care said in a release.The UK was the first country to sign an agreement with Oxford University and AstraZeneca, securing access to 100mn doses of the prospective vaccine. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency confirmed the government’s request and said public safety “will always come first”.Britain’s health secretary Matt Hancock said, “We have formally asked the regulator to assess the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, to understand the data and determine whether it meets rigorous safety standards.

The country’s disease control officials said Germany’s 16 states reported 22,806 cases overnight for a total since the start of the outbreak of 1,006,394.

28-11-2020||World||Will he leave the building?||US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would concede if the electoral college picked President-elect Joe Biden, and would leave the White House. But he vowed to continue pursuing poll fraud allegations until then.“Certainly, I will, and you know that,” Trump said when asked by reporters if he will leave the White House, which has become a concern as he has refused to acknowledge the outcome despite losing to Biden by a wide margin of 306-232 in electoral college votes. “It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede,” the US president insisted.The electors are scheduled to meet in their respective states on December 8 to elect the president. And on the basis of the current projected count - pending complete certification of results by all states - Biden will win. Trump spoke to reporters in the White House’s Diplomatic Reception Room after holding a teleconference with US military leaders stationed across the globe. He thanked them for their service and jokingly warned them not to eat too much turkey, then turned to the election after ending the call. He repeated grievances and angrily denounced officials in Georgia and Pennsylvania, two key swing states that helped give Biden the win. Trump claimed, despite the results, that this may not be his last Thanksgiving at the White House. And he insisted there had been “massive fraud”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-he-leave-the-building/story-1BYigSfyf3lQGpGdd2fnbM.html
28-11-2020||World||Thanksgiving testing crunch foreshadows strain in December||Americans flocked to coronavirus testing sites in the week leading up to Thanksgiving in search of a clean bill of health for travel, which drove up wait times and strained capacity.Nationally, Saturday saw a record with 1.98 million tests performed, according to Covid Tracking Project data. California set its own new mark Tuesday. New York state reported a record high of 217,721 tests this week; its statewide positive test rate was 3.18%, up from a seven-day average of 2.89%.Daily Covid-19 cases climbed throughout November, and communal gatherings over the holiday could expedite the spread, pushing cases to new heights and requiring thousands of added tests. The constraints also foreshadow another round of difficulties in December, when Americans will travel again for the holidays.Brett Giroir, the Department of Health and Human Services official who leads the administration’s Covid-19 diagnostic testing efforts, said he expects screening to return to earlier levels after Thanksgiving. “People are going to get a test just to see if they’re negative before going on travel,” he said in a briefing this week. “I do believe we’ll be back to a baseline area for those type of tests.”The U.S. reported an additional 125,082 virus cases Thursday, according to Covid Tracking Project data, though data can stream in slowly over holidays. There have been more than 263,000 deaths cumulatively, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thanksgiving-testing-crunch-foreshadows-strain-in-december/story-V4ZGnAoC4BBfS9wPQdxpWN.html
28-11-2020||World||New rule could allow gas, firing squads for US executions||The Justice Department is quietly amending its execution protocols, no longer requiring federal death sentences to be carried out by lethal injection and clearing the way to use other methods like firing squads and poison gas.The amended rule, published Friday in the Federal Register, allows the US government to conduct executions by lethal injection or use “any other manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the sentence was imposed.” A number of states allow other methods of execution, including electrocution, inhaling nitrogen gas or death by firing squad.It remains unclear whether the Justice Department will seek to use any methods other than lethal injection for executions in the future. The rule – which goes into effect on Dec. 24 – comes as the Justice Department has scheduled five executions during the lame-duck period, including three just days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.A Justice Department official said the change was made to account for the fact the Federal Death Penalty Act requires sentences be carried out in the “in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the sentence is imposed,’‘ and some of those states use methods other than lethal injection.The official said two executions scheduled in December would be done by lethal injection but didn’t provide information about three others scheduled in January. The official spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity in order to discuss the internal department protocols.The change is likely to set off intense criticism from Democrats and anti-death penalty advocates, as the Trump administration tries to push through a number of rule changes before Trump leaves office. A spokesperson for Biden told the AP earlier this month that the president-elect “opposes the death penalty now and in the future” and would work to end its use. But he did not say whether executions would be paused immediately once Biden takes office.Attorney General William Barr restarted federal executions this year after a 17-year hiatus. This year, the Justice Department has put to death more people than during the previous half-century, despite waning public support from both Democrats and Republicans for its use.All states that use the death penalty allow lethal injection – and that is the primary method in all states where other methods are allowed, according to data compiled by the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. As lethal injection drugs become difficult to obtain, some states have begun looking at alternative methods for carrying out death sentences. Alabama joined Oklahoma and Mississippi in 2018 approving the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners, allowing the state to asphyxiate condemned inmates with the gas in some cases.In some states, inmates can choose the method of their execution. In Florida, for example, an inmate can specifically ask to be put to death by electrocution and in Washington state, inmates can ask to be put to death by hanging. In Utah, prisoners sentenced before May 2004 can choose to be killed by a firing squad. The state law there also authorizes the use of a firing squad if lethal injection drugs aren’t available.In 2014, following a botched state execution in Oklahoma, President Barack Obama directed the Justice Department to conduct a broad review of capital punishment and issues surrounding lethal injection drugs.Barr said in July 2019 that the review had been completed, allowing executions to resume and approved a new procedure for lethal injections that replaced the three-drug combination previously used in federal executions with one drug, pentobarbital. The one-drug protocol is similar to the procedure used in several states, including Georgia, Missouri and Texas.Before the Trump administration resumed executions this year, the federal government had put only three inmates to death since 1988. Though there hadn’t been a federal execution since 2003, until July, the Justice Department has continued to approve death penalty prosecutions, and federal courts had continued sentencing defendants to death.Trump has spoken often about capital punishment and his belief that executions serve as an effective deterrent and an appropriate punishment for some crimes, including mass shootings and the killings of police officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-rule-could-allow-gas-firing-squads-for-us-executions/story-p6rVhWf45BQp0Bzn5EUdJN.html
28-11-2020||World||US announces reward of up to USD 5 million for information about 26/11 mastermind||Twelve years after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, the United States has announced a reward of up to USD 5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba member Sajid Mir for his “role” in the attacks in Mumbai in 2008.According to an official statement issued by the US Rewards for Justice program, “Sajid Mir, a senior member of the Pakistan-based foreign terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), is wanted for his involvement in the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India. The Rewards for Justice program is offering a reward of up to USD 5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction in any country of Sajid Mir for his role in these attacks.”On November 26, 2008, 10 terrorists, trained by the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation LeT, carried out a series of coordinated attacks against multiple targets in Mumbai -- the Taj Mahal Hotel, the Oberoi Hotel, the Leopold Cafe, the Nariman (Chabad) House, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus -- killing 166 people.In these gruesome attacks, nine terrorists were killed and the lone survivor, Ajmal Amir Kasab, was caught and sentenced to death. On November 11, 2012, Kasab was hanged at Yerwada Central Jail in Pune.“Sajid Mir was LeT’s operations manager for the Mumbai attack, playing a leading role in its planning, preparation, and execution. Mir was indicted in the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (Chicago, Illinois) on April 21, 2011, and was charged with conspiracy to injure the property of a foreign government; providing material support to terrorists; aiding and abetting the killing of a citizen outside of the US; and the bombing of places of public use. According to the indictment, during the attacks, Mir advised the attackers to kill hostages, set fires, and throw grenades and also sought the release of a hostage in exchange for the release of a captured attacker. A warrant for Mir’s arrest was issued on April 22, 2011. In 2019, Mir was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists List,” the department said.It added that on August 30, 2012, the Department of the Treasury designated Mir for holding leadership positions within the LeT. “According to the US Department of Treasury, as of 2005, Mir directed training for operatives preparing for overseas recruiting, money laundering, and operational planning. The LeT was designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US Department of State in December 2001,” the department added.However, Pakistani authorities continue to deny culpability and are yet to take action on the multiple dossiers shared by India. A trial underway in a Pakistani anti-terrorism court against seven suspects has made little headway in more than a decade, as Pakistani officials serially question the sufficiency and legitimacy of evidence against them.Pakistan has been placed on the FATF’s grey list of the country with inadequate controls over terror financing in 2018, saying Pakistan “still needs to demonstrate that law enforcement agencies are identifying and investigating the widest range of terrorism financing activity.”Pakistan has long been criticised for cultivating terror proxy groups and the country currently faces renewed pressure to act against terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-reward-of-up-to-usd-5-million-for-information-about-26-11-mastermind/story-DFUsJ4LK7pFIfdJVRZnLxK.html
28-11-2020||India||Punjab CM Amarinder Singh urges farmers to accept Amit Shah’s appeal||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday urged farmers to accept Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s appeal and shift to the designated place for their protest, thus paving the way for early talks to resolve their issues. Amid reports of Amit Shah’s offer to hold discussions with farmers at the earliest, Amarinder Singh said it is in the best interest of the farming community and the nation at large. Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground in the national capital to stage their protest and said the Centre is ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place. Shah’s offer to advance talks with farmers from December 3 and his statement reflecting the Centre’s willingness to listen to the farmers is a welcome step, said the CM in a statement here. He said the only solution to the current stalemate over the farm laws issue is discussion. Thousands of farmers protesting the Centre’s new farms laws stayed put at the Singhu and Tikri borders with the national capital for the third consecutive day on Saturday amid heavy police presence even after being offered the Sant Nirankari ground in Burari to hold peaceful demonstrations. Since the home minister has made it clear that the Centre is “ready to deliberate on every problem and demand” of the farmers and will hold talks the day after they shifted to the designated site in Delhi, the farmer leaders should also move forward, said the CM. Only by sitting across the table can both sides come to a solution to the problem, he added. Pointing out that the purpose of their protest was not to block highways and inconvenience people but to pressure the Union government to listen to their voice, said the CM. The farmers have already won half the battle by bringing the Union government to the negotiating table without further delay. In the circumstances, they should grab the Union home minister’s offer and make the most of the opportunity to resolve the crisis triggered by the Union laws, said Amarinder Singh. He and his government are prepared to extend their full support to these negotiations and were willing to mediate in the collective interest of all, Amarinder Singh reiterated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-cm-amarinder-singh-urges-farmers-to-accept-amit-shah-s-appeal/story-mqvfIrV37biTToheervVxM.html
28-11-2020||India||India, Maldives, Sri Lanka to step up intelligence-sharing to fight terror||India, the Maldives and Sri Lanka agreed on Saturday to enhance intelligence-sharing to tackle common threats such as terrorism, drug trafficking and money laundering as the three countries revived their maritime security cooperation dialogue after a gap of six years.The meeting in Colombo, attended by India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Maldives’ defence minister Mariya Didi and Sri Lanka’s defence secretary Kamal Gunaratne, also decided that working groups at the level of deputy NSAs will meet twice a year to bolster cooperation at the operational level.The dialogue, which was suspended after India’s relations with the Maldives soured under the previous Abdulla Yameen regime, was held against the backdrop of China’s growing assertiveness in the Indian Ocean and the India-China border standoff. New Delhi has focused on shoring up security linkages with key neighbours in recent months. A joint statement issued after the dialogue said the three sides exchanged views on common security threats and “agreed to broad base cooperation by expanding the scope to improve intelligence-sharing and include issues like terrorism, radicalisation, extremism, drugs, arms and human trafficking, money laundering, cybersecurity and effect of climate change on the maritime environment”. Also read: SII to apply for emergency authorisation of Covid-19 vaccine in 2 weeksThe discussions of the trilateral meeting among India, Sri Lanka and Maldives were formalized through signing of the minutes by NSA Ajit Doval, Defence Secretary Major General (Retd) Kamal Gunaratne and Minister @MariyaDidi @HCIMaldives @SLinIndia @MFA_SriLanka @MEAIndia pic.twitter.com/DGmM7IMnrjThe representatives of the three sides also agreed to meet regularly for discussions and to ensure timely implementation of decisions made at the meeting. They also decided to hold deputy NSA-level working group meetings “biannually for cooperation at the operational level”.The trilateral maritime security cooperation dialogue was launched with a meeting in Male in 2011. Two more meetings were held in Colombo in 2013 and New Delhi in 2014. Mauritius and Seychelles were represented virtually at Saturday’s meeting.While noting the forum’s significance in promoting cooperation in the Indian Ocean region on common issues related to maritime security, the three sides also reviewed the maritime security environment and discussed cooperation in areas such as maritime domain awareness, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, joint exercises, maritime threats and marine pollution. “They agreed to further strengthen cooperation in dealing with these challenges, to ensure peace and security in the region for common benefit,” the joint statement said.Doval also held bilateral meetings with the Maldives’ defence minister and Sri Lanka’s defence secretary. At his meeting with Gunaratne on Friday, Doval discussed a collaborative mechanism to enhance maritime cooperation, intelligence-sharing and capacity building, as well as ways to curb drug smuggling and responding to natural calamities. In September, India provided a Dornier maritime surveillance aircraft to the Maldives National Defence Force (MDNF), which is expected to boost efforts to keep a closer watch on the movement of Chinese vessels in regional waters. During Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s visit to New Delhi in November last year, India offered Sri Lanka a line of credit of $50 million to fight terrorism and enhance intelligence gathering in the wake of the Easter Sunday suicide attacks by Islamic State-linked terrorists that killed 258 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-maldives-sri-lanka-to-step-up-intelligence-sharing-to-fight-terror/story-ETk9fwZxay4IlcPHqgGhVL.html

Eight people were killed in in Chittoor and Kadapa districts of Andhra Pradesh in the last three days due to floods caused by heavy rainfall brought in by cyclone ‘Nivar’, officials said on Saturday. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of the deceased. In Delhi, the minimum temperature was recorded at 10.1 degrees Celsius and the maximum was 26.4 degrees Celsius. The city’s air quality slipped back into the “poor” category, a day after favourable wind speed helped it improve significantly.With winds slowing down, government agencies said the air quality is likely to deteriorate further. The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was 231 on Saturday. Stronger winds and a drastic reduction in the contribution of stubble burning were two major reasons for cleaner skies over Delhi on Friday. However, the winds slowed down at night allowing the pollutants to accumulate.Winds are predicted to slow down on Sunday and therefore, Delhi’s air quality is likely to deteriorate further and remain in the ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’ category over the next two days.Further north, cold weather conditions prevailed in most parts of Jammu and Kashmir with Gulmarg in the Valley recorded as the coldest place at minus 5.6 degrees Celsius. The meteorological department has predicted dry weather in the union territory till December 4.

28-11-2020||India||Hyderabad under new Nizam, time to end it, says Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said Bharatiya Janata Party was the only party which had the capacity to transform Hyderabad into a “Bhagya Nagar (a wealthy city)”. Addressing the gathering during a road show at Kukatpally as part of the BJP campaign in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections, Adityanath accused the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen of stalling the development of Hyderabad for their political gains. “The entire area on the banks of Musi river in the south of Hyderabad has been under encroachment of the MIM. We need to teach a fitting lesson to these descendants of the Nizam who have become obstacles for the development of the city,” the chief minister said. CM Adityanath reiterated that Hyderabad could be renamed as Bhagyanagar, which was the original name of the city. “Some people were asking me if Hyderabad can be renamed as Bhagyanagar. Why not? We renamed Faizabad as Ayodhya and Allahabad as Prayagraj after BJP came into power in Uttar Pradesh. Then, why can’t Hyderabad be renamed as Bhagyanagar?” he asked. He reminded that Hyderabad had been liberated from the clutches of autocratic Nizam rule thanks to Sardar Patel. “Now, the people of Hyderabad are witnessing the rule of Naya Nizam and time has come to get rid of it,” he said. Attacking the TRS government, Adityanath said every citizen, including businessmen, was upset with the present rule. “The people who have been in the government and corporation here have nothing to do with the development and basic amenities of the people,” he said. Stating that his government in Uttar Pradesh had constructed houses for 30 lakh people in the state, CM Adityanath sought to know how many houses the TRS government had constructed in Telangana in the last six years. “Though the TRS leaders have failed to fulfil the promises made in the last GHMC elections, they are making new promises to the voters to hoodwink them,” he alleged. The UP chief minister accused the KCR government of distributing the flood relief to the people in the form of cash only to help the TRS leaders make big money. “If the government has concern towards the victims, why didn’t it credit the amount to their accounts directly?” he asked. He said the BJP was bringing about changes across the country. “After the NDA came to power under the leadership of Narendra Modi, it had done away with Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. The centuries old issue of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya was resolved peacefully and now, we are constructing the temple,” he reminded. Stating that he was very much delighted to see the response of the people to his rally, CM Adityanath appealed to the people to help the BJP transform Hyderabad into a Bhagyanagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-under-new-nizam-time-to-end-it-says-cm-yogi-adityanath/story-3iIesQk8o5Tw2Gcj7a7EHM.html

28-11-2020||India||Terrorists making ‘desperate attempts’ to infiltrate into J-K: Army chief||Indian Army chief General MM Naravane said on Saturday terrorists are finding out new ways to infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir to “disrupt normal democratic processes”. Naravane, who did not name Pakistan, highlighted that despite continuous efforts being taken to ensure stability in the Union territory terrorism remains a serious threat.“With the ongoing situation on our western borders, terrorism continues to be a serious threat, and that is not abating in spite of all efforts made. Terrorists making desperate attempts to infiltrate into Jammu and Kashmir to disrupt normal democratic processes,” Gen Naravane said, according to news agency ANI.Army chief Naravane’s comments came at a time when Jammu and Kashmir is conducting its first polls after the abrogation of Article 370. The Union territory held the first phase of maiden elections to the District Development Councils (DDC) on Saturday where it recorded nearly 52% voter turnout. According to PTI, barring a small incident of stone pelting at Kulgam, the polls were held peacefully.The army chief also said that terrorists are finding new means to enter into India and due to the rising snow levels, they are finding it difficult to enter from the northern regions and are now attempting to enter into India from the southern regions of the western border. “With the onset of winters, attempts are being made to infiltrate before the passes close and snow levels rise. It’s because of this that they have started moving southwards and are now attempting to infiltrate through lower regions including tunnels across the International Border,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Security forces in the last three months have detected two sophisticated tunnels in Jammu’s Samba sector. The first tunnel was discovered on August 29 and the second one was discovered by the Border Security Force (BSF) last week after four terrorists were killed at Ban Toll Plaza during a gun battle near Nagrota town of Jammu. BSF has also undertaken an anti-tunnel drive across the 3,300-km-long international border to stop cross-border infiltration and smuggling of drugs and arms and ammunitions.A counter-insurgency officer told HT on Tuesday that despite there being an agreement between border security personnel of India and Pakistan to cut long grass on either side of the respective borders Pakistan border security personnel continue to use the long grass as a cover to send drugs, terror elements and arms and ammunition to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/terrorists-making-desperate-attempts-to-infiltrate-into-j-k-army-chief/story-S0vILVJzxczQlOPcfQXoRM.html

But now, they are flooding the city to campaign in the local polls. Why are they coming in such large numbers and attacking this lanky man?” KCR asked, addressing a massive rally on the penultimate day of the campaigning for Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation elections to be held on December 1.In violation of Covid-19 norms, the TRS mobilised nearly a lakh people for the rally and many of them were hardly wearing face masks leave alone maintaining social distance. Several leaders on the dais also did not wear any masks.The TRS chief said there was a need for a new political alternative in the country with new thoughts, new ideas and new policies. “The two national parties that ruled the country all these years have miserably failed to address the basic issues of the people. There is still poverty, illiteracy, hunger, inadequate healthcare, unemployment and agrarian crisis all over the country,” he said.The TRS president said the BJP was targeting him because he was questioning its policies. “They are targeting me because I question the privatisation of LIC and disinvestment in public sector undertakings like BHEL and railways. I strongly supported the nationwide strike of the trade unions and opposed the legislation on agriculture. That is why they are scared of me and my commitment to the people,” he said.He ridiculed the campaign by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath in the GHMC elections. “As a fellow chief minister, I welcome him. But what moral authority does he have to talk about development here? His state ranks 28th in terms of development, whereas Telangana is in fifth position,” he reminded.KCR said these so-called national leaders would disappear soon after the election campaign is over, whereas TRS would remain forever in Telangana. “We are going to be with you even after GHMC elections and take care of your needs,” he said.He called upon the people to save Hyderabad from communal and divisive forces, which were hell bent on disturbing the tranquillity of the city.“Hyderabad is a cosmopolitan city, where people from all parts of the country co-exist in peace, do their business and prosper. It is like a bouquet of flowers. It is attracting huge investments and creating lakhs of job opportunities only because there are no law and order issues here,” he pointed out.The TRS chief explained how his government had led the state on the path of progress in the last six and a half years. “There are no power cuts, no drinking water crisis, no industrial unrest and no communal riots. We have been displaying a lot of political maturity in developing the state and the city,” he said.He lashed out at the opposition parties for creating hurdles in the distribution of cash assistance of Rs 10,000 to the poor people affected by recent floods in Hyderabad. “While we spent Rs 650 crore on flood relief in the city, the Modi government has not given even a single paisa,” he criticised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-power-cuts-no-communal-riots-kcr-s-pitch-ahead-of-hyderabad-civic-polls/story-fclbmDvmKMtpN7xb7xaN7N.html

Someone once said to me, ‘whatever you do — film, theatre, documentary, web or street play — you are good as long you entertain the audience.’ Following that, I just try to do my best be it for any medium or role. I have to convince myself to believe in the character to make the role of Kansa or Ravan convincing to viewers,” said Manish. He agrees that such shows have given him more recognition, “Surely Chanakya, Ravan, Kans or Peshwa gave me a lot of recognition as they are part of our history and mythology. I have done saas-bahu shows too — ‘Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon...’ was a super hit daily but people me remember me like any other character nothing out of the ordinary.” In his next, Manish plays a scientist. “It’s a sci-fi show ‘Hero Gayab Mode On,’ in which we will be seen searching for a mythological story that has gone missing. It’s about the scientist and his son. I have done sci-fi shows before too — ‘Time Machine’ and ‘Maha Kumbh’. Both are very contradictory yet had a link.” Comparing OTT and TV he said, “Not everything on OTT is great. So, whatever be the medium if you have a powerful content it will work everywhere. On TV too lot of good shows are happening.” Manish shot for ‘Mahakumbh’ and ‘Mitwa’ in UP. “I did a play in Lucknow, ‘Ma Retire Hoti Hai’ where I played Jaya Bachchan’s son.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/not-everything-on-ott-is-great-says-manish-wadhwa/story-2KzJT7SdrIbJRAsAFet8ZP.html

We always knew the series will be powerful and will be nominated at big fests but winning an award this big did come as a super surprise for us all. We all owe this to our director Richie Mehta,” said the young actor. He played Akash, the victim’s friend in the series, who was the only witness to the horrific incident (2012 Delhi gang rape case).Talking about his earlier days, Sanjay said, “I come from non-filmi background and was a MBBS aspirant till my theatre inclination took me Barry John Acting Studio in Mumbai. And then, I along with my friends we form a theatre group and started doing plays till I was auditioned for ‘Delhi Crime’.”Sanjay shared how tough it was for them to relive the incident. “When I read the script, it left me aghast and when we were doing the bus and the road scene near the Delhi airport it send shivers down my spine. Imagine what those people must have gone through in reality! If in a national capital, on one the busiest route at eight in the evening, if a girl is not safe then imagine the situation in village and small towns. Hopefully, our series has left an impact and can bring a small change,” he said. Last year, he also shot for another issue-based OTT film ‘Ashok Vatika’ in Varanasi, UP. Sanjay is currently busy wrapping an untitled film and will start shooting for another from January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/doing-the-bus-scene-sent-shivers-down-my-spine/story-uuRo8BIUlIqufdbNrAosFJ.html

28-11-2020||India||Govt ready to deliberate on every problem, demand of farmers: Union home minister Amit Shah||Union minister Amit Shah on Saturday requested agitating farmers on Saturday to halt their protests against the recently passed farm bills and assured them that the Centre will discuss every issue that has been troubling farmers. According to news agency ANI, Shah said, “To farmers protesting at the Delhi-Haryana border and Punjab border, I would like to tell them that the central government is ready to discuss all their issues over a meeting called upon by the agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on December 3. We are ready to hear all their concerns and demands.”Earlier union minister for agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar had also requested farmers to halt their protests against the recently passed farm bills and asked opposition parties not to politicise the issue. Protesting farmers also relented after assurances were made by the union minister. Bharatiya Kisan Union general secretary Harinder Singh told ANI on Saturday that they will halt their protests at Singhu in Delhi-Haryana border and will conduct meetings every day at 11 am to discuss the course of the protest. Singh said, “It has been decided that we will continue our protest here and will not go anywhere else. We will meet at 11am every day to discuss our strategy.”Agitating farmers had taken out a Delhi Chalo march demanding rollback of the three recently passed farm bills. Farmers on Friday broke barricades at several checkpoints across the Delhi-Haryana border. Earlier on Thursday, farmers and Haryana police personnel clashed with each other at Sambhu and Karnal border points following which police fired water cannons and lobbed tear gas shells. Farmers are agitating against the three bills - Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill. The farmers groups believe that these three bills will affect the MSP system and allow private and multinational companies to make profits off farm yields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-ready-to-deliberate-on-every-problem-demand-of-farmers-union-home-minister-amit-shah/story-s7aVWjDk1tMbAaEfUvigzL.html

Referring to a report published by the Punjab Kesari about 10,000 farmers being booked by the police, Gandhi said that the Modi government cannot change the strong intentions of farmers with the help of fake first information reports (FIRs).“Raising voice against injustice is a duty, not a crime. The Modi government cannot change the strong intentions of the farmers with the help of the police’s fake FIR. This fight will continue till the end of the anti-agricultural black laws. Jai Kisan was and will remain for us!” Gandhi’s tweet roughly translated from Hindi read.The Congress leader had shared a photo on Twitter earlier in the day where a security personnel was seen aiming his baton at a farmer and said the slogan was ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’ but Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s arrogance made the jawan or a soldier stand against the kisan or a farmer. The former Congress president has been a vocal critic of the three newly-introduced agricultural reforms and has hit out at the Prime Minister and the central government on several occasions. अन्याय के ख़िलाफ़ आवाज़ उठाना अपराध नहीं, कर्तव्य है।मोदी सरकार पुलिस की फ़र्ज़ी FIR से किसानों के मज़बूत इरादे नहीं बदल सकती।कृषि विरोधी काले क़ानूनों के ख़त्म होने तक ये लड़ाई जारी रहेगी।हमारे लिए ‘जय किसान’ था, है और रहेगा! pic.twitter.com/EZWxMpIoJcOn Friday, Gandhi had said that no government in the world could stop farmers fighting the battle of truth adding that the Modi government has to accept their demands and the black laws would have to be withdrawn.The Congress, meanwhile, said that it would have been better if PM Modi talked to the farmers instead of getting “himself photographed in corporate offices.”Also Read: Rahul Gandhi shares viral photo of farmers’ protest, says ‘this is very dangerous’The ‘Dilli Chalo’ march which started on Wednesday has been seeing thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana moving towards the national capital to protest against the three farm reforms passed by Parliament in September.

The Russian-origin twin-seat trainer jet went down off India’s west coast on Thursday after taking off from the deck of India’s only aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya. While rescue teams were able to recover one of the pilots on Thursday, the second pilot - identified by the navy as Commander Nishant Singh - is still not traceable.“Additional warships, planes and helicopters were pressed into action on Saturday to intensify the search. There’s been no luck yet,” the officials said.Thursday’s crash was the fourth accident involving the MiG-29K maritime fighter fleet. While the cause of the crash is not known yet, India’s top auditor had in 2016 found deficiencies in the deck-based fighter. These included engine trouble, airframe problems and shortcomings in its fly-by-wire system.Meanwhile, a witty letter written by the missing pilot to his commanding officer on his decision to get married that had gone viral earlier this year surfaced again on social media after the news of the crash broke. Singh wrote to his CO, “I regret to be dropping this bomb on you at such a short notice, but as you would agree, I intend to drop a nuclear one on myself and I realise that just like all the split-second decisions we take up in the air in the heat of combat, I cannot afford to allow myself the luxury of time to re-evaluate my decision.” The letter written by the accomplished naval aviator on May 9 was widely circulated on social media platforms. The letter was peppered with military parlance. Referring to the courtship period, Singh wrote that on the successful completion of three years of extensive SCTT (Survivability and Compatibility Testing Trials), he and his fiancée had come to a mutual agreement that they may be able to get through the rest of their lives without killing each other.“I officially seek your approval to willingly sacrifice myself in absolute peacetime, completely outside of the line of duty and follow you and many other brave men into this graveyard spiral of matrimony,” he wrote. The navy commissioned its first squadron of MiG-29K fighters at Goa in May 2013, ahead of the induction of INS Vikramaditya.India has so far bought 45 MiG-29K fighters from Russia. The navy also plans to deploy the fighters on the indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC) being built at the state-owned Cochin Shipyard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-missing-for-2-days-after-mig-29k-crash-navy-intensifies-search-ops/story-HUPbAr4XWTi4bFnvMSQL4N.html
28-11-2020||India||Chirag Paswan downplays BJP fielding Sushil Modi for seat won by Ram Vilas Paswan||Cold-shouldered by the Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) in the by-election to a Rajya Sabha seat in Bihar, the Lok Janshakti Party(LJP) president Chirag Paswan said on Saturday that it belonged to the saffron party and it was free to take a decision about whom to field.The seat had fallen vacant following the death of Chirag Paswan’s father and Lok Janshakti Party founder Ram Vilas Paswan. The BJP has nominated former Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi for the seat.Sushil Modi is likely to win uncontested unless the opposition Grand Alliance fields a candidate to challenge him.In that event, the polling will take place on December 14.A union minister, Ram Vilas Paswan was elected from the seat last year after it fell vacant following his cabinet colleague Ravi Shankar Prasad’s election to the Lok Sabha from Patna Sahib.“The seat belonged to the BJP and it is for the party to decide which candidate from which party to field in the by-election,” the 37-year-old leader told reporters at a function held to celebrate his party’s 20th foundation day.Chastened by the drubbing in the recent Bihar elections, Chirag Paswan asked the party rank and file to gear up for the next assembly polls which could take place “any time”.He reiterated it in a letter addressed to LJP workers and shared with the media.Responding to questions, Paswan maintained that he saw “fresh elections taking place any time in Bihar, given the way the new government is functioning”.In a written message to party workers, Paswan defended his decision to go solo in the assembly polls, saying, “We had to make a choice between accepting the National Democratic Alliance’s(NDA)offer of only 15 seats despite being a party with six members in the Lok Sabha and one in the Rajya Sabha, or engage in a friendly fight to preserve our honour”.In the one-page letter, Paswan refrained from making any remark against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, the JD(U) boss whom he had targeted all through the elections and repeatedly accused of being unfair and brusque towards his late father while he was alive.The letter contained no reference to the BJP or Prime Minister Narendra Modi to whom Paswan has proclaimed loyalty despite his steadfast support to Nitish Kumar.The Jamui MP also deplored the heated exchanges between the chief minister and Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav on the floor of the assembly on Friday and said both shared the blame for the unsavoury turn of events.“I would not like to take sides in this matter. From both sides many personal attacks were made. I do not think the discourse in Bihar assembly has ever touched such depths,” said Paswan.The LJP chief, under whose stewardship the party fought more than half of the seats in the 243-strong assembly but won only one, tried to perk up his supporters and asked them to focus on the bright side.“We could win only two seats in the previous assembly elections even though we had contested as part of the NDA.This time, we were alone, without an army of star campaigners to canvass in our favour. But we secured 28 lakh votes and now our party is being talked about across the state,” Paswan said in his letter.“It was the dream of the LJP founder, my late father, to help the party come of its own. We have taken a step in that direction. Let’s keep marching,” Paswan, who took over the party mantle from his father a year ago, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chirag-paswan-downplays-bjp-fielding-sushil-modi-for-seat-won-by-ram-vilas-paswan/story-4J8oSWA31W51vsgpTmTSRK.html
28-11-2020||India||‘Samajwadi Party will oppose bill on religious conversion’: Akhilesh Yadav||Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday said his party will oppose the state government’s bill on religious conversions when placed in the assembly for passage. The state cabinet earlier this week gave nod to the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 to curb forcible or “dishonest” religious conversions including those for the sake of marriage, which could land violators in jail for up to 10 years. Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel gave assent to the ordinance on Saturday. Now, it will be presented in the state legislature for passage.  Commenting on it, Akhilesh Yadav told reporters, “The Samajwadi Party is not in favour of any such law. We will oppose it (when it comes to the assembly).” He also sought to know its relevance when the state has schemes to encourage inter-caste and inter-faith marriages. The government does not want to debate on more important issues due to which it brought the ordinance, he said, alleging that it is creating hatred and chasm in society. The SP president also extended support to the farmers’ protest against the Centre’s farm laws. “The betterment of farmers cannot be ensured through laws. It will happen only when the government comes forward and provides them with the right price of their produce,” he said. Akhilesh alleged, “No other government has committed as many atrocities on farmers as this government is doing. This treatment is being meted out by those who had promised to double their income.” He also asked when the Centre is going to bring a law to double farmers’ income and provide employment to the youth. Questioning investment claims of the UP government, Akhilesh said it should also tell how it has fared in corruption and fake encounters. “Fake cases are being lodged against political leaders,” he alleged. To a question on corruption charges against his party leader Azam Khan, Akhilesh Yadav said he has been targeted as he had done some good work. Only time will tell about the corruption and loot taking place under the BJP rule, he said. The former chief minister once again said the BJP government is copying the schemes and programmes of the previous SP regime led by him and hoped that people will give his party another chance in the 2022 assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samajwadi-party-will-oppose-bill-on-religious-conversion-akhilesh-yadav/story-2sywRULTMnoxLkZ16DiVuI.html
28-11-2020||India||Almost 65% of domestic air travel back to pre-Covid level: Civil aviation secy||Nearly 65 per cent of the domestic air travel has returned to the pre-Covid-19 level and now there is a need to evolve a strategy to bring back the tourism industry on its feet, civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola said on Saturday. He was addressing a webinar on ‘Aviation and Tourism-the Road Ahead’ hosted by the Federation of Association of Indian Tourism & Hospitality (FAITH). Kharola also said in the times of Covid-19 air travel has become a preferred mode of travel for being a safe means of transportation. “On the first day of resumption of domestic air services (May 25) there were 79,000 people who would travel and we were worried. But gradually it started improving,” he said. Kharola said, on Friday total 2.50 lakh passengers travelled on domestic flights and considering that the average per day passenger number was around 3.70-3.75 lakh before the pandemic hit the country, almost 65 per cent of the domestic travel is back to the pre-Covid-19 level. He said that as more business activities and colleges open up, this may go up to 80-90 per cent in the next 2-3 months or almost to the level of normalcy. Kharola also said as business travel demand will take time to come back, it will be segments like VFR (Visiting Friends and Relatives) driving the demand in aviation going forward. On the opening of scheduled international commercial passengers flights, he said,” international aviation depends not only on us but other side also.” Kharola said with domestic air travel returning to normalcy, the tourism industry too should be brought back on its feet. “Aviation is going towards normal. This normalcy ought to be brought in tourism industry also. Tourist destinations have already opened up, the ASI has opened up the monuments.  Now is the time to convince people that it is safe to travel,” Kharola said. “So we all  have to work together and evolve a strategy to motivate that domestic tourism also picks up,” he said, adding that at the same time other countries should also consider issuing tourist visas again. Kharola also urged the tourism industry to promote domestic airlines as it would help in revival of the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/almost-65-of-domestic-air-travel-back-to-pre-covid-level-civil-aviation-secy/story-3Cu7hhTIIolCMazXbBGcTN.html

28-11-2020||India||Rajasthan woman tortured with pliers to ‘free her from evil spirit’||An alleged case of witchcraft has surfaced from Bhilwara district where a 35-year-old woman was beaten with grills and cauterised with pliers in the name of freeing her from an evil spirit, police said on Saturday. A police official from Bhilwara said the incident happened on November 21. An FIR was registered under section 341 (wrongful restraint), 323 (voluntarily causing heart) and 34 (criminal act done by several persons) of Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Rajasthan Prevention of Witch-hunting Act. In her statement to police, the victim said that she, along with her relatives, had gone to visit a sorcerer in Chalaniya village of the district. “When I reached the spot, my sister-in-law and other people forcibly pulled me towards the sorcerer. I opposed it, but I failed. Later, along with the accused and his aides, I was beaten with grills, cauterised with pliers in the name of freeing spirit from my body and brutally tortured,” the statement of the victim reads. She added that the accused also took Rs 5,000 from her in the name of worshipping a local deity and freeing the spirit. “The aides of the accused threatened me with repercussions if I inform the police,” she said. “Because of the beating I was horrified and fainted. Next day my relatives who had taken me to the sorcerer took me home. I wanted to inform my husband, who was out of town, about the incident but the sorcerer had snatched the phone from me. My husband reached home after a few days. When he had called on my number, he got a reply from the sorcerer that I am sleeping and will come home in a few days,” the victim said. Shahpura additional superintendent of police Vimal Singh said the police have registered a case against the brother-in-law, sister-in-law of the victim and others. “We are investigating the case sensitively and trying our best to nab the absconding accused,” added Singh. Further investigation is on. According to the Rajasthan Prevention of Witch-hunting Act, 2015, “witch” - locally known as “dayan”, “dakan”, “dakin” - means a woman, who has been identified by any person or persons believing her to be in possession of, or as having, any evil power for causing any harm to any person or property. Occult practices involve pulling women’s hair, beating up them with a broom, iron rod and pliers and dancing in front of them with the chanting of unintelligible phrases to “liberate” them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-woman-tortured-with-pliers-to-free-her-from-evil-spirit/story-1ndHumL5VbDsdxtbBshPrM.html

28-11-2020||India||DDC polls are for local issues, not for ‘bigger’ political problems, say voters in J&K’s Ganderbal||Several voters in Jammu and Kashmir’s Ganderbal district on Saturday said that the District Development Council (DDC) polls are to elect people who can solve basic problems and “bigger issues” like restoration of special status should be left for assembly and parliamentary elections.The eight phase DDC polls are the first elections in Jammu and Kashmir since it was reorganised as a union territory last year after the abrogation of its special status, and it is being held along with bypolls to panchayats.The first phase was held across Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday and over 22 per cent of the seven lakh voters had exercised their franchise till 11 am. Two DDC seats -- Gund-A and Gund-B -- went to polls in the central Kashmir district, which recorded a polling percentage of 23.14 till 11 am.“Political issues are for bigger platforms like the assembly or the Parliament. What role do the DDCs or for that matter panches and sarpanches have in framing laws. This is a small platform to address the developmental issues of the people at the local level,” 67-year-old Shareef-ud-Din said after voting at a polling booth in the district’s Thune area.Zahida Begum, a voter at the Government Higher Secondary School in Hariganiwan, said she came out to vote to support a local candidate who could address day-to-day issues.“We have many issues that need attention. I do not know anything about Article 370, but I want the issues of our locality to be resolved,” she said.The Centre on August 5 last year had announced abrogation of Article 370, which gave the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir special status, and divided it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.Juma Koswal, another voter, said that “bigger issues are for bigger parties to discuss”.“Yes, our identity has been snatched from us (after abrogation of special status), but this election is not for that,” he said, adding that people are voting for candidates who can solve local issues and problems.Some, including first-time voters, however said that this election was a “small fight” for restoration of special status of the erstwhile state.“This election is also important as through this we can keep those parties and people away who took away our special status,” Yaseen Ahmad said, adding that though the DDC polls had nothing to do with the issue, but “this would send a message how the people feel about last year’s decision”.The eight-phase elections are seen as a triangular contest among the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), the BJP and the Apni Party floated by former finance minister Altaf Bukhari.The PAGD -- an amalgam of several mainstream political parties, including NC and PDP, seeking the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status which was revoked by the Centre last year -- has been accusing the Bukhari-led party of being a B-Team of the BJP.Of the 1,475 candidates in the fray for 280 DDC seats, 296 candidates are in the first phase, according to officials. Many voters in the district also said that the elections should not have started at 7 am in view of the chilly weather. But as the day progressed, several turned up at polling booths to exercise their franchise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ddc-polls-are-for-local-issues-not-for-bigger-political-problems-say-voters-in-j-k-s-ganderbal/story-0VXIZI8k8D9hkHfB1kX1pI.html
28-11-2020||India||Haryana CM Khattar suspects ‘unwanted elements’ among protesting farmers, cites slogans raised against PM Modi||As thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana continued their protest against the central government’s three agricultural reforms, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Saturday there were inputs that there were some unwanted elements among the agitating crowds.“We have inputs of some such unwanted elements in the crowd. We have reports and will disclose once we have concrete evidence. They raised such slogans. In videos, they said ‘jab Indira Gandhi ko ye kar sakte hain, to Modi ko kyu nahi kar sakte,” Khattar said after he was asked by a reporter whether there was a Khalistani connection.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that a Khalistani agenda was being orchestrated during the ongoing protests in Punjab. The BJP’s I-T cell chief Amit Malviya tweeted a video on Friday where a man could be heard threatening Prime Minister Narendra Modi by referring to Indira Gandhi’s assassination if the talks on December 3 failed to resolve the issues of farmers. #WATCH We've inputs of some such unwanted elements in crowd.

I appeal to all the farming brothers to directly talk to the Centre for all their legitimate issues. The movement is not its way - the solution will come out of the conversation,” Khattar’s tweet on Friday roughly translated from Hindi read.Multiple clashes have been reported in the past few days between the agitating farmers and the police in Delhi, Haryana and other adjoining states with the latter resorting to tear gas, water cannons and barricades to disperse the protesting farmers. On Friday evening, the Delhi Police allowed these farmers to enter the national capital and carry out peaceful demonstrations at the Samagam Ground in Burari.Also Read: Rahul Gandhi shares viral photo of farmers’ protest, says ‘this is very dangerous’The farmers have been asking for the removal of the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. The laws were passed during the monsoon session of Parliament in September.While the Narendra Modi-led government has said these laws would eliminate middlemen and enable farmers to sell their produce in commercial markets, farmers fear that big corporations would exercise control over them. Farmers also fear they would be denied the right to the minimum support price (MSP) for their produce, thereby disrupting timely payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-cm-khattar-suspects-unwanted-elements-among-protesting-farmers-cites-slogans-raised-against-pm-modi/story-lBE6KSTv3nrjfrxA1DfXFO.html

Citing instances of alleged ‘love jihad’ across the country and claiming that incidents like the recent abduction and rape of a Hindu minor girl at Boxanagar-- a border village in Sepahijala district— by a youth from a minority community were on the rise, the agitators demanded a stringent law to curb forced interfaith relationships. A case was registered on October 27 against the youth under Section 366 (A), 376 and 4 of POCSO Act. Within a few days after her abduction during the Durga puja festivities, the minor girl was recovered from Durlabhnarayan area in the district, but the accused is yet to be arrested. “The protesters demanded a strict law to check love jihad. The prime accused in the abduction and rape of the minor is absconding and police investigation is on to trace the accused,” said Dhrubha Nath, Udaipur sub divisional police officer.“Around nine cases of Love Jihad were lodged at different police stations in Tripura during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Cosmos Malabaricus project is currently under consideration of authorities from India and the Netherlands.The Indian embassy in the Netherlands, in a tweet, said the Cosmos Malabaricus project was a seven-year-old collaboration and initiatives have been taken to discuss the project with various stakeholders. “Cosmos Malabaricus a 7-year collaboration to shed light into history of Kerala using archival material pertaining to Dutch East India Company available in India & the Netherlands was discussed between various stakeholders in online discussion at the initiative of Indian Embassy,” the Indian embassy tweeted on Friday. Cosmos Malabaricus a 7-year collaboration to shed light into history of Kerala using archival material pertaining to Dutch East India Company available in India & the Netherlands was discussed between various stakeholders in online discussion at the initiative of Indian Embassy pic.twitter.com/PvdUNx7UCYDutch historical archives from the 17th century will be translated and summaries published in English for the people of Kerala and others, a statement from the Indian embassy in the Netherlands said, according to news agency PTI.The statement hailed the information, written in the classic 17th-century Dutch language, as a “treasure trove” having descriptions of political and military organisations, dynastic developments, economic matters, social and religious aspects of Kerala between 1643 and 1852.

28-11-2020||India||‘Government thrives on publicity and advertisement’, says Congress as it targets AAP over state of healthcare in Delhi||Seeking to corner the Aam Aadmi Party(AAP )government over the situation of health services in Delhi amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the Congress on Saturday accused it of thriving only on publicity despite failing to do ground-level work.Addressing a press conference at the Delhi Congress office, party spokesperson Pawan Khera cited data to claim that in the last five years, the AAP government has failed to open even one new hospital in the city.“This is a government which thrives on publicity and advertisement. But the ground reality is exposed at the time of a crisis like the Corona pandemic faced by us,” Khera said.No immediate reaction was available immediately from the ruling AAP.Khera also took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to three cities to take stock of the development of vaccines against Covid-19, claiming everything has been turned into “event management”.“The government of India should have a clear policy over how and when it will allocate the vaccine among different categories as Rahul Gandhi has sought to know. Work should be done first, publicity can wait,” he said.Sharpening his attack on the ruling AAP dispensation, Khera alleged that it has added only 776 beds in government hospitals in its over five years in power despite promising 30,000 beds in its election manifesto. He also claimed that the Kejriwal government could not start and finish even a single new hospital.“This year, when Covid-19 pandemic is being faced by the people, the Delhi government has managed to spend only 25 per cent of its allocation on health services. It has also reduced the expenditure on the health sector that was 0.84 per cent of the GSDP,” he alleged, citing data.Khera also claimed that even though the AAP government promised construction of 1,000 Mohalla Clinics, just over 200 were functioning currently.“The Delhi government has failed to do ground level work, and Delhi people are facing the consequences of its mistakes,” he said.The All India Congress Committee(AICC) spokesperson also accused the Delhi government of indulging in blame games with the Centre and other states over crop stubble burning.Experts claim crop stubble burning contributes only 10 per cent to air pollution, he said. So, the Delhi government is accountable for the remaining 90 per cent, Khera added, alleging it has failed to show “seriousness” on addressing the problem of pollution in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-thrives-on-publicity-and-advertisement-says-congress-as-it-targets-aap-over-state-of-healthcare-in-delhi/story-ySWw3rc12sH3zAqiMAGpWN.html
28-11-2020||India||China sending defence minister to Nepal days after Indian foreign secretary’s visit||China is sending defence minister Wei Fenghe to Nepal for a day-long visit on Sunday, just days after India’s foreign secretary Harsh Shringla wrapped up a trip to Kathmandu aimed at boosting bilateral ties affected by a border row. Nepal’s foreign ministry announced the visit by Wei, a general in the People’s Liberation Army who also holds the rank of state councillor in the Chinese cabinet, on Saturday. A brief statement issued by the foreign ministry in Kathmandu said Wei will make a one-day working visit to Nepal on November 29. Wei will meet President Bidya Devi Bhandari, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who also holds the defence portfolio, and the army chief, Gen Purna Chandra Thapa, during his day-long trip, the statement said. There was no official word from Beijing on the visit. Wei will be the senior-most Chinese leader to visit Nepal since a trip to Kathmandu by President Xi Jinping in September last year. He will be in Nepal barely two days after Shringla concluded his two-day trip to Nepal. Shringla, who travelled to Nepal after back-to-back visits by Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane and Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) head Samant Goel, had focused on ways to take forward the bilateral relationship, especially cooperation on connectivity and cross-border infrastructure, during his high-level meetings in Kathmandu. People familiar with developments had said the two sides also focused on the importance of respecting each other’s sensitivities in the discussions during Shringla’s visit. India-Nepal ties had taken a hit when Kathmandu issued a new political map in May that laid claim to Kalapani region, which is controlled by India, after New Delhi opened a new road to the strategic Lipulekh region. India rejected the map and Shringla, during his meetings, discussed ways to take forward the border issue through appropriate bilateral mechanisms. China has stepped up efforts to increase its influence in Nepal in recent years, including investments in major projects and an outreach to the leadership of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP). Reports have suggested that Beijing played a key role in the unification of two leftist parties to create NCP. China’s ambassador to Nepal, Hou Yanqi, frequently meets leaders of NCP, including co-chairs Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal. When differences between the two leaders spilled into the open in July, Hou had reportedly played a key role in keeping the party united. The Chinese defence minister will be presented a guard of honour at the Nepal Army headquarters and discussions between the two sides are expected to look at the resumption of Chinese military aid, Nepal Army spokesperson Brig Gen Santosh Ballav Paudyal was quoted as saying by The Kathmandu Post. Nepal and China had signed an agreement for a 150-million RMB military assistance package during former Nepalese defence minister Ishwor Pokharel’s visit to Beijing last year and a protocol to this deal is expected to be signed during Wei’s visit, The Post reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-sending-defence-minister-to-nepal-days-after-indian-foreign-secretary-s-visit/story-b29wUefPSAWdW4Fe3QaaXI.html

The promulgation comes a month after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath vowed to end “love jihad”, a term the Hindu right uses to describe marital relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women.“…the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance has been promulgated,” said additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi.The ordinance makes violations of its provisions cognisable and non-bailable offences. It authorises “aggrieved parents, siblings or close relatives” to file first information reports over the violations.“If any person reconverts to his/her immediate previous religion, the same shall not be deemed to be a religious conversion,” says the ordinance.An official spokesman said those violating the provisions may be punished with imprisonment of one to five years with a fine of not less than Rs 15,000. In cases of conversions of minors or those belonging to the scheduled castes or the scheduled tribes, the imprisonment will be for two to 10 years and a fine up to Rs 25,000. In cases of mass conversions, the ordinance provides for imprisonment of three to 10 years and a minimum fine of Rs 50,000. It provides for courts to award appropriate compensation with a maximum of Rs 5 lakh payable by the accused to the victim. If an accused, already convicted of an offence under the ordinance, is convicted again he/she shall face double the punishment.Any person, who counsels or convinces the other person to commit an offence under the ordinance, will also invite punishment. The burden of proof will lie on the accused.Any person willing to convert to another religion would have to give a declaration at least 60 days in advance to the respective district magistrate/additional district magistrate. Any violation will lead to a punishment of six months to three years in prison with a fine of Rs 10,000. Any religious converter, who performs the conversion ceremony, will have to give a month’s notice about such proposed ceremony and violation will result in one to five years imprisonment with a fine of Rs 25,000.An inquiry will thereafter be conducted about the intention/purpose of conversion and the violation of this provision will have the effect of rendering such conversion null and void. A converted person will have to make another declaration on the prescribed format within six months after conversion.The ordinance also provides for cancellation of registration of institutions/organisations violating its provisions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-bans-unlawful-religious-conversions-with-immediate-effect/story-pdh8flvrLcHUHc25vUwxqN.html

Within no time, the news spread like wildfire and the villagers have started flocking the beach in search of gold beads and grains,” U Kothapalli sub-inspector of police B Lova Raju told Hindustan Times.Holding umbrellas, the villagers searched all along the Uppada beach and sieved the sand using fishing nets, combs and even clothes. “However, hardly a few people were lucky to find them. But the villagers have not lost their hope,” the SI said.Asked how the golden beads or grains were washed ashore, Raju said a few houses and a couple of old temples on the coast had been washed away during the last month’s heavy rain and some of them might have lost small pieces of gold.“It is also common that people who come to pilgrim centres in the nearby areas leave some small gold pieces in the sea while taking holy baths. During the latest Cyclone Nivar, some of these small gold objects might have washed ashore in tidal waves,” Raju said.He said had there been big pieces of gold, the revenue authorities would have plunged into action by now. “It is not exactly sea spewing gold on the shore. They are minute pieces that would hardly fetch them a couple of thousands of rupees. However, the police have kept a vigil,” the SI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/curious-case-of-sea-spewing-gold-in-andhra-s-kakinada-and-the-spirited-rush/story-9FwWkChjzNvMdO6qYt0jtI.html
28-11-2020||India||Are diamonds really being found in Nagaland? All you need to know||Nagaland has been in news after photos and videos of diamonds being found in Wanching, a village in Mon district of the state, went viral on social media. The video clips and photographs showed villagers gathered in large numbers, digging soil on a hillock and displaying small crystalline finds on their palms. But are those crystallines really diamonds? Not quite.Here is all you need to know about Nagaland’s diamond rush1. The rush started early this week. The district administration is trying to solve the mystery as the stones were found near the surface and not deep underground. 2. The state government had also deployed a team of geologists to look into the issue. 3. The team of four geologists constituted by the geology and mining department on Saturday has reportedly affirmed that the glittering rocks are not diamonds but just quartz crystals. The team that was supposed to reach the district by November 30 or December 1 reached early to investigate after all the media buzz around the rocks.4. The state is known to have latent gold and diamond store due to the ‘ophiolite’ rocks on its crust. According to geologists, ‘ophiolite’ refers to slices of what used to be ocean floors before thrusting with the continental crust more than 65 million years ago to form Himalayan peaks of today.5. As per an Indo-German study published in an issue of journal ‘Current Science’ three years ago, the Indo-Myanmar ranges contain a manganese-consisiting mineral called “manganilmenite” which is found in the ophiolite rocks and hence can potentially be a site for micro diamonds. Micro diamonds are minuscule-sized diamonds with size less than one millimeter.6. Bibhuranjan Nayak of the CSIR-Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology in Bhubaneswar, one of the authors of the study said that manganese-rich manganilmenite is a rare element and is known to be diamond indicators.Also Read | CBI raids 45 premises in 3 states, including Bengal over ‘coal mafia’, bribery cases7. Professor GT Thong from Nagaland University’s department of geology had disputed the diamond claim and asserted that the glittering stones are not diamonds. They are just quartz crystals that are commonly found in Nagaland, he said adding that some people were trying to misguide poor villagers by spreading this false narrative in the district.8. The village council too doubted the diamond claim and had prohibited the villagers from posting any photos or videos relating to the stones on the internet. The council has also restricted the entry of outsiders in the village, especially of the diamond hunters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/are-diamonds-really-being-found-in-nagaland-all-you-need-to-know/story-rY2KkAohF5F79y90CS8IyH.html

As the setting up of a full-fledged plant will require nearly two years, the company has decided to start by getting only the refrigeration boxes from Luxembourg and source the best content from the domestic market under the “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” programme. The refrigerated transport boxes will be able to deliver vaccine between four degrees Celsius to 20 below zero even though the Luxembourg-based company has the technology to transport vaccine 80 below zero degrees Celsius.Also Read: EU seeks early meeting of mechanism to discuss trade agreement with IndiaSantosh Jha, India’s ambassador to the European Union, virtually met CEO and deputy CEO of the company on November 20 to finalise the arrangements with Gujarat. While the refrigerated boxes, powered by solar, kerosene, gas and electricity, are expected to be ready for delivery by March 2021, the B Medical Systems company will set up a full-fledged plant in Gujarat in phase II for not only supplying to Indian requirement but also exporting it to other countries.Also Read: Fresh Covid-19 infection 4% lower than yesterday, total tally crosses 9.3 million-markOfficial sources said the proposal was made by Bettel to PM Modi during the first bilateral summit on November 19.

It was founded in 1979 when the World Health Organization (WHO) approached the mother company Electrolux in Vianden to provide a solution for safely storing and transporting vaccines all over the world. The company is also a world leader in blood bank and plasma storage refrigerators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-pushes-refrigerated-vaccine-transport-boxes-tie-up-with-luxembourg-company-in-gujarat/story-wxo9l18Ne9Yse16cNXrtcN.html

On being queried if the villagers were disappointed with the finding of the experts, he replied in the negative.“Just by seeing the glittery stones, for which we don’t have a name, the villagers started calling them diamonds. And some ignorant people circulated pictures of it on social media. When we don’t know what actual diamonds are, there is no reason for us to feel disappointed,” Shijong said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-that-glitters-isn-t-diamond-but-quartz-say-geologists-about-nagaland-stones/story-R5pSt6prsxbX62mxhUsXZP.html

December 4, when the very same court decides again, is seven days away. Stan cannot be refused fluids for such a long period. The NPRD and its affiliating units have therefore decided to send sippers to the jailor of Taloja Jail, Maharashtra, to be given to Stan Swamy,” the NPRD said in a statement.It also appealed to all disability rights organisations, activists and all those who seek justice for the activist and stand in defence of his rights to join this campaign and send sippers to Swamy.“It took 20 long days for the NIA to come up with a claim that they did not seize these items from Stan’s possession. Even if we accept the NIA’s contention, the special court should have taken a humanitarian view and ordered that he be provided with an utensil that would assist him in intaking fluids including water. The refusal to do so is atrocious to say the least,” the NPRD said.Swamy is a person living with Parkinson’s disease, which is a condition recognised as disabling as per the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, it said and expressed outrage at the continued denial of a sipper and straw to the activist.The NPRD said that “as per various laws and international conventions to which India is a signatory, it is obligatory that Stan Swamy be provided with requisite age and disability appropriate requirements, assistive aids including straws and sippers as also human care assistance”.“Denial of the same constitutes a violation of his basic rights,” it said.Swamy, was arrested for his alleged role inciting mob violence in Koregaon Bhima near Pune in Maharashtra on January 1, 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/disability-rights-organization-to-send-sipper-to-taloja-jail-for-stan-swamy/story-a22YPI17l1lV30IA0xyQ3O.html

Government has not helped the farmers,” Fadnavis said.“We are not demanding President’s rule but the two decisions [each by Supreme Court and High Court against Maharashtra govt ] is an example of a breakdown of constitution machinery,” Fadnavis added.On the occasion of completing a year in the office, Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana published an interview of the chief minister where he said he and his family has been targetted by the opposition. “We do not want to get into vindictive politics but if you force us, we will use Sudarshan chakra [mythological weapon] against your vindictiveness,” he said.“I am following all developments closely. If I am quiet or I am restrained it doesn’t mean that I am unmanly. The manner in which people’s families and children are targeted does not suit Maharashtra’s culture. The ones targeting families and children must remember that even they have families.

Sikandar Khan, the convict, is facing trial for raping another four-year-old girl and has confessed to sexually assaulting dozens of children, men and transgender people, police said.Special public prosecutor Mahaveer Krishnawat said judge LD Kiradu sentenced the convict to life in prison till his last breath.Additional police commissioner Ajay Pal Lamba said the seven-year-old girl’s case was a priority for them. “Because of the combined and coherent efforts of our police team and special public prosecutor Krishnawat, the judgment has come in the victim and police’s favour. For every hearing, we ensured that the witness reached the court and his statement was recorded on time,” Lamba said.Investigators said Khan, who was arrested after remaining on the run for six days, appears to have abused other children as well. “If he is set free, he will commit these crimes again,” a police officer familiar with the case said.The convict faces three rape, one attempt to murder, two sexual harassment, two theft and three cases of burglary.

28-11-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh plans MSP for vegetables and fruits||The Madhya Pradesh government plans to fix Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for vegetables like tomatoes and potatoes and fruits to help farmers who fail to recover even their costs of cultivation, officials aware of the matter said.“We held a round of meetings with farmers before preparing a draft on how to stop hoarding and middlemen interference in deciding the market prices of vegetables and fruits,” said a horticulture department official, who did not want to be named. He said they plan to initially provide MSP for 12 vegetables including cauliflower, tomatoes, potatoes, cabbage, onions, carrots. The list of fruits is yet to finalised. “A team of horticulture and agriculture experts are calculating cultivation cost. MSP will be fixed by including at least a 50% profit margin.”There are 76 fruit and vegetable mandis in Madhya Pradesh. The official said farmers can sell their vegetables and fruits at these mandis at the MSP.The Madhya Pradesh government fixed Rs eight per kg MSP for onions after six farmers were killed in protests in Mandsaur in June 2017.Bhagwan Meena, a farmer leader, said it is good that the government is going to fix MSP for vegetables but it needs to improve infrastructure too. “The farmers sell the vegetables at a lower than the production cost because they do not have any storage facilities... after few months, businessmen sell the same vegetables at 100-200% profit margin as they have cold storages.”Madhya Pradesh has a cold storage capacity of nine lakh metric ton. Meena said the state needs a capacity of at least 18 lakh metric ton.GS Kaushal, an agricultural expert, said he has his doubts about the implementation of MSP for fruits and vegetables. “Vegetables and fruits are perishable items. How will the government compel businessmen to purchase vegetables and fruits at MSP? If businessmen refuse to purchase it at MSP, will the government purchase it or farmers have to bear 100% loss?” He added if the government agrees to purchase the vegetables and fruits from farmers, where will it store them. “The government fixed the MSP for onions. [But] in absence of proper storage and transportation facility, the government had a bear loss of crore of rupees.”Horticulture minister Bharat Singh Kushwaha said the MSP will also control the fluctuation in the costs of vegetables.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-plans-msp-for-vegetables-and-fruits/story-fYJKYMGMLWZi9wY14iFEEO.html

28-11-2020||India||States must rise above politics to check Covid spread, says SC||The Supreme Court on Friday highlighted the utter disregard for social distancing norms across the country looking to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, and warned the state governments that if they do not rise above politics and take harsher measures, the efforts taken so far to curb the spread of the virus will go in vain.A three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by justice Ashok Bhushan said, “We are watching celebrations and processions across the country. Around 60% people have no masks, 30% have their masks hanging. What implementation is this? There are guidelines but who is there to enforce. Since the beginning of this month, the situation has gone from bad to worse. This calls for harsher measures (from states). They must rise above politics or else all efforts taken by them (Centre and states) will go in vain.”The observations came during the hearing of a suo moto petition on proper treatment of Covid-19 patients and dignified handling of dead bodies in hospitals.The bench was shocked to note that a fire at a Covid-19 hospital in Rajkot, Gujarat, on Thursday led to the death of five patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). “It is not the first incident in a Covid hospital where due to fire, patients have died. These incidents are being repeated from state to state and from hospital to hospital. We notice that neither concrete steps have been taken by the states in this regard nor any mechanism to prevent or ameliorate the situation is in place,” said the bench, also comprising justices RS Reddy and MR Shah. The court took cognisance of the Rajkot incident and called for a report from the Gujarat government pointing to action taken with regard to a similar fire that took place at a Covid-19 hospital in Ahmedabad in August in which eight people died. “Some directions are necessary to be passed throughout the country. Centre has to take a lead in this matter. States must put necessary infrastructure (fire-fighting equipment) in place. There should be round-the-clock monitoring,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-must-rise-above-politics-to-check-covid-spread-says-sc/story-lv577KhMiOV5BN1AQsq1bO.html
28-11-2020||India||India to manufacture 100mn doses a year of Sputnik: Moscow institute||India will produce over 100 million doses a year of Russia’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine Sputnik V beginning 2021 following an agreement between the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and Hyderabad-based Hetero Biopharma, according to Dr Alexander Gintsburg, director general of the Gamaleya Research Institute, Moscow.Sputnik V is based on a well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors and has demonstrated a 91.4% efficacy rate, according to the second interim data analysis of the largest double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials in Russia’s history involving 40,000 volunteers. The results were announced by the Gamaleya Institute and RDIF on November 24.Phase 3 clinical trials of the vaccine are approved and ongoing in Belarus, the UAE, Venezuela and other countries, and Phase 2/3 have been approved in India. India, along with Brazil, China, South Korea and others, will provide the vaccine to at least 50 countries that have requested over 1.2 billion doses.“An application has been submitted by RDIF to the World Health Organization (WHO) for accelerated registration (Emergency Use Listing, EUL) and prequalification of Sputnik V,” Dr Gintsburg said in an email interview with HT. The WHO’s EUL procedure streamlines approvals for the global use of new or unlicensed products during public health emergencies.“There is now real hope that vaccines – in combination with other tried and tested public health measures – will help to end the pandemic. The urgency with which vaccines have been developed must be matched by the same urgency to distribute them fairly. While we work towards rolling out a safe vaccine, we must continue the essential public health actions to suppress transmission and reduce mortality,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South East Asia.The EUL procedure for the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine has begun. “WHO has had several discussions with Astra following the expression of interest that WHO issued for emergency use listing and prequalification of vaccines. We will receive more clinical data in the coming weeks. There are eight sites – some are manufacturing sites – and we will be analysing the data carefully. We expect to finalise assessments beginning of next year,” said Dr Singh.Sputnik V is a human adenovirus-based vaccine candidate and the only late-stage adenovirus-based Covid-19 vaccine candidate to use two different vectors for different injections, human adenovirus types Ad5 and Ad26. In vaccines that use the same vector in both injections, the immune system may launch defence mechanisms against the second one making the vaccine less effective.The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a well-studied human adenoviral vector platform that has been proven safe and effective with no long-term side effects in more than 250 global clinical trials over the past two decades. Sputnik V uses two different human adenoviral vectors that have been genetically modified not to cause infection to trigger a stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to the vaccines using one or the same vector for two doses.“While we look forward to the clinical trial results in India, we believe that manufacturing the product locally is crucial to enable swift access to patients. This collaboration is another step towards our commitment in the battle against Covid-19,” said B Murali Krishna Reddy, director, international marketing, Hetero Labs Limited, in a statement.“While there are many challenges to come beyond vaccine introduction, vaccination is the best opportunity we have to halt the transmission of Covid-19 and minimise its associated morbidity and mortality. Based on the currently available evidence, Sputnik V can play a role in the global fight against Covid-19,” said Dr Gintsburg, on email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-manufacture-100mn-doses-a-year-of-sputnik-moscow-institute/story-r8gKAfJehQuLsECI8zp9wO.html
28-11-2020||India||Law should not be used to selectively harass people: SC||Courts have to ensure that criminal law should not be used to selectively harass citizens, the Supreme Court said on Friday, explaining the reasoning behind its November 11 judgment granting interim bail to Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami in an abetment to suicide case.Delivering the verdict, justice DY Chandrachud also explained that its decision was influenced by a prima facie reading of the FIR, which did not establish his role in the suicide, and also a chain of events that resulted in the suspicion that the state was targeting a citizen. Justice Indira Banerjee was the other judge on the bench. Both the promptness with which the top court heard the case, and the judgment itself, came in for some criticism when it was delivered, with several senior lawyers and experts saying the same benchmark isn’t being applied to other cases.In its judgment, the bench was also harsh on the Bombay high court and said that it was “clearly of the view that in failing to make even a prima facie evaluation of the FIR, the high court abdicated its constitutional duty as a protector of liberty.” It added that “the doors of this court cannot be closed to a citizen who is able to establish prima facie that the instrumentality of the state is being weaponised for using the force of criminal law. Deprivation of liberty even for a single day is one day too many”.The decision came on an appeal filed by Goswami and two others against a November 9 order of the Bombay HC declining bail. On November 11, this bench ordered release of all accused on bail and recorded the reasons in a 55-page judgment issued on Friday.The allegation against the trio was that they owed sums of money ranging from ₹55 lakh to ₹4 crore to designer Anvay Naik for professional services. Naik died by suicide in May 2018 and left a suicide note naming the three persons. Goswami’s company owed Naik ₹83 lakh. The Bombay high court had previously refused Goswami and the others interim bail. The SC said in its judgment that “the appellants are residents of India and do not pose a flight risk.... There is no apprehension of tampering of evidence or witnesses. Taking these factors into consideration, the order dated November 11 envisaged the release of the appellants on bail”.The observations come ahead of a crucial hearing in the Bombay high court which will take up Goswami’s petition seeking quashing of FIR on December 10. Legal experts said that the SC’s observation on the FIR in its judgment are bound to weigh on the high court. Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde said, “Courts normally do not make such observations. But this was a matter where detailed arguments were made. The observation by the Court will certainly have a substantial bearing on the high court although the judges have been careful in saying that this view is prima facie. The high court may not necessarily be guided by this view if prosecution is able to produce evidence. However, I prefer to see this judgment in the larger context where bail is seen as a matter of right and not indulgence by courts.”Goswami through his lawyer, senior advocate Harish Salve, contended that the state was targeting him for criticising the Maharashtra government and state police in his television debates. Salve said that Goswami was arrested on November 4 despite the fact that the investigation in this case ended in April 2019 when a closure report was submitted to the trial judge. It was on October 15 that the police communicated its decision to reinvestigate the FIR before the concerned court, he said.The Bombay HC on November 9 refused to grant bail to Goswami. Linking bail to personal liberty, the SC bench said that high courts should not foreclose itself from exercising power under Article 226 when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of personal liberty in an excess of state power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/law-should-not-be-used-to-selectively-harass-people-sc/story-tdw6UvbE3PM6uvI50CJ17L.html
28-11-2020||India||Protest may intensify, farmers from 4 states look to join stir||Punjab and Haryana farmers protesting in Delhi on Friday got support from their counterparts in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, who will join the stir in the next few days, farmer leaders from these states said. Protests were observed on Friday in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh as well. There could be a possible stand-off on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh interstate border on Saturday as farmers from UP, Uttarakhand and MP will try to enter the Capital from there.After battling teargas shells and water cannons for hours on Friday at the Delhi-Haryana border in Sonipat and Jhajjar, thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana were allowed in the evening to enter through the Tikri border and hold their protest at Burari in north-west Delhi against the three newly enacted farm laws -- The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- passed by Parliament in its monsoon session. At Singhu border, which falls on the Grand Trunk road, where thousands of tracker trolleys are stranded with farmers, police did not allow entry till late in the evening. Haryana police officials said there were many farmers in cars, buses and tracker trolleys headed towards Delhi from different highways in the state. Farmers’ organisations have been demanding that the laws be repealed and replaced with a new act assuring minimum support price (MSP) for all agriculture produce in the country. Farmer bodies in at least 12 districts of Uttar Pradesh held protests and blocked traffic on highways in the state on Friday, with leaders calling the farmers to start a march towards Delhi from Saturday. Dharmendra Malik, state spokesperson of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, said the union decided that farmers would start marching towards Delhi in their tractor trolleys.“Five lakh farmers had staged a protest in Delhi for seven days in 1988 under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Tikait, compelling the then Rajiv Gandhi government at the Centre to accept their demands. Farmers would force the Modi government to withdraw the bills,” he said.A large number of farmers from Madhya Pradesh, who were trying to join the protest of farmers from Punjab and Haryana in Delhi, staged a protest near Agra at national highway-3 on Friday as UP police didn’t allow them to go further towards the Capital.Madhya Pradesh Kisan Sangh general secretary Akhilesh Singh said, “The farmers from MP had been trying to reach Delhi to join the peaceful protest since Wednesday night but UP police were stopping them. On Friday morning, they sat on a dharna near Agra on national highway-3 and halted traffic for more than five hours.” Later in the evening, they were allowed to proceed towards the Capital on the Delhi-Mathura-Agra highway.All India Kisan Sabha members from Rajasthan mobilised farmers from Sri Ganganagar, Hanumangarh and Sikar districts to join the stir. “The farmers from Rajasthan will be joining the Delhi Chalo movement in the next few days. We have held solidarity protests in various parts of the state on Friday,” said Amra Ram, a former lawmaker and general secretary of the Kisan Sabha.Farmers in tractor trolleys from the paddy bowl of Uttarakhand, Uddham Singh Nagar, were stopped in UP’s Rampur from proceeding to Delhi. They started an indefinite sit-in at Rampur national highway and blocked traffic. They were joined by local farmers from UP.Tajendra Singh Virk, president, Terai Kisan Sangathan, Uddham Singh Nagar, said, “UP police are not allowing us to head to Delhi on the pretext of the Covid-19 outbreak. We have decided that we will continue our sit-in and camp here till the police allow us to go to Delhi.” UP police deployed heavy force on the Rampur highway to prevent farmers from reaching Delhi. “Farmers are already in a pathetic condition due to the government’s policies. These farm bills will further aggravate our problems. So we’re left with no other option but to raise our voice in Delhi,” Virk said.There were protests in several places in Maharashtra such as Thane, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Sangli and Wardha with farm leaders saying they would decide in a few days whether to join the stir in Delhi. Ashok Dhawale, national president of the All India Kisan Sabha, said, “Thursday’s was a countrywide protest. Punjab and Haryana are not the only states affected.” In the meantime, farmers have decided to organise sit-ins over the next 4-5 days in Maharashtra.Farmers in Andhra Pradesh’s Vijayawada city held a solidarity protest under the aegis of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee. The protesters were detained by police after they had a minor clash with them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protest-may-intensify-farmers-from-4-states-look-to-join-stir/story-faK6qZad7HGKb1aeugU7jM.html
28-11-2020||India||BJP plans to step up outreach on new laws||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to step up its drive to reach out to farmers across the country in a bid to dispel concerns about the newly enacted farm laws even as protests against the legislations reached the Capital on Friday, a person familiar with the matter said.The party carried out a 15-day campaign wherein senior leaders, ministers, MPs and party functionaries reached out to farmers explaining the intricacies of the new laws in September, following Prime Minister, Narendra Modi’s instructions to BJP cadres to spread awareness.“The Prime Minister urged BJP workers to reach out to farmers on the ground and explain the importance of the laws. This exercise was carried out across the country...and farmers were explained the benefits they stand to get from the new laws. However, given the Opposition’s attempt to mislead the farmers, this exercise will be renewed,” said another party functionary aware of the details.As protesting farmers continued with the Dilli Chalo march on Friday and faced teargas shells, water cannons and police batons at the Haryana-Delhi interstate border, the party is concerned about the impact that the tussle will have on the ground. The BJP does not want the protests to cast a shadow over its claims of drafting pro-farmer policies. Senior ministers have been urged to initiate dialogue with farmers’ unions to get them to call off the stir. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told ANI that the government was ready to discuss all issues with farmers. “We have invited farmers’ organisations for another round of talks on December 3. I appeal to them to leave the agitation in view of Covid-19 and the winter,” he said.Even as the Opposition has said the new laws do not protect farmers’ rights and are meant to favour select corporate entities, the BJP has blamed the Congress for creating such misapprehensions. Congress-ruled states such as Punjab and Rajasthan have drafted their own laws to circumvent the central laws.The BJP refers to its recent electoral victory in the Bihar assembly elections and the Madhya Pradesh bypolls as evidence of support for its policies. “The Opposition has been misleading farmers. If the farmers were not convinced by the laws then the party would not have won elections in Bihar, Gujarat and MP where farmers are in good numbers,” said Rajkumar Chahar, head of the BJP’s Kisan Morcha. Chahar cited a tweet by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra as proof of the party misleading the farmers. “She (Gandhi) said the laws take away the MSP, which is grossly incorrect. She says the laws will favour the big players, which is also incorrect. The laws empower farmers with small holdings; they seek to increase farm incomes, and the only ones who will not benefit are the middlemen,” Chahar said. On Thursday, Gandhi tweeted that the government instead of listening to the voice of the farmers was attacking them with water cannons. “Everything is being taken away from the farmers and banks, loan waivers, airport railway stations are being distributed to the capitalists,” she tweeted. On the police action, Chahar said, “Capt Amarinder (Punjab CM) should have realised that Delhi is in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic and by pushing the farmers to protest and come out in large numbers, violating social distancing norms, he has put their lives in danger.” The protesting farmers, however, questioned the urgency behind enacting the laws in the middle of the pandemic (the bills were passed in Parliament’s monsoon session) and the said the government should have waited if it was serious about controlling the spread of the virus.The Congress has come out in support of the farmers. It sent senior leader Randeep Singh Surjewala to Panipat before daybreak on Friday where he assured protesting groups of the party’s support. Surjewala tweeted, “The Congress party stands firmly with farmers. Is Delhi made only for those who protect the vault of a handful of capitalists? Is the capital of India not the right of the farmer to Delhi? Why did the farmers become so hated today?’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-plans-to-step-up-outreach-on-new-laws/story-VZA6jA7IkJ6hlRCxQjUKKO.html
28-11-2020||India||After Baghjan blowout, no redressal||Oil India Limited (OIL) is in the process of abandoning a gas well that blew out and caught fire in the Baghjan Oilfield in Assam’s Tinsukia district after “killing” the well and dousing the blaze that raged for almost six months, but little has been done to address the environmental impact of the disaster that has ravaged one of India’s finest wetlands .Gas well number 5, which blew out on May 27, spewed copious amounts of condensed oil and gas into the Maguri Motapung wetland and surrounding river tributaries of Dibru and Lohit. Abandoning the well involves plugging the well for good and stopping production from it. The blowout was plugged and fire doused on November 15.Evidence has emerged from a multidisciplinary committee, appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), and headed by Prof Bhagawat Pran Duarah of the department of geological sciences at Gauhati University, that fish and mollusc diversity has declined alarmingly in the Maguri Motapung wetland. The fish have been found to have high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a toxic group of chemicals.Fishermen have had to stop fishing for three months, and surrounding villages have been soaked by water laced with oil and chemicals, which are likely to leave an impact on the ecologically fragile region in the long term. The wetland is also home to several species of birds, including some found only here, and the rare Gangetic dolphin. Other species have been impacted as well. A dead hoolock gibbon baby, believed to be a case of stillbirth, was found on September 28 in Purani Motapung village near the wetland. Investigators found that the mother was compelled to feed on contaminated leaves and plants apart from being directly exposed to xenobiotic pollutants (synthetic chemicals). The mother also died on October 27, but test results on her viscera are still awaited.After the Baghjan blow-up, investigators also found that four of nine calves born to domestic cows in neighbouring villages perished; of the four, two were still-born. Investigators also found that important fish species such as Ompok pabo, Nundus nundus, Ailia coilia, Pseudeutopius atherinodes, Channa aurantimaculata and Danio rerio have been completely wiped out from the Maguri-Motapung wetland. The findings suggest a long-term impact of the oil well blowout. The Wildlife Institute of India warned in a July report to the Union environment ministry: “The impact is significant and will have long-term effects, as many of these pollutants will leach into the ground and contaminate groundwater. Long-term restorative efforts are needed for cleaning up these pollutants.”Investigators have underlined that the monitoring of migratory birds will be crucial for gathering more evidence on the environmental impact of the oil well disaster. Their numbers, behaviour and foraging habits could signal what lies ahead.Locals said migratory bird diversity and arrivals have definitely been affected. “By November, this area is full of migratory birds. This time not even half of them have arrived. The diversity is also less,” said Imon Abedin, a zoology student.His father Jonyal Abedin, who runs an eco-tourism facility, said: “We saw only one or two (Gangetic) dolphins till now. We have to study how migratory birds have been impacted by the blowout. The impact will be long-term but can gradually be offset if there is no more disturbance.”A seismological and geophysical investigation by the Geosciences and Technology Division of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s North East Institute of Science and Technology also found that the blowout site was the source of the high frequency disturbances observed at seismic stations nearby. Some may be very disturbing to local people, the report added.NGT’s intermediate report, dated October 31, pointed to several illegalities surrounding OIL’s Baghjan gas well and called on the Assam Pollution Control Board to take legal action against OIL and its officials for violations of the mandatory requirements under the Air and Water Acts. OIL has also been unable to carry out the Biodiversity Impact Assessment Study through the Assam State Biodiversity Board, as mandated by the Supreme Court.OIL violated provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 1994 under which it is mandatory to obtain environmental clearances for any onshore drilling projects that commenced before 2006, the multidisciplinary committee said in its report.“We have started implementing the well abandonment policy which means we will never again produce gas from the well. A number of safety and technical issues need to be addressed before the abandonment is complete and till then the location will be a hazard zone. Cement plugs will have to be installed at various locations and depths,” said OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika, claiming that the company has cleaned up the oil condensate in the area. “Nature also helped us. The heavy monsoon rains helped wash away some of the oil. We are also undertaking bio-remediation (use of microorganisms to control pollution) in water bodies. About ₹37 crore worth of compensation to local people has also been disbursed through the DC’s (deputy commissioner’s) office. An evaluation by the DC’s office and NGT’s final verdict is awaited,” he added.“Environmental disasters will continue to be normalised and not accounted for if we do not pin clear liability, allow projects to only safeguard their profits and offer small change in the name of compensation,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-baghjan-blowout-no-redressal/story-NWeQgtXohRFArkYItrjFZN.html

Six other patients in the ICU were rescued by the hospital staff and fire brigade personnel. Around 33 patients were admitted in the hospital. The Supreme Court took cognisance of the incident, calling it “shocking”. The court said this is a “very serious thing” and sought a report from Gujarat government.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind tweeted their condolences to the bereaved families, while Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called for an investigation into such hospital fires.Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani ordered an inquiry into the incident, and announced a compensation of ₹4 lakh to the kin of the deceased. Rajkot municipal commissioner Udit Agarwal said: “The fire was caused by a spark in the ICU and we are waiting for the forensic [reports].”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/five-killed-in-fire-at-covid-19-hospital-in-gujarat-s-rajkot/story-tQ1dcmAtyhSwkDGLGVjrPP.html
28-11-2020||India||Pilot missing after MiG jet crashes into Arabian Sea||A MiG-29K fighter of the Indian Navy crashed into the Arabian Sea on Thursday, with search and rescue teams recovering one of the pilots while the other was still missing even as efforts to locate him have been intensified, navy officials said a day after the Russian-origin jet went down off India’s west coast. The twin-seat trainer jet crashed at 5 pm after taking off from the deck of India’s only aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, the officials said. Both pilots ejected from the aircraft before it went down, they added.Thursday’s crash is the fourth accident involving the MiG-29K maritime fighter fleet. Scores of warships and aircraft are scouring the Arabian Sea to locate the missing pilot identified by the navy as Commander Nishant Singh. “A MiG-29K trainer aircraft operating at sea ditched at about 1700 hrs on 26 Nov 20. One pilot (the trainee) has been recovered and search by air and surface units is in progress for the second pilot,” navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said on Friday. The navy has ordered an inquiry into the accident. While the cause of the crash is yet to be ascertained, India’s top auditor had to pointed to some deficiencies in the deck-based fighter, including engine troubles, airframe problems, deficiencies in its fly-by-wire system and poor serviceability, in a report tabled in Parliament four years ago. The MiG-29K is riddled with problems relating to airframe, RD MK-33 engine and its fly-by-wire system, Comptroller and Auditor General said in the July 2016 report. The CAG report revealed that the serviceability of the single-seat fighter ranged from an unimpressive 15.93% to 37.63 % while that of the twin-seat trainer hovered between 21.3% and 47.14%. The navy commissioned its first squadron of MiG-29K fighters at Goa in May 2013, ahead of the induction of INS Vikramaditya. India has so for bought 45 MiG-29K fighters from Russia. The navy plans to also deploy the fighters on the indigenous aircraft carrier (IAC) being built at the state-owned Cochin Shipyard. The 44,500-tonne Vikramaditya and its embarked MiG-29K fighters had taken part in the recently concluded Malabar exercise involving the navies of India, the United States, Australia and Japan. The second phase of the exercise was held in Arabian Sea from November 17-20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pilot-missing-after-mig-jet-crashes-into-arabian-sea/story-3BfvuVj2rvoMUfWrqZZv0M.html

Later on Friday, she was not allowed to address a press conference at her residence at Gupkar. “I’ve been illegally detained yet again. For two days, the J&K admin has refused to allow me to visit @parawahid ’s family in Pulwama. BJP Ministers & their puppets are allowed to move around in every corner of Kashmir but security is a problem only in my case,” Mufti tweeted on Friday morning. Parra was arrested by NIA on Wednesday in connection with a terror case in which a senior police officer was arrested along with two militants in January.Mufti said that her daughter Iltija Mufti has also been placed under house arrest. “Their cruelty knows no bounds. Waheed was arrested on baseless charges & I am not allowed to even console his family. Even my daughter Iltija has been placed under house arrest because she wanted to visit Waheed’s family.” However in the afternoon when media persons arrived at her home, the police didn’t allow them to enter. “The Press has been barred from entering my residence in Srinagar. This despite no written orders explaining my arbitrary detention. Kashmir is an open air prison where no one has the right to express their opinion,” tweeted Mehbooba Mufti.Police denied that Mehbooba Mufti is under house arrest. “PDP leader Ms Mehbooba Mufti is not under house arrest. She was requested to postpone her visit to Pulwama purely due to security reasons,” police spokesman said.Mufti further said that her administration is using fear and intimidation.“We are one day away from DDC polling & its evident that the admin here is using fear & intimidation in tandem to muffle any form of opposition.”Jammu and Kashmir is set for its maiden District Development Council (DDC) polls and by-elections to the panchayat and urban local bodies, scheduled to be held in eight phases beginning November 28.

28-11-2020||India||Riding tractor trolleys, farmers from 4 states to join protest in Delhi||Farmers in tractor trolleys from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand will head to Delhi to join those from Punjab and Haryana staging a protest against the new agricultural laws, said farm leaders, lending a boost to them. They are expected to enter Delhi through UP.Earlier today, after battling tear gas shells and water cannons for hours at the Delhi-Haryana border in Sonipat and Jhajjar, thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana were allowed in the evening to enter through Tikri border and hold their protest at Burari in north-west Delhi against the three agricultural bills - The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- passed by Parliament in its monsoon session.At Singhu border, which falls on Grand Trunk road, where thousands of tractor trolleys are stranded with farmers, the police did not allow entry till late in the evening. Haryana police officials said that there were many farmers in cars, buses and tractor trolleys heading towards Delhi from different highways in the state. The farmers’ bodies have been demanding repealing of these laws and bringing a new law ensuring minimum support price (MSP) for all agriculture produce in the country. Watch | Farmers enter Delhi, allowed to protest in Burari; AAP welcomes | Key details As the visuals of the protests on Delhi-Haryana border being stopped went viral, farmer bodies in at least 12 districts of Uttar Pradesh held protests and blocked traffic on highways with leaders calling the farmers to start a march towards Delhi from Saturday. Dharmendra Malik, state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union, said the union has decided that farmers would start marching towards Delhi from tomorrow in their tractor trolleys.“Five lakh farmers had staged a protest in Delhi for seven days in 1988 under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Tikait, compelling the then Rajiv Gandhi government at the Centre to accept their demands. Farmers would force the Modi government to withdraw the bills,” he said.A large number of farmers from Madhya Pradesh, who were trying to join the protest of farmers from Punjab and Haryana in Delhi, staged a protest near Agra at National Highway 3 on Friday as the UP police didn’t allow them to move forward.MP Kisan Sangh general secretary Akhilesh Singh said, “The farmers from MP had been trying to reach Delhi to join a peaceful protest since Wednesday night but the UP police were stopping them. On Friday morning, they sat on dharna at Saiyan toll near Agra on National Highway 3 and halted the traffic for more than five hours. Later, they were allowed to proceed towards Delhi on Delhi-Mathura-Agra highway.”The All India Kisan Sabha members from Rajasthan have mobilised farmers from Sri Ganganagar, Hanumangarh and Sikar districts to join the stir. “The farmers from Rajasthan will be joining the Delhi Chalo movement in the next few days. We have held solidarity protests in various parts of the state on Friday,” said Amra Ram, former law-maker and general secretary of the Kisan Sabha.Farmers in tractor trolleys from the paddy bowl of Uttarakhand, Uddham Singh Nagar, were stopped in Uttar Pradesh’s Rampur from proceeding to Delhi. They have started an indefinite sit-in protest at Rampur national highway and blocked traffic for some time. They were joined by local farmers from UP.Tajendra Singh Virk, president, Terai Kisan Sanghtan, US Nagar, said, “UP police are not allowing us to head to Delhi in the name of Covid-19. We too have decided that we will continue our sit in and camp here till police allow us to go to Delhi.” The Uttar Pradesh police had deployed heavy force on the Rampur highway to prevent farmers from reaching Delhi. When the UP police didn’t allow the farmers, despite several efforts, they started to sit near the barricade on the highway. “Farmers are already in pathetic condition due to the government’s policies. These farm bills will further aggravate our problems. So we’re left with no other option but to raise our voice in Delhi,” Virk said.There were protests in several places in Maharashtra such as Thane, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Sangli and Wardha with farm leaders saying they would decide in the few days whether they would join the farmer stir in Delhi or not. Although the three farm bills do not impact the farmers in Maharashtra much, Ashok Dhawale, National President of All India Kisan Sabha, said, “Thursday’s was a country-wide protest on the same issue. Punjab and Haryana are not the only states affected. We will soon take a call on joining the agitation in Delhi.” In the meantime, the farmers bodies have decided to organise protests over the next 4-5 days. “Protests will be held for the next four-five days,” he said. While there were no protests by farmers’ associations in Telangana, farmers in Andhra Pradesh’s Vijayawada city held a solidarity protest under the aegis of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC). The protesters were detained by the police after they had a minor clash with them. AIKSCC leader, Vadde Sobhanadreeshwar Rao, lashed out at the NDA government for enacting a draconian law that would severely affect the farmers’ interests. It is unfortunate that even the YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh had supported the legislation, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/riding-tractor-trolleys-farmers-from-4-states-to-join-protest-in-delhi/story-98diw5fLjUc74L663ZPfzM.html
