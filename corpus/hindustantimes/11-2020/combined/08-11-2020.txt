08-11-2020||Noida||Noida traffic police conduct study to fix three accident-prone spots||Noida: The Noida traffic police and transport department on Saturday conducted a study of three ‘black’ spots and noted some corrective measures for road safety. Officials visited the Mahamaya Flyway, Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) Flyway and Rajnigandha Chowk (Sector 16) on Saturday and found vehicles speeding at these spots, which leads to accidents.Any stretch of about 500m, where either five crashes have taken place or ten fatalities took place in the past three years is considered a ‘black’ spot. Prashant Tiwari, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO-Enforcement) of Gautam Budh Nagar, said that the traffic police and transport department had identified 35 ‘black’ spots in February 2019. Some of these include the DND Flyway near Sector 15-A loop, Rajnigandha Chowk, Mahamaya Flyway, zero point of Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, zero point of Yamuna Expressway, Gijhore intersection, Sector 137, NSEZ, Yamaha Chowk in Greater Noida, Jewar Toll Plaza, etc.Ravindra Vashisht, traffic inspector Noida, said the traffic police on Saturday conducted a study of the DND Flyway loop. “We found that vehicles come from Delhi to Noida at high speed. There are three routes at the Flyway loop near Sector 15-A. The left lane leads to Film City road to Mayur Vihar; the middle lane leads to Rajnigandha Chowk and the right one leads to Rajnigandha underpass. Since the vehicles are in speed, the drivers sometimes confuse which lane to take and this leads to accidents. We have decided to place rumble stripes on the road to slow down speed and also place big signages for directions. We will also urge people to drive slower at the spot,” he said. At Rajnigandha Chowk, the police said they will recommend to the Noida Authority to develop a foot over-bridge (FOB). “We will also deploy traffic officials at the Chowk to manage traffic,” Vashisht said. On the Mahamaya Flyway, a FOB has been developed recently to facilitate pedestrians.“Earlier some luxury buses used to halt near Mahamaya Flyway which slowed down traffic. We have removed all such buses and made this a no-halt zone. We will continue this enforcement and traffic near Mahamaya Flyway will be smooth,” Vashisht said.According to data from the district transport department, between March 1 and September 15 this year, the Gautam Budh Nagar district recorded 162 deaths in 317 accidents. On Saturday, Noida traffic police and transport department conducted an enforcement drive and fined some vehicles which were found to be in violation of pollution norms. “We also seized three diesel vehicles which were older than ten years, as per National Green Tribunal guidelines,” Tiwari said. The traffic police conducted an awareness programme for children in Saint Hood Convent School, Dadri and Mihir Bhoj PG College in Dadri. Around 75 students vowed to follow traffic rules and also made signatures. The traffic police also conducted a chaupal with transporters in Tilapta, Greater Noida and sensitised them to follow traffic rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-traffic-police-conduct-study-to-fix-three-accident-prone-spots/story-sAyHGdCd8rop4aA5r02XMN.html

08-11-2020||City||Two Ambala villages lead the way against stubble burning||Two Ambala villages, Bara and Ugara, have not reported even a single incident of stubble burning this year as 95% paddy farmers from these areas are making money by selling straw. Under a project launched in October, bales of straw are piled up in Ugara’s panchayat land to be supplied to the Naraingarh Sugar Mill in Shahazadpur for power generation. Both villages situated adjacent to National Highway-44, have young and educated sarpanches who are working together to ensure the success of the project. An engineer and a postgraduateBara sarpanch Vikas Behgal is an engineer and his counterpart from Ugara, Harinder Kaur, has completed her postgraduation. “Farmers came to us every day to register their land for crop residue management and the task is undertaken within 48 hours. There are around 55 paddy farmers here holding 700 to 750 acres of land, of which around 685 acres have been registered. The others have adopted in-situ measures,” Behgal said. Bahadur Singh, a farmer holding 10 acres of land, said, “This extra income will help me make arrangements to grow wheat. Eight to 10 of my family members with nearly 40-acre land have also registered for the project.” The scheme is fetching farmers extra income of Rs 500 per acre with Rs 1,000 per acre from the state government for not burning the residue. Kaur said she decided to take up the initiative this year after a few villagers were booked last year for burning the straw. “Jaswinder, my husband, and Vikas are old friends and the project has been a success because of their efforts as well as that of the agriculture department,” Kaur said. Satnam Singh, 24, who looks after eight acres of his family’s ancestral land, had burnt stubble last year. This year, he stood with the sarpanch to make other farmers aware of the initiative. Health awareness“This year, I understood that nothing is more important than our health,” he added.Girish Nagpal, deputy director of agriculture, the brains behind the project, has been working on it since last year and ensuring its execution on ground. “I presented the model last season, and when Vikas and Jaswinder came to know about this, they started working on it enthusiastically. They spread the word in their respective villages and the result is before us,” he said. “The government will give an incentive of Rs 1,000 per acre at Rs 50 per quintal on ex situ measures on the condition that the residue is converted to bales. I expect farmers of both these villages to get Rs 90 lakh before Diwali,” Nagpal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-ambala-villages-lead-the-way-against-stubble-burning/story-CxvPVxUdhOaL1N9EnxnT0I.html
08-11-2020||Noida||In Ghaziabad, discount in house tax if solid waste segregated at source||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad municipal corporation has planned to incentivise residents and the corporation’s staff in order to better manage the source-segregation of solid waste generated daily in the city. Officials said that starting December, they will be rolling out an app-based solid waste collection system which will keep track of dry and wet waste handed over to the corporation’s door-to-door collection vehicles, and the points collected by households can be redeemed in the way of rebate in house-tax. At present, the city generates about 850-1,000 metric tonnes of solid waste and a majority of it is collected from residential areas with the help of about 200 door-to-door collection vehicles, which do so every day in the morning in 100 residential wards. However, residents have also complained that they cannot get alerts about the exact timing of the arrival of door-to-door collection vehicles and even if vehicles arrive, they tend to move along fast and residents sometimes are unable to handover the garbage. “Such problems were indicated by residents during the daily meeting which we hold in residential wards. To overcome all these issues, and more importantly the source segregation of daily solid waste, we are getting an app developed. With the help of this app, the staff of the collection vehicle will be able to keep track of households which handover segregated dry and wet waste. Further, for this work, we will also provide additional incentives to staff deployed in the vehicles,” said MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner. The civic agency has planned that they will provide incentives to the driver and the support-staff of the vehicle for each kilogram of segregated waste they collect from residential localities. The city at present has about 3.3 lakh households which pay house tax while it is officially estimated that the total number of households under the civic agency’s jurisdiction could be about five lakhs. “With the help of the app, the vehicle staff will record which households have handed over segregated waste. Further, the residents will also be able to download the app and they can set alerts which will let them know the specific timing when the vehicle will come to the locality. We will also define the exact route for the collection vehicles,” Tanwar added. “On a daily basis, the vehicle staff will make entries in the app and this will give certain points to households who handover segregated waste. When the residents pay house tax, they can seek to redeem the points collected through the app in the form of rebate in house tax,” he added. The officials have planned the rollout of the app-based system from December and have planned to fully implement it across the city in the next six months. They added that the segregated waste collected will be taken to different sites for processing or manufacturing purposes.For the purpose of start of the app-based system and rebate in house-tax, a proposal will be taken to the corporation’s board for required approvals and the modalities are getting prepared for the new system, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/in-ghaziabad-discount-in-house-tax-if-solid-waste-segregated-at-source/story-WxaFgjUiKqgbkmmka373RO.html

Lashing out at the state government over hike in prices of daily use commodities, Rathore said the Congress will hold statewide protests in all districts on November 12 and submit a memorandum to the governor via deputy commissioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/demonetisation-destroyed-our-economy-himachal-congress-chief/story-wMVa4rpfU4o4JbS4rjW5uO.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||BJP trying to derail Metro project, says CM Uddhav Thackeray, hints at opening places of worship in Maharashtra after Diwali||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday launched an attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), over the Metro car-shed land issue, by saying that those who were claiming it as a salt pan were derailing a project meant for Mumbaiites. Thackeray, in a veiled attack on BJP during his state address, said that despite a campaign to defame Maharashtra, the state has attracted a proposed investment of over ₹50,000 crore.The chief minister, in his 33-minute address to the state through social media, said the state was seeing a downward slide in Covid-19 numbers. However, he cautioned that lax behaviour could lead to another wave in the state. Thackeray also appealed to people to have a firecrackers-free Diwali, saying pollution and smoke would add to the discomfort of people who suffer from lung ailments. Thackeray said that instead of imposing a ban on crackers, he wanted people to voluntarily refrain from bursting them. The chief minister also hinted that places of worship could be reopened by the end of November. Thackeray said that he was criticised for not opening temples and other places of worship, but those criticising would not share the blame for a spike in cases.The plot for the Metro car depot in Kanjurmarg has become the new flashpoint between the Centre and Maharashtra government. The Centre claimed that the plot where the Metro car shed has been proposed belongs to them and is a salt plan. Responding on the issue for the first time, Thackeray said, “Somebody stood up and said that this plot belongs to them and is a salt pan. We will respond to all those criticising us, but those who are saying this is a salt plan, do not understand that they are derailing the project meant for Mumbaiites.”He added that the state government does not work with its “eyes shut”.Thackeray, in a restrained, but forceful attack on ally-turned-foe, said, “During the past few months, while we were battling the coronavirus in Maharashtra, those who have a grudge against Maharashtra launched a campaign to defame the state. [They said] Maharashtra’s law and order has collapsed, there are fields of drugs, etc. But breaking all that, we signed memoranda of understandings (MoU) worth₹17,000 crore in June. Last week, we signed MoUs worth₹35,000 crore. Several companies, both Indian and foreign, are coming to invest in Maharashtra. I was criticised for not stepping out of the home, but sitting at home I have done this. Crores of investment are coming to Maharashtra, the wheels of the economy are getting momentum.”Thackeray said that Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, among others, are reducing. He credited the discipline and state government’s “My Family, My Responsibility” campaign to help bring the numbers down. “Several people were criticising us, saying that the situation is getting out of control. But our determination, self-confidence and discipline has brought the curve down,” he said.The CM said that the next 20 days, however, remain crucial where people will have to maintain social distancing, avoid crowding and wear masks to prevent another surge in Covid-19 cases in the state. “Even if the numbers are coming in control, but Diwali and the next 15 days after Diwali are the big test... European countries including have gone on lockdown again. Cases there had touched zero, but I would say it is not a wave, but a tsunami now… if we have to go into a lockdown again it will be very tough. I am seeing many people are not wearing masks, it will not be tolerated. Those who do not wear masks will be fined. An estimation said a corona positive patient without a mask could infect up to 400 people,” he said.Thackeray appealed to the people of Maharashtra to celebrate a firecracker-free Diwali, keeping in mind that smoke due to firecrackers could create health issues for people suffering from Covid-19.The issue to ban firecrackers was discussed in the state cabinet on Thursday, however, no decision to ban it was taken. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the government may take a decision about restricting the use of crackers later. Although a discussion over banning firecrackers like done by a few other states, the state cabinet on Thursday stopped short of the decision. Shiv Sena ministers reportedly suggested promoting environment-friendly crackers, instead of banning them completely. Thackeray, on Sunday, said that instead of imposing the ban on crackers, he wanted people to voluntarily restrain from the bursting them. “Elsewhere in the country, especially in Delhi, the numbers are going up. Why is it increasing? It is said it’s due to pollution. While celebrating Diwali, I would appeal you to not burst crackers. Should we not maintain self-discipline, like we have done all this while to fight Covid-19? we do not have any vaccine yet. If we know that pollution causes the cases to increase, can we avoid crackers? Should we ban it? We can, but I feel we can maintain self-discipline… there is so much smoke and pollution. What we have achieved so far [in controlling Covid-19] will wash away in four days of smoke. I request you not to light crackers in public places and avoid crackers.The CM also said that the state government would prepare a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to reopen places of worship in the state. Several political parties and religious bodies have been appealing to the state government to reopen places of worship. However, the Thackeray government has been cautious owing to the age group [referring to senior citizens] that would predominantly frequent these places. Senior government officials said that places of worship could become sites of superspreaders.“After Diwali, we will prepare a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). In all places of worship, most senior citizens, our parents, our grandparents go. Masks will be compulsory in places of worship. I am knowingly delaying reopening of places of worship. I am criticised over it, but if tomorrow there is a bigger spread, those criticising me will not take the responsibility,” Thackeray said.Meanwhile, BJP leader and leader of opposition in legislative council Pravin Darekar has termed the address by Thackeray a “damp squib’. “He has failed to address real issues faced by the people of Maharashtra and tried to garner sympathy out of his address. He did not say anything about the reservation to Marathas, the stalled admission of colleges, relief to flood-hit farmers, rise in the cases of atrocities against women. He boasted about industrial investments, but the memoranda of understanding signed with the companies do not realise in due course of time. Thackeray’s address was just a lip service to the people of Maharashtra,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-trying-to-derail-metro-project-says-cm-uddhav-thackeray-hints-at-opening-places-of-worship-in-maharashtra-after-diwali/story-EOqFMN7oVzwS57KcDMCLIJ.html
08-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Air quality severe for fourth consecutive day||Noida: Even as cases of stubble burning dropped slightly over the past 24 hours, the air quality of Noida and Greater Noida worsened on Sunday, remaining under the “severe” category for the fourth day in row. Pollution monitoring agencies don’t see a respite for the next few days until the stubble burning drops drastically.According to the weather department, the air quality is likely to remain toxic till Diwali, as the weather conditions are likely to remain unsupportive to disperse the pollutants choking the city. “There was a little wind speed towards the morning hour that helped ventilate the air, however, the wind speed dropped to near three kmph that led to further worsening of the air. The situation is likely to remain so for a week at least,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD). Meanwhile, instances of stubble burning in neighbouring states, though slightly lesser, continued, with north-westerly and westerly winds bringing smoke to the city, taking pollution levels nine times above the safe limits. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), there were approximately 3,780 instances of fire counted on Saturday, against 4,528 on Friday. “Surface winds have become calm, which were moderate so far, and forecasted to stay low in magnitude for the next two days. This is the major factor due to which no quick recovery is expected unless a drastic reduction in fire counts takes place. Air quality is forecasted to marginally deteriorate and stay at the “severe” to the higher end of a “very poor” category for the next two days. The Safar synergised stubble fire counts over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighboring areas stood high at 3,780 Saturday,” said SAFAR statement on Sunday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 428 on Sunday against 426 a day earlier. The AQI of Greater Noida was 440 on Sunday against 428 on Saturday, while Ghaziabad was 456 against 436 a day earlier. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.”Meanwhile, the average particulate matter (PM)2.5 volume for Noida was 266.90 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3) against 346.5µg/m3 a day earlier. The PM10 for Noida was 549.89µg/m3 – nine times the safe limits, against 546.62µg/m3 a day earlier.The PM2.5 for Greater Noida was 376.56µg/m3 against 321.55 a day earlier and PM10 levels were 608.72µg/m3 against 536.37 a day earlier. The standard limits for PM2.5 is 40µg/m3 and for PM10 is 60µg/m3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-air-quality-severe-for-fourth-consecutive-day/story-Y4uh9nKmfHWPcObNmhL7wK.html
08-11-2020||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad in for long pollution haul with lower temperature, wind speed this season||Ghaziabad: The pollution levels have been high in the two cities of Noida and Ghaziabad, with the air quality index (AQI) not falling below the “very poor” category since October 22, except on one day in Noida on November 2. The data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reveals that the period starting October 1 to November 6 this year has been relatively colder, with less wind speed, which has resulted in the two cities facing higher pollution levels.The experts of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that both the parameters of wind speed and direction, as well as temperature, play a vital role in determining dispersal of pollutants. The CPCB’s data, assessed by HT, indicates that a 24 hours average temperature at four different monitoring stations in Noida was in the range of 28.9 to 31.13 degrees Celsius during October 1 to November 6 last year, while the same was 28.2 to 29.77 degrees Celsius during the same period this year.Likewise, temperature during the same period at four monitoring stations in Ghaziabad was average of 30.12 to 31.64 degrees Celsius last year, while in the same period this year it was recorded in between 28.14 to 29.93 degrees Celsius. “Temperature also plays a vital role in dispersal of pollutants. If the mercury is high, it heats up the earth surface and moves the air upwards. Otherwise, the pollutants remain stagnant near the ground. October this year has been relatively cooler as we also recorded the lowest temperature of 58 years at Safdarjung in Delhi this October,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, Delhi. He added that apart from the mercury, the wind speed and also its direction also play vital roles in dispersal of pollutants. IMD officials on Friday had indicated that high pollution levels are likely to go till Diwali. “If the wind speed is below 5kmph then dispersal of pollutants becomes difficult. They disperse better in a wind speed range of 10-12kmph, while wind speed ranging 15-18kmph will clear more of the trapped pollutants. If the wind direction is north-westerly, they will bring in effects of stubble-burning from states like Punjab and Haryana, while easterlies will lower the effect as they come from eastern Uttar Pradesh,” he added.According to official statistics of the Consortium for Research on Agro-ecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (Creams) Laboratory, the instances of stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and UP, combined, have risen to 55,287 from October 1 to November 5 this year, as compared to 42,437 and 40,140 during the same period in 2019 and 2018, respectively.The CPCB data recorded at four monitoring stations of Noida from October 1 to November 6 last year indicates average wind speed was in the range of 2.88 to 5.07kmph, while it was recorded in lower range of 2.12 to 4.7kmph during the same period this year. For Ghaziabad, the average range during the same period last year was 4.28 to 6.9kmph, while during the same period this year the average range was 1.4 to 6.08 kmph at the four monitoring stations.“It is due to the combined effect of lower temperatures and relatively low wind speed that we have seen an early spike in pollution levels this year. The contribution of stubble-burning and local pollutants has also impacted,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of UP Pollution Control Board (UPPCB). “Last year, Noida and Ghaziabad started to witness high pollution levels at least three days before Diwali (Diwali was on October 27 last year) and the two cities reached a peak on November 1 and then there was gradual decline. However, this year, we are witnessing a peak since October 22 and with present conditions, it seems that it is likely to continue up to Diwali and a couple of days after, due to any effect of bursting crackers,” he added. City-based environmentalist Akash Vashishtha said that a longer period of high pollution levels should attract strict enforcement. “The pollution levels have already started rising and it is likely that such conditions will prevail till Diwali and a couple of days thereafter,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ghaziabad-in-for-long-pollution-haul-with-lower-temperature-wind-speed-this-season/story-kk4EaU3YOiP2ZCwr2m6EEJ.html
08-11-2020||City||Ludhiana: Man, kin duped of ₹22 lakh in investment fraud||Three persons have been booked for duping a man and his relatives of ₹22 lakh after coaxing them to invest in a scheme, which they promised would double their money.The accused have been identified as Suresh Mehra, the managing director of Blue Life Infra, his wife, Anita Mehra, who is the director of the company, and his brother, Rakesh Mehra, who serves as the additional director of the company.Complainant Brijinder Mishra of Gurdev Nagar, Mundian Kalan, said that the accused had lured him into the scheme a few months ago. Believing that it was a lucrative deal, he even got his relatives to invest in the scheme. Together, they all invested ₹40 lakh in the company. But later, the company neither gave them the interest nor the principal amount.After much pressure, the trio finally returned about ₹18 lakh but refused to return the rest. Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Gurmeet Singh, who is investigating the case, said the victim had lodged a complaint on July 28. After conducting a thorough probe, police have now registered an FIR under Sections 420 (cheating) and 120 (concealing design to commit offence punishable with imprisonment) of the Indian Penal Code, the ASI said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-man-kin-duped-of-22-lakh-in-investment-fraud/story-2XtQI6f7sa2gsfVoQhMaqI.html
08-11-2020||Chandigarh||Unregistered guest houses in HP eating into hotel business||Unregistered villas, flats and apartments that are being pitched to tourists as affordable accommodation across the state have become a thorn in the side for legitimate hoteliers, homestays and bed and breakfasts across the state as they have been losing considerable business to these illegal ventures. These unregistered guest houses are being rented through online travel companies and through touts. Tourists, too, prefer to put up at these accommodations due to the cheap tariff. Most of these accommodations only charge ₹500 to ₹1,000 per room during the off season. Registered hoteliers cannot hope to compete with the prices as the illegal ventures do not pay tax and use domestic water and power connections. With business being encroached, occupancy in registered businesses is around 10% during weekdays and increases to 15%-20% during the weekends. A large number of illegal guest houses have mushroomed around the state capital. The tourism department says there are around 3,350 registered hotels and 1,656 registered homestays in the state. Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president Mohinder Seth says , “Due to these unregistered accommodations, tourists are unwilling to pay even 50% tariff in the off season. This is a big blow for budget-class hotels, bread and breakfasts and home stays. It has become difficult to sustain hotels due to low- occupancy in hotels.”“The government does not get any tax from these unregistered accommodations, which causes losses to the government also,” he said. Hoteliers claim that it has become difficult for them to meet fixed expenditures such as staff salaries, electricity bills, water bills and garbage-collection fee. The industry is already reeling in the aftermath of the Covid crisis. Apart from a six-month waiver on fixed demand charges levied on hotels by Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Limited no other financial help has been extended to the hotel industry.The government has also announced an interest subvention scheme for the hotel industry, under which working capital will be provided to hotels but this has proved to be an eye wash as none of the hotelier benefitted from the scheme due to stringent norms. Banks are reluctant to sanction loans to hoteliers under the scheme.Rebate in property tax and waiver of garbage fee for the period when the hotels were completely closed is still awaited. Travel agents out of jobTravel Chapter Anil Bhardwaj senior vice-president said travel agents were not getting any business. “Unless Volvo bus service and flights are not resumed and train connectivity from Bengal, Maharashtra ,Delhi and Gujarat is not streamlined. Travel agents cannot expect any business. Moreover, online travel companies are also eating into travel agents’ business.” “The government should restart Volvos and ask the railways to restore of all train routes up to Kalka and Chandigarh at the earliest to save the travel and tourism industry,” he said.Hoteliers and tourism stakeholders do not expect the tourism and hospitality sectors to normalise before the summer and are seeking financial aid from the government. They have demanded that the government announce a special package, which includes domestic tariff for water, garbage-collection fee, property tax, waiver of fixed demand charges on electricity bills for at least one year and unconditional and collateral-free financial assistance in the shape of working capital loan to all hotels through state cooperative banks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unregistered-guest-houses-in-hp-eating-into-hotel-business/story-4sdDOfJIgblrWsJKKaOnvN.html
08-11-2020||City||Ludhiana’s AQI ‘very poor’, raises concerns over spike in Covid cases||At 316, the city’s air quality index (AQI) remained very poor on Sunday even as health experts expressed concern over the possibility of a spike in Covid cases due to this. Senior cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan, who is also a member of the Covid-19 Task Force formed by the state government, said that pollution can cause several health issues ranging from blood pressure, heart ailments and lung problems, besides also increasing the chances of contracting Covid-19.“The logic is simple. Pollution may lead to coughing and sneezing, especially among Covid patients, and this can in turn lead to the spread of the virus. The problem is only heightened by the fact that the droplets remain suspended in air for longer periods in cold weather conditions,” said Prof Mohan. Stubble burning to be blamedHe added that stubble burning (which a major cause of dipping AQI levels) has caused a 15% increase in Covid cases across the country. Prof Mohan said that at least three studies have been published in the last six months, highlighting the ill-effects of stubble burning on human health.As per the data provided by the Punjab Pollution Control Board, Ludhiana saw as many as 3,150 stubble burning cases between September 21 and November 7. The figure stood at 995 and 1, 890 for the corresponding period in 2019 and 2018 respectively.Meanwhile, the concentration of particulate matter, PM 2.5, in air also remained worrying at 366 micrograms. Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said that the concentration of dust can cause eye irritation and respiratory discomfort. “Those who have dust allergy or a compromised immune system should avoid going out,” he cautioned, adding that people should wash their hands and face regularly and cover their face while going out. “Our body has its own fighting mechanism. These dust particles have lesser toxicity than automobile exhaust and particulate matter produced by burning of crop residue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-s-aqi-very-poor-raises-concerns-over-spike-in-covid-cases/story-Ye6lWKrdGjj3ljimRLHZ1N.html
08-11-2020||Chandigarh||Marriage ceremonies, schools accelerate virus spread in Himachal||With the government deciding to reopen schools and relax restrictions on social gatherings, there has been an alarming increase in Covid infections in Himachal even as a second wave is expected to sweep through the state with the onset of winter. A total 24,917 people have tested positive in the state while 365 have succumbed to the deadly virus. Last month, the state had increased the ceiling for social gatherings to 200 while schools were opened for regular classes on November 2 for Classes 9 to 12. In the last two weeks alone (since October 25), as many as 4,442 new infections have been reported in the state, with 2,750 cases reported in the first week of November. On November 7, the state witnessed the highest single-day spike of 573 infections since the hill-state reported the first case on March 20. The death toll also increased by 27.6% in these two weeks with 73 people succumbing, of which 53 people died in November. Mandi, Shimla, Kullu become hotspots Three districts — Mandi, Shimla and Kullu — have seen the highest infections over the last two weeks. Mandi district reported a staggering 923 new infections. The infection has also spread in schools. Mandi logged 187 infections on November 7, the highest single-day spike in any Himachal district since the outbreak, of the new infections at least 100 were school children. Shimla has logged 909 infections in the same time period. The surge is largely due to the social gatherings and marriages. Similarly, Kullu reported 567 fresh infections in this period. Kangra, which is population-wise the largest district has reported 488 fresh infections. Una and Sirmaur that were hotspots in the initial stage of the outbreak, have reported 134 and 124 cases, respectively. Social distancing goes for a toss at ceremonies The increase in Covid cases across the state can be primarily attributed to marriage ceremonies and social gatherings. Around 50 Covid cases were reported in four villages — Shathala, Mangsu, Veergarh and Bithal in Kotgarh sub-tehsil. “Wedding ceremonies are primary reasons for spike in cases in some villages of Kumarsain sub-division as people are not following the Covid protocol. The cultural practices, including holding hands while dancing, makes following social distancing norms difficult,” said Kumarsain divisional magistrate Gurpreet Singh Cheema. “The administration has ordered closure of government senior secondary schools in Veergarh for five days while Kotgarh bazaar was also closed for two days. Schools will be reopened on Monday after being thoroughly sanitised,” he said. Kumarsain block medical officer (BMO) Dr Dr Tara Chand said four persons had tested positive in Shamathla village on Saturday while around eight people had tested positive in the last week. 92 students test positive in Tibetan Children Village As many as 92 students and staff at Tibetan Children Village (TCV) School Suja, Jogindernagar, Mandi have tested positive, including 47 girls, 20 boys and 25 staff members. The cases were detected after the administration decided to test all those arriving from outside the state and carried out a special testing campaign. A spokesperson said, “The students that have tested positive had come to the state between October 25 to 31 from Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Maharashtra and Nepal. “The cases were detected due to the state government’s pro-active approach. The district administration took stock of the facilities available in the school premises and isolated them. They are under observation of the health department and will be shifted to a Covid-Care Centre or hospital,” said secretary health Amitabh Awasthi. Covid tests have been increased in the state and around 6,000 tests are being conducted regularly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/marriage-ceremonies-schools-accelerate-virus-spread-in-himachal/story-y1lKPgx05nHM5DpWNjTasM.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||Thane-based groups come together to send Diwali sweets to Army personnel||After a Dombivli-based man floated an idea to share Faral, a collection of snacks and sweets, with Army personnel, five different groups from the area came together and sent 8,008 packets to Army personnel serving in the borders. Kunal Sutavane, 35, owner of travel agency Vivisu Dehra, has a few relatives serving in the Army and India Air Force. He used to send sweets to a few Army personnel every year through them. He said, “We always celebrate Diwali by giving gifts to our dear ones. The armed forces are there on the border; therefore we can celebrate such festivals happily. Every year, I used to send some sweets but a in a very small scale. While discussing the idea with a member of Hindu Nav Varsh Swagat Samiti in Dahisar who used to send such sweet boxes to the border, we decided to make it big his year. Accordingly, we floated the idea on social media, following which two more groups (Bharat Vikas Parishad from Panvel and Sadguru’s Welfare and Educational Trust, Dadar) joined us. We have sent almost 8,008 boxes to seven different parts of the border so far.”Ashish Sakhalkar, 45, head of Hindu Nav Varsh Swagat Samiti, said, “It’s is our group’s tradition to send sweets during Diwali to Army personnel every year. We started this ritual after one of our friend’s son joined the Army. He is now in Ladakh regiment. This year, we wanted to double the amount of boxed than last year’s 2,000. After we discussed this with Kunal and two other groups, we thought we can actually do it in a bigger scale. We posted a message on social media sites about our plan and several people from villages to those living in other countries helped us financially. Because of all the support, we sent 8,008 sweet boxes along with 19,000 healthy nutritious laddoos, 2,500 bottles of SPF 50 sun screen lotion of 100 ml each, two boxes of sweet lime juice and 550 greeting cards.”Sutavane said, “Through our relatives serving on the border, we took permission from each of the seven regiments. Then we sent out our orders to sweet shop owners. Students from Divya Vidyalaya Residential School for Blind and Mentally Challenged Tribal Children in Jawhar made 1,000 boxes of sweets. Children from different areas of Dombivli, Dahisar and specially-abled children from Dadar made greeting cards for Army personnel.”The boxes were sent to Army personnel posted at Jammu, Leh Ladakh, Imphal-Manipur, Jorhat-Assam, Shillong-Meghalaya, Tawang-Arunachal Pradesh, and Udhampur borders.Sakhalkar added, “We received a call that senior Army officials appreciated the efforts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-based-groups-come-together-to-send-diwali-sweets-to-army-personnel/story-2ltPolMrDlrrkrAtTri3wO.html
08-11-2020||City||On first anniversary of Kartarpur Corridor inauguration, devotees in Punjab want it reopened at the earliest||Opened amid much fanfare to meet a long-pending demand of the Sikh community in India, the Kartarpur Corridor is lying defunct on the first anniversary of its inauguration. The prolonged suspension of pilgrimage through this corridor that connects Dera Baba Nanak, a border town in Gurdaspur district of Punjab, to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan’s Kartarpur, has marred the anniversary celebrations and left the devotees upset.The corridor was inaugurated by Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan on November 9 last year to provide Indian devotees visa-free access to the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak, which is just four kilometers from the international border.It remained operational for only four months before governments of both countries closed it in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Even in those four months, several controversies cast shadow over it, and the turnout remained low. Only 59,000 people used the corridor, even as India asked Pakistan to allow 5,000 pilgrims daily and 10,000 on special days.Citing improvement in the pandemic situation, the Pakistan government first expressed its readiness to reopen the corridor on June 27. It then announced to reopen it on October 3, but the Indian government has remained undecided. As a result, the integrated check posts on both sides of the border are still wearing a deserted look.“The corridor on which crores of rupees were spent has unfortunately remained closed for the past eight months. If the Indian government could reopen all places of worship that are witnessing huge gatherings these days, why not open the corridor?” said Perneet Singh Bedi, president of the Dera Baba Nanak municipal council, adding that there is outrage among the Sikh community over the issue.“The Centre should reconsider its decision. The Punjab government has already raised a demand for reopening the corridor,” said cabinet minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who represents Dera Baba Nanak in the assembly. “There will be no issue in maintaining social distancing as the gurdwara complex is very large. Also, compliance of other norms will be ensured easily in view of arrangements made on both sides of the borders”. ‘Sikh community being discriminated with’BS Goraya, a former government official who worked on opening the corridor for over two decades, said: “This is discrimination with Sikh community. The Indian government is not ready to let pilgrims visit Kartarpur even as Pakistan has assured to take all precautions to protect them from Covid-19.” “Opening of the corridor was historic not only for the Sikh sangat but also for both the nations. When the Government of India has reopened all places of worship and also restarted international flight operations, there is no reason for it to keep the corridor closed,” said Gurpartap Singh Wadala, Akali legislator from Nakodar.Considering its current fate, next phases of the project are in limbo on both sides of the border, the major among them being construction of a bridge over the Ravi catchment area in Pakistan territory.Meanwhile, to mark the anniversary, Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and Evacuee Trust Property Board are organising a function at Kartarpur, while on the Indian side, radical Sikh organisations, including Dal Khalsa and Akal Federation, are holding a function near the integrated check post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-first-anniversary-of-kartarpur-corridor-inauguration-devotees-in-punjab-want-it-reopened-at-the-earliest/story-634jU057nQxN1rck5ING4K.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||Winter session of Maharashtra legislature may not be held in Nagpur||The winter session of the state legislature, slated to be held from December 7, is unlikely to be held in Nagpur this year amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the possibility of surge in Covid-19 cases after Diwali. The state government is expected to curtail the session to one week and hold it in Mumbai. The decision on the matter is expected to be taken in the business advisory committee (BAC) meeting to be held on Tuesday.After a review meeting in Nagpur this week, the state legislature administration has reportedly arrived at the conclusion in view of the risk in holding the session in Nagpur. Holding the session in Nagpur requires shifting and mobilising government staff including security agencies from all across the state. At least 5,000 people including legislators, political workers, and state staff are expected to attend the session if it is held in Nagpur.“The staff members, security personnel need to report to the Nagpur office of legislature at least two weeks prior to the commencement of the session. They will have to be kept in isolation at least for a few days. In addition, if 5,000 people attend the session, it will lead to the risk of spread of the virus. After visiting various offices that are involved in conducting the session earlier this week, we have come to the conclusion that it is very risky to conduct the winter session in Nagpur. We will submit our report, but the final call has to be taken by the state government during the BAC meeting on Tuesday,” said an official from the legislature.He said that 57 people were found positive during the state legislature’s monsoon session held on September 7 and 8. According to officials, the state too is not keen on holding the session in Nagpur. “The government had asked for the report on Parliament’s plan to hold its winter session. The parliament secretariat has informed us that they could cancel the winter session and directly hold the budget session in January-February. We are unlikely to cancel it as it could lead to criticism, but it can be curtailed to one week instead of the traditional duration of two weeks. It is likely to be held in Mumbai,” an official from Mantralaya said.Though the state legislature has been tapping the possibility of holding the session online, it has been facing technical difficulties. Another official said an online session needs a lot of manpower as every legislator will need to be assisted with a technical assistant at his/her residence and that there might be difficulties in giving opportunity to members to speak on any subject. Connectivity is another problem in holding the session online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/winter-session-of-maharashtra-legislature-may-not-be-held-in-nagpur/story-UIp4CEH5XNlIKosWiXnShO.html

Suspension of freight trains due to the farm agitation has hit coal supplies to power plants across the state. The power generation has nosedived at a time the demand has gone up due to the festive season (see box). Punjab State Power Corporation Limited, which otherwise sells power at this time of the year, is forced to buy it from the national grid, that too at 20% hiked prices. At present, only two government coal-based power plants are operating, that too at just 20% of installed capacity. Left with just two days of coal stock, they are generating around 350MW daily against the installed capacity of 1760MW. The private thermal plants are left with no coal stock and have been out of operation for a week.“There is a need for early restoration of coal supplies, as festival season is approaching, when demand is set to increase to around 5,500 MW daily. We have to purchase from the national grid on a short-term basis, which has become a costly affair, as prices have gone up 20% in a week,” said a senior PSPCL official.Due to the high demand in festival season, power prices in the national grid have gone up from ₹2.7 per unit to around ₹3.3 per unit. “We are suffering a double whammy, as this is usually the time we either sell power or bank it with other states. However, we are forced to purchase it due to the coal crisis,” PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director A Venu Parsad said. For the festival season, the corporation has tied up to buy 835 MW of power till November 30. “This will cost us from ₹3-3.5 per unit, depending upon the time of withdrawal from the national grid,” said Parsad, adding that PSPCL has already urged the government to resolve the issue of coal supplies at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rail-blockade-coal-stocks-drying-up-power-crisis-deepens-in-punjab/story-YiOzKM5huY04DaXIlJOEfO.html

During search, NCB officers found 10 gram ganja or marijuana from her home in Juhu. Zonal director Sameer Wankhede, NCB, confirmed the arrest of Saeed. Nadiadwala did not respond to HT’s calls and messages.The other arrested accused are drug peddlers and suppliers. NCB has seized 727.1 gram marijuana, 74.1 gram charas, and 95.1 gram MD (commercial quantity) along with ₹358,610 cash from the peddlers and suppliers.Following a tip-off, NCB first arrested Andheri resident Wahid Abdul Kadir Shaikh alias Sultan Mirza. During interrogation, he revealed the name of Saeed whom he had supplied marijuana to. Shaikh has been in the drug supply chain from several years and is known as Sultan Mirza, said NCB officers.An NCB team then reached Saeed’s residence and conducted a search in the presence of two independent witnesses. Ten gram marijuana, which was procured from Shaikh, was recovered. The notice was issued under section 67 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. NCB arrested her after recording her statement.Apart from Saeed and Shaikh, NCB arrested three more drug suppliers and their questioning is underway, said NCB officers.“The operation is still going on; hence the names of the other three suppliers cannot be revealed at this stage. We have seized commercial quantities of drugs from their possession,” said Wankhede.Nadiadwala, too, has been summoned for questioning in the case. He has produced several Bollywood films including Welcome, Phir Hera Pheri, Aarakshan, Deewane Huye Pagal, Kartoosh and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-ncb-arrests-wife-of-film-producer-firoz-nadiadwala-4-others-in-drugs-case/story-2HC1gk8mlRTgfmZqFCw9RI.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||Aspiring model held for stealing gold ornaments from relatives in Mumbai||Oshiwara police on Friday arrested a 26-year-old aspiring model for stealing gold ornaments from her relative’s house. The accused, who used to work as an advisor at an insurance firm, lost her job during the lockdown and was in need of money to continue her attempts to get modelling jobs, hence she resorted to stealing, said police officers. The arrested accused, Sheetal Nagraj Gholap, is a resident of Kranti Nagar in Jogeshwari (West), whereas the complainant, Sunita Agvane, lives in Ganesh Nagar, Jogeshwari (West). An officer from Oshiwara police station said, “Gholap aspires to become a model. As she was in need of money, a few days before Dussehra she visited Agvane’s house. She was aware that Agvane and her entire family were going out for personal work. They left the house together but Gholap had purposely left behind her phone at the flat. When they came down from the building, Gholap said she left her phone, took the keys and stole the ornaments from the flat.” “Agvane used the same technique again on Dussehra and stole some more ornaments. This time, the family noticed few ornaments were missing from their cupboard and visited Oshiwara police station to lodge a complaint. We registered a case against an unknown person under section 380 of the Indian Penal Code for theft and started investigation,” an officer said. A team formed under the supervision of senior inspector Dayanand Bangar and sub-inspector Tushar Sawant questioned everybody who had visited Agvane’s house and during questioning Gholap confessed to the crime. The police have recovered gold worth ₹2 lakh from a jewellery shop where she sold them. The accused was produced before metropolitan magistrate’s court on Saturday and has been released on bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/aspiring-model-held-for-stealing-gold-ornaments-from-relatives-in-mumbai/story-cmGYiASbmgDiWWS2BXuA6H.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body’s desalination plant project: Why not focus on water conservation, ask experts||Even as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is planning to revive its decade-old proposal to develop a desalination plant in the city to convert seawater into potable water, experts have said that the issue has brought back focus on the need for water conservation by way of harvesting and fixing leakages on Mumbai’s 6,000-km-long pipeline network. Ten days ago, Maharashtra environment minister Aaditya Thackeray had given his nod to BMC for preparing a feasibility report to revive the civic body’s plan for a desalination plant. The plan was first proposed in 2007 to provide an alternative water source to the city, owing to poor rainfall in the catchment areas of the dams that supply water to Mumbai. Later in 2016-17, the BMC had initiated the process to set up two desalination plants – one in south Mumbai and the other either at suburbs or any other location in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) – with a capacity to process 100 million litres per day (MLD) of seawater into potable water. However, the project was put on hold owing to high cost. Now the BMC has claimed that cost optimisation methods have been introduced for the project and the civic body estimates that a desalination plant for supplying 200 MLD of water can be constructed at an approximate cost of ₹1,800 crore. Currently, the city gets drinking water from the Bhatsa, Vaitarna, Middle Vaitarna, Modak Sagar, Tulsi, Tansa and Vehar lakes, which are located in Mumbai and the neighbouring Thane and Palghar districts. The civic body supplies 3,850 million litres of water per day (MLD), even as the city needs 4,200 MLD of water. The BMC has also proposed to construct the Gargai dam in Palghar district, which will supply around 440 MLD of water to the city. The civic body has anticipated the city’s water to surge to 5910 MLD by 2030. However, experts have stated that as water infrastructure projects such as building dams and introducing desalination plants are expensive means to avail water for the city, emphasis must be laid on water conservation. Commenting on BMC’s idea to revive the desalination plant project, Rakesh Kumar, director of CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-NEERI) last week told HT, “These are costlier options, and it brings back to the problem of how we handle our water resources and conservation.” Rainwater harvesting Around a decade ago, the civic body made it mandatory for residential and commercial buildings to install a rainwater harvesting system on their terraces. The BMC denies occupancy certificate (OC) to new projects if they did not implement the system. During its financial budget for 2020-2021, the BMC had also announced that the recycled water will be used for flushing and other non-potable building activities to reduce the load on supply by at least 1,350 MLD. It also made it mandatory for bulk users to install sewage water treatment plants (STPs) in its premises. However, the execution of the ambitious project on ground has not been encouraging and the ratio of rainwater lost continues to be substantial. According to BMC’s estimates, between June 2007 and December 2015, at least 5,000 new constructions were approved of which only 1,848 (36%) new buildings have implemented the rainwater harvesting system on their premises. Janak Daftari, a water conservationist who was associated with the BMC since the inception of the rainwater harvesting system project, said, “The implementation of rainwater harvesting system is poor. Typically, developers install an inadequately-designed tank to harvest water, merely for the sake of getting clearances from the BMC. Actually, it is ineffective for harvesting and provides little relief from water stress. Recycling waste water offers the most cost-effective solution for resolving water shortages in urban areas.” However, the BMC claims that annually only around 2,000 to 2,500 building proposals get passed, and that it is also the responsibility of citizens to conserve rainwater. Vinod Chithore, director of BMC’s engineering services, said, “We have made it mandatory for residential buildings to have rainwater harvesting plants on terraces and don’t give permissions to buildings without it. Now if the harvesting is not carried out, we cannot blame the administration alone. Annually more than 2,000 buildings get permissions, and it is also the moral responsibility of citizens to ensure that water is harvested.” Leakages and unaccounted supply Experts have also said that the city must tap on non-revenue water. Of the annual supply, around 20% of the water is lost owing to leakages and illegal water connections. The BMC has been working towards digitalising the water supply system of the city which is around 6,000 km long. “Annually around 28% of the total water supply is not accounted for owing to illegal water connections or wastage due to leakages. This is a major problem with our water supply system and a big failure on part of the BMC to regulate water theft or misuse. We might not need costly projects if we execute basic water conservation methods properly,” Sitaram Shelar, convenor of Pani Haq Samiti, an organisation that works towards universal access to water. “When it comes to water pipelines and unaccounted water, the department has been consistently working towards ensuring that the city’s water supply chain functions well. But we need to understand that in a city like Mumbai, maintenance of water supply is a challenging task. It is a continuous process in which if we fix one thing, something else may pop out. This process will go on,” said Chithore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-s-desalination-plant-project-why-not-focus-on-water-conservation-ask-experts/story-2Rts4Z19QmBYpHPDIbQkqL.html

We are dead against the movement of passenger trains. Protesters have vacated tracks and platforms, but we will not move out of the railway properties till our demands are met,” said Dallewal.Dallewal said Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, an umbrella body of 110 farm organisations of the country, held a meeting in Delhi on Saturday, where it was decided to hold a massive demonstration on November 26 and 27.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Balbir Singh Rajewal and Dallewal are part of the seven-member national panel formed to coordinate the Delhi agitation.Ploy to quell our movement: RajewalRajewal said stopping the freight train services was a ploy of the Union government to quell the farmers’ movement. He said the proposal to clear the tracks for freight trains was approved keeping in view the interests of the state, traders, industrialists and exporters.“We had left the tracks on October 21 too. For two days, the freight trains were operating. No incident of violence was reported and the traffic was not disrupted. But suddenly, the Railways slammed brakes on goods trains, which clearly shows the hidden agenda of the Centre,” he said.Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, which on Saturday vacated the Amritsar-Delhi railway tracks and moved their dharna outside the Jandiala railway station, said Centre was trying to ruin Punjab’s economy. “The intention of the central government is to create financial crisis in the state for its political benefit. Our farmers are also facing a shortage of fertilisers,” committee’s senior vice-president Sawinder Singh Chutala said. Ruldu Singh of Punjab Kisan Union said they have received no invitation of talks from any government agency.“A joint meeting has been called in Chandigarh on November 18, where the future course of agitation will be decided. Till then, agitations will continue near railway stations in different districts,” he said.Meanwhile, additional divisional railway manager, Ferozepur, Balbir Singh said there has been no decision on resuming trains in Punjab.DSGMC offers full support to Delhi event For the farmers’ national-level demonstration planned at the Ramlila Ground in Delhi on November 26-27, the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) has assured full support. “DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa informed me that he would give all support, including food and lodging, to the farmers while they are in Delhi for the two-day protest,” Jagmohan Singh Patiala of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakounda) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/won-t-allow-passenger-trains-to-run-reiterate-farmers-protesting-in-punjab/story-U6breAHUcYLbpzENbe1tTL.html
08-11-2020||Chandigarh||Amid farm protests, Punjab CM talks to Shah for restarting goods trains||Reiterating his assurance of smooth and safe movement of goods trains in the state, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday said he had spoken to Union home minister Amit Shah for his intervention to ensure restoration of rail services and was hopeful of an early resolution of the issue. This comes at a time 30 farm unions protesting against the three new agriculture laws reiterated on Sunday that they would not allow movement of passenger trains in Punjab, while accusing the central government of playing politics by not running freight trains even as the agitators have vacated railway tracks across all districts.The chief minister spoke to Shah on Saturday to discuss the situation and assured him that there were no law and order concerns to prevent resumption of the services for facilitating supply of essential commodities in Punjab and neighbouring states, including Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.He pointed out that security concerns could, however, be serious for the nation if essential supplies did not reach the armed forces in Ladakh and the Valley before snowfall due to the Railways’ decision not to ply goods trains. Countering the misinformation being spread on this count, Amarinder said all tracks had been cleared by farmers for movement of freight trains, pointing that the farmers had not disturbed peace in any part of the state. Restating his earlier assurance to Union railways minister Piyush Goyal, the CM told Shah he had directed Punjab Police to extend all support to the Railway Protection Force in providing security on the tracks as well as the platforms to enable smooth movement of freight trains.The state government said the CM was closely engaged with the farmer organisations to persuade them to lift blockade completely so as to allow passenger trains to commute as well. Punjab rural development and panchayats minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa and cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, who are part of a state committee holding discussions with the farmers, also asked the Centre to show a good gesture by resuming freight trains so that economic activity in the state, which has been held up for almost 45 days, could restart.“I do not know why the Centre is arm-twisting Punjab government and Punjabi farmers,” said Bajwa.The comments come two days after the railway board pointed out that the Punjab government had been unable to remove all blockades on the rail network with as many as 22 sites to be cleared. Board chairman VK Yadav had said both freight and passenger trains will be started in one go. Allow movement of passenger trains too: Bir DevinderFormer deputy speaker and Shiromani Akali Dal (Panthic) leader Bir Devinder Singh on Sunday said the agitating farm unions should seriously deliberate upon the issue of allowing hassle-free movement of passenger trains in Punjab, as they have agreed to the movement of goods trains.With passenger trains coming to a halt, the general public is facing difficulties while the transporters’ lobby is the biggest beneficiary, he said. “The railway minister and farmer unions must see the logic in this public demand and allow smooth operations of all trains in Punjab, notwithstanding the continuation of the agitation for farmers’ most legitimate demands,” he said.He also requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to not support business interest of the corporate houses and come to the rescue of farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-farm-protests-punjab-cm-talks-to-shah-for-restarting-goods-trains/story-WbN0cLR4u39mJSJT3TqumI.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||Can’t hold online hearings with outdated computers: MAT informs Bombay HC||The Maharashtra administrative tribunal (MAT) at its principal seat in Mumbai and benches at Nagpur and Aurangabad could not conduct hearings through video conferencing (VC) during the Covid-19 lockdown due to outdated computers and lack of technical manpower, MAT registrar Suresh Joshi has informed the Bombay high court (HC).In a report submitted to HC, Joshi has said that most of the computers being used at MAT are very old – purchased between 2007 and 2014. Besides, the tribunals lack the technical manpower to conduct video conferences, he said, adding that at least two technical persons are required for the tribunal at Mumbai and one each at its benches. Therefore, since June, the tribunal has been conducting physical hearings, the report states.Working twice a week during the Covid-19 pandemic, MAT benches have heard a total o 1,220 cases filed during this period, along with several other urgent matters, and have disposed of 599 cases, the report adds.Joshi filed the report pursuant to an October 28 order passed by the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, on a petition filed by advocate Yogesh Morbale, a resident of Ichalkaranji in Kolhapur district.In his petition filed through advocate Vinod Sangvikar on October 6, Morbale complained that he had been stuck at his native place because of the pandemic, and thousands of lawyers like him and litigants were deprived of access to MAT because of lack of online filing and hearing by the tribunal.He had, therefore, sought directions to the MAT to conduct hearings through video conferencing on a daily basis and to update its website to support an e-court system and make it user friendly.As regards the MAT website, Joshi said in his report that the tribunal had started its website in July 2013. It was designed by Mahaonline Limited and only had certain basic features. He added that the space provided for the website on the state government’s server is insufficient and therefore, whenever data is required to be uploaded on it, the tribunal has to approach the director, information technology.The MAT registrar’s report adds that the tribunal has a chairman, three vice-chairmen and five members. However, of the three member posts, one each at Mumbai, Nagpur and Aurangabad are vacant, and two of the three vice-chairmen are due to retire on November 17, 2020, and January 22, 2021.Thus, no bench will be available at Aurangabad from November 17, 2020, and government employees from the Marathwada region will have to move either to Mumbai or to Nagpur in case of urgency. For hearing regular matters from Marathwada region, MAT will have to make arrangements for circuit benches, the report adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/can-t-hold-online-hearings-with-outdated-computers-mat-informs-bombay-hc/story-WF0bpSzlKx3qIyrjPSLfnI.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||Green Diwali: Women from Maharashtra’s border village make seed crackers, sweets||This Diwali, light up your house in a different way. Instead of fireworks, bring home a seed cracker that would burst into a plant.Concerned about noise, air and light pollution from firecrackers affecting birds and animals, a group has developed a unique concept – BeejParva or seed crackers - to celebrate an eco-friendly festival this year.Women from 40 families, part of the Gram Art Project (GAP), a collective of farmers, painters, social workers, and writers from Paradsinga village in Chhindwara district, on the border of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, have made exact replicas of firecrackers (available in markets – see image) using recyclable material embedded with seed balls. Rather than bursting them, these uniquely designed crackers, which have seven different variations can be sowed in a pot, watered, and nourished into an edible plant. “There is an urgent need to address the impacts of our actions on voiceless species like birds and animals that suffer miserably due to the use of firecrackers during festivals like Diwali every year. Thus, we came up with this idea that not only benefits them but the overall environment while ensuring the concept also upholds the symbol of this festival,” said Shweta Bhattad, visual artist and member, GAP.The variations of plant species and types of crackers include the micro-green ladi (series of crackers that have seven types of seeds in them - red amaranthus, amaranth, fenugreek, common purslane, mustard, green amaranthus, and spinach). “This cracker has seven pairs of micro-green seeds for each day of the week. One simply needs to separate each pair, sow them in different pots and water regularly, and can be consumed within a month,” said Nutan Dwivedi, another member.Other seed crackers include the phoenix chakkar (using onion seeds), hemp bomb (roselle seeds), golden shower (amaranthus seeds), laxmi bomb (bauhinia racemosa seeds), coriander tikli (coriander seeds), and cucumber rocket (cucumber and green sorrel seeds). The growth of the plant has been designed similar to the emitting trajectory of a cracker. For example, the anar firecracker (flower pot) forms a shower of colours when lit. Similarly, the golden shower (amaranthus) forms the same pattern when nourished into a plant.“A normal series of crackers (ladi) lasts hardly seven seconds even after having more than a dozen crackers in it creating both noise and air pollution. On the contrary, if you nurture the hatcher ladi, the plant will last for more than seven generations. Instead of creating pollution and disrupting the ecosystem, it will rejuvenate it,” said Roshni Narnawre, member of the group.The group has been working with environmentalist and IT professional Arundhati Mhatre in Mumbai to share the concept among nature lovers in the city. “The concept took me by surprise when I learnt that all the crackers were handmade, and so much thought had gone behind this. Such projects need to be replicated in different regions while also nurturing the livelihood of communities working on them. In this case, the use of art to create something so meaningful in an attempt to conserve nature is the need of the hour,” said Mhatre adding that apart from the ladi, which is priced at ₹50 apiece, all other seed crackers are priced at ₹40.Bhattad added that GAP generally has 100 families from across 10 villages involved in seed band projects. “However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we had to restrict our work to the closest villages. For BeejParva, we had ladies from 40 families from two villages,” she said.Seed-sweets an alternative to expensive sweets this DiwaliNot just crackers but the group of women from GAP have also made seed-sweets are an alternative to expensive sweets available in the market during Diwali. These seed-sweets are seed balls made from waste paper and are biodegradable. “They can be consumed once nurtured after sowing and watering. They are alternatives to sweets during festivals with main ingredients as sugar and palm oil. We intended to highlight the burden of overworked sugarcane farmers across the country while habitat degradation to recover palm oil from monoculture plantations,” said Dwivedi. The four variations of the seed-sweets include palm-oil free laddu with tomato and radish seeds, what-less cookies with brinjal and common purslane seeds, sugar-free barfi with okra and amaranthus seeds, and sovereign cham-cham with chilli and carrot seeds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/green-diwali-women-from-maharashtra-s-border-village-make-seed-crackers-sweets/story-gGwPqEWceHFPnhX3vdIXeL.html
08-11-2020||Gurugram||GCER murder: Cops visit crime spot where woman was shot||Two police teams consisting of 15 police personnel on Sunday visited the crime spot where 26-year-old Pooja Sharma was shot in the head by three masked men during a suspected robbery attempt near Golf Course Extension Road on October 26. The victim died the next day while undergoing treatment at a private hospital, said the police. Despite six days having passed, the police are yet to make any headway in the case though they have questioned more than 200 suspects and history-sheeters. They have also scanned nearly 200 CCTV cameras of different locations, conducted technical surveillance and worked on dumped mobile data.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the special investigation team visited the crime spot on Sunday and questioned a few people and staff members of three liquor shops. “There are liquor shops close by and there are possibilities that the suspects might have stopped there to buy liquor. We have recovered a vital clue and are verifying the registration number of the suspect’s bike from three of the liquor shops,” he said. The liquor shops are operational until midnight, so the teams have questioned more than 20 staff members from the shops to know if they happened to have seen any of the suspects or whether their faces were captured in the shop while buying liquor. Sangwan said the motive of the murder is likely to be a failed robbery but they are looking at all possible angles, including old enmity. “The victim, Pooja Sharma, and her fiance, Sagar Manchanda, had left the Sector 31 market at around 8pm and they were shot at 11pm. As such, there is a slim chance of anybody following them. The location of the suspects as per CCTV camera is on the Golf Course Extension Road stretch and they were seen taking rounds,” he said. Manchanda told the police that the suspects tried to open the car door multiple times and when they failed, they shot at both of them. Manchanda escaped unhurt while Sharma was hit in her head. They got scared as they were suddenly intercepted in their way and did not get a chance to flee from the spot. Sharma, who was driving the car, tried to speed away but got shot. Sharma worked with an IT company in Sector 48 in medical claims and insurance department, while Manchanda is a software engineer from IIT-Roorkee. They were about to get married this year but due to lockdown their wedding was postponed, said the police. Sharma suffered one bullet injury in the head, which resulted in her death, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gcer-murder-cops-visit-crime-spot-where-woman-was-shot/story-Chr95IOinXZy5L7i4GyWRJ.html
08-11-2020||City||Cops bust gang involved in 19 daytime burglaries; one held||The city police on Saturday night arrested one member of a gang for its alleged involvement in at least 19 daytime burglaries in six residential areas across the city over the last six months, said the police. The gang used to target only locked houses in areas such as sectors 5, 14, 53, 54, 56, 57, Sushant Lok-1 and Palam Vihar, said Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime). “The gang members had a common mode of operation. They used to target locked houses and ring the doorbell at least thrice. If no one answered within 10 minutes, they used to break the lock and ransack the house,” he said. The police said more than 50 theft cases were reported in the month of October alone from across the city. Sangwan said after the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 was announced, many families had left the city between March and April and returned after a gap of three months. He said they received calls from these areas, informing the police that their houses were targeted and cash and valuables were missing. In many cases, the burglars had even taken away television sets and groceries. The suspect has been identified as Suresh Singh alias Sonu of Chawla in Delhi. As per the police, he has revealed the names of three of his close aides, although the police are yet to arrest them. The gang members became operational six years ago and, since then, have been allegedly involved in more than 100 cases of burglary across the city. The police are working to identify more cases the gang members might have been involved in. They recovered CCTV footage from different areas and formed teams to look for the suspects. The footage gave the police leads on the location where the suspects were seen scouting repeatedly. The police said Singh is a history-sheeter who served time in Bhondsi, Tihar, Faridabad and Uttar Pradesh jails over the last six years. He along with his gang members would usually steal items such as cash, jewellery and laptops, which are usually easier to carry in bags. However, due to lockdown, they picked up whatever they could find, sometimes even things from the kitchen, said the police, adding that they would spend ample time in a house or apartment without any fear. “During questioning, he revealed they carried out burglaries in locked houses as they were aware people had left for their home towns and would not return anytime soon,” Sangwan said. The police said FIRs against them have been registered under sections 380 (theft in dwelling house), 454 (house trespass) and 457 (house trespass in night) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cops-bust-gang-involved-in-19-daytime-burglaries-one-held/story-K5riknU048Ee23q5LuepLP.html
08-11-2020||Gurugram||Faridabad Police saves three men from kidnappers; two held||Faridabad Police on Saturday arrested two history-sheeters after a two-hour-long car chase, while trying to save three men whom the suspects had kidnapped. Two of the associates of the suspects, who were also inside the car, managed to escape arrest, said the police. According to the police, they received a call from an advocate at the police control room, informing that four men have kidnapped two traders from the sabji mandi area in Dabua. He shared the car’s registration number and told the police that the kidnappers have headed towards the forest area. The police said that they later found out that the kidnappers had also arrested a third person from Faridabad, who was also present inside the car. Anil Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that they immediately formed teams and sent crime investigation agency of Sector 48 in three directions. “The crime units took out the details of the car owner and set the number on surveillance. The mobile location was traced to village Bhakri in Faridabad, which is close to the forest area on Faridabad-Gurugram Road,” he said. One of the crime units located the car of the kidnappers, a Maruti Swift, and tried to intercept it. However, when the car did not stop, the police rammed their vehicle into the car and forced it to stop. The police said they rescued three men, two of whom are traders dealing in paneer (cottage cheese) and have shops in the sabji mandi. They used to deal in cash regularly and are in their early twenties, said the police, adding that the other victim, was a manager at a crusher zone. Although the victims knew the kidnappers separately, they, however, did not know one another, said the police. Yadav said the two of suspects who were arrested have been identified as Karan and Lokesh of Faridabad. The police have recovered three countrymade pistols, eight live cartridges, one iron rod and a swift car from their possession. Two of their associates, Kuldeep and Sehdev, had fled the spot before police could arrest them. A case under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 148 (Rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 364A (kidnapping for ransom), 506 (criminal intimidation), 342 (wrongful confinement), 365 (kidnapping), 379 B (snatching) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 25-54 of Arms Act was filed at Dabua police station During investigation, it was revealed that on Saturday, at around 1.30am, when one of the victims, Sunny Kumar, who works in a crusher zone as a manager, was busy with his work, the suspects asked him to board their car and took him from towards the forest area near Pali village. Two of them took him at gunpoint and three of them thrashed him and threatened him for life, said the police. ACP Yadav said that they took Kumar to the forest area and tied him with a rope to a tree and stuffed cloth in his mouth. Later, they left him alone in forest area and asked him to think about how he can arrange money for his release. The two other victims narrated their ordeal to the police. One of the two victims, Pradeep Kumar, was repairing his motorbike on Saturday morning around 11am when the four suspects came and forced him into the Swift car. When his friend Hariom objected, they also kidnapped him at gunpoint and took both of them to the same place where the suspects had kept the other victim. They assaulted with him sticks and iron rods and asked them to arrange ₹50,000 for release. Kumar said the suspects assaulted them and threatened them not to make noise. He said they were shocked to see another man tied with a rope. The suspects then asked all three to board the car. As they were being taken to another location, the police spotted the car and rescued them. The rescue operation went on for almost two hours, said the police. Three of the victims were admitted to a private hospital for treatment as they had suffered physical injuries from the assault. Yadav said these suspects are all history-sheeters and have been jailed several times for kidnapping, attempt to murder, theft and forgery cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faridabad-police-saves-three-men-from-kidnappers-two-held/story-Qa4jreTmnvpHOIW8HNYM1N.html
08-11-2020||Gurugram||Fire department prepares for Diwali||Despite the Haryana government allowing a two-hour window period for the sale and burning of firecrackers, the Gurugram fire department said it will continue to be on high alert this Diwali like all other previous years. On Sunday evening, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had allowed the bursting and sale of firecrackers for two hours on the day of Diwali. The fire department said it has cancelled all leaves of firemen till November 16 and directed them to work on a 12-hour shift instead of the usual eight-hour shift to ensure the maximum presence of staff for any possible fire mishaps.“Leaves of all 200 firemen have been cancelled till next Monday. In addition, nearly 200 firemen will be working on Diwali in two batches of 12-hour shifts. The staff usually works in three eight-hour shifts. However, realising that the chances of fire incidents are the highest on Diwali, we wanted the maximum manpower available. Hence the staff have been directed to work for an additional four hours,” said Satyawan Samriwal, assistant divisional fire officer (ADFO).At least 20 fire incidents were reported across the city on October 27, Diwali last year. However, no injuries were reported.In 2018, 28 incidents of fire were reported, which resulted in at least six people suffering burn injuries on Diwali, November 7. In 2017, 13 incidents of fire were reported on Diwali, October 19, although no injuries where reported. “Although there is only a two-hour window for bursting of firecrackers this year, there remains a possibility that people may have purchased firecrackers in bulk beforehand or have stock from previous years. They may even have purchased them illegally. In addition, fires from diyas (lamps) is also a common occurrence during Diwali. Hence, we are undertaking all possible measures as usual,” said Samriwal.On Friday, the Haryana government had banned the sale of all firecrackers in the state, citing high levels of air pollution and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Later, on Saturday, the government had allowed use of firecrackers for two hours In both 2019 and 2018, sale and bursting of only green firecrackers were allowed in Gurugram.Samriwal further said that all 25 fire tenders and seven fire bikes would be strategically placed across the city on Diwali to ensure that the response time in the event of a fire is minimal.“In areas such as Sadar Bazaar, where the streets are narrow, the time taken for fire tenders to reach the spot is usually higher. Hence, we will position at least two fire bikes there along with two more fire tenders to ensure that the response time is kept to a minimum. We are working on finalising more such areas across the city, where tenders and fire bikes need to be strategically located,” said Samriwal.Samriwal further said that he, along with fire department officials, visited warehouses in Chandu Budhera, Farrukhnagar, and Sultanpur Road on Sunday to check if sale or purchase of firecrackers were being conducted illegally. However, the fire department did not find any such violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/fire-department-prepares-for-diwali/story-K3g5gqwMLGD6TCEsGcdotM.html
08-11-2020||Gurugram||City air still ‘severe’; no improvement till next week||The air quality in the city remained in the “severe” category for the second consecutive day on Sunday with a reading of 434 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin. Saturday’s reading is only a few points below the previous day’s AQI reading of 439, also in the “severe” category. An AQI reading between 401 and 500 is categorised as “severe” and can cause distress and respiratory complications, especially for children and senior citizens, as per air quality experts. The average daily concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 — the city’s most prominent pollutant — on Sunday was 436.95µg/m³, as per the HSPCB’s official air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan. Officials and experts attributed the spike in pollution to poor dispersion of pollutants and farm fires. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to remain in the “severe” to “very poor” categories on Monday. Air quality is expected to persist in the same category on Tuesday as well. As per the warning system, a high count of farm fires was adversely affecting the air quality in Delhi-NCR. Further, average wind speed less than 10 kmph was not favourable for the dispersion of pollutants. Calm winds with speed up to 5-8kmph are expected to prevail on Monday. Experts said that due to the prevalence of slow wind speed, a significant improvement in air quality was not on the cards. Navdeep Dahiya, a Rohtak-based meteorologist, said that due to the prevalence of calm winds along with other factors, pollutants couldn’t be dispersed. “The wind speed didn’t pick up significantly due to which there was no significant impact on the AQI. High-speed winds are needed for the dispersal of pollutants due to the layer of fog that has enveloped,” said Dahiya. He said that continuing stubble burning, along with temperature inversion, was also contributing to the high pollution levels.Dahiya said that no significant improvement in air quality was expected until Diwali. “There is stability in the atmosphere. There is no immediate western disturbance or weather system that might help in the improvement,” he said. On Sunday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 13 degrees Celsius, three degrees below the normal. The maximum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 27.5 degrees Celsius, two degrees below Saturday’s 29.9 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature is expected to hover around 13 degrees Celsius on Monday while the maximum temperature is expected to be around 29 degrees Celsius. Clear skies are expected to prevail this week with fog and mist in the morning hours, as per the IMD’s weekly forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-air-still-severe-no-improvement-till-next-week/story-mP11WCt35HfSjE61ZYb5TI.html

A bench of Punjab and Haryana high court, hearing a petition on November 3, directed the HSVP not to take up auction of any site, until they dispose of all the applications that have been pending for years, for allotment of plots at alternate sites due to issues with original allotment. The court, in its directions, observed that the order was passed to ensure that the officials of HSVP do not dispose of all the available sites and thereafter, give an excuse to the petitioner herein and other similarly placed persons, that all the sites are already allotted and therefore, there is no site available for allotment in their favour.

In a directive shared with principals of government colleges and universities on Saturday, the department of higher education said that the centralised admission portal for new registrations and editing of forms will stay open till November 13. Besides new admissions, students will also be able to update their course subject choices. The directive, issued by Hemant Verma, deputy director (coordination), higher education department, said that admission of students against vacant seats will take place without any late fee. In case of colleges having vacant seats other than reserved seats, the seats may be converted into open category for admission. Admission against vacant seats will take place from Monday till November 14 through physical counselling. Further, colleges have been directed to refund the admission fee of students who might have cancelled admissions. Alka Gulati, nodal officer for admissions at Dronacharya Government College, said that the admission portal had been opened again to accept admission forms for vacant seats. “Many colleges have vacant seats that need to be accounted for. In our college, some seats remain vacant across different courses. Colleges had also been receiving requests from those who missed the process earlier. Students who couldn’t apply earlier can do so now,” said Gulati. Dr Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, said that the window had been reopened again since many students had not been able to apply earlier, due to pending exams and results in their colleges. “The new registration will take place online followed by physical counselling for students who wish to get admission. The process should get over by November 14 after which classes can be resumed,” said Yadav. He said that with all formalities expected to get over by mid-November, colleges would start for regular sessions from November 16. Online classes are already taking place in colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/admissions-for-vacant-ug-seats-reopened-till-november-13/story-sOtMjK8KHQ6VwZHqj0ZTqO.html
08-11-2020||Gurugram||H-Rera creates mediation forum for faster resolution of real estate disputes||The Haryana-Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera), Gurugram, has established a mediation forum for the amicable resolution of disputes between real estate developers and homebuyers. The authority said that alternate dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms like arbitration, mediation, and conciliation are much more private, economical and time-saving than litigation. As such, the regulatory authority felt the need to promote such mechanisms in the real estate sector, which has seen a huge pendency of cases due to homebuyers approaching the authority for grievance redressal. An official spokesperson of H-Rera said that over the years, the authority has brought to the forefront a multitude of cases relating to homebuyer’s dissatisfaction in dealing with real estate developers and service providers.“H-Rera, Gurugram, has therefore decided to adopt mediation as an ADR mechanism for dispute resolution in real estate matters and has set up a fully dedicated mediation centre/forum for the same”, the spokesperson said, adding that the mediation forum will provide the parties with an option to have a settlement outside the formal proceedings of authority.The authority has constituted a panel of mediators, equipped with the requisite skills to mediate in real estate disputes. There shall be two types of cases that shall fall under the ambit of mediation forum: Firstly applications made for mediation at pre-filing of formal complaint stage that shall be taken up by grievance redressal cell and the chief public relations officer of H-Rera, Gurugram, Dr. Deepa Malik on an individual basis. The second type of cases are the complaints referred by the authority to the district and session judge and adjudicating officer of H-Rera, S.C. Goel (retd), relating to the provisions of Section 89 of CPC. The spokesperson said that in case the authority is convinced that a particular complaint case can be resolved through mediation then such references can be made by the authority even without the consent of the parties. The cases to be heard by adjudicating officer shall be taken up bulk, which means that 15 to 20 cases per day shall be received, he said, adding that such complaints which are already pending before the authority may be referred to the panel of mediators headed by the adjudicating officer at any stage and at any time during the proceedings of the court. To start with, 310 complaints against one developer that are pending before the authority have been referred for mediation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/h-rera-creates-mediation-forum-for-faster-resolution-of-real-estate-disputes/story-YG2ugp6HUGRYsUFi1B3WAM.html
08-11-2020||Gurugram||Residents oppose smart meters||Around 700 residents, representing residents’ welfare associations from across the city, convened in Bajghera on Sunday morning in protest of the installation of smart meters. The group, under the aegis of Jan Adhikar Sanghathan, decided to launch a public movement against the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam’s (DHBVN) move to install smart meters.Residents, mostly from Palam Vihar, New Palam Vihar, Bajghera, Sai Kunj and adjoining colonies, alleged that the smart meters are inaccurate and that they are getting inflated bills. Members of the group said they will submit memorandums and hold protests, failing which they would refuse to pay the bills if the smart meters are not removed.Bir Singh ‘Beeru Sarpanch’, who heads the recently formed Jan Adhikar Sanghathan, said, “Smart meters or any other tax is imposed in Gurugram because people are vulnerable and not united, but we will oppose this move. We will submit memorandums, hold protests and finally refuse to pay the bills if the government doesn’t listen to us.”Rakesh Rana, president of Sai Kunj RWA, said that they have repeatedly raised the issue with authorities, but to no avail. “These smart meters run fast and produce inflated bills, which have hurt the common man badly,” said Rana.Residents also demanded that the government waive off three months of electricity charges, for the lockdown period, on the lines of subsidies issued to power companies.Col (retd) Ved Prakash, a resident of New Palam Vihar, said that he has got a bill of Rs 64,000 this October, in comparison to a bill of Rs 5,000 for the same period last year. “These meters will destroy the lives of common man,” he said.Kuldip Dahiya, a resident of Palam Vihar, said he has received a bill of Rs 83,000 for a period of two months. “I am not alone. Many are suffering due to smart meters and we will oppose this move of the government strongly,” he said.Singh alleged that the elected representatives of Gurugram always stood with the government and do not take up issues being faced by people. “We will fight ourselves,” he said, adding that a memorandum will be given to the deputy commissioner on Tuesday in this matter.The DHBVN, however, maintained that smart meters are accurate and sensitive, and had been tested rigorously. “These meters are tested and are very accurate. There is no chance of fast reading but if consumers still feel that there is some issue, then they can submit a representation and these can be tested,” said Kulvinder Singh, assistant engineer, Smart Grid project.The DHBVN till date has installed one lakh smart meters across the city under this project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/residents-oppose-smart-meters/story-SRp4M4kWJLyPCt84sQBvQM.html
08-11-2020||City||Yet another peak in daily Covid infections||The district on Sunday reported 964 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), marking the highest single-day spike in cases since the outbreak began in March. The record high comes just two days after the district recorded 704 new cases on November 6, which was then the highest spike reported in Gurugram. From 30,527 reported infections a week ago, the total tally of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram is now inching towards the 35,000 mark, with 34,742 infections reported at present.Over the last week, 4,215 new infections were reported, which was significantly higher than the 2,566 infections reported the week prior. Also, this is the highest weekly aggregate in over at least the past six weeks.Health department data also shows that the test positivity rate (TPR) over the past week has consistently been trending upward, from 10.7% on October 26 to 21% on November 1, and to 24% on November 8. There has also been an increase, over the past week, in the actual number of daily tests, with the district having tested 4,008 people on Sunday.Official and experts both expressed caution over the steady increase in positivity rate. “There is definitely some cause for concern, because when the TPR goes up consistently, it indicates that the transmission of the virus among the general population has been accelerating. This was to be expected, since we are moving into the winter season, and lower temperatures enable quicker transmission of infectious respiratory diseases. And since we are also heading into the festive season, public movement has also increased,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former head of the department of community medicine at PGIMER, Chandigarh.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “Falling temperatures, increasing social engagements and a laxity in social distancing are responsible for the spike in new cases. People are not complying with basic hand and mask hygiene guidelines. We are also continuing to see this trend of whole families testing positive, which we started observing in September, because multiple members of a single household are venturing out freely. I strongly advise that people should curb going outdoors unless absolutely necessary.”The district at present has 5,183 active cases of Covid-19, up from 3,707 cases a week ago. This is also the highest number of active cases since the beginning of the outbreak. Of these, 309 are presently hospitalised (up from 214 a week ago), while 4,865 patients are under home isolation (up from 3,486 patients a week ago). Another nine patients (up from seven a week ago) are under observation at district Covid care centres.The daily growth rate of cases, from being a little over 1% in early October, currently stands at 2.8% (from about 1.7% a week ago). The growth rate has also been trending upward for the past two weeks, health department data shows. This has resulted in a shrinking of the doubling rate of cases, which stands at 55 days (as opposed to 65 days a week ago).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yet-another-peak-in-daily-covid-infections/story-8GDhqMyxhByeSw3JHwDAcP.html
08-11-2020||Gurugram||Over 60% of ICU beds occupied, but officials prepared to meet any spike||With cases of Covid-19 steadily rising in the district, 60% of all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in the district are currently occupied, as per data available with the district health department, up from about 40% a month ago. On the other hand, the data also shows that only 30% of general beds with oxygen facilities are occupied, which officials attribute to most active cases being asymptomatic or mild in nature, with patients opting for home isolation. Occupancy of ventilator beds also remains low, with only a third of them currently in use.Officials in the district administration and health department said they are keeping a close watch on the occupancy rates, in case infrastructure needs to be ramped up. However, they also emphasised that there is presently no reason to fear a shortage of beds in the near future, with about 40% of all hospitals beds reserved for Covid-19, up from about 35% in September.Vivek Kalia, estate officer, HSVP, and nodal authority for hospital bed management, said, “A large number for high occupancy rates of ICU beds is a spillover of patients from Delhi, UP and other states as well. In anticipation of a winter surge, an additional 5% of total beds was reserved for Covid about a month ago.”Of the 670 Covid-19 patients currently admitted to Gurugam hospitals, only 300 are city residents, while 144 are residents of Delhi. Of the latter, 72 are currently undergoing treatment at Medanta in Sector 38. Official data provided by the nodal officer for hospital bed management also shows 44 patients from Uttar Pradesh and another 49 from “other states” are undergoing treatment in city hospitals.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said that spillovers from Delhi and other neighbouring regions had been anticipated. “There is no cause for alarm because so far, we are able to absorb this spillover. Majority of active cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and are able to get by in home isolation. In certain hospitals, availability of beds is an issue, but there are plenty of beds available in other private and government facilities. There are no restrictions on admitting patients coming from elsewhere,” Yadav said.There is a total of 1,975 beds in the city reserved for Covid-19 treatment (up from 1,740 beds in late September), across 42 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and healthcare centres. These include 1,715 general beds with oxygen facility and another 260 ICU beds (which include 122 ventilator beds). While 594 general beds are presently occupied, 160 ICU beds are currently in use (including 45 patients on ventilator support). Officials added that ventilator bed occupancy, in absolute numbers, has remained stable over the last two months.“There are at least 328 ventilators available across the district’s Covid-19 hospitals. We can always allocate more for Covid-19 treatment if need be. The capacity can be created,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), Gurugram, adding that the health department’s goal is to hospitalise less than 10% of the active cases.At present, only 5% of the cases originating in Gurugram are hospitalised. According to a state government order, a maximum of 60% of beds can be reserved in private hospitals. “Any shortfall can be met,” Yadav added.A spokesperson with a major private hospital in the city, who did not wish to be identified, said that a significant majority of patients from Delhi are elderly persons with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and past cardiac events. “They typically opt for one of three major multi-speciality hospitals in Gurugram which offer treatment for Covid-19, but are also equipped to deal with any complications arising from these specific comorbidities. Many happen to be residents of south and west Delhi, since Gurugram is easily accessible from there. Many asymptomatic patients in Delhi are also availing of home isolation care, and telemedicine services from Gururgam hospitals,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/over-60-of-icu-beds-occupied-but-officials-prepared-to-meet-any-spike/story-8Ma9jKvdQgq7mYwMebX3OP.html
08-11-2020||Gurugram||Inflated electricity bills add to woes of Gurugram residents||Residents across the city are complaining of inflated electricity bills this year, with many having received more than double the amount they had paid for the corresponding period last year.Consumers allege that the problem has intensified since the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) started issuing bills based on average consumption, following the installation of smart meters. They alleged that the slow dispute resolution system of the power corporation has left them in the lurch.Naren Kaimal, a resident of The Palms condominium in South City-1, said he has received a bill for Rs 38,000, based on average consumption, for a four-month period from July to October. “The reading was taken after 122 days and the bill has been computed at the rate of the highest slab. What if my consumption was less than 800 units in two months? The method of averaging the bills is wrong and if the utility has installed smart meters, then it should be able to extract data on the last day of every month,” said Kaimal, who has made the payment to avoid action.What has irked consumers like Kaimal, even more, is that the DHBVN’s complaint centre closes the complaint without giving consumers a chance to state their side of the case.Shakti Singh, the president of Housing Board Colony in Sector 57, which is a colony for below poverty line (BPL) category, said that to get a resolution of their complaints, residents have to take a photo of the electric meter, meet the lineman for verification and then meet the junior engineer, who is mostly unavailable. “Once the faulty bills get verified, then we have to wait in a queue for days to get the problem resolved,” said Singh.Residents started living in this colony from November 2019 and the problem of inflated electricity bills has caused problems since then. “A resident got a bill of Rs 94,000 and he has been running pillar to post to get this rectified. Officials never turn up to take the reading and the bills are based on assumption alone,” said Singh.Sachin Yadav, executive engineer, DHBVN said that the issues of wrong billing should not arise as smart meters automatically take the reading. “If the consumers have a problem, then they should submit a representation and we will get the meter tested. If the problems are genuine, then these would be resolved,” he said.When asked about the matter, Haryana power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala said that the issue has come to his notice and it would be resolved on priority. “Necessary directions to resolve these problems will be issued to the officials concerned. The matters pertaining to consumers must be taken very seriously by the utility,” said Chautala.While the residents of a majority of colonies complain of inflated bills, residents of Sector 55 are worried because they are being issued bills on a pro-rata basis, as electricity meter readings are not being taken monthly. “Since December last year, we are getting bills on a pro-rata basis of small amounts, whereas the consumption is higher. The majority of the sector residents are apprehensive that the DHBVN will wake up from its slumber suddenly and issue bills based on average, calculated in the highest slab, amounting to lakhs of rupees. How will we pay such a bill at that time in five days or a week?” said Sidharth Gupta, who stays in Sector 55, and has been paying around Rs 8,000 to Rs 9,000 per month for electricity use.Residents of Sushant Lok, Sector 14, Palam Vihar and several other areas raised similar concerns. HS Nanda, former president, Sector 14 RWA, said that after activation of smart meters two months earlier, half of the sector residents had received inflated bills in September. “I don’t know whether the meters are faulty or calculation is wrong, but charges have doubled compared to last year or a few months earlier. We have raised the matter with authorities concerned,” said Nanda.Residents of Palam Vihar also said that they will be meeting the DHBVN chief engineer to apprise him of their problems. “The power utility should realise that people don’t have unlimited money. Billing should take place on the basis of usage and if electricity meters are smart, then monthly consumption should be charged and not averaged over months,” said Pawan Bhojwani, a resident of Block A.Bhim Singh Yadav, the president of Palam Vihar RWA Block A, said that around 10 homeowners, whom he personally knows, are receiving inflated bills. “We will raise the matter with authorities,” he said.Earlier in July also, HT had reported about complaints raised by residents regarding inflated bills, calculation on average basis and delay in issuance of bills. Residents of Sushant Lok, sectors 46, 47, 56 and 57, and South City-1 had raised similar concerns.Officials of the DHBVN maintained that smart meters are accurate and tested at different labs for accuracy. They also said that the issue of bills being calculated on average could be due to the Covid-19 pandemic disrupting regular meter readings. “The smart meters are accurate and these are tested. We have installed around 1 lakh (100,000) such meters and it is unlikely that there could be any lacunae in reading made by them. Even then if the consumers have specific complaints, they can write to DHBVN and these can be tested in a laboratory,” said Kulvinder Singh, assistant engineer, Smart Grid project, Gurugram.Singh also said that there was a perception among residents that the smart meters clock units at a faster pace. “There is no doubt these meters are sensitive and calculate actual usage,” he said.Vineeta Singh, chief engineer, Smart Grid project, said that the issue of faulty billing was outside their domain. “We are working on installing the Smart Grid system in the city and around 30% has been completed,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/inflated-electricity-bills-add-to-woes-of-gurugram-residents/story-mDJKUTNusyATeQOS5VGYsK.html
08-11-2020||Chandigarh||Zirakpur policemen helped gangsters get fake passports||Two Zirakpur policemen who were arrested in a fake passport racket over the past week reportedly forged travel documents for five gangsters, including Raju, alias, Raju Basodi from Haryana, and more than 40 others with criminal links, investigations have revealed.What was initially thought to be a minor operation is now turning out to be a major criminal scam, say police officials interrogating head constable Sukhwant Singh and constable Rajinder Singh, both posted at Zirakpur and assigned passport verification duties.They were dismissed from service after their arrests through the last week.“The scam appears to be huge as they (the policemen) even made the passports of five gangsters and we have already arrested one in this regard. All 41 passports were made of persons with a criminal background,” said Satinder Singh, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Mohali. False name on passport“We have arrested one dreaded gangster of Haryana, Raju Basodi, whose passport was registered under the false name of Gurveer Singh. One passport was made for Ludhiana gangster Gopi Lamber and another for Ashish Kumar (under the name of Sandeep Singh of Kapurthala), who is facing a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,” said Manjit Singh, deputy superintendent of police (DSP), Mohali, on Sunday.Investigations were continuing to check how payments were made to the passport office and likelihood of passport officials being involved in the racket, the DSP added.Mastermind took Rs 30,000 for a passportAlso nabbed in the racket is Raman Kumar, a resident of Dera Bassi and the mastermind behind the operation. He used to charge Rs 30,000 for forging documents for the passports and pay Rs 15,000 to the policemen in question, investigators said. Using addresses of locked or abandoned flats, he forged documents, including Aadhaar cards, voter cards and other certificates for both Rajinder and Sukhwant.The fact that he used to be a property dealer before switching to passport services with an office in Ambala helped Raman, police officials said. Rajinder was the first to be arrested on November 3 for forging documents to make the passport of one Sarabjeet Singh, against whom several cases were already registered. This was followed by arrests of Sukhwant and Raman.Passports to be cancelledPolice will be writing to the passport office for cancellation of all fake passports and cases registered against people holding the documents.A case has already been registered against the two policemen and Raman Kumar under Sections 420, 421, 466, 467, 468, 471, 167 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, Section 12 of the Passport Act and 7, 8, 13 (2) 88 the Prevention of Corruption Act at the Zirakpur police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/zirakpur-policemen-helped-gangsters-get-fake-passports/story-6FzQc4qFPwlIbcjhBGlxZI.html

08-11-2020||Mumbai||Foreign national in Delhi arrested for duping Mumbai woman of ₹7.61 lakh||Sakinaka police on Friday arrested a Nigerian national from New Delhi for duping a 35-year-old woman from Mumbai to the tune of ₹7.61 lakh. The woman, who works in a private company, was asked to deposit the money to receive gifts worth lakhs which the accused had sent to her but were in Delhi airport customs’ custody in March. The arrested accused identified as Fulgence Kuoadia alias Christopher Wilmer, 33, is a resident of Puchnpur, Delhi. “Wilmer befriended her on Facebook and introduced himself as a businessman from England. He talked to her for two to three months and told her that he would send her gifts,” the police complaint read. Within a few days, the complainant received a call from a person who introduced himself as a customs officer from Delhi airport. He asked her to pay duty charges to get her parcel released. The accused by then convinced the woman to deposit over ₹7.61 lakh to various bank accounts.According to police, when the calls for payment did not stop, the woman realised that she had been cheated and approached Sakinaka police station to file a complaint. Following her complaint, police registered a case under sections 420 (cheating), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 66(C), 66 (D) of the Information Technology (IT) Act. “During the investigation, we came to know that the accused used three different numbers, six SIM cards, seven mobile phones and nine bank accounts so that their trap looked real,” said an officer from Sakinaka police station. “We tracked Kuoadi to Delhi after analysing the mobile numbers used for the scam. We dispatched a team to Delhi and on Friday evening we arrested him,” said the officer. Deputy commissioner of police Maheshwar Reddy supervised the team of senior inspector Kishor Sawant, assistant inspector Liladhar Patil and tracked the accused to Delhi. “We are investigating the case in detail and are looking for his accomplices. We have also asked people to come forward if they have been targeted by such people and to share information on those instances,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/foreign-national-in-delhi-arrested-for-duping-mumbai-woman-of-7-61-lakh/story-QCiq7VOp3Z4OBr1bytyENL.html

However, relief is expected later this week (Tuesday-Wednesday) as temperatures are expected to drop, the weather bureau said.The day temperature on Sunday shot up to 35.8 degrees Celsius, 2.4 degree Celsius above normal, at the Santacruz weather observatory, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai. The Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, recorded the day temperature at 34.2 degrees Celsius, less than a degree Celsius above normal.The minimum temperature in both the suburbs and south Mumbai was a degree Celsius above normal at 23 and 25.4 degrees Celsius respectively.The weather bureau said the sea breeze set in late leading to hotter conditions on Sunday. “The city is witnessing easterly to northeasterly winds which are cooler during early hours of the day. However, due to clear skies allowing more heat intensity combined with the delayed setting in of sea breeze (westerly winds) on Sunday afternoon, a rise in temperature was observed,” said an official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) adding, “The minimum and maximum temperature is expected to drop from Tuesday-Wednesday onwards due to cooler winds from the north.”The weather bureau has predicted a clear sky for Monday with the day and night temperatures expected at 35 and 22 degrees Celsius respectively.The air quality index (AQI) was 190 (moderate) for PM2.5-pollutant on Sunday and is predicted to be 180 (moderate) on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/at-35-8-celsius-sunday-was-hottest-day-of-season-in-mumbai-so-far/story-yJlNzCE4kakVlphRIyIoyI.html
08-11-2020||City||NMMC to seek MCZMA, Maharashtra forest department permissions to clean holding ponds in Navi Mumbai||Navi MumbaiNavi Mumbai municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar inspected the holding ponds in the city on Sunday to explore ways to maintain their cleanliness. Holding ponds are vital for the city as they prevent it from being flooded in the monsoon. The commissioner has asked Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) officials to prepare proposals to the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) and the mangroves cell of the forest department, for requisite permissions with regards to silt removal and mangrove maintenance.Bangar, along with city engineer Surendra Patil, inspected the holding ponds at Sector 12 in CBD Belapur and the Sector 8 in Vashi.While developing the city, City and Industrial Development Corporation (Cidco) had constructed 11 holding ponds node wise, based on Dutch technology. , As the city is located below sea level, during high tide in the Vashi creek, water naturally flows into the holding ponds, preventing waterlogging in the nodes. They also help collect water from the nodes, that is then pumped backed into the creek.The civic body has been unable to take up the cleaning of these ponds due to growth of mangroves in the area. A host of public interest litigations (PILs) have been filed in the Bombay high court (HC) on the issue. HC has ordered a freeze on the destruction of mangroves in the state. Recently, HC has issued a notice to NMMC on the cleaning of the ponds, following a PIL filed by former corporator Dr Jayaji Nath. “NMMC needs to take serious and quick action in the matter. The situation is getting dangerous in the city. It can no longer shed its responsibility citing court orders,” said Nath.Lack of cleaning of the ponds over the years has led to accumulation of silt, reducing their water-holding capacity. During heavy rains coupled with high tide, there have been instances of some areas of the city getting flooded, with holding ponds overflowing.“I studied the issue in detail and have asked my officials to immediately prepare a proposal to remove the silt from the holding ponds to increase their water-holding capacity,” said Bangar.“I have also asked for a proposal to be prepared seeking solutions to the mangrove growth in the ponds from the MCZMA and the mangroves cell of the forest department,” the civic chief added.“During high tide, when it rains, additional water is pumped into the holding ponds. The pump house structures in CBD Belapur and Vashi are over 30 years old. I have asked for a tender process to be initiated for new state-of-the-art pump houses at both locations,” Bangar said.The NMMC chief has also asked for a proposal to be prepared for an express feeder so that no power failure issues are faced during pumping of additional water in monsoon. “Strict instructions have also been given to ensure that there is no encroachment at the pump house area,” he added.Social worker Nitin Kandhari said that the ponds are in desperate need of maintenance. “There has been no cleaning undertaken of the ponds, which receives silt and other waste from the creek, despite years having passed since they were handed over to NMMC by Cidco. This has resulted in natural growth of mangroves in the ponds,” he said. “However, since the issue of cleaning the mangroves is sub-judice in the HC, the matter has been stuck for years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nmmc-to-seek-mczma-maharashtra-forest-department-permissions-to-clean-holding-ponds-in-navi-mumbai/story-cIKKV72Zmzwft5bvNia9qJ.html

The revelations come five days after the accused were arrested by the Vigilance Bureau (VB) on November 2 for illegally taking over shamlat land (belonging to the panchayat) at the village.VB had arrested Varinderpal Singh Dhoot, the then naib tehsildar of the Majri block, and other revenue officials, including kanungo Raghbir Singh, patwari Iqbal Singh and nambardar Gurnam Singh for fraudulently changing the ownership titles.The case dates back to 2017, when Dhoot was posted as the naib tehsildar in Majri. He allegedly in connivance with subordinate revenue officials and private individuals fraudulently sold off the 100 acres, leading to losses in crores to the government exchequer.People renamed as the owners were not even residents of the village, a senior VB official said, adding that they have not been traced as yet.Investigations were continuing on how the money from sale of land had been spent and resultant losses to the exchequer. “We are also looking into details of the properties and other financial transactions of the accused,” the official said. On Sunday, three deputy superintendents of police visited Seonk and recorded the statements of the original land owners as in some cases money was taken from them for the land, but possession not delivered.Probe also revealed that while the ownership of 1,295 acres of shamlat land was being fraudulently transferred, boundaries of approximately 100 acres were altered, depriving 24 beneficiaries of their shares, officials said.According to the FIR, the accused persons took undisclosed sums from people to get their names registered in the land records. In a statement to the VB, the block development and panchayat officer stated that according to the land records, the land in question from 1946 till 2000 was in the shamlat and not agricultural category and had no ownership.At present all the accused are in police custody and will be produced in the court on November 10. An FIR under Sections 409, 420, 465, 467, 471 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/naib-tehsildar-others-illegally-changed-ownership-of-100-acres-at-mohali-village/story-g0LdcOiGL8XCRDTbZyY0GJ.html
08-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn refuses to budge, firecracker ban to stay||Notwithstanding appeals by traders, the UT administration is unlikely to give a three-hour relaxation for sale and bursting of firecrackers on Diwali.“I am not in favour of the three-hour relaxation being demanded. The lives and health of senior citizens and patients are far more important than revelry of children,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida.The administration on November 6 had enforced an immediate ban on the sale and use of firecrackers under the Disaster Management Act until further notice. This had prompted traders’ associations to seek a three-hour relaxation on Diwali. They have also planned to approach the Punjab and Haryana high court.The Chandigarh Beopar Mandal on Sunday wrote a letter in this regard to UT administrator VP Singh Badnore.“The ban, enforced just a week before Diwali, will severely hit the traders, who have already purchased the stock. Worse, it came after the draw of lots to issue 96 permits for the sale of firecrackers in 14 locations,” said Charanjiv Singh, chairman, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, adding that if at all, the administration should have taken a call to this effect at least a month before Diwali. “Authorities should review this decision and give a three-hour exemption, else it will ruin small traders and also dampen the festive spirit,” Singh said.Backing the traders, Aam Aadmi Party’s Chandigarh convener Prem Garg said, “Punjab has not banned the sale and use of firecrackers and Haryana has also given a two-hour relaxation. The Chandigarh administration should follow suit and allow firecrackers between 8pm and 10pm on Diwali. Let the show go on and allow the public to burn firecrackers only in a symbolic way to avoid pollution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-refuses-to-budge-firecracker-ban-to-stay/story-mNbohEbA47Rg3ccPXaFQZN.html

It is a clear indication that the Centre is trying to pressurise farmers and the state government through the railways.” Jindal said thousands of containers are stranded at ports, goods have been dumped in warehouses and more than 80% exports have been cancelled. Similarly, three-lakh tonnes of scrap being exported into Punjab is also lying at ports.“Ludhiana is known for its hosiery industry. But, due to trains not plying and the anti-farmer and anti-industry policies of the Union government, most export orders have been cancelled. Due to coal crisis, power cuts have started affecting the functioning of industries. If the situation does not change soon, thousands of factories will be forced to shut down and millions will lose their jobs,” he added.“On the call of the industries and state government, farmers have given a clear and written statement that freight trains will not be stopped in the state. The Punjab government has also given written assurance of safety to the railway ministry. All Lok Sabha members from Punjab have also complained to the department and ministry concerned,” he added. The farm bills is a matter between farmers, the state and central government and industries have no relation with this subject, stressed Jindal.CICU demands bus serviceOn the other hand, president of the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking (CICU), Upkar Singh Ahuja, suggested that the government should start a bus service for ferrying migrant labourers from their hometowns to industrial areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/industrialists-in-ludhiana-seek-resumption-of-freight-services/story-sAu0VqGYUDmX4sCgij9o1M.html

Requesting anonymity, a principal said, “We have a strength of 60 students in Class 12 and they are yet to receive the smartphones. As they are unable to attend online classes, they have to ask their classmates and friends about the topics covered in classes.”Government school teachers conducting online classes have said that over 20% of students are not attending classes regularly and facing difficulty as they do not have smartphones. Insufficient data package is another hurdle for them.Harpreet Kaur, a Class 12 student said, “I do not have a personal mobile phone.

08-11-2020||Chandigarh||Disease prevention in livestock is key: Ludhiana vet varsity experts||Veterinary experts from Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) have expressed concern over the lax attitude of livestock farmers on newly-born calves suffering from diseases.Parkash Singh Brar, director of extension education, GADVASU, said that calving season is on and most farmers don’t take proper care of newly-born calves, especially transitional animals. Therefore, two webinars on these topics were conducted for the benefit of dairy farmers this week. Vishal Mahajan, veterinary pathologist from Animal Disease Research Centre, spoke on important infectious diseases and vaccination schedule. Diseases like Hemorrhagic Septicemia (HS) can be fatal and affect both buffalo and cows, he said. He also highlighted the differences between the symptoms of HS and nitrate poisoning. Foot-and Mouth disease (FMD) is also a highly contagious virus disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, Mahajan added.Other diseases like Johne’s disease and Brucellosis were also discussed. He emphasised on the need for biosecurity at farm sand timely vaccination. Animals should be healthy at the time of vaccination and there should atleast be a 21-day gap between two vaccinations, Mahajan said. He also cautioned farmers regarding hygiene protocols, particularly about used syringes. RS Grewal, senior nutritionist, Department of Animal Nutrition, discussed the importance of transitional period of animals, which is around three weeks before and after the calving, and nutrient requirements associated with it.He told farmers that the requirement of energy, protein, fat and calcium increases four,two,five and four times respectively during this critical period. Animals produce more milk, but due to lack of nutrients, they lose weight which is detrimental in its conception in the following lactations, he said. He discussed modified feeding strategies by incorporating calcium propionate propylene glycol in the ration.Grewal also emphasised on the importance of certain feed supplements, particularly niacin, biotin and choline chloride which increase the metabolism of the animal and help maintain production and health of the newly lactating animal.  Parkash Singh Brar, director of extension education, said: “An effective and efficient disease prevention and control strategy is of paramount importance to improve the quality and quantity of livestock production. Although livestock vaccination is considered an emerging innovation of socio-economic importance in dairy industry; the rate of adoption and diffusion of vaccination technology is very low at field levels.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/disease-prevention-in-livestock-is-key-ludhiana-vet-varsity-experts/story-yx7tMYczMLL95c9tcLalWN.html

BJP MP from Bankura Dr Subhas Sarkar visited Bibhishan Hansda’s household at Chaturdihi village earlier in the day, along with some of his party men, and said he would bear all treatment expenses of his teenaged daughter, who is suffering from a rare diabetic disorder.Sarkar also said the girl might be flown to AIIMS in Delhi, if need be.“She is suffering from diabetes insipidus, which starts early in life and needs continuous treatment. I will do everything possible to help her, as suggested by our home minister,” he stated.Read also: Day after Amit Shah’s visit to Bengal, TMC, BJP taunt each otherLocal TMC leaders had met Hansda on Saturday and promised all facilities to the class 12 girl, two days after Shah’s much-hyped visit to the household.“Amit Shah came, had lunch but did not offer any financial package or help to the family. The BJP will always provide lip service to the poor tribals,” Shyamal Santra, Bankura TMC chief, had said.He also advised the girl to take up a course in nursing later in life.Bankura, dominated by tribal and backward communities, is one of the several districts, where the BJP made deep inroads in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.It bagged both the parliamentary seats in Bankura.A district CPI(M) leader said the BJP and the TMC seem to have suddenly woken up to the plight of the family, with an eye on the tribal vote bank, ahead of 2021 assembly polls.The CPI(M) leader also said that he “would be happy if any of those promises are actually fulfilled”.BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu had said on Saturday that the ruling party would reach out to more such families, only if Shah visits them.“It seems more such visits by the home minister is required to tribal, backward and poor households. The local Trinamool leadership stands exposed before the tribals in the Jangalmahal area, who have identified the BJP as their true friend,” he said.The TMC leaders, however, levelled counter allegations, claiming that the BJP is “indulging in cheap vote bank politics” by arranging such visits.Jangalmahal area, once a Maoist stronghold, comprises parts of Jhargram, Paschim Medinipur, Bankura and Purulia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bjp-tmc-extend-helping-hand-to-tribal-family-after-amit-shah-visit/story-oWgsQ9ekp6vFpZkKCAPl3M.html

The former chief minister said all the schemes like MNREGS, Matikala along with others which the government was claiming to be creating job opportunities were in “deep trouble”. He claimed those associated with these schemes were facing problems in meeting their daily needs.“The government’s own vocational career service portal shows there has been a fall of 60 per cent in jobs in October 2020 as compared to September,” Akhilesh said. He alleged that during the rule of the BJP government in the state new jobs have not been created, and the existing factories closed down and employees were retrenched during the lockdown.“People are running around for jobs. The crowds of labourers seen every day in the mornings seeking jobs expose the reality of government claims,” he said, further claiming that the BJP government was harming the interests of all sections of society.The BJP will have to pay for the allegedly rising unemployment in the 2022 assembly elections, Akhilesh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-govt-misleading-people-on-unemployment-numbers-akhilesh/story-W9Snvzqj0daJGXRI0UyPnI.html

The state’s death toll is at 45,155 so far.Following recent announcements by some states in the country to ban firecrackers ahead and on the festival of Diwali, Thackeray said that while no such contingency has been imposed in Maharashtra, people must not burst them in public places and practice restraint. “We can ban firecrackers but we can avoid bursting firecrackers through self-discipline,” he said while speaking to reporters. “Whatever we have achieved (in controlling Covid-19) will go away in four days due to pollution through crackers,” he added and also pointed out that Covid-19 cases have gone up in the national capital of Delhi due to pollution.Thackeray also urged the people of Mumbai to remain vigilant. He stressed that the 15 days that follow Diwali are most crucial in the state’s efforts against the coronavirus pandemic.Plans and guidelines to reopen temples and places of worship would be drafted after Diwali, Thackeray also said. In his response to criticisms over not reopening temples, he said that the people criticising him will not share responsibilities “if something happens.” He also added that it is his responsibility to tread cautiously regarding the issue. “I’m criticised for not stepping out of the house. But I’m at home and bringing investments to bring Maharashtra back on progress path,” he added.Talks to resume local train services are currently in progress, the chief minister said. He also acknowledged that railways minister Piyush Goyal has been cooperating with him regarding the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/uddhav-thackeray-lauds-people-after-dip-in-covid-19-cases-stresses-on-vigilant-festival-celebrations/story-yvTjI6l5LqsS54MBBl09TO.html
08-11-2020||City||2015 sacrilege cases: Centre wrote to state on transfer of probe to it in June 2019, Punjab tells HC||Chandigarh The Punjab government has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that in June 2019, the Centre had communicated to it about transferring the probe into 2015 sacrilege cases to the state police from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). “.. as a matter of fact, a communication was addressed by the under secretary to the government of India, department of personnel and training, ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions, on 28.06.2019, to chief secretary, government of Punjab, informing him that the matter was being taken up by the said ministry with the CBI itself, to transfer all evidence gathered by it to the Punjab Police, upon transfer of investigation to it (Punjab Police),” Punjab’s counsel, Harin P Rawal, told the bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh. He added this communication was marked to the CBI director as well. CBI counsel, on the other hand feigned ignorance about the communication and told court that he would check and apprise court on the adjourned date. The submissions were made during resumed hearing of pleas from Sukhjinder Singh, and Shakti Singh, two Dera Sacha Sauda followers, who had questioned how two agencies are probing the same FIRs in parallel. Two persons were killed in the violence reported after incidents of sacrilege in 2015. Three FIRs on incidents of sacrilege were recommended for a CBI probe in 2015, by then SAD government. Of these, the Captain Amarinder Singh government passed a resolution to withdraw two FIRs in August 2018. In the same resolution, it also withdrew two more FIRs related to violence, entrusted to the CBI, barely four days after the move. However, the CBI filed a closure report in July 2019 before a CBI court in Mohali; in December 2019, it reopened the probe in these FIRs, by then Punjab Police had started its probe. The parallel probes are underway by CBI and Punjab police into these FIRs as the CBI maintains that with there being no de-notification issued by the Centre, these FIRs are still to be probed by it. The court observed that in its opinion, as the Supreme Court has dismissed the CBI’s plea challenging high court order by which it had refused to interfere with the Punjab government decision to take back all sacrilege cases from the CBI, the high court ought to proceed further. However, the CBI told the court that a review petition has been filed by the agency against the January 25 order of the apex court; this plea is yet to be taken up. The court also observed that the counsel for the parties would address, also, as to how investigations by two agencies in the same FIR, can continue simultaneously, when case is taken up on November 19. Rawal also told the court that Sukhjinder had filed a transfer petition in apex court seeking transfer of the trial itself outside Punjab, and response from the state has been issued. However, the bench observed that since there is no ‘stay order’ it would continue with hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2015-sacrilege-cases-centre-wrote-to-state-on-transfer-of-probe-to-it-in-june-2019-punjab-tells-hc/story-4WXW9kxKLUPzs2QD8Ypl0K.html

Police got information about the movement of those involved in illegal mining of sand coming from Rajasthan and a police team subsequently began checking Kheragarh and Saiyyan road but could not find any of them,” said Rohan Pramod Botre, SP (city), Agra, who is officiating as SSP Agra since the incumbent is down with Covid-19.  ”The police, while returning from the search, found half-a-dozen tractors laden with mined sand. Constable Sonu Chaudhary got off the police vehicle and waved to one of the tractor drivers to stop.

The number of cases suggests it is the worst wave so far. But the cases will come down soon,” Jain said.The minister attributed the increase in the number of cases to aggressive testing and contact-tracing.He, however, said laxity on the part of the people has been a major reason behind the spike in new cases.“Some people think nothing will happen to them if they don’t wear a mask. They are wrong. Mask is the only medicine for Covid-19 till a vaccine is developed,” Jain added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/worst-wave-of-covid-19-so-far-delhi-health-minister-satyendar-jain/story-SxRCXmq78XrXGVKnIC8b1J.html
08-11-2020||Delhi||In Delhi, air still in severe category for 4th straight day||The air quality index (AQI) in the national capital on Sunday morning remained in the severe category for the fourth consecutive day, despite a marginal improvement.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that the AQI was 405 at 7 am on Sunday. An AQI between 401 and 500 is considered to be severe, which causes distress and respiratory complications, especially for children and senior citizens. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Delhi’s average 24-hour AQI stood at 450, 406 and 427, respectively. Scientists have predicted that the relief from bad air is unlikely till Tuesday (November 10). Over 4,500 farm fires that are raging in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab contributed to around 32% of ultrafine particulate matter (PM 2.5), which could not be dispersed, in Delhi’s air despite slightly better wind speed on Saturday, as compared to Friday. VK Soni, the head of India Meteorological Department (IMD) environment monitoring research centre, said that during the day the average wind speed was around 12 kilometres per hour (kmph), which was higher than that on Friday. However, its impact was not seen on the AQI because of an increase in stubble burning cases in Haryana and Punjab. He said that the north-westerly winds are bringing a heavy load of pollutants from these farm fires to the national capital. “For the last three days we have been observing that the number of farm fires spotted over Punjab alone is over 4,000. Usually, these fires go up on Sundays at this time of the year. Though the wind speed picked up during the day, the improvement in air quality was not all that significant only because of an uptick in farm fire cases,” Soni said. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that in parts of central Delhi the wind speed fluctuated between six and eight kmph on Saturday, but the corresponding figure was up to 16 kmph in outer parts of the national capital. “The wind is blowing from the north-western direction, which is bringing a large share of smoke from Haryana and Punjab,” he said.Srivastava said that there is a forecast of the wind direction changing to easterlies from Tuesday, but before that it will reduce drastically, possibly pushing the city’s air quality further into the “severe” zone. “During the transitional stage of a change in wind direction, the speed reduces drastically. The wind may become calm from Sunday evening. This will only lead to a further worsening of air quality,” he warned. IMD had predicted a foggy Sunday morning in the national capital. The maximum and minimum temperature is expected to be around 30 degrees and 11 degrees Celsius (C), respectively. On Saturday, Delhi’s minimum temperature, recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, was 11.8 degrees C – two degrees below normal. The maximum temperature was 30 degrees C – one degree above normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-delhi-air-still-in-severe-category-for-4th-straight-day/story-aJdV04OSsdAMj9kEFlesoI.html

Firefighters reached the spot and rescued trapped residents from the top floor of the building.Atul Garg, director of Delhi Fire Services, said that at least seven residents were stranded on the top floor of the building as smoke rose from the basement and engulfed the entire structure.It wasn’t immediately clear how many residents were there in the building even as Garg said that a few on the lower floors had already managed to escape by the time the firefighters reached.“Since there was just one staircase in the building, the other residents had no escape route,” said Garg.The firefighters had to reach the trapped residents by using hydraulic lifts and by scaling the adjacent building.The call about the blaze was received around 11.15 pm on Saturday from a residential house located near the ICICI Bank branch in the neighbourhood.“We had to use seven fire tenders to contain the situation,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-fire-in-residential-building-in-gk-7-trapped-on-top-floor-rescued/story-AmGzQpD1IiCgBYgEM7kquJ.html

The NGO named Humans for Humanity, led by a 26-year-old social worker from Dehradun, Anurag Chauhan has associated with a school and is in talks with other schools in Dehradun to provide online lessons through puppetry The lessons of the syllabus would be narrated by the traditional puppeteers through puppetry and videos of which would then be used by the school for its students. Chauhan who has been providing help to the needy people during the lockdown, said he decided to revive the art of puppetry while helping puppeteers in Delhi’s Anand Parvat area where they have been living in a ‘sorry condition.’“During the lockdown, I used to visit their area where they are staying after being displaced from their Kathputli Colony a few years ago. While helping them with ration and food, I witnessed the condemnable state in which they were living. It was then I thought to help them,” said Chauhan.Chauhan said that as the art of puppetry is on the verge of dying, the puppeteers were already finding it very difficult to earn a livelihood, and ‘then the lockdown made it worse.’“I then decided to find a solution which would not only revive the art but also provide them a livelihood. Hence the idea of associating with the schools came to my mind,” he said.Chauhan said he had initially spoken to a school in Dehradun and roped in three-four puppeteer families. “Under the project, we spoke to a Dehradun based school-- Summer Valley School and asked them to give us the PDF files of the stories in Hindi subject. We then narrated the stories to the puppeteers we are working with, who adapted them into their puppetry art. Our members recorded the puppetry in Delhi and then sent the videos to the school in Dehradun,” said Chauhan.He said the school would show the videos to their students in online classes. “The school welcomed the idea very much as it’s an innovative and interesting way of teaching the students. Also the management thought that it would also help the dying art to revive,” said Chauhan.He said, “Initially, we have reached only one school, but will associate with other schools of Dehradun in the coming days.”The puppeteers are also happy with the project as they feel that it would help saving the dying art and provide them a livelihood. Bhagwan Das, a 70-year-old puppeteer living in Anand Parvat who claims to have performed in many countries, said, “We are very grateful that Chauhan has spared a thought for us and is doing something to revive this art.”“I have performed in about 60 countries around the world. Despite that, today my family and I are living in a place like refugees. Amid that, when Chauhan came to us with his project, we are very thankful to him to think about our livelihood,” said Das. He said that he hopes that the project will “save the 500-year-old art form from dying”.His wife, Sharbati Das, who too is a puppeteer and helps him in his performances said, “I came to the puppeteers colony in Kathputli at the age of five. Since then I have been associated with this art.”“Today it really hurts when we see that not only the puppeteers are being neglected but our art too which is a part of the Indian culture. I sincerely hope, Chauhan’s effort won’t go in vain and would revive this art,” said Sharbati.Abhaya Wasu, director of Summer Valley School in Dehradun, which is the first school to associate in the project, said, “When Chauhan came to us with the project about 15 days ago, we found it very interesting and agreed to work with the puppeteers.”Wasu said, “So far we have provided stories from Hindi subject of classes 1-8 to Chauhan and his team for puppetry narration. We will soon include the stories in English subject also.”She said that the school will also gradually provide the stories from English subject of senior classes. “We are also planning to invite the puppeteers to school once it opens for the students. We are grateful to be associated in this project as it is helping the art to be revived and also providing a livelihood to the puppeteers who are a significant part of Indian culture,” said Wasu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/ngo-ties-up-with-school-in-dehradun-to-revive-traditional-puppetry-with-innovative-teaching/story-Sljf4rDkT1soXdN3MnGwtJ.html

08-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai engineer who operated drug racket amid ‘financial stress due to lockdown’ held with imported marijuana worth ₹1.62 crore||The anti-narcotic cell (ANC) of Mumbai Police’s crime branch has busted a major drug racket and arrested its alleged mastermind – a 25-year-old software engineer from Bandra – on Thursday evening. The accused – identified as Yash G Kalani – allegedly told the police that he operated the racket owing to “financial stress during lockdown”. Based on a tip-off, Kalani was arrested near National Library Road in Bandra (West) by Bandra ANC unit head inspector Anil Wadhawane and his team on Thursday evening with 1kg of imported high-quality marijuana. His aide, 32-year-old Guru Jaiswal, who works as an autorickshaw driver, was also arrested with the same amount of drug. Based on Kalani’s interrogation, the team visited his rented house in Bandra and seized around 7kg of marijuana. “We have seized a total of 9kg of high-quality weed worth ₹1.62 crore from the two accused,” said deputy commissioner of police (ANC) Datta Nalawade. According to ANC, the contraband was smuggled to India from the United States (US) for supply across the country. ANC said Kalani has an engineering degree from an institute in Sydney, Australia, and was running a software systems’ firm. Before the lockdown, he used to order marijuana for consumption from a supplier in the US through dark web and get the drug shipped to Mumbai, said the police. He would make the payment to the supplier through e-wallet, said Wadhawane. During the lockdown, he was reeling under financial stress and in August decided to supply the drugs to earn money for which he took the help of the supplier from US, Wadhawane added. “He would order a sizeable amount of drugs from the supplier in the US. Once the shipment reached Mumbai, he would supply them to his clients in the city through auto drivers such as Jaiswal and pay them a commission. He would also send the drugs to New Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Pune through mail and courier,” said Wadhwane. In India, the drug is sold between ₹1,500 and ₹3,500 per gram. “Kalani was earning a profit worth around ₹1 lakh each day,” said Wadhavane. He was storing the contraband in a rented bungalow in Bandra. According to Nalawade, Kalani would communicate to his clients through Wickr App. “The anonymity-providing app not only has end-to-end encryption, but it also has self-data deleting feature in which the user can set a fixed time after which the chats, photos and videos get deleted automatically, leaving no trace of evidence,” said Nalawade. Kalani’s contacts and phone call details are being scanned to trace the links of his other associates, the police said. Kalani and Jaiswal have been booked under the relevant sections of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. A local court has remanded them in police custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-engineer-who-operated-drug-racket-amid-financial-stress-due-to-lockdown-held-with-imported-marijuana-worth-1-62-crore/story-cOOsTIvLPyX5ITBD88r7ZP.html

08-11-2020||City||Reopen schools only after proper planning: Parents, teachers in Maharashtra tell government||As the state government has given its final nod to reopen schools after the Diwali break, schools and parents are now concerned about the safety of students and teachers.Parents said that while schools need to be reopened, the process needs to be well-planned.“Ensuring social distancing is a big challenge, especially in schools which have a large number of students. Also, when students use the washroom, adequate precautions need to be taken to sanitise the facility well,” said Arundhati Chavan, president of the PTA United Forum.Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the Mumbai Principals’ Association, said that the government can ensure phased reopening of schools across the state. “Schools in districts with no or very few Covid-19 cases can start reopening first and other schools at other places can follow. Similarly, enough provisions need to be made to ensure sanitisation of schools and preparing them well in advance,” he added.Parents of several private schools are sceptical of sending their children to school until a vaccine is found. “We cannot risk their lives by sending them to school as the pandemic is not over yet. Students can continue learning online for the current academic year,” said Anu Sinha, a parent from Thane.In June, the education department submitted standard operating procedures (SOPs) on online learning, which also consisted of plans on physical reopening of schools.

He also accused the previous government of falsehood. “The then government had falsely claimed that the Kanjurmarg plot would have cost the state ₹5,000 crore. The private litigant [who petitioned the court against the project at Aarey] had himself claimed that no cost will incur for the land [at Kanjurmarg],” said Sawant.Rubbishing the claims, the BJP called the allegations a “diversionary tactic”. “The decision will only increase the costs as well as delay the whole project. From the past 10 months, the Metro project is stuck owing to the inefficiency of the MVA government and they are creating roadblocks. It is the citizens who will be affected by this move,” said BJP legislator Ram Kadam.Since November 2014, the project at Aarey had created uproar after a proposal to build a car shed for the Colaba-Bandra-Seepz Metro line was proposed by the government. The state’s decision to axe 2,298 trees for the project had witnessed widespread protests. After coming to power, the MVA government last year decided that no trees would be felled any further for the project and later decided to shift the car shed to Kanjurmarg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-metro-3-car-shed-aarey-was-chosen-to-commercially-exploit-forest-land-says-congress/story-KbnDDIWEqyVbKSMI80p3ZP.html

Senior advocate Devdatta Kamat made the statement on behalf of the crime branch, which is probing the TRP scam. The statement came after senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, who represented the company, pointed out that despite being complainants, right from October 6, several officials of the firm were being summoned to the crime branch almost every day and made to wait for eight to nine hours. Hansa Group, engaged by Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), for operating and monitoring meters installed in about 16,031 households across India to help assess TRP, has moved HC, seeking transfer of the case to some independent agency, such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). In its petition, Hansa Group has alleged that many of its officers, including complainant Nitin Deokar, deputy general manager, Hansa Research Group, were harassed and pressured by the crime branch for securing a false statement that the Hansa report shown on a TV news channel was fake. It added that although channel showed the document as “Hansa Report”, the company was not in a position either to confirm or deny the same, as none of its officers had seen the document. It has sought a direction to transfer the case for probe to CBI, claiming that no fair play is being reflected from the conduct of crime branch officers. Kamat responded by stating that the crime branch has got material against the company and he will substantiate it when the matter is taken up for further hearing. On October 6, Kandivli police registered an offence against one of the firm’s ex-employees on the basis of a complaint lodged by Deokar after BARC noticed a sudden spike in viewership of certain channels over a period of time till June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trp-case-will-not-summon-hansa-employees-more-than-twice-a-week-mumbai-police-crime-branch-tells-bombay-high-court/story-qrrb2wMOiNlKJqSIRUdbGO.html
08-11-2020||City||At 19.7 degrees Celsius, suburban Mumbai records season’s coolest day||The minimum temperature on Saturday dropped below the 20 degree Celsius-mark. The Santacruz weather observatory – representative of the suburbs and Mumbai – recorded the minimum temperature at 19.7 degrees Celsius, which is the lowest for this season. However, there was a wide gap between the minimum temperature in the suburbs and in south Mumbai. The Colaba weather station – representative of south Mumbai – recorded 24 degrees Celsius, which was at the normal mark. The weather bureau said that the minimum temperature was expected to hover in the range of 19 and 21 degrees Celsius over the next week owing to the current wind pattern. “For the first time this season, Mumbai has recorded the minimum temperature below 20 degrees Celsius. The cool winds from easterly and north-easterly directions are leading to this change. This is also reducing the moisture in the city’s air, typical of the weather pattern during this time of the year,” said KS Hosalikar, deputy director general (western region), India Meteorological Department. Kandivli was the coolest at 18.9 degrees Celsius, followed by Malad at 19.6 degrees Celsius, while Panvel was the coolest in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region at 14.8 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD’s automatic weather stations. The maximum temperature, however, surged to 35.4 degrees Celsius, almost 2 degrees Celsius above normal, in the suburbs. This is the highest maximum temperature recorded in Mumbai suburbs for this season so far. South Mumbai recorded 34.2 degrees Celsius, a degree Celsius above normal. This means that the gap between the maximum and minimum temperature widened on Saturday to 15.7 degrees Celsius. HT had reported earlier this week that if temperature variability was high it could lead to health ailments such as the seasonal flu, lead to a spike in swine flu cases, and could also create confusion among doctors and patients as the seasonal flu had similar symptoms as Covid-19. Meanwhile, owing to a rise in the wind speed over the past 48 hours, the air quality index (AQI) has remained in the moderate category, as per the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The AQI, which was at 221 (poor) earlier in the week, was at 149 (moderate) on Saturday. Pollution levels are likely to decline further as an AQI of 132 (moderate) has been predicted for Sunday. SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-19-7-degrees-celsius-suburban-mumbai-records-season-s-coolest-day/story-U6EhsH7WkWUYZhu2IoFO4K.html
08-11-2020||Delhi||Diwali 2020: Sarojini Nagar potters wait for shoppers to go #VocalForLocal||Come Diwali and the potters’ lane near the popular south Delhi Sarojini Nagar market, turns into a riot of colours and clay. But, the pandemic has dulled most of these colours as brightly painted diyas (earthen lamps), clay idols, and lanterns adorn the makeshift shops on the road side, in the long wait of buyers. Amid Covid-19, ahead of Diwali, the potters are clinging to the hope that the call for #VocalForLocal will bring them some festive cheer, and selling their wares at much lower prices. The bylane, popularly referred to as the Matka Market of Sarojini, has about 16-17 makeshift shops that sell a range of earthenware all round the year. From pots to vases and diyas to idols, one can find a huge variety. “Pehle ke mukable 50% sale reh gayi hai sirf. Ab toh bas jo banaya hai, woh stock bik jaaye, wohi bohot hai,” says Rekha, who has been manning the 50-year-old shop at this place. She has six boys employed with her, and says that they are looking at their biggest loss in the longest time. She adds, “Lagta hai 1.5-2 lakh ka nuksaan hoga is saal!” For Ram Krishna, a potter who makes and paints diyas in this market, says though he has been in the trade for over 40 years, this might be one of his worst Diwali. “We are making diyas and pots for the entire Diwali season, but pehle jaise log din raat yahan aate the, is saal 10% bhi nahi aa rahe hain,” he says, as he goes back to dip the diyas in bright red hues. The lane certainly bears a barren look barring a few people who have been halting their cars in front of the shops and haggle for a dozen diyas or a clay idol. Lack of sales has left the potters with no choice but to reduce the prices, to make ends meet. “Since manufacturing near the market is banned, we bring these earthenware from Lucknow, Kolkata, Gorakhpur, and Rajasthan. We spend weeks decorating these pots and diyas and sell them during Diwali. But this year, we seem to be staring at a dull festival since people are not coming to us to purchase handmade diyas, but ordering online instead,” explains Roopvati, whose family has been running a shop in the market for three generations. Her husband, Rajkumar, adds, “Hum wholesale price se bhi kum pe bech rahe hain is waqt. We open the shop at 4am hoping people will come early in the morning to ditch the market rush in evening hours, and stay open till late, but still hardly make any sales.”Rohan, a third generation potter, opines that the pandemic has encouraged people to buy earthenware online, or from their local markets rather than coming here. But, with the PM’s clarion call of #VocalForLocal, he hopes the situation might improve as Diwali nears. He says, “Usually by this time, people who sell just festive wares come in and display their products in this lane, including rangoli sellers, but even they haven’t come here yet due to the pandemic. But we are trying to not lose hope. If the footfall increases in the coming days, we all can look forward to having a Diwali, else it will be like any other day.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/diwali-2020-sarojini-nagar-potters-wait-for-shoppers-to-go-vocalforlocal/story-dapsCqZBnZjQMbTZWilxOK.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||Arnab Goswami arrest: Revision application hearing in Alibag sessions court adjourned till Monday||The Alibag sessions court on Saturday adjourned the hearing into the revision application filed by Alibag police seeking custodial interrogation of Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and two others to November 9. Goswami, Feroz Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda, who have been remanded to judicial custody till November 18 by the magistrate court, were arrested on Wednesday in connection with the 2018 suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother. The prosecution has challenged the magistrate court’s order and filed a revision application asking for police custody of Goswami, Shaikh and Sarda for further investigating the case. Special public prosecutor Pradeep Gharat, in the sessions court on Saturday, read out contents of the suicide note written by Naik and said “the deceased had clearly mentioned names of all three accused in the note”. “Nitesh Sarda did not pay Rs55 lakh, Goswami Rs83 lakh and Shaikh had not paid Rs4 crore. Kindly collect money from them and hold them responsible for my death,” Gharat read out from the suicide note, adding that it was verified by handwriting experts that the note had been written by Naik. “The investigating officer has full rights to arrest the accused without warrant and for further investigation in the case. Judicial custody given by the magistrate court is illegal and inappropriate. The summary report filed by the previous investigating officer Suresh Warade was illegal which has been accepted by the court,” said Gharat in court. “Police should get custody of the accused. If the court wants information then custody should be granted. There are 18 reasons pointed out which need to be investigated… Apart from that some articles and electronic devices also need to be recovered from the accused for investigation.” However, Goswami’s lawyer Gaurav Parkar sought adjournment for arguments, saying he wasn’t allowed to meet his client. “I had made an application to the jail superintendent to visit Goswami to take his signature on vakalatnama and his instructions in today’s matter. But the jail superintendent did not allow me to meet him. In view of this, I filed an application seeking adjournment on the ground of lack of instructions,” said Parkar. “The same issue is also being heard before the division bench of the high court. The court was kind enough to allow adjournment till November 9.” SD Patil, defence lawyer of Sarda, too, said, “We have filed an application to adjourn the matter and it has been granted by the court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/arnab-goswami-arrest-revision-application-hearing-in-alibag-sessions-court-adjourned-till-monday/story-oMqUB5PYat9KuUJ2I0AN5K.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||Bombay high court reserves order on interim bail plea of Arnab Goswami, two others||The Bombay high Court on Saturday reserved its order on the interim bail plea of Republic TV’s editor Arnab Goswami, who was arrested by Alibag police in connection with a 2018 abetment to suicide case. The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik said it would try to pronounce the order as early as possible. Goswami has been in judicial custody since Wednesday. The bench also allowed Goswami and two others arrested in the case, Firoz Shaikh and Nitish Sarda, to approach the sessions Court at Alibag for regular bail and asked that the court deal with this within four days. All three are in judicial custody till November 18. On Wednesday, the Republic TV editor moved high court questioning his arrest and sought immediate relief. His legal team argued that his arrest and detention were illegal, as the case, closed in April 2019 by filing an A-summary report, was being re-investigated without a necessary court order. They also argued that the police officer could not have reopened the case without first obtaining necessary order from the judicial magistrate concerned. Sheikh and Sarda, too, moved HC challenging their arrests. The Maharashtra government on Saturday responded to the pleas, submitting that unlike B and C-summary reports, A-summary reports aren’t closure reports, and therefore, no permission from the magistrate is required to undertake further investigation in the case.Senior advocate Amit Desai, who represented the government, said A-summary indicates that the allegations made in the complaint are true, but no one can be prosecuted for want of adequate evidence. B-summary means the allegations are found to be false, whereas C-summary indicates that no offence is disclosed. Thus, Desai claimed, an A-summary report reflects an incomplete investigation and cannot be construed a closure report. Desai also pointed out that there was efficacious alternative remedy available to the accused, filing a regular bail application; filing habeas corpus petition was no substitute for bail application, and cannot be granted by way of interim relief when the petition itself was not maintainable, he added.The bench found merit in the submission. Judges said granting bail as interim relief in a writ petition will send a wrong message and also set a wrong precedent. “The current danger is that this court will be flooded with petitions seeking bail as interim relief,” said the bench. Goswami’s counsel, senior advocates Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda, insisted the high court can grant bail in a writ petition and urged the bench to forthwith release the Republic TV editor on bail, claiming his arrest itself was illegal. The court on Saturday also issued notices to the state government and the accused in the case on a petition filed by Adnya Naik, daughter of the deceased architect and interior designer Anvay Naik, challenging the April 2019 magisterial order closing the criminal case. Anvay Naik, 53, died by suicide at his residence at Kaavir village in Alibag tehsil on May 5, 2018. His mother, Kumud, too, was found dead at their home. His wife Akshata lodged a complaint with police alleging that her husband and mother-in-law were forced to take the drastic step as they were under tremendous mental stress because of non-payment of dues collectively amounting to ₹5.40 crore by Goswami and the two others, something that was also mentioned in a suicide note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bombay-high-court-reserves-order-on-interim-bail-plea-of-arnab-goswami-two-others/story-cEfzr3kwpPKFnfBJzwkqxJ.html
08-11-2020||Election:||Bihar Assembly Election 2020: Exit polls give edge to RJD-led alliance||The Opposition Grand Alliance (GA) could edge out the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in a closely contested election in Bihar, a clutch of exit polls predicted after voting ended on Saturday, flagging anti-incumbency and jobs as issues that shaped the outcome. Five of eight major exit polls backed the GA – comprising the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and three Left parties – to outpace the NDA and cross the majority mark of 122 in the 243-member assembly.  Two polls forecast a thumping majority for the GA and only one said that the NDA – composed of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Dal (United), Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular and Vikassheel Insaan Party – may cross the halfway mark. The polls also indicated that the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which walked out of the NDA in the state and put up candidates largely against the JD(U), could perform poorly but hurt the ruling alliance’s vote share in several seats. In all, the election was largely seen as a two-horse fight with smaller parties and independents squeezed out. The Bihar assembly polls, spread over three phases in what was the first mass election since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country, was fought on questions of employment, governance and handling of the infection that has claimed 1,100 lives in the impoverished state. Chief minister Nitish Kumar was seeking his fourth consecutive term, squaring off against RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, whose promise of one million government jobs galvanised young people and drove huge crowds to his 200-plus rallies. Results are out on Tuesday. To be sure, exit polls are not completely accurate and have frequently got it wrong in earlier elections, especially in states with diverse populations, castes and communities as Bihar. In 2015, a plurality of exit polls predicted the BJP will win the state but the results saw the Opposition GA – of which the JD(U) was a part before severing ties in 2017 – win a decisive majority. But if these exit poll numbers hold, it could mean a significant surprise because as recently as the 2019 general elections, the NDA won 39 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats – which translated to a tally of 220-plus assembly constituencies. The numbers, if they are correct, will also signify a personal triumph for Yadav, who led his party in the absence of his father and former chief minister Lalu Prasad, who missed an assembly election campaign for the first time in four decades. If the exit poll forecast matches the actual result, it could also see a lot of post-results political developments, especially if the GA falls marginally short of a majority. In 2015, the GA won 178 of the 243 seats – 80 for the RJD, 71 for the JD(U) and 27 for the Congress. The BJP won 53 seats. In 2017, JD(U) exited the GA and joined hands with the BJP with Kumar continuing as CM. After the exit polls, the BJP took heart in the narrow margins predicted by several pollsters. “What is surprising is that if the exit polls are any indication, change does not come in small numbers. This perhaps indicates an undercurrent that may reverse the story of the exit polls,” said party spokesperson Tom Vadakkan. Another senior party functionary said exit polls have a track record of going wrong. It’s ally JD(U) said that there was no doubt about the success of NDA. “Just wait for a few more days and all the expectations of GA leaders would come crashing,” said spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad.RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha exuded confidence that the GA will win a majority. Congress said the GA will emerge a clear winner. “Bihar is on the verge of change. It has voted for change, for jobs, for better price of crops, for industries and businesses and for a new government and youth power,” party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said. Five polls predicted a slim victory for the Opposition.Times Now-CVoter gave NDA 116 and GA 120. ABP-CVoter gave NDA between 104 and 128 seats and GA between 108 and 131. Republic TV-JanKiBaat gave NDA between 91 and 117 seats, and GA between 118 and 138. TV9-Bharatvarsh gave NDA between 110 and 120 seats, and GA between 115 and 125. NewsX-DVresearch gave NDA between 110 and 117 seats, and GA between 108 and 123. Two polls gave a sweeping majority to the Opposition.News18-Today’s Chanakya gave NDA between 44 and 66 seats, and GA between 169 and 191. India Today-AxisMyIndia gave NDA between 69 and 81 seats, and GA between 139 and 161 seats. Only one poll gave the decisive edge to the NDA.Dainik Bhaskar gave NDA 120-127 seats and GA 71-81 seats. In at least two exit polls, the BJP was projected to be the bigger partner in the NDA – a big reversal of roles in the state where the JD(U) was traditionally the senior partner in the alliance. The exit polls forecast three broad trends. One, the election may have been defined by rising anti-incumbency sentiment against Kumar, who was seen struggling to deal with the migrant crisis, rising local aspirations and demand for jobs. Two, Yadav’s promise of one million government jobs in a state with poor industrialisation was predicted to have struck a chord and the 31-year-old leader may net support from young people, in addition to the RJD’s traditional caste coalition. Three, LJP and smaller formations such as the Grand Democratic Secular Front (GDSP), comprising All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samata Party, and Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party, may not have made a dent in terms of seats but damaged the major alliances in some pockets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bihar-election/bihar-assembly-election-2020-exit-polls-give-edge-to-rjd-led-alliance/story-S9rxggUtW6MMAb3MYip4SJ.html

08-11-2020||Mumbai||Active Covid-19 infections in Maharashtra drop under 100,000 for the 1st time since July 11||Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 3,959 Covid-19 infections, pushing the case count to 1,714,273. For the first time since July 11, the tally of active cases in the state fell under 100,000. The number of active cases stood at 99,151.The trend of fewer daily cases over the past few weeks has led to a constant decline in active infections. In the past 51 days, the state experienced a drop of more than 200,000 active cases. On September 17, its active cases tally was 3,01,752, the highest till date. However, there has been a decline since then and on September 30, the tally fell to 259,033 and on October 31, it further came down to 123,585, revealed official figures. Fewer active cases indicate that the epidemic is in control. Public health expert Sanjay Pattiwar said that cases have been reducing, but the state will have to be cautious and ensure that cases will not increase by November-end. “Decline in cases is a fact, but we have to wait till November-end as festivals are going on and winter has arrived. Plus, most lockdown restrictions have been lifted. We have to increase testing and contact tracing and if cases don’t rise till November-end then we can say that the state has successfully controlled the pandemic,” Pattiwar said.Although the Covid-19 curve in the state has been on the descending limb, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting on Saturday asked local authorities to be prepared for a second wave. He said that the next 15 days post Diwali would be crucial as there is a concern over a rise in cases owing to winter and ongoing festivals. He also directed testing potential super-spreaders, who have a lot of interaction with various groups of people, such as milkmen, maids, vegetable vendors and people working in public transport. “We can see that the infection rate and death rate are coming down, however, we cannot remain inattentive. We have to be prepared for a second wave like it is going on in European countries,” the chief minister said in a review meeting of divisional commissioners and district collectors to look at measures to be taken to prevent a potential second wave.“I have said this in March that it is a world war and we have been fighting it and are close to win it without “arms”. We are relaxing restrictions in a graded manner. We have taken all precautions to prevent spread of seasonal diseases during summer and monsoon, but winter has arrived, which is likely to bring other respiratory diseases such as pneumonia, asthma, flu and heart diseases, apart from rise in Covid-19,” Thackeray said. The chief minister also asked local authorities not to discontinue or dismantle temporary Covid treatment facilities such as field hospitals as of now. He said, “Do not remove field hospitals or Covid Care Centers developed for Covid-19 treatment. In fact, remove any lacunae, if any, as we have got some time.

08-11-2020||Chandigarh||Amid infighting in Himachal BJP, Jai Ram meets Nadda in Delhi||With the Himachal BJP reeling from factionalism, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur met national party chief Jagat Prakash Nadda in New Delhi on Saturday.Thakur had also held a closed-door meeting with state party chief Suresh Kashyap on Friday evening at Peterhoff Hotel. The leaders are said to have discussed the issues plaguing the party and the upcoming elections to panchayati raj institutions. Kashyap also discussed in detail factionalism in the party, particularly in the Jawalamukhi segment ,where senior party legislator Ramesh Dhawala is up in arms against the party’s decision to dissolve the block unit. Kashyap had dissolved the unit after fresh infighting erupted among Dhawala supporters and the party’s organisational secretary Pawan Rana.Dhawala has repeatedly accused Rana of interfering in the Jawalamukhi segment. Dhawala had termed the party’s action as arbitrary. He has sought intervention of national BJP chief Jagat Prakash Nadda to redress his grievances. “After the Bihar elections, Nadda should devote two to three days to asses the situation in Himachal and Jawalamukhi, in particular,” said Dhawala, who also spoke to former chief minister Shanta Kumar. There is growing disquiet in the party over infighting in Jawalamukhi, as it believes that it will tarnish the party’s image. The party can hardly sideline Dhawala who Dhawala was instrumental in formation of the BJP- Himachal Vikas Congress (HVP) alliance government in 1998. Dhawala, then an independent candidate, had enabled the BJP to topple the Virbhadra Singh-led Congress government. Dhawala enjoys considerable support among the dominant OBCs (other backward classes). Braced for panchayat pollsNadda assessed the political situation along with the government and party’s preparation for the upcoming elections to civic bodies and Panchayati Raj Institutions. The elections, which are due next month, are being seen as a precursor to the 2022 assembly elections. The outcome of the elections will be reflective of the policies and programmes of the Jai Ram-led government, which will complete three years in office in December.The Congress has also fortified its cadres and is attacking the government over misrule, poor governance and questionable fiscal management. Congress leaders during their rallies and speeches have been condemning Jai Ram’s anti-people stance. The BJP is banking on the party’s three-year rule and the achievements of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Centre.The BJP has directed its workers to educate voters about the benefits of different centrally-sponsored schemes. The BJP will also attempt to derive political mileage from the newly carved out municipal corporations in Mandi, Palampur and Solan. Mandi is also the home town of the chief minister while Palampur is the home town of former chief minister Shanta Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-infighting-in-himachal-bjp-jai-ram-meets-nadda-in-delhi/story-YIy1KqXdpGs2Jb5Ahi9jGN.html

Also, thermal screenings will be conducted before allowing students to enter schools, said school education minister Varsha Gaikwad.“RT-PCR tests of all teachers will be conducted by local authorities between November 17 and 22 and only teachers, who will test negative, will be allowed to conduct classes. Thermal screening of all students will be done before they are allowed to enter school and only one student will be allowed to sit on one bench to maintain social distancing,” the school education minister said.“Classes can be conducted only on an alternate day and they cannot be for more than four hours. Only select subjects such as Maths, Science, where teachers’ help is required, will be taken up for studies and classes for the remaining subjects will be continued online,” she said. Senior officials said that a consent form has been made mandatory, which has to be filled by parents. “Physical classes are not compulsory for schools and not even for students as online classes for all subjects will continue,” said a senior official from the school education department.“Besides, there will be no tiffin breaks as students will not be allowed to carry tiffin. They will have to eat at home and come. Water bottles can be carried by an individual student as there will be no common water filling spots, Gaikwad said. Thackeray said, “A possibility of a second wave cannot be ignored, thus the next few days after Diwali will be very crucial. The schools that were converted into quarantine centres cannot be closed down even now. The local administration will have to decide if an alternative site can be made available to schools.”He said that sanitisation of classrooms, screening of staff, students and even parents have to be made. Thackeray asked parents not to send students for physical classes if the student or someone else in the family is unwell due to Covid-19.The Central government allowed partial reopening of schools for higher standards from September 21, but the state had decided to consider reopening them post Diwali.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-allows-school-to-reopen-for-classes-9-to-12-from-november-23/story-U0WK81UIGAw6IOOBm8ICHJ.html

Some states have already taken a decision to ban firecrackers during Diwali.

A civic official on condition of anonymity said, “With many restrictions already in place due to the Covid situation, we have only made a public appeal to avoid use of crackers instead of banning it. As it is, there is no mechanism to check citizens using firecrackers during the festival.” Meanwhile, the civic administration has already put in place many checks and guidelines for crackers sellers to put up roadside stalls in an effort to bring down supply numbers.

The statement by state health minister Rajesh Tope asking people to celebrate Diwali without firecrackers has left the cracker sellers in a fix as they have already being issued non-objection certificate (NOC) by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to put up stalls. “The Covid situation has already hit our business. Now that the PMC has allotted us space to set up shops after following the given guidelines and formalites, the state government officials are asking people to celebrate Diwali without firecrackers. I am looking at a 50 per cent less sale this year,” said Sanjay Dilip Dakhave, who has put up his stall near Mutha riverbed. As of Saturday, 26 cracker sale shops have been put near the Mutha riverbed with 13 open and the rest yet to start sale. “Unlike previous years when we used to keep extra bags full of crackers to meet the rising demand, we have bought only limited stock this time,” said Rakesh Shah of Swamini Seznal firecrackers shop.

The city on Saturday recorded 13.3 degrees Celsius as the minimum temperature with the average air quality index level-pollutant measuring indicator for Pune at 11am was 95 μg/m3 (concentration of air pollutant [eg. ozone] in micrograms [one-millionth of a gram] per cubic metre air). It soared a bit and reached 98μg/m3 by 5pm, remaining under the ‘satisfactory’ level. The AQI, which is classified into six categories, including good + satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor, and severe, transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number (index value). The real-time pollution data by Safar showed the average PM10 (atmospheric particulate matter that have a diameter of less than 10 micrometres) in Pune was 95 μg/m3 and PM2.5 (atmospheric particulate matter that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres) – 60 μg/m3. Within city, Shivajinagar, Lohegaon and Hadapsar reported deterioration of air quality with PM10 being 156 μg/m3, 121 μg/m3 respectively at 5pm, according to Safar.

Dr Gufran Beig, project director, Safar, “Due to sudden temperature drop, the air quality deteriorates as polluted particles are trapped.” He said that the forecast for the city for next three days is that the air quality will witness a drop from “satisfactory” to “moderate”, with the AQI PM10 at 115 μg/m3 and PM 2.5 at 72 μg/m3. “The ambient air quality monitored in the city is satisfactory and is due to the effect of the cold wave which is leading to increasing of pollutants in the city.

Many citizens have already taken the benefit of the amnesty scheme announced by PMC in order to generate revenue during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said that more staff have been deployed to collect property tax dues. Congress leader Aba Bagul had requested the Pune municipal commissioner that as health staff are visiting each household for Covid-19 related purposes, if they also distribute the PMC property tax forms to residents then the civic administration will get also information. Bagul said, “PMC has printed the property assessment forms and distributed it to all the 15 ward offices. Now health staff would distribute these forms to citizens.” According to Bagul, many citizens who want to pay tax are unable to do so as they are unable to assess their properties. “Many citizens have also changed the use of their property. Some properties have turned commercial but tax is paid under the residential slab. Filling the forms will help PMC get the requisite details and taxes to be paid,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/after-amnesty-pmc-deploys-another-tool-to-generate-revenue/story-6pwQeOLfCJQcz9dsIUyQfK.html

The civic body has put a proposal to charge Rs 2,000 to cremate pets like cat and dog. The rising labour cost needed to cremate stray dogs has led PCMC to charge for cremation of pets. Pet owners out of PCMC limits may have to pay Rs 3,000 per pet. The electric incinerator for pet animals set up by PCMC at Nehrunagar’s Chirantan Pet Cemetery in 2013 was free for residents. “Labour and maintenance charges have increased as even strays are cremated here,” said Arun Maruti Dagade, veterinary officer and assistant superintendent (zoo). The Chirantan Pet Cemetery was built in 2007 and the incinerator of Rs 38 lakh can handle maximum weight of 80 kg at one time. As per the PCMC pet cremation data, from December 2016 to March 2020 a total of 1, 309 cats and dogs have been cremated. Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited provides CNG to the incinerator. “The proposal is expected to be passed in PCMC after the election code of conduct is lifted which is in place due to election for the graduate constituency,” said Dagade. Amol Patil, a businessman who has two pet dog, said, “I think charging cremation for pets is fine. I hope the cremation process is done properly.” Gunjan Jangid, IT professional, said, “When human are cremated free of cost then why PCMC is planning to charge for pets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pcmc-plans-to-charge-rs2-000-for-pet-cremation/story-YsAdRBEc10obXISzaHeAbM.html
08-11-2020||Pune||Mixed signals as APMC ushers in VRS scheme despite state’s opposition to farmers’ bill||Despite the opposition by the Maha Vikas Aghadi government to the new agricultural reforms proposed by the Centre, the agriculture marketing board has decided to launch a Voluntarily Retirement Scheme (VRS) for the Agriculture Produce Market committee’s (APMC) employees.As per the new farm bill introduced by Central government, farmers have been more empowered over the APMC.According to the new bill, farmers don’t have to sell their produce at APMC markets. Farmers have the opportunity to sell the produce anywhere and anyone can purchase the produce from farmers directly.APMC marketing director Satish Soni issued the circular on November 5th. The circular stated, “As the revenue of APMC is going down due to new reforms, the VRS scheme would be executed at APMC. Employees and officers can take VRS under this scheme. The workers union itself demanded to introduce such a scheme. As per the request from the employees union, the marketing director is allowing APMC to execute VRS schemes at their level. For recruitment, APMC will now require permission from the marketing director.”The Marketing director has issued the circular and said that a maximum of 25 per cent employees can take VRS under this scheme which would get executed until March 2022.One of the top officials from the marketing board said on anonymity, “Before the Central government Maharashtra allowed some crops and fruits to sell outside the APMC since 2016. The Centre had brought new reforms in the last parliament session. All these would affect APMC and their revenues would definitely come down. On this background though, the politicians are opposing these reforms, it would be better to bring down the number of employees at APMC.

To deal with such situation, armed forces have to be ready to combat hybrid threats emanating from multiple fronts.The Air Force chief was speaking after reviewing the passing out parade for 217 cadets of 139th course at National Defence Academy (NDA) in Pune on Saturday. The conduct of parade at Khetarpal Parade Ground, NDA, was suitably modified so as to ensure Covid-19 related precautions and thus the parents could not be invited for the ceremony.A total of 540 cadets participated in the parade of which 302 cadets were from the 139th course.

In the battle-space, operational response and demand will be an integrated synergistic approach to all operations,” said Bhadauria.“Our armed forces have to be prepared for hybrid threats emanating from multiple fronts. This mandates very high levels of knowledge, dedication, commitment and sacrifice and leadership at all levels at all times. This is what each service and the nation would expect from you,” he added.While addressing the cadets, IAF chief said the bonds of friendship that cadets have forged here, with course-mates, with squadron-mates, need to continue throughout life. “As you go into your service career and should translate always into better synergy at every stage of your career,” he said.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/armed-forces-must-be-ready-to-combat-hybrid-threats-iaf-chief/story-w802nUmLQh8aNurIv6RsAK.html

If there are more such patients coming from one particular area then we will increase testing and contact tracing accordingly so that the spread is controlled at the primary level.”Earlier the administration has targeted local chemists to give this information and the civic-run flu clinics were addressing such patients but this time, the authorities have focused on just collecting the information but also analysing the data to find if any trend exists.The district administration in its meeting with the hospitals and local authorities informed that if theyget the ‘early warning signs’ for the flu-like symptoms then they can control the spread of the infection for which the flu clinics set up by the civic body or the rural administration will play the key role.The administration has also informed that under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) all the primary health centres, sub-district hospitals, rural hospitals and select private hospitals must send weekly reports of such patients to the concerned authorities with details including the area from where the patient has come to understand if there is any ‘trend’ in the spread of the infection.The testing, containment zone plans and contact tracing strategy can be decided according to such trends, said officials...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/second-wave-on-mind-admin-asks-hospitals-to-keeps-tabs-on-patients-with-ili-and-sari-symptoms/story-AOHHiFarmw41JLhdTalnUM.html
08-11-2020||Pune||Covid-19 safety norms continued to be ignored at market in Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward||In spite of Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC’s) repeated appeals to comply with the Covid-19 safety norms, people continued to throng the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Market vegetable market in the Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward without following protocols.According to the PMC’s ward-wise data, Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward has reported as many as 16,171 Covid-19 cases as of November 4, which makes it the most affected ward. The doubling rate of the ward is 315.15 days and the ward has been reporting the maximum number of cases in 24 hours for over a month.Many people including vendors and buyers come for grocery shopping are seen ignoring the hygiene norms put in place by the administration.Yogesh Sasane, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator from the area, said, “Despite repeated attempts, the vendors refuse to wear masks. It is a problem. PMC is also conducting multiple drives and penalising the vendors, but to no effect.”The ward office, on Friday, has collected a fine of Rs 15,200 from 85 people for not wearing masks. The civic body also conducted a community rapid antigen testing for all the vendors, about 700 people, in which not even a single vendor had tested positive.Somnath Bankar, assistant municipal commissioner of the ward, said, “We have conducted drives to penalise vendors if found not wearing face masks. We have also deployed our officials at that market to ensure that the vendors follow the norms.”The market is often visited by thousands on a daily basis with people purchasing vegetables and fish. The market is also visited by traders from the nearby farms and Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) who sell their produce to the vendors. Vendors are often seen not wearing masks and coughing and sneezing. The market is located just 100 metres away from the Hadapsar-Mundhwa ward office which is responsible for implementing the norms.The district administration in its strategy paper has described vegetable vendors and market places as ‘super spreaders’ who would play a crucial role in controlling the possible ‘second wave’ of Covid-19 with people ignoring social distancing and even wearing masks in public places and administration may find it a challenge to control the number of cases in this ward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-safety-norms-continued-to-be-ignored-at-market-in-hadapsar-mundhwa-ward/story-QcomWpHZubARB3K5VEifsO.html
08-11-2020||Chandigarh||Valmiki community, West Pakistan Refugees oppose Gupkar alliance||Valmiki communities and West Pakistan Refugees (WPRs) criticised the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) for seeking restoration of the ‘highly discriminatory Articles 370 and 35-A’ on Saturday. Valmiki community leader Gharu Bhatti said, “They never met us before. Today, too, they did not sought a meeting with us. They met different delegations from civil society but we were not invited.” “If Article 370 is restored. What will be our fate? Will we again be relegated to second-class citizens? The PAGD leaders don’t value us. They ruined Kashmir and want to do the same in Jammu,” said Bhatti. He said, “We were the biggest victims of the highly-discriminatory Articles (370 and 35-A). If these article are restored again, will we again be given brooms and continue to work as safai karamcharis. We were brought here in 1957 from Gurdaspur and Amritsar on the assurance of the then Prime Minister of J&K Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed that we will be given permanent resident status and other privileges. But for 62 years we worked as sweepers irrespective of our educational qualifications. We were not entitled to apply for any other government jobs,” said Bhatti. He also demanded that arrest warrants be issued against the leaders for ‘seditious remarks pertaining to the Tricolour and China. West Pakistan Refugees Action Committee chairperson Labha Ram Gandhi said they too were opposed to the PAGD. “I appeal to the people of Jammu to boycott them. They will ruin Jammu as well. If India has become one nation then what’s wrong in it,” he said. If industries come to Jammu, there will be more jobs for the youth, said Gandhi. Gandhi represents 1.25 lakh West Pak refugees, belonging to scheduled castes and backward classes. Before August 5, 2019 West Pak refugees were not considered residents of the erstwhile state and were not entitled to jobs and admission to professional courses. They had fled Pakistan from Sialkot during Partition and settled in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/valmiki-community-west-pakistan-refugees-oppose-gupkar-alliance/story-oMS8LtHhqsY3LfR1E6jxRL.html
08-11-2020||Chandigarh||HT Chandigarh Our Take: Let’s celebrate a happy but safe Diwali||The festival of lights, Diwali, is just around the corner, heralding the advent of the winter months and the final months of a gloomy year or annus horribilis, as Queen Elizabeth once famously put it, in which a Covid-19 wreaked havoc on the planet, forcing nations to declare lockdowns, keeping people confined indoors for months, destroying economies and lives.What is worrying is that despite a brief respite, the Covid-19 tally crossed the 15,000 mark to reach 15,025 in Chandigarh on Saturday, breaching the 100 mark on Friday after the span of one month. The home ministry’s “unlock” directions have resulted in opening of most services, including restaurants, workplaces – even schools for higher classes earlier this week. So, with the festive and wedding season combined, the rise in Covid numbers comes as no surprise.In a season where the air quality has also deteriorated because of the drop in temperatures and stubble burning, the UT administration’s decision to ban firecrackers seems to be a move in the right direction. However, with the ban coming just a few days before Diwali could mean huge losses for dealers who have already bought their stock of firecrackers for the season.At a time when the economy is in the doldrums and the fear of Covid-19 is intensifying again with a second surge very likely, how can Diwali be celebrated in the best way possible?Should crowds be thronging markets for festival shopping? Should firecrackers be burst? If not, what happens to the stock already purchased by dealers? Stubble burning is still continuing, because of which the Air Quality Index on November 3 and 4 crossed 200 (poor category).These are critical, unprecedented times. People need to feel positive and celebrate life to keep looking forward to better times, but the Covid threat persists, requiring abundant caution. This is the time to stop, reflect and take a decision that’s for everyone’s benefit – not for just one person or two.Question of the Week: Festival dilemma: What’s the best way to celebrate the festive season?With Covid cases surging and AQI getting worse, how do you plan to celebrate Diwali?

08-11-2020||Mumbai||Only 4 out of 20 smart projects in Kalyan-Dombivli completed; rest gaining momentum, says civic body||Four years after its inception, only four out of the 20 projects listed by the Smart Kalyan Dombivli Corporation Limited (SKDCL) are completed, as per the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation’s (KDMC) record. The project faced several technical issues till early this year. The KDMC, though, has claimed that the projects have gained momentum since February.Three out of the four completed projects are solid waste management that includes automated solid waste management, 10 metric ton bio-methanation plant at Umbarde and garbage bins at household level for segregation. The fourth project is installing LED street lights across the city.The major projects that are meant to decongest the city’s station areas, improve parking facilities, waterfront development, lake-beautification and smart transport are still pending.The commissioner, Vijay Suryavanshi, who is the chief executive officer of SKDCL, said, “The work under smart city was slow initially due to technical issues. The consultants were changed twice. Since February this year, the work has received a push. We have managed to hold three meetings of the city level advisory forum.”Suryavanshi added that the tender for beautification of Kala Talao lake has been finalised. The work order for the most important project of Kalyan station, SATIS, will also be given soon.The projects under the smart city mission were introduced by the KDMC in 2016. In the last four years, the civic body has managed to initiate the work for city park project in Gauripada, Kalyan (W), traffic signals and CCTV at major junctions in Kalyan Dombivli and a control command centre for CCTV at the headquarters of KDMC.The civic body had proposed the projects worth ₹1,445Cr. Presently, the civic body has acquired ₹194Cr funds from the state and central government.After almost 18 years, traffic signals are being installed at five out of the 20 major junctions in the city under the project.Yogesh Dalvi, 47, social activist from Kalyan, said, “Even though the traffic signals are installed on a trial basis, there is no proper management. In some places, the signals installed are not visible from a long distance due to the advertisement boards. The installed signals are also defunct at times. There is a need for improvement in the signal management system.”Residents of Kalyan-Dombivli claim that there is no clear picture on the status of most projects.“I think the project under the smart city that we have been waiting for is the Kalyan and Dombivli station area development. Even today, we face a lot of trouble taking the station due to congestion. Traffic signals are a must but unless there is a wider road, what is the point in putting up the signals if there is congestion,” said Saurabh Joshi, 37, a resident of Paar naka, Kalyan (W).Experts claim that the idea of a smart city was itself not clear and it was flawed. They claim that the projects planned in the cities are not implemented effectively because the authorities fail to look into the basic amenities at first.Mayuresh Bhadsavle, an urban policy maker from Thane, said,“ In Kalyan-Dombivli, the station area development, which was one of the aspired projects, did not get a push as the stakeholders like transport authority, auto rickshaw unions or the railway failed to come to a common conclusion. Also, the proposal prepared by the civic bodies for the projects are data centric without taking into consideration the ground infrastructure. The traffic signals project does not make much difference as roads are narrow and there is no relief from congestion.“Two major issues pertaining to the smart city mission are that it did not take into account the environmental needs and the support of local communities. For the water front development project, people from Koli communities were not taken into confidence. This affects the implementation at all levels.”Bhadsavle also claimed that in KDMC, the commissioner has changed every one or two years, impacting the smart city projects.Suryavanshi said, “The work of road concretisation and widening is already under progress. We are trying to give a push to all major projects that will help decongest the city one by one.”PROJECTS COMPLETEDAutomated solid waste management: ₹1.43CrLED street light pilot project: ₹0.62Cr10 MT bio-methanation plant at Umbarde: ₹1.88CrGarbage bins at household level for segregation: ₹1.35CrPENDING PROJECTSCity Park: The phase 1 work of the project located at Gauripada, Kalyan (W) is 14 per cent completed by spending ₹7.54Cr. The total cost of the project is ₹114Cr. It includes construction of a swimming pool, health club, auditorium, tennis court, restaurants, cafe and other facilities.Control Command Room, Traffic signals and CCTV: This project is ready and will be opened soon. The room is set up at the KDMC headquarters near Shivaji chowk in Kalyan (W). It will help in monitoring the traffic signals and CCTVs and other projects under the Smart city mission. The work of installation of the traffic signals is under progress. Signals have been installed at five major junctions out of the 20 on a trial basis. The total cost of this project is ₹149Cr. A total of ₹20.67 has been spent on these projects with the completion of 25 per cent of the work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-4-out-of-20-smart-projects-in-kalyan-dombivli-completed-rest-gaining-momentum-says-civic-body/story-Yo6Xv9uAK6WANydfLOkqlI.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||NGO opposes Ulhasnagar traders’ idea of using Gol Maidan for parking||While the Ulhasnagar traders have sought parking space for four wheelers at the Gol Maidan, the Hirali Foundation from the suburb has opposed the notion. The Foundation has suggested that instead of damaging the open space at Gol Maidan, wedding lawns in the city be used for parking.The Ulhasnagar traders association had approached the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) commissioner to allot the ground for parking four wheelers during Diwali. Sarita Khanchandani, founder of Hirali Foundation, said, “We are not against parking facilities in the city. Parking facility is a must to decongest the city. However, Gol Maidan is usually occupied for cultural events. If parking is permitted, the, children will be deprived of open space.”The foundation had lodged several complaints with the civic body against the misuse of Gol Maidan. Sprawled over two acres, Gol Maidan in Ulhasnagar has been popular with children and senior citizens. It has now turned into a venue for public and political gatherings, events and fairs. Children hardly have space to play there. Although there is a volleyball court, it has not been maintained properly. Only 20 per cent of the ground is used by the children and the rest is let out for public and political gatherings.“All the marriage lawns in the city are now lying vacant. the civic body can approach their owners and ask them to take up parking facility for vehicles in the city. This is a better option than just overusing the playground,” said Khanchandani.The Ulhasnagar traders association had cited the need for a parking lot as vehicles parked on the roads cause major congestion in the city during Diwali, and also cited Gol Maidan as an option.An officer from UMC not wishing to be named said, “The civic chief has not yet taken any decision on allotting the ground for parking. If there is an opposition to it, then we will consider all the points and only then take a decision.”The fight against the violations at Gol Maidan began in December 2016 after a spiritual event was organised on the ground. Residents complained about noise pollution during the event. Hirali Foundation, an NGO fighting against noise pollution, filed a contempt petition against the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) in the Bombay high court.The Foundation wants the ground only for children. The Gol Maidan, earlier, had no fencing and was open to children throughout the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ngo-opposes-ulhasnagar-traders-idea-of-using-gol-maidan-for-parking/story-mhT5aWFsVg6N2AFvYA6BhP.html

The victim — identified as Saurabh Mavi, a resident of Dhrampura village — was rushed to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead. Police have detained Mavi’s friend Nakul Sharma, who was travelling with him in a car at the time of the incident. Ankur Aggarwal, additional DCP (Noida central), said that the incident came to light around 3pm when Mavi’s friend Sharma, who is in early 20s, called up the police control room to inform about the incident. Sharma and Mavi were friends and have known each other for some years, investigators said. Sharma told police that Mavi had reached his sweet shop in the afternoon and later planned to visit a mutual friend, Sachin, in Sector Pi-3 in Greater Noida “Sharma has told us that he and Mavi left the shop in his Maruti Vitara Brezza for Pi-3. On the way Mavi suddenly took out a gun and started posing for a selfie,” police said in a press statement. Police said that when the duo reached somewhere near Ace City roundabout in Greater Noida west, Sharma accidentally pulled the trigger of the gun, firing once. The bullet pierced Mavi’s chest and he was wounded. Sharma immediately rushed Mavi to Sharda hospital. Ajit Kumar, Sharda Hospital PRO, said that the victim had received critical injuries and he was declared brought dead. “The victim died due to critical injuries and blood loss. The hospital has informed the police about the matter,” he said. Police have sent the body for a post-mortem and a medical report is awaited. Bisrakh police have detained Sharma and are questioning him regarding the case. A forensics team is also collecting evidence from the weapon and the finger prints of Mavi to check if he was involved in the incident. Aggarwal said that the victim’s family is yet to file a complaint in this regard. Police said that it appears the gun used in the crime is a licenced revolver. Police are investigating the source of weapon and why the victim was carrying the weapon at the time of the incident. Local residents expressed shock over the incident. Nisha Rai, a resident of Noida Sector 77, said that there is need to create mental health awareness. “People are facing anxiety and mental issues.

The Noida Sector 58 police have registered a case on the basis of a complaint by Amazon, and have launched an investigation into the matter.According to the police, the suspect, Rajat Sharma, is a resident of Uttam Nagar in Delhi.The complaint was filed by the company’s authorised representative, Tushar Bagga. In the complaint he alleged that Sharma has been working with the company at its Noida Sector 62 office as a customer service associate. “He abused his authority and approved illegal refunds of fake customers,” he alleged in the FIR.Bagga alleged that Sharma used to book expensive products such as mobile phones and other digital products using fake IDs, and then facilitated refunds without following company guidelines. “Sharma worked in the customer care department. His works involved addressing complaints and facilitating refunds. There is a process of refund where customers file a complaint and return the products, and then their money is refunded. The refund and concessions are issued when the customers contact the company. In some cases, the suspect himself approved concession/refunds without an application from the customer,” Bagga alleged.Most of the accounts which had placed such orders and requests for refunds had allegedly been on the same IP address. The company noticed foul play and launched an internal investigation into the matter and allegedly found that one product was booked and a refund request was made on the name of Sharma’s sister. These products were allegedly booked from September 2019 to January 2020 and then sought illegal refunds. Sharma has allegedly defrauded the company products worth ₹7.75 lakh, Bagga said in the FIR. When contacted, Sharma said that the allegations against him were not true. “I am still an employee of the company,” he said before disconnecting the call. Athar Khan, senior sub-inspector of Sector 58, the case was registered under sections 66-D and 420 (cheating) of IPC. “We will seek help from cyber cell to investigate the matter and take appropriate action,” he said.When contacted, an Amazon India spokesperson said: “As India’s most trusted online marketplace we take incidents of fraud seriously. A case has been reported, and the local police are investigating.

Trump’s public staging of the dramatics of denial mode bore (un)poetic resemblance to the melodrama of a sulking six year old shredding to smithereens a school report card that declares him flunked.Tweeple on turf closer home tasted not only the Battle of the Ballot, but also another battle – Donald-ism VS Decibel-ism.Tamasha TV’s saner channel cousins punctuated breaking news bulletins with tell-all taglines – “News Without Noise” or “No Noise, Only News”. That compounded Couch Potatoes’ confusion – did these taglines resonate the sound and fury emanating from Trump or did the camouflaged catchphrase-ism allude to the lull in the lungs of Loudmouths like jailed Arnab Goswami, the subtext smacking of another war – channel war?The curious case of “For Whom the Ballot T(r)olls”.When Harris met SulkyWell, it’s not for us to do a dissection or dissertation of Donald-esque denial mode. What concerns us more is misadventures closer home – what kept our Lollita, Lamba ji & Co busy during the epic Battle of the Ballot.Remember, the Trump-Biden theatrics coincided with another battle – Qualifiers for #IPL2020 final.So the scenario scripts thus: Lollita is all agog not so much about Trump making history or histrionics, but the making of Harris. She’s busy telephonically twattling and also twiddling on her touchscreen, texting Tamil friends for enlightenment on vernacular vocabulary – struggling to master the pronunciation of Thulasendrapuram, Kamala Harris’ village.Lamba ji’s eyeballs are engaged in a nail-biting finish of the Battle of the Berth, and he’s in no mood to lend his ears, Biden or unbidden. Lamba ji’s lungs lustily root for Mumbai Indians, “Kamaal hai ... Kamaal!”Lollita too is lost in a nail-biting finish, but her vocal cords chortle cheeringly for an American-Indian, “Kamala ... Kamala!”The next moment, bowler Jasprit breaks a record, propelling MI ahead in the Battle of the Berth. Lamba ji erupts into elation, “Bumrah … Bumrah!”Lollita too breaks into jollifications, but at the breaking of an American glass ceiling, “Bhangra, bhangra!”Amid the cricket cheering, Lamba ji remembers the letter from his head office which arrived that morning. “Honey, can you pass me the chithhi?”Lollita is in no mood for distractions, she’s engrossed in deconstructions – of Kamala’s viral vocabulary. Lamba ji returns rebuffed to IPL action, like a surly schoolboy who keeps raising his hand but the teacher turns a blind eye.Showing off her smattering of newly imbibed Tamil, Lollita speed dials her TamBrahm girlie gang to go gaga, “Chithis... Chithis!”The curious case of “Chithis Creak”.chetnakeer@yahoo.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-chithi-chithi-gang-gang/story-4CCiXLtbDg7UKo4gJKHNzI.html
08-11-2020||Noida||Noida police to issue ‘green’ fire cracker licence for three days||Noida: The Noida police will issue licences to fire cracker vendors to sell green crackers for three days in Greater Noida, officials said. The police department will accept applications from interested vendors till November 8. It will also issue a helpline number for people to seek help in case of injuries due to fire cracker bursting.Suhas LY, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate, said that a state government order and The Explosive Substances Act mandates the commissionerate to look after these issues.The Noida police on Saturday issued a press statement inviting applications for fire cracker licenses from vendors. Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that temporary licences will be issued to some vendors. “We are inviting applications from interested vendors from November 4-8. We received five applications till Friday. We will evaluate them and issue licences through lottery draw. The licences will be for green fire crackers only,” he said. The licence will be issued from November 11 to 13. All vendors will have to sell the fire crackers in stalls allocated at the Knowledge Park playground. Officials said that they will set up a helpline at Sharda University for treatment of people with burn injuries, if any.The Delhi government, on the other hand, on Thursday had imposed a blanket ban on firecrackers, including those branded ‘green’, between November 7 and 30, with the city reeling under the impact of hazardous air quality. Singh said he has not received any communication from Delhi government over the issue.Ajit Kumar, Sharda Hospital PRO, said the hospital has a burn unit and an ICU. “We have collaborated with the Noida police to treat burn injuries. We will soon issue a helpline number where people can contact and get help,” he said. The helpline will be active from November 10 to 15.On Saturday, Noida and Greater Noida recorded an air quality index (AQI) 426 and 428, respectively, both in “severe” category, as per data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Alok Singh, a resident of Sector Alpha 1 in Greater Noida, said that fire crackers should be banned as the air quality is not good these days. “People should act responsibly. Diwali is a festival of lights. This is not a good time to burst fire crackers which will only worsen the air quality,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-police-to-issue-green-fire-cracker-licence-for-three-days/story-WNyl6okkZnRitthlWHSPTP.html
08-11-2020||Noida||Ghaziabad plans to make 34 major markets ‘vehicle-free zone’ till Diwali||Ghaziabad: The The Ghaziabad administration has planned to make 34 major markets in the city “vehicle-free zones” up to Diwali, in order to check over-crowding and to reduce traffic, besides reducing vehicle emissions. District officials have also issued an advisory in which residents living in the vicinity of 500 metres of markets have been requested to walk to the markets instead of taking their vehicles along.The Ghaziabad city has 34 major markets across Indirapuram, Vaishali, Sahibabad, Bajaria, Gandhi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Mohan Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Turab Nagar, Vasundhara, Kaushambi, Raj Nagar District Centre, Kavi Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, Shyam Park, Raj Nagar Extension, Navyug Market and Ambedkar Road, apart from and those in Delta Colonies of Ramprastha, Brij Vihar, Surya Nagar and Chander Nagar.“I have directed officers to find open parking spaces for visitors where they can park their vehicles near markets and walk the rest of the way for shopping. If there are several markets in the vicinity, one major parking lot nearby is to be identified. The plan is likely to be implemented from Tuesday next week up to Diwali. If this plan yields good results, it will be continued for a couple of days after Diwali festival as well,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate. “The idea is to reduce congestion which will also help us control mixing of people in markets, otherwise it may have an adverse impact in terms of spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease,” he added.The administration has directed officials to find out big parking areas near markets. The Ghaziabad city has been facing high pollution levels. “The idea for vehicle-free zones in markets is a welcome move as traders also face issues as vehicles move inside markets and create chaos. Also, during the times of the pandemic, over-crowding must be reduced at all cost. However, appropriate parking spaces should be made available to visitors where they can park vehicles safely,” said Rajneesh Bansal, chairperson of Turab Nagar Vyapar Mandal.Traders also said that once the plan comes into effect, it should be supplemented strictly to maintain order in markets and enforcement against people not wearing masks should also be implemented strictly. “The traders will surely help out the administration in carrying out the vehicle-free market plan. Further, we request the admin to streamline small vendors who occupy roads, which lead to chaos. Some separate space should be marked for them as well. In major markets, the administration should also define a line beyond which no trader or vendor should be allowed to keep goods or stock,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram in Ghaziabad. At present, Ghaziabad city has a large vehicle-free zone at Raj Nagar District Centre which was recently inaugurated by the development authority and a nearby parking lot is provided for visitors. “We are planning for implementation of vehicle-free markets. This will help reduce congestion which will also reduce emissions and their effect on air quality,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UP pollution control board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/ghaziabad-plans-to-make-34-major-markets-vehicle-free-zone-till-diwali/story-skyq03j4BjcIj31cK5LdMK.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body identifies 1 lakh frontline workers who will get vaccine first||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has identified 1 lakh frontline workers working as Covid-19 warriors in government and private hospitals who will be given the Covid-19 vaccine first after the trial runs are completed and the vaccine is available in the market.BMC officials said they have compiled data on 1 lakh frontline workers who are going to be priority for vaccine distribution followed by senior citizens. Till now, more than 2,500 frontline workers of BMC have been contracted Covid-19 and more than 150 have lost their lives.Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner of BMC, said, “We have identified a total of 1 lakh frontline workers in the city who will be given vaccine on priority once the vaccine is available. These 1 lakh frontline workers involve workers from both private and government institutions.”Kakani added, “After frontline workers, the vaccine will be administered on senior citizens. The Central and state governments will also issue guidelines on further distribution. However, the school of thought is such that frontline workers and senior citizens are going to be priority.”According to BMC, the vaccine distribution strategy will be amended from time to time based on the guidelines received from the Central and state governments.The Central government has, two month ago, already formed an expert committee comprising representatives from all relevant ministries and institutions to oversee all aspects of Covid-19 vaccine plan — from identification of the vaccine, to buying, to financing the purchase, to distribution and administration.The identification process undertaken by BMC is part of the civic body’s vaccine distribution strategy. HT had, on October 4, reported that BMC will draw up a plan for vaccine distribution starting November.In terms of vaccine trials, BMC has kicked off trials of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University a month ago. The trial is being undertaken at the civic-run KEM Hospital.India is banking on four types of vaccines for which trials are being conducted or will be started in the coming days. The four types of vaccine include the BCG vaccine, the vaccine by Oxford University, Russia’s Sputnik V, and India’s Covaxin by Bharat-Biotech.The Serum Institute of India, which is conducting trials for the vaccine by Oxford University, had two days ago said that the vaccine can be made available starting January 2021, if it is found to be successful.Meanwhile, on the status of antibodies, BMC said it doesn’t plan to conduct any fresh sero surveillance study which is undertaken to ascertain whether an individual has developed Covid-19 antibodies.A BMC official said, “It is natural that with more time, more people have started developing antibodies, and this could be one of the reasons why the number of cases has been going down in the city.”Meanwhile, the city’s daily case positivity rate is below 10% since the past five days, and active cases are also going down. As of Friday, the city had 262,473 Covid-19 cases and 10,399 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-identifies-1-lakh-frontline-workers-who-will-get-vaccine-first/story-8IIwFlEuKuXMa99NkAcWGN.html
08-11-2020||Noida||Noida, Ghaziabad see no scope of improvement as air quality remain severe for third day||Noida: The air quality of the National Capital Region (NCR) worsened on Saturday as pollution levels refused to budge from the “sever” category in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad for the third day.According to analysts, weather conditions will remain unfavourable for ventilation of marginal dispersion of pollutants till November 11. On Saturday, wind speed in Noida and adjoining areas dropped to 4-5 kmph, which is not enough for dispersion of the smog cover in the city. Meanwhile, north-westerly winds – coming from Punjab and Haryana where myriad instances of stubble burning have been reported – are bringing in more smoke to the region.“Wind speed did pick up in some parts of NCR, however, in Noida and adjoining areas, it was calm at 4-5 kmph, due to which dispersal of pollutants was not much. Weather conditions will remain so till November 9, after which wind direction will change from westerly to easterly. Now, when the direction changes, the speed drops for a few days, due to which on November 10 and 11 pollution levels may increase further,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD).Meanwhile, instances of stubble burning in neighbouring states have increased. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), a private weather forecasting agency, there were a total of 4,528 instances of fires on Friday in at least four northern states, against 3,225 on Thursday.According to the agency, Thursday’s figure was the all-time seasonal high, and with the addition of more than 1,000 on Friday, such instances are peaking.“The air quality has declined, despite moderate day time dispersion conditions, owing to sustained and unusually high fire emissions. Surface winds became calm today (Saturday) morning and pollutants are accumulating near the surface. Safar synergised that stubble fire counts over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas increased and stood at 4,528 on Friday, the highest of this season,” said a Safar statement.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida, on a scale of 0 to 500, dropped to 426 on Saturday against 406 a day earlier, while Greater Noida was 428 against 421 on Friday. Ghaziabad was 436 on Saturday against 433 a day earlier.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.”Meanwhile, the average PM2.5 for Noida was 346.5 microgrammes per cubic metres (µg/m3), which is eight times the safe limit, against 270.67µg/m3 a day earlier. The PM10 for Noida was 546.62µg/m3– nine times the safe limits – against 478.077µg/m3 a day earlier.The PM2.5 and PM10 for Greater Noida was 321.55µg/m3 (276.25µg/m3 on Thursday) and 536.37µg/m3 (520.17µg/m3 on Thursday), respectively. The standard limits for PM2.5 is 40µg/m3 and for PM10 is 60µg/m3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-ghaziabad-see-no-scope-of-improvement-as-air-quality-remain-severe-for-third-day/story-8oxrVLsZIvqNFNUyBHa2OL.html
08-11-2020||Gurugram||Cops seal shops selling firecrackers||A day after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced a statewide ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers to prevent air pollution, the Gurugram Police on Saturday carried out a sealing drive of shops selling crackers. A police official said videography of shops selling crackers was done on Saturday morning and traders were directed to stop selling crackers till November 30 as per the directive of the government.The city has 11 major cracker dealers and six stockists also called magazine holders, located mostly in Qaddipur and Ghadoli villages, on the outskirts of the city.Gurugram Police said that the traders were asked to stop the sale of crackers on Saturday morning itself after the ban was announced by the chief minister on Friday. “Videography of shops was carried out in the morning and traders were asked to resume sale only after November 30, when the ban is supposed to be revoked,” said inspector Sanjay Kumar, SHO, Sector 10, whose area has a number of such shops.The district administration is yet to issue a formal direction in this regard but the traders, who ceased operations due to police action on Saturday morning, said that their business will be greatly affected due to the ban.The traders said roughly 12 to15 crore of sales happens during Diwali. The ban will greatly affect the business. They said that every year, governments announce a ban on crackers without consulting them and give them no time to prepare.Anil Nagpal, a trader based in Qadipur, said that around 2,500 to 3,000 people are engaged in this business in this city and their income would be badly hit. “Who will buy crackers after November 30. Most of the sale of crackers happen before Diwali. Further, we are selling only green crackers, which cause very less pollution and are more expensive than normal crackers. The government should have at least given us a couple of days so that we could have prepared for this situation,” said Nagpal.The traders said that a delegation also met the district authorities in this regard but they were told that the ban was being imposed on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.Pawan Kumar Jhamb, another cracker dealer, said that the government should listen to their plight and allow for a limited sale of green crackers. “A lot of traders have taken stock on credit and this ban will ensure that they won’t be able to make payments throughout the year as 80% of the revenue is generated during Diwali,” he said.On Friday, the public relations department of the Haryana government posted a tweet stating that with a view to preventing the risk of spread of Covid-19 due to the polluted atmosphere created by the bursting of crackers, the Haryana government has decided to put a complete ban on the sale of crackers in the state.Despite repeated attempts, Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, and Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner, did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-seal-shops-selling-firecrackers/story-iFcmfWAutxrC8UsOAxTCGJ.html
08-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: No mashal march outside Matoshree, Maratha Kranti Morcha’s protest contained in a ground||Maratha Kranti Morcha’s attempt to organise the mashal march outside Matoshree, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s residence in Bandra, did not materialise as the police did not allow protesters to hold the march.Rally organisers instead had to stage their protest in the ground opposite the collector’s office at Bandra. Their attempts to storm out of the ground were resisted by the police. After five hours, state transport minister Anil Parab met the protesters and assured that Thackeray will meet them next week.The protesters demanded that the government take steps to give relief to the Maratha community in view of the Supreme Court stay on Maratha reservation.One of the coordinators, Abhijit Ghag, said Matoshree was chosen as the venue as it was the destination where many problems related to Maharashtrians were solved. “For decades, whenever any Maharashtrian faced any problem, Balasaheb Thackeray (Shiv Sena founder and Uddhav Thackeray’s father) would solve them at Matoshree. We now expect his son, who heads the state, to take proactive steps,” said Ghag. He said that the state government has the power to ensure a way out of this crisis.On September 9, the Supreme Court (SC) stayed the implementation of the law granting reservation to Marathas and referred the matter to a larger constitutional bench. The Apex court had said that the state government had not shown any extraordinary situation which warrants the reservation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-no-mashal-march-outside-matoshree-maratha-kranti-morcha-s-protest-contained-in-a-ground/story-Qa8A32WiI61MNVqqQKObHP.html
08-11-2020||Gurugram||City’s air quality enters severe category for the second time this week||Air quality in the city entered the “severe” category on Saturday for the second time this season with a reading of 439 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) air quality index (AQI) bulletin. Saturday’s reading is up from the previous day’s AQI reading of 392 in the “very poor” category. Earlier, on Thursday, the air quality had entered the “severe” category. Officials and experts attributed the spike in pollution to low wind speed, falling temperature and stubble burning. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of the “very poor” category on Sunday. Air quality is expected to remain in the “severe” to “very poor” categories on Monday as well. The average daily concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5, the city’s most prominent pollutant, on Saturday was 436.95µg/m³, as per the HSPCB’s official air quality monitor at Vikas Sadan. “Low speed winds are a major reason behind the increase in pollution. Due to calmer wind speed, the dispersion of pollutants is not taking place adequately. In the morning hours, particularly between 4am and 7am, there is a peak in the level of pollutants due to thermal inversion. The mixing height is also coming down; it is roughly 40% less than what it used to be earlier. As a result, accumulation of pollutants is higher,” said Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist. The mixing height is the vertical height at which suspended particles mix with the air. Due to a dip in temperatures, the air rising from the surface cannot reach a particular height for dispersal. Panwar said that while some relief could be expected on Sunday and Monday, more peaks could be expected next week between November 10-12. Kuldeep Srivastava, a scientist at Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, also reiterated that pollution had increased due to poor dispersal of pollutants. “The pollutants have accumulated since dispersal is poor due to low wind speed. We can expect some improvement if wind speed picks up,” said Srivastava. On Saturday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 13 degrees Celsius, three degrees below the normal. The maximum temperature was recorded at 29.9 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature is expected to hover around 13 degrees Celsius on Sunday while the maximum temperature is expected to be around 30 degrees Celsius. Clear skies are expected to prevail this week, as per the IMD’s weekly forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-s-air-quality-enters-severe-category-for-the-second-time-this-week/story-cGUToSR4199IxFtYJRwB0J.html
08-11-2020||Chandigarh||Random Forays: Mother Nature is the greatest teacher||Of all the learnings that a human being can garner in a lifetime, the most enlightening ones come from Mother Nature. A walk in a forest will alone teach more to a young student than hours spent in a classroom. The youngster would then be forced to wonder, even if he is Instagramming intermittently at the same time, as to how the various species of fauna and flora take birth, grow and prosper.Those who do not wonder at the beauty and expanse of nature and the vast array of forms that life takes on are not really living to the fullest extent. Even an insect like an ant or a ladybird can teach us a lot about perseverance and dedication to our goals, if one is receptive enough to learn from them. To not be mystified at the fact that a tree sheds all its leaves and looks completely denuded, yet soon blossoms with flowers and is found to be utterly luxuriant and green weeks later, is to take nature for granted.Of course zoology has all the answers as to why and how an ugly looking pupa turns into a beautiful and exotic butterfly. And of course botany tells us how a mango tree manages to find itself laden with many dozens of the delicious fruit every year.Yet, to marvel and wonder at the cosmic creator, to compel ourselves to not take nature’s magic for granted is to really live. To the receptive soul, the Almighty’s ingenuity seems inexhaustible in a jungle. To think of it, one can even further be confounded by the shapes, sizes and varieties of human beings who dot our planet. There is no similarity between the looks and stature of a Jason Holder from the West Indies and a Prithvi Shaw from India. Yet both have the ability to play cricket at the highest level with brains and skills that are ultimately similar.The essence of the message of nature is that we must wonder at the miracles we see around us every day and yet tend to overlook. The sun manages to provide us with boundless heat, light and energy day in and day out, but we seldom acknowledge even its existence in our minds. We are too caught up in worrying about share markets and election results and the like, after all.One of the greatest innovations in education could be to take city-based children camping more often, to the great outdoors and make them feel wide eyed with amazement at the stars. Those children whose parents actually spent hours under the natural umbrella of the night sky and told them stories have been truly blessed. There is no greater experience for a child than to be in the lap of nature, listening to a fascinating story or reading a wondrous story.Sally Walker puts it beautifully in this rhyme. “Just feel the magic in the air and the power in the breeze, Feel the energy of the plants, the bushes and the trees, Let yourself be surrounded by nature at its best, Calm yourself, focus, and let magic do the rest!”A walk in surroundings which are not artificially created by mankind would surely rejuvenate a child or a grown up who has spent days on end staring at a screen. Just the whiff of the cool air and the sound of birds chirping would act as a balm for the body, mind and soul.Even those who have pets at home are truly fortunate, for they have pure energy vibrating in their surroundings. One look at our resident Beagle, Joey, and his wagging tail, makes my mind feel more refreshed than anything else in the world. To exist in the state of being besotted with the intricacies of materialistic pursuits, without pausing to think about what brought us here and where we are ultimately headed, is to live life with a closed mind. Life teaches us many things, and one of them has to be to fall in love with nature, if we already haven’t.Alex Trebec has the last word: “If you cannot be in awe of Mother Nature, there’s something wrong with you!”vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-mother-nature-is-the-greatest-teacher/story-YKkno9FzvyOhuzLwvMF9UK.html
08-11-2020||Delhi||AQI severe for third consecutive day, it may get worse, warns scientists||Delhi’s air quality remained in the severe zone for the third consecutive day on Saturday, with over 4,500 farm fires in Punjab and Haryana contributing to over 32% of ultrafine particulate matter (PM2.5) which could not be dispersed despite slightly better wind speed compared to Friday, scientists said, warning that a relief was unlikely at least till Tuesday. The average air quality index of Delhi was 427 on Saturday, marginally higher than Friday’s 406 but less than Thursday (450). VK Soni, head of India Meteorological Department (IMD) environment monitoring research centre said that during the day the average wind speed was around 12kmph, which was higher than the wind speed recorded on Friday. Its impact, however, was not seen on the AQI because of the high stubble burning cases in Punjab and Haryana. He said that the north-westerly winds are bringing heavy load of pollutants from these fires to Delhi. “For the last three days we have been observing that the number of fires spotted over Punjab alone is more than 4,000, and that it tends to increase on Sundays. Even though the wind speed picked up during the day, the improvement in air quality was not very significant only because of higher share of farm fires,” Soni said. According to the union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), 4,528 fires were spotted over Punjab and Haryana, on Saturday. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that in parts of central Delhi the wind speed fluctuated between 6-8kmph, but around outer Delhi the wind speed picked up to 16kmph. “In the Palam observatory, the wind speed was nearly 16kmph, but if you look at the winds recorded in the Safdarjung observatory, it was only around 6-8kmph. This could be the reason behind the high pollution in the heart of the city. The wind that we are receiving now is from the north-western direction, which is bringing a large share of smoke from Punjab and Haryana,” said Srivastava. Srivastava said that there is a forecast of the wind direction changing to easterlies from Tuesday, but before that wind speed will reduce drastically, possibly pushing the city’s air quality further into the ‘severe’ zone. “When the wind direction changes, in the transitional stage the wind speeds reduce drastically and from Sunday evening the wind may become calm. This will only spell more trouble for Delhi,” Srivastava warned. Saturday was the third consecutive day when the AQI in the national capital crossed the severe mark. CPCB data shows that last year, there were 24 days when the air quality plunged into the ‘severe’ category. In 2018, there were 20 such days and in 2017, there were nine days when the AQI levels remained in the red zone. Senior CPCB officials said that even though the city’s AQI levels has remained in the ‘severe’ zone for three days now, late Thursday night the PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) had dipped below the 300ug/m3 mark. For the city to slip into the ‘severe plus’ category, PM 2.5 levels have to consistently remain above the 300ug/m3 mark and PM 10 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers) have to be above the 500ug/m3 mark for 48 hours. Under such a situation, the CPCB’s taskforce would declare an air emergency and direct all enforcement agencies in Delhi-NCR to bring about measures such as restriction of trucks into the city, stopping construction activities and directing the government to announce the odd-even vehicle rationing scheme under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aqi-severe-for-third-consecutive-day-it-may-get-worse-warns-scientists/story-EMAPumzfK4EkTlntRHAU1H.html
08-11-2020||Delhi||Over 6,900 new Covid cases in Delhi, active cases cross 40K mark||With Delhi reporting nearly 7,000 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday, the number of active cases or those with current infections crossed the 40,000 mark for the first time in the city as the “third wave” of the pandemic infection rages. A day after the number of new cases in Delhi breached the 7,000-mark for the time, the capital reported 6,953 cases of the infection on Saturday, as per the Delhi government’s daily Covid bulletin. Also, according to the bulletin, there were 40,258 people living with the infection in the city as on Friday night with the experts warning further spike in cases due to more violation of Covid norms in the ongoing festive season.On Saturday, Delhi reported 79 deaths due to the infection, the highest since July 4 when 81 deaths – some that had happened before – were added to the city’s toll.The total number of fatalities stood at 6912.As per data shared by the union health ministry, Delhi topped the list of 10 states that contributed 77% of the new Covid-19 cases. The Delhi high court had earlier this week said Delhi was on its way to become the “corona capital of the country.” “The number of cases is likely to continue to go up during the festive season as people tend to have gatherings. The problem is that people tend to get relaxed with their relatives around and do not follow safety measures. People eat together with their masks off at a distance less than 6 feet. Nowadays, even outdoors masks have become chin accessories. Add to that the increase in the levels of pollution, which is also known to increase the severity and transmission of the infection,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences. Following Delhi’s second surge in cases of the viral infection in September, the number of active cases was on a decline to just over 20,000 recorded on October 12. Since then, the active cases have almost doubled. The government is concerned about the active cases as these are the people who either need to be constantly monitored at home or need to be hospitalised. With over 19.5% of the patients with current infections needing hospitalisation, the health bulletin showed that 7,858 people were admitted across city hospitals as on Friday night. Despite having over 16,000 beds earmarked for the treatment of the viral infection in government as well as private hospitals, the intensive care unit beds are filling up fast. Over 80% of all the ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 treatment were occupied as on Saturday night, according to data shared by hospitals on Delhi Corona app. The government ordered eight of its hospitals and 14 private ones to earmark 1,185 more beds for the treatment of Covid-19 on Friday. Of these, at least 110 beds in the government hospitals will have non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal oxygen support. The national capital is currently reeling under the “third wave” of the Covid-19 infection, but cases should begin to come down soon, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Saturday.Interacting with reporters, he also said that the Delhi government has filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court after the high court did not allow reserving 80 per cent ICU beds for Covid-19 patients at several private hospitalsJain said, “Yesterday, we issued an order to add 1,185 beds for Covid patients in both Delhi government hospitals and many private hospitals.Five hundred beds are to be augmented at city government-run Covid facilities, including 110 ICU beds.”Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max healthcare, said, “The hospital occupancy has undoubtedly shot up and is likely to go up further. There is an increasing burden on critical care and hospitals are stretched thin. As per government’s data there are several beds vacant in government hospitals, these could be upgraded to provide critical care as most of the Covid-19 patients coming to hospitals need it. Those with mild symptoms prefer to remain in home isolation.” The number of deaths have gone up along with the increasing number of cases in the city. On average, just over 57 deaths were reported each day over the last seven days as compared to almost 41 deaths the week before. However, with huge number of cases being reported, the case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among total positive cases – has reduced to 1.6%. This is still higher than the national average of 1.4%. “And, if the number of hospitalisations keep going up and there is a shortage of beds, the mortality is likely to go up as people in need of critical care might not get it on time,” said Dr Budhiraja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-6-900-new-covid-cases-in-delhi-active-cases-cross-40k-mark/story-65TWlPlvygIV0CVF3nOiuM.html
08-11-2020||Delhi||Police crackdown on cracker sale, 459kg of banned 459kg recovered after multiple raids||The Delhi Police on Saturday said they had suspended all the licences given to shopkeepers in Delhi for selling green and PESO-certified firecrackers this Diwali . The decision comes a day after the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) issued a notification for “complete ban” on bursting and sale of all kinds of crackers in Delhi till November 30. Senior police officers said that all police personnel on duty across the city have already been directed to enforce the directives and carry out “massive crackdowns” on people involved in the illegal sale and use of crackers. As a result, the city police so far have already seized nearly 459 kilograms of banned crackers and arrested three shopkeepers from west, south-west and outer Delhi areas, between Friday and Saturday, for storing and selling firecrackers.“We (Delhi Police) have suspended all the licences issued for selling firecrackers in Delhi following the DPCC’s notification that has completely banned the sale and use of all crackers till November 30. All licence holders are being informed about the decision through concerned police districts and police stations,” said joint commissioner of police (licencing unit) Suvashis Choudhary.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday had announced a complete ban on firecrackers, including the less pollution green variants, in Delhi from November 7 to November 30. He had said that the decision was taken after assessing the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the city, which was being made worse by the rising pollution levels.DPCC member secretary had written to the Delhi Police on Friday asking them to enforce the ban from Saturday, and submit a daily action taken report to the state pollution control body. A meeting to chalk out the SoPs of the ban will be chaired by environment minister Gopal Rai on Monday.As per police data, a total of 167 licences for selling green crackers were issued till November 2. All of them stand suspended after the DPCC issued the “complete ban” notification on Friday (November 6) which kicked in from Saturday. Officials said that apart from notifying shopkeepers, who obtained licences from 15 police districts, and the licencing unit for firecrackers sale about the ban, the police are also seeking the records of storage of crackers in shops and godowns. The shopkeepers are also being informed that any mismatch in the existing storage quantity may attract legal action. “Since both sale and use of firecrackers have been banned in the city, we have categorically asked the shopkeepers dealing in such items to ensure that there is no disparity in their existing list of stored crackers. If anyone is returning the crackers to the concerned dealer, distributor, or manufacturer, the proper documentation of the same should be done and furnished before the concerned police station. Their records will be checked periodically,” said deputy commissioner of police (north) Anto Alphonse. A total of 19 licences were issued to shopkeepers in north police district, with most of the shops in Sadar Bazar area. On Saturday, special teams carried out surprise checks in various markets and residential colonies in north Delhi to enforce the ban and inform the public about the same. Similar arrangements were made in other police district of the city as well, the officials said. On Saturday morning, the Dabri police station team seized more than 34 kilograms of banned crackers from a shop where they had been illegally accumulated . The shopkeeper, Rakesh Bansal, was arrested under section 9B of the Explosive Act, said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena. “Two policemen on patrolling duty received information regarding storage of banned crackers in a shop at Main Rajapuri Road. A raid was conducted and 34.600 kg of such crackers seized. The shopkeeper failed to produce any licence or documents for the crackers. We have arrested Bansal,” added Meena. On Friday, nearly 415 kilograms of crackers were seized from a shop in west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar. The shopkeeper, Sanjay Kumar, also a supplier of crackers and previously involved in four such cases, was arrested by Khayala police station. The crackers were stored in 19 cartons. In a similar operation, a total of 9.2 kilograms of banned crackers were seized from Vishnu Datt in outer Delhi’s Nehru Enclave in Alipur. Datt was arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-crackdown-on-cracker-sale-459kg-of-banned-fireworks-recovered-after-multiple-raids/story-gG8wxCi3AYghj9d98PrstJ.html

His target worked as a motivation, but at times it also put pressure on him. Last month, he relieved this pressure by buying a six-room house for his family. And this was very much evident when he took to the greens after over seven months, with resumption of the domestic professional circuit that started simultaneously in Panchkula and Chandigarh on November 4. Sharma’s superlative performance saw him equalising the PGTI (Professional Golf Tour of India) four-round record of 24-under, set by multiple Asian tour winner Anirban Lahiri and highest ranked Indian golfer in the world Rashid Khan. On all four days, Sharma played under-par (64,66,67,67) and maintained the top position on the leader’s board till lifting the title. Another Chandigarh golfer Karandeep Kochhar finished second with a tally of 19-under-269. He got a cheque for ₹3.34 lakh. ‘Win will set the tone for remaining season’“Professional golfers, especially caddy-turned pros, are totally dependent on the tournaments to earn their livelihood. So, I was eagerly waiting for the professional circuit to resume post lockdown. I am really happy that I won the inaugural tournament,” said Sharma. “The win in the first event will set the tone for the remaining four events of the season. My next target is to perform well in the second tournament presented by my home course Chandigarh Golf Club, starting from November 9,” he said.Sharma’s association with the sport started as a caddy at an age of 13. Two years later, he started playing, and at 20, he turned professional. Last month, he bought a two-storey house for his family at Nayagaon near Chandigarh. “The day I turned pro, my ultimate target was to have my own house. It took me almost 10 years to realise my dream. Now, the next in line is marriage and a car. I also have to save money to play on the Asian Tour. If I do well there, then I can aim for a bigger car too, otherwise I have to be content with a smaller one,” said Sharma. ‘My life revolves around 18-hole golf course’“My life revolves around the 18-hole golf course. First, it was the job of the caddie to earn pocket money and contribute to my family’s meagre income, and now I play golf to provide a decent lifestyle to my family,” said Sharma.After two years of caddying, he bought two secondhand clubs (7 Iron and Sandwich) for ₹500 each. As he was not eligible to use the course, he honed golfing skills on a ground at Saketri, after his caddy work. “For almost two years I saved money and bought my first set. It was second-hand and cost me ₹8,000. Today I am a little bit comfortable and have got an equipment sponsor. But I can never forget what members of the Chandigarh Golf Course have done for me,” said Sharma. SPS Matharoo, who is the captain of the course, helped him financially, so that he could travel and participate in tournaments. “I am also thankful to my caddy Montu Kumar (from Delhi), who is my partner from struggling days. He had travelled with me by train and stayed in the cheapest lodges. But since 2017, I am able to afford travelling by air and staying in decent hotels,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/caddy-turned-pro-akshay-sharma-wins-post-lockdown-inaugural-pgti-tourney-equals-india-s-four-round-record-of-under-24-par/story-qtcp31XMu7jAWiz1xmlNZI.html

FZ8194 landed at Dubai International Airport just after 5:40pm, bringing the tourists to the skyscraper-studded city after a roughly three-hour trip. The low-cost carrier had sent one of its Boeing 737s to Ben-Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv earlier Sunday morning to pick up the passengers.The flight flew across Saudi Arabia and then over the waters of the Persian Gulf to reach the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms also home to Abu Dhabi.The arrival of tourists comes as Dubai in particular tries to revive its vital tourism industry amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

08-11-2020||World||Joe Biden may bring respite to China-US ‘Cold War’, but feud to continue: Chinese observers||The victory of Joe Biden in the US presidential election may provide a respite to China from President Donald Trump’s declaration of the “Cold War” and offer a limited chance to reset the turbulent ties even as high-intensity rivalry is expected to continue, Chinese observers said on Sunday.Click here for complete coverage of US election 2020 Trump’s four years in power is the worst phase in China-US relations as the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), headed by President Xi Jinping, struggled to deal with what Chinese officials said is the most elusive and unpredictable American leader ever since the former US president Richard Nixon’s historic visit to Beijing in 1972, establishing ties for the first time with the Communist nation. Trump pushed aggressively on all aspects of the US-China ties, including with his relentless trade war, challenging Chinese military hold on the disputed South China Sea, its constant threats to Taiwan and branding coronavirus as ‘China virus’ after it emerged from Wuhan in December last year. The Biden tenure could usher in a “buffering period” for already-tense China-US relations, and offer an opportunity for breakthrough in resuming high-level communication and rebuilding mutual strategic trust between the two countries, a report in the state-run Global Times said. Deteriorating relations between China and the US have entered a vicious circle, leading to damaged strategic mutual trust, suspended high-level communication and little concrete cooperation, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Centre for US Studies at Fudan University, told the daily.Also Read | China opposes US’ move to remove ETIM from terrorist outfit list Under Biden, it might now be expected that China and the US will resume pragmatic cooperation on vaccines, the anti-epidemic fight and climate change, Xin said. Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at Renmin University of China in Beijing, said that Biden will usher in a “buffering period” for worsening China-US relations. “Biden will be more moderate and mature on handling foreign affairs,” Jin said. Much has been written in the overseas media that no matter who wins the White House, the next US president is most likely to take a “get tough” stand on the China policy, Wang Xiangwei, a columnist of the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, said. “That is certainly true, but from Beijing’s perspective, a Biden presidency is more likely to put a floor under the current free-fall in relations, judging by his recent remarks on China and those of his foreign policy advisers,” he said in his column on Sunday. Instead of the Trump administration’s increasingly bare-knuckled and full-throttled approach to demonising the Chinese leadership and ramping up the ideological confrontation as well as constricting China’s economic progress, a Biden presidency could lead to a new normal in relations characterised by intensifying confrontation and competition on issues like technology and human rights but increased cooperation on global issues including climate change, he said. “If that is the case, Biden will probably take an overall harder line against China but avoid pushing the two countries to a new Cold War,” Wang said, referring to Biden’s comment in an interview that he sees Russia as a bigger threat to the US and China as a “serious competitor”. However, the pending change in the US leadership won’t change the overall direction of Washington’s China policy, observers said. Regardless of who resides in the White House, the US will to some extent maintain its current approach towards China, a report in the Global Times said. Biden’s China policy won’t simply slip back into the Obama era approach of 2016 as during the past four years, China-US relations and the global landscape have changed significantly, it said. “We should not put too much expectation on Biden because to contain and confront China is a strategic consensus between the two major parties of the US,” Jin added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-may-bring-respite-to-china-us-cold-war-but-feud-to-continue-chinese-observers/story-g2SI0kANfnaG6iNCzfWw8O.html
08-11-2020||World||5 US states approve measures eradicating potentially racist language, symbols||Alabama voters reversed themselves from a few years ago and removed racist vestiges of segregation from the state constitution that courts long ago ruled unconstitutional. Rhode Island did a similar a U-turn to eradicate the word “plantations” from the state’s official name.In a year when discussions of racial justice have dominated US society like few others, five states voted to cleanse the public sphere of words, phrases and symbols that to many were painful reminders of the nation’s history of slavery and the systematic oppression of Black people.Brendan Skip Mark, who teaches political science at the University of Rhode Island, believes the decisions were linked to the revulsion and widespread protests that followed the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota in May.“In many ways this has sparked a national conversation on race, and I think we’ve seen a lot of people who are more willing to take concrete steps to address racism than they were in the past,” Mark said.Read also: After the vote: A timeline of how a president takes powerIn addition to the votes in Alabama and Rhode Island, residents of Utah and Nebraska decided to strip their constitutions of unenforceable provisions that allowed slavery as a punishment for criminal convictions. And Mississippi voters approved a state flag without the familiar X-shaped design of the Confederate battle flag.The votes are a positive sign in a nation where racial tension always has existed, said Stacy Moak, who teaches in the social work department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.“Affirmative votes for these changes shows a willingness on the part of Americans to provide for a more inclusive community. These changes, by themselves, are not enough — but they are encouraging signs of progress in the right direction,” she said in an interview conducted by email.The Alabama measure begins the process of removing Jim Crow language from the 1901 Constitution that was intended to entrench white supremacy. Voters in the mostly white, conservative state had rejected similar proposals twice since 2000.Courts had previously struck down the legality of the segregationist provisions that were enshrined in the document long ago, but the language banning mixed-race marriage, allowing poll taxes and mandating school segregation remained.Glenn Crowell, a Black Republican from Montgomery, was among the roughly 67% of voters who supported scrapping those sections.“It just doesn’t make any sense nowadays,” said Crowell, 63. Yet another statewide vote will be required to approve the revisions after legislators consider a draft in 2022.In neighboring Mississippi, about 71% of voters approved a new state flag featuring a magnolia and the words “In God We Trust” to replace the Confederate-themed flag that state legislators voted to retire in June after the nation erupted in demonstrations following Floyd’s killing.Mississippi voters also eliminated an 1890s provision that aimed to ensure white control of the state by requiring majorities of both the popular vote and the 122 state House districts to win statewide office. Now, only a popular vote majority is required.To the west, Utah and Nebraska approved provisions similar to Alabama’s to delete constitutional language allowing slavery as a possible punishment in criminal cases.The measures, which passed by 81% in Utah and 68% in Nebraska, got relatively little attention before the vote.But the fact that states even placed the measures on ballots shows that protests and the national discussion on racism are having an impact, said Deirdre Cooper Owens, director of the humanities in medicine program at the University of Nebraska.“Symbolism matters, and so does language,” she said by email.The vote was closest in Rhode Island, once a hub of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, where about 53% of voters supported the proposal to strip the words “and Providence Plantations” from the state’s formal name, first adopted in 1790. A similar measure failed in 2010.Like elsewhere in the country, Rhode Island has seen protests over Floyd’s death, and in racially diverse Providence, a truth commission was established to consider the state’s historic ties to slavery, land seizures, systemic racism and possible reparations.“This ballot initiative is part of a broader shift in Rhode Island to reconcile with the past,” said Mark, the political scientist. “I think this is a unique moment in history.”All those ballot measures involved changing symbols or wiping away reminders of injustices of long ago. In California, where voters were asked to reconsider a more contemporary race-related issue, they balked.The liberal-minded state rejected a proposition that would have repealed a 1996 initiative prohibiting affirmative action programs in public employment, education or contracting. Supporters said the measure lost for several reasons, including a lack of time to persuade voters during a busy election year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-us-states-approve-measures-eradicating-potentially-racist-language-symbols/story-K9rsEdBrg7gpjhQX0n8goK.html

It will go through the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the world’s most geologically active areas, according to the Chinese official media.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway starts from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province and travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours.Linzhi, also known as Nyingchi, is located close to Arunachal Pradesh border.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control, the de-facto border between the two countries. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of south Tibet which is firmly rejected by India.Linzhi also has an airport which is one of the five airports built by China in the Himalayan region.The Ya’an-Linzhi section runs 1,011 km with 26 stations. Trains are expected to run at speeds between 120 and 200 kms per hour. The total cost of the entire Sichuan-Tibet Railway project is around 319.8 billion yuan ($47.8 billion), according to a recent report by the state-run Global Times.In a video conference, ahead of the commencement of the construction of the project, Xi identified it as a major measure in facilitating the ruling Communist Party’s general plan for governing Tibet in the new era, and stressed the project’s important role in safeguarding national unity, promoting ethnic solidarity and consolidating stability in border areas.He made the instruction ahead of the beginning of the construction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway’s Ya’an-Nyingchi section on Sunday, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway will not only accelerate and enhance the overall economic development of the Tibet region, but will play an important role in safeguarding border stability, the Global Times said.Read also: Curbing Covid-19 pandemic swiftly was vital in China’s ongoing economic recoveryThe project would significantly contribute to the economic and social development of the western region, especially in Sichuan province and Tibet Autonomous Region, Xi said.Underlining the complex geological and climatic conditions, as well as fragile ecological environment along the project line, he called for leveraging China’s advantage of concentrating resources to get things done to accomplish this historic task, which is arduous but glorious.The construction should be carried out in a scientific, safe and eco-friendly way, Xi said, apparently referring to the fragility of the area as it is one of the world’s most active seismic regions.Speaking at the meeting, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang emphasised prioritising the safety, reliability and quality of the project, and called for coordinated efforts in promoting construction, epidemic prevention and people’s well-being.The 1,011-km section between Ya’an in Sichuan and NyingChi in Tibet is the third part of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, which will be carried out by the China State Railway Group Co., Ltd.The project’s Chengdu-Ya’an section became operational in December 2018, and the construction of the Lhasa-Nyingchi section started in June 2015, the Xinhua report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-advance-construction-of-rail-line-in-tibet-close-to-arunachal-pradesh/story-4mKlFQfI1iptVOddbv8mnJ.html

08-11-2020||World||Johnson denies his Trump ties weaken UK-US bond under Biden||Britain and the United States will work together to support democracy and combat climate change, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Sunday, while denying that his close ties to President Donald Trump would hurt UK-US relations once President-elect Joe Biden takes office.Click here for complete coverage of US election 2020Johnson congratulated Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on their victory and said the two countries’ “common global perspective” would be vital to shore up a rules-based global order that is under threat.“The United States is our closest and most important ally,” said Johnson, who has yet to speak to Biden. “And that’s been the case under president after president, prime minister after prime minister. It won’t change.”Johnson told The Associated Press during an interview Sunday at his offices in 10 Downing St. that he looked forward to “working with President Biden and his team on a lot of crucial stuff for us in the weeks and months ahead: tackling climate change, trade, international security, many, many, many, many, many other issues.”Conservative Party leader Johnson is widely seen as an ally — and to critics, a copy — of the populist, “America First” Trump, who has referred to Johnson approvingly as “Britain Trump.” Last year, Biden called the British leader a “clone” of Trump, and he has criticized Britain’s exit from the European Union, which Johnson has championed and led.But Johnson said “there is far more that unites the government of this country and government in Washington any time, any stage, than divides us.”“We have common values. We have common interests. We have a common global perspective,” said Johnson. “There’s a huge amount of work we need to do together to protect those values: a belief in democracy, in free speech around the world, in human rights, in free trade, in the rules-based international order.”He shrugged off suggestions that Biden’s victory would scupper chances of a UK-US trade deal, and make it more urgent for Britain to secure a post-Brexit free trade deal with the 27-nation EU.Also Read | UK says US ties will go ‘from strength to strength’ whoever winsBritain had been hoping to secure a quick trade agreement with the US after its official departure from the EU in January. The change in administration in Washington leaves prospects of a deal uncertain and could raise pressure on Johnson to seal a deal with the EU before the UK makes an economic split from the bloc at the end of this year.Post-Brexit trade talks are due to resume Monday, with the deadline imposed by the two sides just days away.“I’ve always been a great enthusiast for a trade deal with our European friends and partners,” said Johnson, who has repeatedly said he is prepared to walk away from the Brexit trade talks without an agreement. “I think it’s there to be done.

Despite heavy destruction, the fortress city withstands the blows of the enemy,” the Nagorno-Karabakh Rescue Service said.Armenia’s defence ministry said that heavy fighting for the strategic site continues, while the Defence Army of Nagorno-Karabakh said they had repelled multiple attempts by the Azeri side to advance on the town.Emboldened by Turkish support, Azerbaijan has the upper hand in the bloodiest fighting in more than 25 years in the South Caucasus. In just over a month, it has retaken much of the land in and around Nagorno-Karabakh that it lost in a previous war over the territory in the 1990s.Turkish leaders congratulated Azerbaijan on Sunday.“I congratulate my Azeri brothers’ Shusha victory. I believe (it) is a sign that the rest of the occupied lands will be liberated soon too,” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said, addressing crowds in Turkey’s northwestern province of Kocaeli.The city could serve as a key staging post for an Azeri assault on the enclave’s largest city, Stepanakert. Both have come under heavy shelling in recent days. Azerbaijan’s defence ministry said allegations that it had shelled civilian areas were ‘misinformation’.The town is also culturally significant to both sides, Thomas de Waal, analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said.Its population was predominantly made up of Azeris before the previous conflict, making it historically significant for Azerbaijan. For Armenians, it is the site of Karabakh’s cathedral, de Waal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/azerbaijan-announces-capture-of-karabakh-city-armenia-denies-it/story-IOYAzGJI0mYQ52BhrOQIKO.html
08-11-2020||World||Iran’s president calls on Biden to return to nuclear deal||Iran’s president called on President-elect Joe Biden to “compensate for past mistakes” and return the US to Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, a state-run news agency reported Sunday.Hassan Rouhani’s comments mark the highest-level response from Iran to Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris clinching the Nov. 3 election.“Now, an opportunity has come up for the next US administration to compensate for past mistakes and return to the path of complying with international agreements through respect of international norms,” the state-run IRNA news agency quoted him as saying.Under President Donald Trump, tensions between the US and Iran have escalated, reaching fever-pitch earlier this year. One of Trump’s signature foreign policy moves was unilaterally withdrawing the US from Iran’s nuclear deal in 2018, which had seen Tehran limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.The US has since reimposed punishing sanctions on Iran that have crippled its economy, which was further battered by the coronavirus outbreak. In an effort to pressure Europe to find a way around the sanctions, Iran has slowly abandoned the limits of the nuclear deal.“The people of Iran, though their heroic resistance against the imposed economic war, proved that the US maximum pressure policy was doomed to fail,” Rouhani said. He added Iran “considers constructive engagement with the world as a strategy.”Meanwhile, Iran on Sunday reached its highest ever single-day death toll from the coronavirus with 459 new deaths recorded. This brings Iran’s total recorded deaths from the virus to 38,291 nationwide. Another 9,236 new confirmed cases of the virus were confirmed over the past 24 hours, bringing total confirmed cases to more than 682,000 nationwide since February.Iran has struggled to contain the virus and has seen daily surges and highs over the past month. The capital, Tehran, has been the hardest-hit and recently extended some lockdown measures across the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-president-calls-on-biden-to-return-to-nuclear-deal/story-cYUzttqbDPaKYU4PuVjJSM.html
08-11-2020||World||Donald Trump’s Iran policy can be an opportunity for Joe Biden||The next US president will have to come to terms with “the will of the Iranian people” and end the economic war against the Islamic Republic, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech Thursday. Bluster aside, there is a kernel of truth to his prediction — and President Donald Trump’s Iran policy may make negotiations easier for President-elect Joe Biden.Rouhani, who will have to run for the presidency next year, is dealing with an economy that has been pummeled by the sanctions that the US imposed after 2018, when it withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement. Both Trump and Biden have said they would negotiate with Iran after the 2020 election. In those negotiations, the Biden administration should use Trump’s “maximum pressure” policy to its advantage.Also Read: What Iran’s tit-for-tat missile attack on US interests means for IndiaThis sounds like a contradiction. When Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, Biden and most Democrats denounced what they perceived as reckless petulance. Former Secretary of State John Kerry even advised Iran’s foreign minister to wait out the Trump administration until the 2020 elections, in the hopes of salvaging the agreement.Biden has also pledged that the US will re-enter the nuclear agreement if Iran “returns to strict compliance with the deal,” he wrote in the March/April issue of Foreign Affairs. This means that he would lift many of the nuclear sanctions that Trump has re-imposed if Iran brings its low enriched uranium stockpiles back under the limits in the 2015 deal.Biden’s position is more moderate than many Democrats who argue that the US should re-enter the nuclear deal unconditionally. Nonetheless, his stated position risks missing an opportunity.But don’t take my word for it: Biden himself and many of his top advisers have acknowledged that the 2015 agreement must be improved. Limits on low enriched uranium production, for example, which can be further enriched into fuel suitable for a nuclear weapon, begin to expire in 2026. Last month, a U.N. ban on selling advanced conventional weapons expired. In a few years, Iran will be able to begin installing more efficient, advanced centrifuges.Biden has said that he would pursue fixes to the nuclear deal after the US rejoined the agreement. He has described this as using “our renewed commitment to diplomacy to work with our allies to strengthen and extend” the agreement, and work with those allies to more effectively push back against “Iran’s other destabilizing activities.”Also Read: Iran’s supreme leader mocks US election using Donald Trump’s wordsThat is a worthy goal. But it makes no sense to think that Iran would be more inclined to make concessions it has not already made after economic sanctions are lifted. Here the Trump administration has done its successor a favor. Not only has Trump imposed nuclear sanctions on Iran’s oil exports and crucial economic sectors such as metals and petrochemicals, but it has also imposed a series of sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism.Just last month, the Trump administration sanctioned Iran’s oil ministry, its national oil company and its national tanker company for support for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Quds Force. The administration’s 2019 decision to sanction Iran’s central bank was also tied to its financial support for terrorism, not its nuclear program.So Biden could lift nuclear-related sanctions but still keep terrorism-related ones in place if the Iranians do not agree to make further concessions. Mark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told me that Biden is in a position to ask Iran’s regime to “help me, help you.”There are a few reasons for this. For one, Republicans could win back the presidency in four years. As Iran has learned, any agreement with the US that is not ratified by the Senate as a treaty can be withdrawn by the next president.There is also the broader issue of risk and perception of risk for financial markets. If the Iranian regime wants money to invest in its oil sector and economy, large banks and corporations must be assured that they will not face problems down the road. Biden alone cannot make those assurances if Iranian banks continue to engage in terror financing and money laundering. This will require Iran to up take more substantive reforms on its own.None of this is to say that Biden cannot and will not lift some sanctions in exchange for some Iranian concessions. All of that is likely to happen. The test for the Biden administration will be to use the leverage Trump has created to improve the 2015 nuclear agreement and pressure Iran to end its regional aggression.This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.Eli Lake is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering national security and foreign policy.

The NGO’s, that monitors the performance of the United Nations, condemnation comes after Pakistan government defended the beheading of a French teacher in Paris by an Islamic terrorist by claiming that the blasphemy in the garb of freedom of expression is ‘intolerable’.French President Emmanuel Macron has been facing criticism from various Muslim-majority countries after he took a tough stand on radical Islam and defended cartoons of Prophet Muhammad. Macron’s remarks did not go well with Pakistan Prime Minister Khan who slammed the French President, saying that he has “chosen to deliberately provoke Muslims”.In a reply to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s remark ‘Blasphemy in the garb of freedom of expression is intolerable’, the UN watch said: “Your presence on the U.N. Human Rights Council is intolerable.”Also Read | Pak PM Imran Khan involves in ‘demagoguery’ over Macron’s remarkIn another tweet, the UN Watch shared a statement dated September 28 where it has presented its views against the election of Pakistan in the rights council. In October, Pakistan was re-elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council despite opposition from activist groups over its abysmal human rights records. Blasphemy laws are exploited to attack and persecute members of religious minorities, particularly Christians, the document stated.“Religious minorities in Pakistan suffer from discrimination, sectarian violence and forced conversions. A Christian mother of five, Asia Bibi spent eight years on death row in Pakistan for blasphemy after she got into a dispute with local Muslim women over a cup of water. Two Pakistani politicians were killed for supporting her,” read the document. The NGO had pointed out Pakistan ranks in the bottom 20 per cent of the Reporters Sans Frontiers (RSF) world press freedom index. Pakistani children are subjected to multiple forms of violence and abuse including exploitative labour practices, sexual abuse and child marriage, the NGO had stated in the document. “According to the United Nations Children’s Fund, Pakistan has the sixth-highest number of child brides in the world. Human Rights Watch (HRW) reports that “an average of 11 cases of child sexual abuse are reported daily across Pakistan,” including of girls as young as 5. Furthermore, child labour remains a serious problem, including the sale of children into domestic servitude and kidnapping,” the NGO stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-presence-in-rights-council-intolerable-says-un-accredited-ngo/story-MQqB9bWs1taI5E1EgWw6TI.html
08-11-2020||World||Aung San Suu Kyi’s party set to win Myanmar vote with weak opposition||Voters in Myanmar’s biggest city, Yangon, turned up early Sunday in large numbers to vote in nationwide elections that are expected to return to power the party of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won the last elections in 2015 in a landslide, ending more than five decades of military-dictated rule in the country.With Myanmar under threat from a coronavirus surge, mask wearing was mandatory in the lines at polling stations, and many voters also donned plastic face shields and gloves. Body temperatures were taken and hand sanitizing gel was freely dispensed by officials, but social distancing rules were only fitfully observed.Traditional campaigning ahead of the election was severely limited by social distancing and quarantines in some areas.Also Read: Myanmar elections: What you need to know“The voter turnout here is more than we expected,” said Zaw Win Tun, a neighbourhood administrator and official at Yangon’s Pho Myae polling station. “I think people are excited to vote, as they would like to escape from the political struggles. They want real democracy.” He did not elaborate, but appeared to be referring to a power struggle between Suu Kyi’s civilian government and the military.The ability of Suu Kyi’s administration to run the country has been hamstrung by a clause in the 2008 army-drafted constitution giving the military 25% of the seats in Parliament, allowing it to block constitutional reforms.At another polling station, 19-year-old Eaint Yadanar Oo said she was excited because it was her first time voting.“I came here to vote to perform my civic duty,” she said. She explained that she was afraid of the coronavirus pandemic, but that she “came here with full protection because I want better educational and job opportunities.” More than 90 parties are competing for seats in the lower and upper houses of Parliament, while there were also elections at the state levels. There were more than 37 million people eligible to vote, including 5 million first-timers.With the opposition in disarray, Suu Kyi, who is the nation’s leader with the title of state counsellor, remains Myanmar’s most popular politician. But her government has fallen short of expectations, with economic growth doing little to alleviate widespread poverty and a failure to ease tensions among the country’s fractious ethnic groups.Suu Kyi, 75, cast her ballot late last month in the capital, Naypyitaw, as citizens 60 years of age and over were encouraged to vote in advance, along with those who were forced by the coronavirus to stay away from their home constituencies.Her party’s main challenger, as it was five years ago, was the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, which has led the opposition in Parliament.Also Read: Don’t turn away from Rohingya’s plight, UK urges worldThe Election Commission said it would begin to announce results Monday morning. But it may take up to a week to collect all the votes, some of which will come from remote jungle areas.The election is widely seen as a referendum on Suu Kyi’s leadership.“There is no major party really putting an alternative, a credible alternative, forward,” Yangon-based political analyst Richard Horsey said, explaining part of the reason Suu Kyi’s side has a winning hand in Myanmar’s heartland, where its ethnic Burman majority lives.Even more important for the ruling party’s prospects, he said, is “the personal support, even love, that many people have for Aung San Suu Kyi herself, almost irrespective of how the government administration performs, how the economy performs and so on.” One such fan is 32-year-old voter Mee Mee, a business owner. She said she was excited because in her travels around the country she could see changes and development initiated by Suu Kyi’s government putting the country on the right track.“I like Auntie Suu. She’s good,” said Mee Mee, referring to Suu Kyi by how she is popularly known. “I believe in her and what she’s doing.” The affection for Suu Kyi does not extend to the borderlands, the states occupied by the myriad ethnic minorities who have been seeking greater political autonomy for decades.Suu Kyi’s ambitious plans to reconcile with the minorities have foundered. Their grievances have frequently erupted into armed rebellion, posing major threats to national security.The ethnic political parties in 2015 had cooperated with Suu Kyi’s party to ensure victory against candidates from the Union Solidarity and Development Party. But this year, the ethnic parties, disappointed with her failure to reach a deal to expand their political rights, are supporting only their own candidates.The Union Election Commission caused major controversy when it cancelled voting in some areas where parties critical of the government were certain to win seats. The commission said those areas were dangerous because of insurgencies, but critics said the agency was carrying out the NLD’s bidding. More than 1 million people are estimated to have been disenfranchised.The plight of Myanmar’s Muslim Rohingya ethnic minority — an issue of major concern outside the country — played no real role in the campaign. A brutal 2017 counterinsurgency campaign by Myanmar’s army drove about 740,000 Rohingya to flee across the border to Bangladesh, leading to a World Court investigation of possible genocide.Long-standing prejudice against the Rohingya, whom many consider illegal immigrants from South Asia despite their families having been settled in Myanmar for generations, has deprived most of Myanmar citizenship and basic rights, including voting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aung-san-suu-kyi-s-party-set-to-win-myanmar-vote-with-weak-opposition/story-AesOBy4fp7p7y7mw87SgmN.html
08-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Trump may have been voted out, but Trumpism lives on||It won in the parts of the country and with the voters whom Trump catered to over four years, constantly jabbing the hard edges of almost every contentious cultural issue into Red America, on the bet that fear and anger were a winning hand. It almost was.Joe Biden defeated Trump to win the presidency, and is on pace to win up to 306 electoral votes, a total that would match what Trump exaggerated as a “landslide” four years ago. In a typical election year, such a victory would mean Biden would have carried other Democrats along with him. Instead, several promising Democratic Senate and House candidates, including incumbents, lost.For Trump, the situation was the inverse. His popularity among his base voters helped protect incumbent Republicans but was not enough to save him. He won more votes for president than any other candidate. Except Biden. The rejection of Trump was personal.The election did little to suggest that the country was suddenly less polarized. Trump wrung out votes from areas where he already had a core of support, in rural and small-town America. Biden did the same, only more, in urban and suburban America while also holding down Trump margins in some rural areas. The outcome didn’t change the fact that much of the country is still speaking two different political languages.Full 2020 US Presidential Election Coverage“This defied everyone’s expectations. Everyone said if Joe Biden wins, Democrats win the Senate. If Trump wins, Republicans win the Senate,” said Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago and chief of staff to President Barack Obama. “That’s not what happened. Clearly there was an undertow.“Life is not binary,” Emanuel said. “It’s more complicated. Florida, a state that voted for Trump, voted for the minimum wage. Illinois, a state that voted for Biden, voted down a progressive income tax. California, cobalt blue, voted against affirmative action in the place of employment.”Emanuel said that Democrats may have erred in not offering clearer plans about how they would rebuild the economy while also gaining control over the virus and in not batting back Republican efforts to label them socialists.“Trump played to people’s fatigue about Covid,” he said. “If we had brought the same sense of urgency to getting the economy moving as we did getting Covid under control, it might have been different.”Instead, some Democrats were advocating for expanding the Supreme Court and ending the filibuster in the Senate, proposals that might have prompted fear about one-party control.“It’s clear there was more voter frustration with Trump than with the ideology of the Republican Party,” said Mike Murphy, a strategist to several Republican presidential campaigns who broke with his party over Trump. “Clearly the presidential race was operating in its own world from the congressional race.”Since Trump campaigned largely on friendly turf, he also helped Republican candidates in those areas.“Trump lifted Republican candidates by vastly boosting turnout in areas of Republican strength,” said David Axelrod, former senior adviser Obama. “In the states and districts that favor Republicans, they ran up the score.”Many voters offered a consistent refrain about Trump: They liked his policies but could not abide his anger-fueled personality, his constant use of Twitter as a weapon, and the way he ridiculed anyone who dared disagree with him.Biden’s call for a return to decency, and his appeal to be a president for all Americans and not just the base of his party, was an important part of his formula.But the closeness of the race, even with the president’s persistently low approval ratings, was also a testament to the inherent power of an incumbent seeking re-election. There’s a reason only three elected incumbents before Trump had lost in nearly a century.When an incumbent loses, the challenger’s party often gains. In 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated President Jimmy Carter, Republicans took 12 Senate seats from Democrats. In 1992, Bill Clinton’s victory over President George H.W. Bush also came with three Democratic Senate victories over incumbent Republicans. When Franklin D. Roosevelt defeated President Herbert Hoover in 1932, Democrats gained nearly 100 House seats and a dozen in the Senate, giving Roosevelt the muscular majorities he needed to pass sweeping New Deal legislation.But no president in recent memory had maintained such iron-grip allegiance from his own party as Trump, with only a handful of Republicans in Congress ever willing to cross him, fearing that they were always one presidential tweet away from a primary challenge. They stuck with him during his impeachment, when only Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, voted to convict him, and Trump ostracized him. And several were sticking with him even in defeat, offering up unproven allegations of voter fraud.Some voters liked Trump’s tough talk on trade and getting other nations to pay more for common defense. They gave him credit, right or wrong, for an economy that was buoyant before the pandemic struck. And Trump played to Americans’ fatigue from all the restrictions imposed because of the virus by saying the warnings of his own administration’s top public health officials were overblown.Still, there was a collective limit to how much more of Trump’s always-in-your-face presidency they were willing to take.Not enough, though, to deliver Biden a majority in the Senate, at least not until the outcome of two runoff elections in Georgia in January.But some Democrats also noted that they held most seats in swing states, and that Biden won in some competitive districts. “There are also many districts that Biden flipped from 2016, like my district,” said Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia. She said her margin of victory over the same opponent more than doubled from 2018.“The bottom line on Republicans winning in traditionally Republican-held seats was their unprecedented turnout,” Luria said. “Trump was not able to capitalize on that turnout himself, because his actions and rhetoric over the last four years made him unpalatable to the majority of Americans.”Biden clearly was seen as both a necessary and acceptable alternative. He had no pithy slogan like “Hope and Change” when he was Obama’s running mate in 2008. Rather, he tapped into a national desire to stop the noise, to turn the page from a period so marked by rage and hate inspired from the White House itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-trump-voted-out-but-trumpism-still-alive/story-waAnN8zXSHPGGJd4nStdRK.html

He will return the US to the Paris Accord, remove the travel ban on people from some Muslim-majority countries, resume funding for WHO and reinstate protections for undocumented immigrants brought as children, according to a report in The Washington Post.Murthy, an Indian American, will co-chair the task force with David Kessler, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner and Dr Marcella Nunez-Smith, a Yale University professor. The team will have 12 members.The president-elect spoke briefly about this team in his victory speech Saturday. “On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as Transition Advisors to help take the Biden-Harris Covid plan and convert it into an action blueprint that starts on January 20th, 2021,” he said.“That plan will be built on a bedrock of science. It will be constructed out of compassion, empathy, and concern.”The president-elect gave no further details, but multiple news reports named Murthy as co-chair.Biden ran his presidential campaign on the promise of tacking the epidemic as his top priority and accused Trump of failing to respond adequately to the crisis and not being transparent about its severity. More than 237,000 Americans have been killed and 9 million have been infected and new cases have been surging again.Murthy had been advising Biden for months on Covid-19; once every week, according to some accounts, that gave rise to speculation about a possible berth for the Indian American physician who shot to fame as President Barack Obama’s Surgeon General.He was the 19th Surgeon General of the United States — also called America’s Doctor — from December 15, 2014 to April 21, 2017Many Indian Americans hope to land somewhere in a Biden administration, and there is even a list of names put together of potential appointees by Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Victory Fund, a group of Democrats who promote AAPI candidates and political effort.It gave the list to the Biden transition team chair Ted Kaufman in September. It contained “dozens” of names, including “many Indian Americans”. But the group has been tight-lipped about names and numbers.Every incoming administration is expected to fill some 4.000 federal positions with political appointees, from members of the cabinet to senior positions in state, defence and other departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-taps-vivek-murthy-to-co-chair-covid-19-team-report/story-4yq081iBAfL07wlVIhKwYL.html

08-11-2020||World||Curbing Covid-19 pandemic swiftly was vital in China’s ongoing economic recovery||China’s economy continues to recover from its contraction earlier this year, showing the economic benefits from swift control of the pandemic and a rapid resumption of manufacturing.While Europe and the US face renewed surges of Covid-19 infections, in China factories are capitalizing on a global rush for medical equipment and work-from-home technology. That trend was underlined in trade data released Saturday. Inflation and credit reports for October due this week should also signal stable underlying demand.China’s recovery on the back of successful virus control to date is indicative of the wider picture in Asia Pacific. Taiwan has seen its economy rebound, benefiting from stable domestic demand and buoyant exports to the US and China. South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are all, for now, recovering after seeing infection rates drop.That contrasts with the current outlook in Europe, where the largest economies are locking down once more, and the US, where the case count is hitting records. The UK has already added stimulus to combat this new slump, and both the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have said more is needed.Meanwhile, China is effectively isolated from the rest of the world, with very few options to travel overseas and inbound travel banned or heavily restricted from an increasing number of countries.While that separation is for pandemic control measures, further signs that the global economy is becoming less integrated are emerging. China’s economic plans for the next five years set out a greater focus on the domestic economy.What Bloomberg Economics Say...“China’s data will shed light on the strength of the economy’s recovery at the start of fourth quarter. Credit growth probably slowed sharply, but it would mainly reflect reduced business days due to the golden week holiday, not a sign of weakening momentum.

08-11-2020||World||First time since Covid-19 pandemic, Queen Elizabeth II seen wearing face-mask in public||Queen Elizabeth II donned a face mask in public for the first time during the coronavirus pandemic when attending a brief ceremony at Westminster Abbey last week to mark the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior.While the 94-year-old has been seen in public on several occasions over the past few months, she had not been pictured wearing a face covering until now.On Wednesday, during her first public engagement in London since March, she wore a black mask that was edged with white. Pictures of the ceremony were officially released late Saturday.“It was wonderful to see Her Majesty in such good spirits and good health,” Dr. David Hoyle, the Dean of Westminster, said after the service. “We talked about the centenary and the life of the abbey. This is the place where she was married and she’s conscious of those associations.”The brief service was attended by just the dean and the queen’s equerry, Lieutenant Colonel Nana Kofi Twumasi-Ankrah. The queen left a bouquet of orchids and myrtle, based on her own wedding bouquet from November 1947. She bowed her head after a prayer from the dean.The queen had requested a ceremony take place as the pandemic had derailed plans for the centenary of the interment of the Unknown Warrior.The grave is the final resting place of an unidentified British soldier who died during World War I. His body was brought back from Northern France and buried at Westminster Abbey on Nov. 11, 1920.The ceremony took place a day before a four-week lockdown came into force in England. As well as forcing the closure of an array of businesses, places of worship are having to operate within limits.Face coverings are required by law in certain indoor settings such as on public transport, in shops and places of worship. The British government also recommends they are worn in indoor places where social distancing may be difficult and where people come into contact with those they do not normally meet.Other members of the royal family have been seen regularly wearing face coverings during the pandemic. The queen was criticised for not wearing one last month when she visited the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down in southern England alongside her grandson Prince William.The queen took the opportunity during her rare trip to London to visit Buckingham Palace, her official residence in the capital.Before the U.K. was put into full lockdown on March 23, the queen and her 99-year-old husband, Prince Philip, moved to Windsor Castle, which is around 25 miles (40 kms) west of London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-first-time-queen-elizabeth-ii-seen-wearing-mask-at-tribute-to-unknown-warrior/story-CZjObRTOCMHjYo8L2r3BZP.html
08-11-2020||World||Joe Biden defeats Donald Trump for White House, says ‘time to heal’||Democrat Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump to become the 46th president of the United States on Saturday, positioning himself to lead a nation gripped by a historic pandemic and a confluence of economic and social turmoil.His victory came after more than three days of uncertainty as election officials sorted through a surge of mail-in votes that delayed processing. Biden crossed the winning threshold of 270 Electoral College votes with a win in Pennsylvania.Trump refused to concede, threatening further legal action on ballot counting.Biden, 77, staked his candidacy less on any distinctive political ideology than on galvanizing a broad coalition of voters around the notion that Trump posed an existential threat to American democracy. The strategy proved effective, resulting in pivotal victories in Michigan and Wisconsin as well as Pennsylvania, onetime Democratic bastions that had flipped to Trump in 2016.Biden’s victory was a repudiation of Trump’s divisive leadership and the president-elect now inherits a deeply polarized nation grappling with foundational questions of racial justice and economic fairness while in the grips of a virus that has killed more than 236,000 Americans and reshaped the norms of everyday life.Biden, in a statement, declared it was time for the battered nation “to unite and to heal.”“With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation,” he said. “There’s nothing we can’t do if we do it together.”Biden was on track to win the national popular vote by more than 4 million, a margin that could grow as ballots continue to be counted.Nonetheless, Trump was not giving up.Departing from longstanding democratic tradition and signaling a potentially turbulent transfer of power, he issued a combative statement saying his campaign would take unspecified legal actions. And he followed up with a bombastic, all-caps tweet in which he falsely declared, “I WON THE ELECTION, GOT 71,000,000 LEGAL VOTES.” Twitter immediately flagged it as misleading.Trump has pointed to delays in processing the vote in some states to allege with no evidence that there was fraud and to argue that his rival was trying to seize power — an extraordinary charge by a sitting president trying to sow doubt about a bedrock democratic process.Kamala Harris made history as the first Black woman to become vice president, an achievement that comes as the U.S. faces a reckoning on racial justice. The California senator, who is also the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency, will become the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in government, four years after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton.Trump is the first incumbent president to lose reelection since Republican George H.W. Bush in 1992.He was golfing at his Virginia country club when he lost the race. He stayed out for hours, stopping to congratulate a bride as he left, and his motorcade returned to the White House to a cacophony of shouts, taunts and unfriendly hand gestures.In Wilmington, Delaware, near a stage that has stood empty since it was erected to celebrate on Election Night, people cheered and pumped their fists as the news that the presidential race had been called for the state’s former senator arrived on their cellphones.On the nearby water, two men in a kayak yelled to a couple paddling by in the opposite direction, “Joe won! They called it!” as people on the shore whooped and hollered. Harris, in workout gear, was shown on video speaking to Biden on the phone, exuberantly telling the president-elect “We did it!” Biden was expected to take the stage for a drive-in rally after dark.Across the country, there were parties and prayer. In New York City, spontaneous block parties broke out. People ran out of their buildings, banging on pots. They danced and high-fived with strangers amid honking horns. Among the loudest cheers were those for passing U.S. Postal Service trucks.People streamed into Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, near where Trump had ordered the clearing of protesters in June, waving signs and taking cellphone pictures. In Lansing, Michigan, Trump supporters and Black Lives Matter demonstrators filled the Capitol steps. The lyrics to “Amazing Grace” began to echo through the crowd, and Trump supporters laid their hands on a counter protester, and prayed.Americans showed deep interest in the presidential race. A record 103 million voted early this year, opting to avoid waiting in long lines at polling locations during a pandemic. With counting continuing in some states, Biden had already received more than 74 million votes, more than any presidential candidate before him.Trump’s refusal to concede has no legal implications. But it could add to the incoming administration’s challenge of bringing the country together after a bitter election.Throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, arguing without evidence that the election could be marred by fraud. The nation has a long history of presidential candidates peacefully accepting the outcome of elections, dating back to 1800, when John Adams conceded to his rival Thomas Jefferson.It was Biden’s native Pennsylvania that put him over the top, the state he invoked throughout the campaign to connect with working class voters. He also won Nevada on Saturday pushing his total to 290 Electoral College votes.Biden received congratulations from dozens of world leaders, and his former boss, President Barack Obama, saluted him in a statement, declaring the nation was “fortunate that Joe’s got what it takes to be President and already carries himself that way.”Republicans on Capitol Hill were giving Trump and his campaign space to consider all their legal options. It was a precarious balance for Trump’s allies as they try to be supportive of the president -- and avoid risking further fallout -- but face the reality of the vote count.On Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had not yet made any public statements -- either congratulating Biden or joining Trump’s complaints. But retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is close to McConnell, said, “After counting every valid vote and allowing courts to resolve disputes, it is important to respect and promptly accept the result.”More than 236,000 Americans have died during the coronavirus pandemic, nearly 10 million have been infected and millions of jobs have been lost. The final days of the campaign played out against a surge in confirmed cases in nearly every state, including battlegrounds such as Wisconsin that swung to Biden.The pandemic will soon be Biden’s to tame, and he campaigned pledging a big government response, akin to what Franklin D. Roosevelt oversaw with the New Deal during the Depression of the 1930s. But Senate Republicans fought back several Democratic challengers and looked to retain a fragile majority that could serve as a check on such Biden ambition.The 2020 campaign was a referendum on Trump’s handling of the pandemic, which has shuttered schools across the nation, disrupted businesses and raised questions about the feasibility of family gatherings heading into the holidays.The fast spread of the coronavirus transformed political rallies from standard campaign fare to gatherings that were potential public health emergencies. It also contributed to an unprecedented shift to voting early and by mail and prompted Biden to dramatically scale back his travel and events to comply with restrictions. The president defied calls for caution and ultimately contracted the disease himself.Trump was saddled throughout the year by negative assessments from the public of his handling of the pandemic. There was another COVID-19 outbreak in the White House this week, which sickened his chief of staff Mark Meadows.Biden also drew a sharp contrast to Trump through a summer of unrest over the police killings of Black Americans including Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minneapolis. Their deaths sparked the largest racial protest movement since the civil rights era. Biden responded by acknowledging the racism that pervades American life, while Trump emphasized his support of police and pivoted to a “law and order” message that resonated with his largely white base.The third president to be impeached, though acquitted in the Senate, Trump will leave office having left an indelible imprint in a tenure defined by the shattering of White House norms and a day-to-day whirlwind of turnover, partisan divide and Twitter blasts.Trump’s team has filed a smattering of lawsuits in battleground states, some of which were immediately rebuffed by judges. His personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was holding a news conference in Philadelphia threatening more legal action when the race was called.Biden, born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and raised in Delaware, was one of the youngest candidates ever elected to the Senate. Before he took office, his wife and daughter were killed, and his two sons badly injured in a 1972 car crash.Commuting every night on a train from Washington back to Wilmington, Biden fashioned an everyman political persona to go along with powerful Senate positions, including chairman of the Senate Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees. Some aspects of his record drew critical scrutiny from fellow Democrats, including his support for the 1994 crime bill, his vote for the 2003 Iraq War and his management of the Clarence Thomas’ Supreme Court hearings.Biden’s 1988 presidential campaign was done in by plagiarism allegations, and his next bid in 2008 ended quietly. But later that year, he was tapped to be Barack Obama’s running mate and he became an influential vice president, steering the administration’s outreach to both Capitol Hill and Iraq.While his reputation was burnished by his time in office and his deep friendship with Obama, Biden stood aside for Clinton and opted not to run in 2016 after his adult son Beau died of brain cancer the year before.Trump’s tenure pushed Biden to make one more run as he declared that “the very soul of the nation is at stake.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-defeats-donald-trump-for-white-house-says-time-to-heal/story-K9eE2opunKdotCSyDsTjZJ.html
08-11-2020||World||Not a good loser: Trump vows a long court fight||Moments after news channels called the results of the US Presidential elections in favour of Joe Biden, Donald Trump said in a statement from his campaign: “Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated.”Trump’ s missive against mail-in and provisional ballots continued over Twitter on Saturday as he wrote: “Tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8pm on Tuesday, Election Day...changing the results in Pennsylvania and certain other razor thin states...” The social media company flagged these tweets for being “disputed” and possibly “misleading”. Since November 4 midnight when Trump prematurely declared himself victorious, his campaign has mounted legal challenges in states as Michigan, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. On Friday, his campaign issued a statement: “This is about the integrity of our entire election process. We will pursue this process through every aspect of the law to guarantee the American people have confidence in our government.” David Bossie, who served as deputy campaign manger for President Donald Trump in 2016, spearheads the legal effort. Other members of the legal team include former New York City Mayo Rudy Giuliani, Jay Sekulow and Pam Biondi from his impeachment defense team, son Eric Trump and former acting director of national intelligence Richard Grenell. A Supreme Court judge issued an order that late-arriving ballots in Pennsylvania be separated by all county boards pending further orders of the high court. State officials have said they were already keeping those ballot apart, but Republicans had argued they were not convinced if all counties were doing it uniformly. A state judge granted the Trump campaign’s request to observe Philadelphia poll workers as they process the remaining mail-in ballots. However, the judge denied halting the count after a deal was struck to have 60 observers of each party observe the process. Later, the Trump campaign filed a federal lawsuit intending to stop the Philadelphia vote count. This request was ultimately denied. In Nevada, a lawsuit was filed alleging that ineligible votes were cast in the Las Vegas area. Lawsuits filed in Michigan and Georgia over the electoral process were dismissed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-a-good-loser-trump-vows-a-long-court-fight/story-Q0FkGQKqo3b43FVLl5EZYN.html
08-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Kamala Harris gives America a Second Family full of firsts||Kamala Harris’s husband Doug Emhoff on Saturday tweeted a picture of them hugging, a photo taken soon after she was projected as vice-president-elect of the US, with the words: “So proud of you”.Harris was jogging when the news broke, and tweeted a video of a call with her boss, Joe Biden, “We did it, we did it Joe! You’re going to be the next President of the United States!”Harris is a first in a number of ways: the first woman, the first Black person and the first Indian-American to serve the second highest office in the US.Her husband will make history, too. He will be the first man and first Jewish person to serve as a spouse to a president or vice president. Harris is Baptist.And everyone from political strategists to racial justice activists are waiting to see whether those firsts will be mere symbolic wins or the beginning of a sea change on gender and race relations and the launch of an enduring Democratic coalition.The symbolism alone is important. Strategists say Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party. They vote in large numbers, help staff its volunteer efforts and power its wins in key races, but they have not always been well-represented among its candidates or in its policy decisions.In an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes” last month, Harris vowed that she would bring her diverse perspective to the Biden administration. “What I will do, and I promise you this — and this is what Joe wants me to do, this was part of our deal — I will always share with him my lived experience as it relates to any issue that we confront,” she said. “And I promised Joe that I will give him that perspective and always be honest with him.”That experience includes being the daughter of an Indian immigrant and a Jamaican-born father. She was raised biracial and interfaith. She is a Christian, but also attended Hindu temples with her mother.That side of Harris’s background could help galvanise Asian-American voters, the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in the US and one both Democrats and Republicans have tried to woo. That experience also means being the first graduate of a historically Black college in such a high office. Harris attended Howard University in Washington and is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nation’s oldest Black sorority. Members have turned up at her events and been active donors, many giving $19.08 to note the year the group was founded.Harris, 56, has not shied away from using her background as a touchstone for outreach. She attended virtual campaign events with South Asian celebrities such as actress Mindy Kaling, comedian Aasif Mandvi and former US attorney and Trump antagonist Preet Bharara.And she had a starring role in Biden campaign ads targeting both Black and Asian-American voters, including one that featured words in Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tamil, Hindi and Filipino.Cheryl Hori, founder of Democratic consulting firm Pacific Campaign House, said, “This will be historic for Asian-Americans, full stop.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-kamala-harris-gives-america-a-second-family-full-of-firsts/story-gY7yhvcQBicRuopqdzcaUK.html
08-11-2020||World||A president who changed the party: Trump stamp on GOP will last long||President Donald Trump’s claims of opponents who are “trying to steal the elections” have led even US news channels to censor him. Most mainstream Republican leaders have declined to either support or criticise him, preferring to speak blandly about the need to honour the electoral process. This has drawn the ire of his son, Don Trump Jr, who accused party leaders of “sitting on the sidelines.” One of the targets: Nikki Haley, the Indian-American seen as a Republican presidential hopeful. She has carefully praised Trump’s leadership but stopped there. An angry Republican tweeted, “Nikki Haley is doing what?” eliciting praise from Trump’s son. One congressman accused Haley of “eulogizing” when others were “fighting” for the president. Haley’s dilemma is shared by all moderate Republicans when faced with Trump’s reckless language. Only those confident of local support or near retirement, like Senators Susan Collins and Pat Toomey, have openly refuted Trump. Trump, admitted the New York Times, “will remain a hero” for the Republican electorate. As far as his base is concerned, he has again defied the establishment they despise. Pollsters, including of his own party, had predicted a landslide for Joe Biden. Instead, Trump clawed back seats in the lower house and may retain his Senate majority. His share of the popular vote rose two percentage points. Though accused of being a racist, Trump won more minority votes than any Republican candidate in 60 years. When asked what he would do if defeated, the president used to half-jokingly say he would run in 2024. After his electoral performance, Trump’s aura with the US working class has only grown. The Republican Party was always a chimera: a pro-business head grafted on to a working-class body. Trump seized the base of the party, argued its leadership was no different from the liberal establishment, and tossed out tenets of rightwing ideology like free trade and fiscal sobriety. Trump used his popularity with the faithful to bring the party leadership to its knees. Many Republican leaders quietly prayed for a sweeping Biden victory. “A cleansing landslide,” wrote National Review editor Rich Lowry of their hopes, so that “every trace of Trump and his enablers would be erased from the Republican Party” — except that didn’t happen. Instead, the middle-class intellectuals and businessmen who crafted the party’s rightwing ideology are likely to be pushed further to the margins. In his first term, Trump depended on members of the Republican mainstream to staff his government. While he had his way on trade and the fiscal deficit, he went along with them on regulations and taxes. If he has a second term, the party fears he will move to impose his 19th century nativism in other areas such as ending the US’s overseas alliances and close down migration. Triumphant Trumpism will be a bane for a President Biden. Biden had hoped to work with mainstream Republicans and resurrect bipartisanship in Washington. After these poll results, Republican leaders will avoid shaking his hand and instead join Trump’s plans to wage a four-year guerrilla war against the new administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-president-who-changed-the-party-trump-stamp-on-gop-will-last-long/story-0ODXpmlTcZykqnMDQwCz0I.html
08-11-2020||World||US Election 2020: Yes, he can too||Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, was on Saturday elected the 46th President of the United States, beating Donald Trump in a bitterly contested fight, and Kamala Harris made history by becoming the first woman, the first person of Indian descent and the first Black person elected to the office of the Vice President.Biden, 78, won the 2020 White House race after he was projected to win Pennsylvania, the tipping-point state whose 20 electoral college votes carried the Democrat well past the 270-vote. He also clinched Nevada on Saturday afternoon, shortly after he won the presidency by taking Pennsylvania, increasing his tally from 264 to 290.Donald Trump, whose tally stood at 214 (the figure may change), will be the first one-term US President in 30 years. He was on his golf course when Biden was declared winner.“I am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice President-elect Harris. In the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America,” President-elect Biden said in a statement, adding: “With the campaign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation. It’s time for America to unite. And to heal. We are the United States of America. And there’s nothing we can’t do, if we do it together.”Biden’s victory came after more than three days of uncertainty as election officials went through mail-in votes that delayed the processing of some ballots. Biden was the Vice President during President Barack Obama’s two terms. Obama, whose campaign during his presidential election pivoted on the slogan “Yes, We Can”, endorsed Biden and his running mate Harris for the 2020 race.Vice President-elect Harris said she and President-elect Biden have a lot of work to do. “This election is about so much more than Joe Biden or me. It’s about the soul of America and our willingness to fight for it. We have a lot of work ahead of us.”US President Trump indicated it was not over from his end. In a statement issued just after the race was called for Biden, he said: “We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be exposed. The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor. In Pennsylvania, for example, our legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process. Legal votes decide who is president, not the news media.”“Beginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. The American People are entitled to an honest election: that means counting all legal ballots, and not counting any illegal ballots. This is the only way to ensure the public has full confidence in our election...”The US President has put together a legal team to shepherd the challenges, hoping, perhaps, for a repeat of the 2000 recount which gave George W Bush his first term as President. The Trump campaign has called for donations to fund the legal fight. “This Election Isn’t Over,” it has said in texts and mail to supporters. “The President needs YOUR HELP! We can’t allow the Left-wing MOB to undermine our Election. President Trump needs his fiercest and most loyal defenders, like YOU, to step up and FIGHT BACK!” But the President’s aides and allies in the Republican Party are also reportedly trying to prepare him for conceding, while arguing for his right to seek a recount of votes and sue to correct irregularities. “Mr. Trump’s legacy will be diminished greatly if his final act is a bitter refusal to accept a legitimate defeat,” The Wall Street Journal, a conservative media giant, wrote in an editorial on Saturday. Biden was at home in Wilmington when news broke of his victory. It was not immediately known if Trump planned to call Biden, as has been the practice, but he has demanded recounts in two states and has filed several lawsuits challenging the counting process, and has alleged fraud and irregularities.Biden has indicated he is ready to move on and said in a speech on Friday he had gone to work already, getting updates and briefings on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.Biden had continued to increase his lead over Trump in Pennsylvania when counting resumed Saturday morning. He was also building on his lead in Georgia (16 electoral college votes), which is headed for a recount as requested by Trump, and in Nevada (6). He is also ahead in Arizona, whose 11 electoral college votes have already been given to him by some news organisations, but the President has been chipping away at his lead. Trump leads in North Carolina (15) and Alaska (3). “My fellow Americans, we don’t have a final declaration of victory yet, but the numbers tell a clear and convincing story: We are going to win this race,” the former Vice President had said in a speech from his hometown Wilmington, Delaware, late on Friday, with Kamala Harris, his vice presidential nominee by his side.“But while we’re waiting for the final results, I want people to know we are not waiting to get to work,” he added. Biden, who ran on the promise of tackling the pandemic as his top priority, said he and Harris on Thursday met a group of experts on the crisis and its impact on the economy. He went on to reiterate his promise to begin tackling the crisis from the first day in office.Celebrations began as news of Biden’s win broke. “It’s a new day in America. We can now put the rancor and the frenzy of electioneering behind us and move to governing,” said Shekar Narasimhan of AAPI fund in a statement, adding: “Biden and Harris have won a hard-fought election with States across the country and a record number of votes cast for them. As the first African American and Indian American to be the Vice President-elect, Kamala Harris has a special place in our hearts and we wish her the very best and offer her our full support. We pray for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to be successful in healing and uniting the country.” MR Rangaswamy, the founder of Indiaspora, a bipartisan body, said: “At Indiaspora, we believe, like President-elect Biden does, that the core principles shared by America and India as democracies will continue to be a source of strength in the bilateral relationship between the two nations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-yes-he-can-too/story-4QjlUUNyOfVVBu2dCzVjRL.html
08-11-2020||World||Poll says China’s increase in exports driven by global economic recovery||China’s foreign trade is expected to have grown quite strongly in October due to a recovery in global markets and the domestic economy, a Reuters poll showed, but there are fears that the coronavirus upsurge overseas could slow trade in coming months.In October, exports are expected to have risen 9.3% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 20 economists, down slightly from the 9.9% gain in September.Imports likely rose 9.5% on year, which economists regarded as a solid increase though it would be slower than in September, when imports rebounded 13.2%.China’s trade surplus is expected to have widened to $46 billion in October from $37 billion in September, according to the poll.The forecasts could suggest the recovery in the world’s second-largest economy from the initial impact of the coronavirus pandemic remains intact.China’s economy is expected to expand around 2% this year - the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies as it emerged faster from the coronavirus crisis, having been the first country to be hit by the pandemic.The upward momentum was also evident in China’s official manufacturing survey for October, as the new export orders sub-index expanded at a quicker pace.Analysts at Nomura said in a research note that a pause in the re-opening of some overseas economies due to a resurgence of Covid-19 cases, and a high base last year would have weighed on October’s import growth. They also expected less growth in crude oil imports.Some analysts also noted there were fewer working days last month compared with same period last year due to the long national holiday, which might lead to a slightly softer reading.And they said China’s trade performance could suffer over the next few months as stringent virus control measures are re-imposed by trade partners due to recent resurgence of Covid-19 infections in Europe and the United States.Some companies reported that second wave in infections abroad had lengthened procurement periods for imports of raw materials and increased transport costs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poll-says-china-s-increase-in-exports-driven-by-global-economic-recovery/story-ejjlaJo2JmwW5ahQnapByK.html
08-11-2020||India||IIT study cites risk of plastic contamination in drinking tea from disposable paper cups||Disposable paper cups are not safe for drinking tea and a person drinking three cups of tea in them will end up ingesting 75,000 tiny microplastic particles, a study by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur, has found.According to Sudha Goel, Associate Professor at IIT Kharagpur, who led the research, disposable paper cups are a popular choice for consuming beverages. “Our research has confirmed contamination of the hot liquid served in paper cups due to the degradation of microplastics and other hazardous components from the lining material of the cup. Paper cups are usually lined by a thin layer of hydrophobic film which is made of mostly plastic (polyethylene) and sometimes co-polymers to hold the liquid in the paper cup. Within 15 minutes this microplastic layer degrades as a reaction to hot water, “ she said. “According to our study, 25,000 micron-sized (10 µm to 1000 µm) microplastic particles are released into 100 mL of hot liquid (85 – 90 degrees C) residing in the paper cups for 15 minutes. Thus, an average person drinking 3 regular cups of tea or coffee daily, in a paper cup, would be ingesting 75,000 tiny microplastic particles which are invisible to the human eye,” she added. The researchers followed two different procedures - in the first process, hot ultrapure (MilliQ) water (85–90 degrees C) was poured into the disposable paper cups, and it was allowed to sit for 15 minutes. Goel, explained that the homogeneously mixed water was then analysed for the presence of microplastics as well as additional ions that may have leached into the liquid from the paper cups. In the second process, paper cups were initially dipped in lukewarm (30–40 °C) MilliQ water. “Thereafter the hydrophobic film was carefully separated from the paper layer and exposed to hot MilliQ water (85–90 degrees Celsius) for 15 minutes. Changes in the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the plastic films were examined before and after exposure to hot water. “These microplastics can act as carriers for contaminants like ions, toxic heavy metals such as Palladium, Chromium, and Cadmium, and organic compounds that are similarly hydrophobic in nature thus allowing them to conveniently cross over to the animal kingdom. When ingested, the health implications could be serious,” she said. Research scholars Ved Prakash Ranjan and Anuja Joseph studying Environmental Engineering and Management, assisted Goel in the research. Virendra K Tewari, Director, IIT Kharagpur said, “This study shows that careful consideration needs to be done before the promotion of replacements for bio-hazardous products and environmental pollutants. We have been quick to replace plastic cups and glasses with disposable paper cups”. “While the need was crucial we have to find eco-friendly products. India has traditionally been a country promoting a sustainable lifestyle and may be it is time that we look into our roots for corrective measures,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-study-cites-risk-of-plastic-contamination-in-drinking-tea-from-disposable-paper-cups/story-AsVSNGipDNpLPGIU8VJGQK.html

Badal condemned the Centre for not resuming freight trains despite farmers “clearing” all rail tracks. It is wrong to treat farmers agitating against the central agri-marketing acts as “enemies”, he told reporters. Read also: After quitting alliance, SAD eyes BJP’s voter base in LudhianaBadal said the Centre should not make the train services a “prestige” issue.“Farmers held a ‘rail roko’ agitation to press for the repeal of the laws. They have vacated the rail tracks for more than a week. However, the central government is not restarting trains on one flimsy excuse or the other. Such conduct is not advisable in a democracy,” he said. Badal criticised Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for doing “nothing” to resolve the crisis, except holding an hour long-protest in Delhi “solely for the benefit of the cameras”. He said the CM should tell Punjabis why he failed to meet either the railway minister or seek time from the prime minister to pressure the Union government for the resumption of freight trains. On future alliances of the party after parting ways with the BJP, the SAD chief said they are strengthening the party in all 117 constituencies in the state. On the occasion, former Tarn Taran BJP president RPS Maini joined the Shiromani Akali Dal.Maini, an advocate by profession, had joined the BJP in 2002. He had remained its Tarn Taran district president from 2009 to 2014 and the party spokesperson for the state unit till 2017.Maini said he resigned from the BJP in protest against the party’s refusal to repeal the recently enacted farm laws and its “discriminatory” attitude towards Punjabi language in Jammu and Kashmir.Badal welcomed Maini to the SAD fold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wrong-to-treat-protesting-farmers-as-enemies-sad-s-sukhbir-singh-badal-slams-centre/story-6phGOZH7pt7P4cJ6i3JKZM.html

The Congress came out in support of Computer Baba and alleged that the demolition was a vindictive act of the BJP-led state government.Police sent the Baba and five others to the Indore Central jail. The ashram was constructed on two acres government land in Gommatagiri area of Indore district. Indore, Hatod tehsil, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Shashwat Sharma said, “Computer Baba had encroached upon a part of 46 acres land which was reserved for construction of cow shelter. The ashram was constructed illegally. We were receiving so many complaints related to illegal construction of the ashram. The administration served a notice to Computer Baba two months ago but he didn’t reply.” Indore, deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, HN Mishra said, “Computer Baba and his supporters were trying to create hurdles during the demolition drive so they were arrested under preventive action.” A local Congress MLA Vishal Patel said, “The ashram has a temple which was constructed by the community people. If the administration tries to demolish the temple, people will stage protest.” Former Congress chief minister Digvijaya Singh called it “revenge politics”.“It is the height of revenge politics. The demolition of ashram of Computer Baba took place without any notice.” Singh said he will go to the Indore central jail to meet Baba. BJP state president VD Sharma said, “Do Congress leaders support encroachment on government land? It was the government land allotted for cow shelter but Computer Baba encroached upon it and was running his ashram. It’s a job of administration to clear the encroachment but Congress leaders are unnecessarily dragging politics in it.” Computer Baba hit headlines first time in 2018 when he was accorded minister of state status by the then BJP government after he threatened to expose the alleged scam of the then BJP government in plantation work on the banks of the Narmada during Narmada Sewa Yatra. He was also appointed as chairman of Nadi Nyas by the previous Congress-led state government in 2019.

The states aren’t getting their due under the GST, which is a betrayal by the government of India and unjustified in a federal system,” Gehlot said, addressing a virtual press conference. “Demonetisation was a dangerous decision, implemented in a dangerous manner. This is the way of the PM, be it demonetisation or GST. Farm bills were introduced without consulting farmers, states or taking public opinion, which is fascistic,” he told reporters, while observing the fourth anniversary of demonetisation as “Vishwasghaat Diwas” (Betrayal Day). “That is why we say that democracy is in danger and we are observing today as the Betrayal Day,” he said. Gehlot questioned if the demonetisation exercise had achieved its intended objective.“You should inform the country whether money from Swiss banks was brought back, black money, terrorism and Naxalism were eliminated in the last four years after demonetisation,” Gehlot said, adding that RBI has said that 99.3% of the money has returned to the banks. “The Prime Minister is required to issue a white paper to inform people about the impact of demonetisation, GST and rectify the mistakes done. People of the country are worried where the economy is headed to,” Gehlot said in a stinging attack. Also Read: DeMo anniversary: PM Modi hails move, Congress observes betrayal dayHe alleged that in the last four years, farmers, labourers, small traders were destroyed and the rural economy collapsed. Calling electoral bonds a scam, he said bonds were brought to favour a party and should be abolished. Gehlot said, “Rs 20 lakh crore package announced by the Centre as relief during the Covid-19 crisis did not prove to be of any use.” On the ongoing Gujjar agitation, the CM said that a majority of their demands have been met, but despite that some people’s act of sitting on railway tracks is not in the interest of the community. “The government will do justice with the demands but sitting on tracks in the name of demands is unjustified,” said Gehlot BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the Congress has a habit of needlessly questioning Centre’s decisions. “Entire world is affected by the coronavirus and the Centre is constantly working in the interest of poor, labourers and farmers, which is resulting in strengthening of the economy,” he said. “In the last one month, the Centre has received record GST revenue; the economy is improving and the production is increasing. The Congress is just making baseless allegations, which public time and again has rejected,” Pareek said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bring-out-white-paper-on-demonetisation-gst-gehlot-tells-pm/story-mViB0WvJWOZMHJlP74DuYO.html

Harris traces a part of her ancestral roots to India. People began celebrating her victory by distributing sweets and bursting crackers in Thulasendrapuram, a village in the Tiruvarur district of Tamil Nadu where Kamala Harris’ maternal grandfather was born. They congratulated Harris by drawing colourful rangoli in front of their homes. “Her win also motivates the boys and girls in our village,” says Arulmozhi Sudhakar, a local village head of Thulasendhirapuram, Painganadu. “Now I’m able to show my 11-year-old son how much he can achieve even from our village.” The Dharmasastha Temple in the village has been conducting special poojas since August when Joe Biden announced Harris as his running mate. In 2014, her aunt (Dr Sarala Gopalan, who lives in Chennai) donated Rs 5,000 to the temple in the name of Kamala Harris. Tamil Nadu politicians spotlighted Harris’ Tamil heritage as her mother Shyamala Gopalan was born in Chennai. Harris’ mother later moved to the US. Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami tweeted that Harris’ victory made Tamil Nadu proud. DMK leader MK Stalin congratulated Harris by tweeting that he was “especially pleased” that Americans chose “a woman with Tamil heritage as their vice-president”. Harris has often recalled visiting the seaside neighbourhood of Besant Nagar in Chennai. Harris’ Indian family, which includes her aunt Gopalan and her uncle G Balachandran, who lives in Delhi are making plans to attend her swearing-in ceremony in January 2021. They were also present during her swearing in as California Senator in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamala-harris-ancestral-village-celebrates-her-win-with-crackers-rangoli/story-UkKmP55i8bZs1rhI7MBs7N.html

08-11-2020||India||Gupkar alliance ready to listen to all including BJP on Article 370, says Omar||National Conference vice president and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah has said that the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) was willing to listen to all divergent views including that of the BJP, on the issue of Articles 370 and 35-A. Abdullah made the comments while expressing regret over Panthers Party founder Prof Bhim Singh’s sacking from his own party after the latter attended PAGD meeting at Bhatindi residence of Dr Farooq Abdullah on Saturday. “I regret his sacking. We never said that we would meet only those who endorse our stand. We were ready to meet anyone. Even if BJP had come, we would have met them too and had they said that they do not accept our stand of restoring Articles 370 and 35-A, we would have listened to them as well,” he said. Omar’s comments on Sunday came during a short visit to Kalakote in Rajouri to express his condolences to the family of party leader Thakur Rachpal Singh, who passed away on September 7. Omar clarified that Bhim Singh’s decision to meet the PAGD didn’t mean Singh agreed with their position on the contentious issues like revocation of Article 370 and 35-A.“We never said that we would listen to only those who toe our line. And, Prof Bhim Singh also pointed out to us that he doesn’t endorse 35-A and also wants amendments in Article 370 before it could be accepted. Therefore, I don’t think that Prof Bhim Singh said anything wrong, which formed the basis of his sacking. Since they have expelled him, what can we say now? It is their internal matter,” he added. The veteran leader was expelled by party chairman Harsh Dev Singh on Saturday after he attended the PAGD meet at Farooq’s residence. Omar informed that the PAGD met 26 delegations representing different thoughts and ideologies on Saturday.

Our Gupkar agenda is a unified agenda and we will jointly contest the DDC polls,” he said. When asked if the Gupkar alliance of seven political parties will also jointly contest assembly polls as and when they are announced, Omar termed it a hypothetical query. “As of now, there is no possibility of assembly elections. Had there been no delimitation commission announced then I would have anticipated early polls. The panel is yet to start its work on the ground, which has been delayed due to corona. It has to visit areas, meet delegations, seek suggestions from stakeholders before making a report and present it to the authorities concerned. I don’t think that in the next one to two years Assembly polls can be held,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gupkar-alliance-ready-to-listen-to-all-including-bjp-on-article-370-says-omar/story-ydbF2nENKnApNBMXDwRWDP.html

But, at the end of day, irrespective of the medium, it’s all about acting. So, be it for any platform I just enjoy acting,” said ‘Virgin Bhasskar2’ and ‘Meri Hanikarak Biwi’ actor. Comparing both the platform she says, “If I can sum it up it will be like web has limited episodes while on television, we have scope to add the characters and expand the length of the show. Then on TV we are working literally the entire month. Though content on TV too is undergoing a change and new kind of shows are being made. But still, there are a very few shows which have over the top melodrama but then the fact is there is an audience for it too.” Jia has also done shows like ‘Love by Chance’, Gumrah-4 and ‘Queens Hain Hum’. The actor learnt Haryanvi for her upcoming show where she plays a barber and she also learnt the art of using scissors with conviction. “I’m very excited about ‘Kaante Lal & Sons’ as its very exciting show. I understand that young generation is more into watching OTT series and films but this is so entertaining and refreshing that everyone will like to watch it. It’s inspired with a real story and is a full package of emotions, drama and comedy,” Jia said. About shooting in Covid conditions she said, “We are just getting used to the new normal. It’s tough to wear make-up and shoot. We also keep our masks on and take if off only while facing the camera. There is no option but to adapt to the situation and be safe.” Talking about her early days, the actor said, “I have been really lucky that my mother pushed me towards acting as I was a very shy kid otherwise. With support of parents my journey actually became easy!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ott-or-tv-jiya-is-just-lovin-it/story-QMJpoaHIEYGfuuDg8j7bnN.html

It has been made possible as the GST infra has been upgraded to handle up to three lakh concurrent logged-in users at a time,” according to an official statement. The gateway’s capacity was increased from 1.5 lakh to 3 lakh concurrent logged in taxpayers in preparation of the expected surge in the indirect tax-related activities on the portal after easing of lockdown in June 2020.If needed, the GSTN can even handle and scale up to five lakh concurrently logged in taxpayers. “The GST eco-system is future-ready to offer a seamless experience to the taxpayers with its augmented capacity even beyond the current load limits. Taking the surge during the peak filing into consideration, GSTN also took on the performance and stress testing of GST System applications that helped identify and remove bottlenecks in the software,” the official statement further said.According to the news agency ANI, GSTN data shows a sudden jump in the filing of GSTR-3B, the monthly return filed by the normal taxpayers, in September 2020. Also, the number of active taxpayer numbers has doubled since the launch of GST at approximately 1.3 crore. “This surge was due to the backlog in the filing of previous months’ returns for which relaxations were provided to the taxpayers in view of the Covid-19 outbreak,” the official statement said.(with ANI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-portal-scaled-up-to-handle-3-lakh-taxpayers-concurrently/story-Yek3qoAQ6DbwWKmk52gTwN.html

The company has filed a police complaint in this regard with Cyber Crime Cell in Bengaluru and is verifying claims made by cyber experts. Cyble said that a hacker has put data allegedly belonging to Bigbasket on sale for around Rs 30 lakh. “In the course of our routine dark web monitoring, the research team at Cyble found the database of Big Basket for sale in a cyber crime market, being sold for over USD 40,000. The leak contains a database portion; with the table name ‘member_member’. The size of the SQL file is about 15 GB, containing close to 20 million user data,” Cyble said in its blog. It added the data put on sale includes names, email IDs, password hashes, contact numbers (mobile and phone), addresses, date of birth, location, and IP addresses of login among many others. While Cyble has mentioned “passwords”, the company uses a one-time password sent through SMS which keeps on changing every time a user logs in. “A few days ago, we learnt about a potential data breach at Bigbasket and are evaluating the extent of the breach and authenticity of the claim in consultation with cybersecurity experts and finding immediate ways to contain it. We have also lodged a complaint with the Cyber Crime Cell in Bengaluru and intend to pursue this vigorously to bring the culprits to book,” Bigbasket said in a statement. The company said that the privacy and confidentiality of customers is priority and it does not store any financial data including credit card numbers etc and is confident that this financial data is secure. “The only customer data that we maintain are email IDs, phone numbers, order details, and addresses so these are the details that could potentially have been accessed. We have a robust information security framework that employs best-in-class resources and technologies to manage our information. We will continue to proactively engage with best-in-class information security experts to strengthen this further,” Bigbasket said. The Bengaluru-based company is funded by Alibaba Group, Mirae Asset-Naver Asia Growth Fund, and the UK government-owned CDC group. Cyble claimed that the breach occurred on October 30, 2020 and it has already informed the management of Bigbasket about it. The cyber intelligence firm said on October 31, Cyble validated the breach through “validation of the leaked data with BigBasket users/information”, and on November 1, “Cyble disclosed the breach to Bigbasket management”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bigbasket-faces-potential-data-breach-details-of-2-crore-users-put-on-sale-on-dark-web/story-UibH5KMcvsr0Ywgjy2Y09L.html
08-11-2020||India||DeMo anniversary: PM Modi hails move, Congress observes betrayal day||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hailed his government’s demonetisation move four years ago, claiming that it gave a boost to transparency. In a tweet on Sunday, Modi said that the move helped reduce black money, increase tax compliance and formalisation and gave a boost to transparency and that the outcomes have been beneficial for the country’s progress.In graphics accompanying the tweet, the Prime Minister pointed out that India had turned into a lesser cash-based economy with better tax compliance. He said self-assessment tax of more than Rs 13,000 crore was paid by targeted non-filers and 3.04 lakh persons who deposited cash of Rs 10 lakh or more but had not filed their income tax returns were identified. He also claimed that the demonetisation helped improve India’s tax/GDP ratio. Demonetisation has helped reduce black money, increase tax compliance and formalization and given a boost to transparency. These outcomes have been greatly beneficial towards national progress. #DeMolishingCorruption pic.twitter.com/A8alwQj45ROn November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Modi announced the decision to ban all currency notes of higher denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 from midnight. Long queues were witnessed outside ATMs for several days after that, as people tried to get new banknotes in hand. Most of the old notes in circulation were deposited with banks. The move came in for criticism from several quarters, and the opposition claimed it had harmed the economy.The Congress observed the fourth anniversary of demonetisation as “Vikshwasghaat Diwas” (betrayal day) as it ran a social media campaign ‘SpeakUpAgainstDeMoDisaster’ and slammed the government alleging that it has continuously changed the explanatory reasons for carrying out the measure four years ago. Demonetisation has “destroyed” the economy, it added.Congress general secretary Ajay Maken at a media briefing quoted former prime minister Manmohan Singh’s remarks on November 24, 2016, to hit out at the government. “The way this scheme has been implemented -- is a monumental management failure, and in fact, it is a case of organised loot, legalised plunder of the common people,” Maken said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Modi’s move four years ago was aimed at helping a few of his “crony capitalist friends” and had “destroyed” the Indian economy. In a video released as part of the party’s online ‘SpeakUpAgainstDeMoDisaster’ campaign, Gandhi said the question is how the economy of Bangladesh “surpassed” the Indian economy as there was a time when India used to be one of the most high performing economies of the world. “The government says that the reason is Covid but if that is the reason, there is Covid in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world also. The reason is not Covid, the reason is ‘Notebandi’ and GST,” Gandhi said in Hindi.P Chidambaram, Mallikarjun Kharge, Shashi Tharoor and Salman Khurshid were among senior Congress leaders who also slammed the government over demonetisation as part of their party’s online campaign.“The first lesson every ruler and every government must learn is that - even if you do not do good to the people, do not do harm. The BJP-led NDA government did great harm to India’s economy on November 8th, 2016,” Chidambaram, a former Union finance minister, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demo-anniversary-pm-modi-hails-move-congress-observes-betrayal-day/story-YMjSwOBCknM6fED5CQwvpJ.html
08-11-2020||India||India looks to continuity in ties under Biden, experts expect rebalancing in some areas||The overall thrust of India-US ties, including burgeoning security cooperation and the focus on the Indo-Pacific, are unlikely to change under a Joe Biden presidency though experts believe there will be some rebalancing in certain areas. In a congratulatory message on Saturday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi recalled Biden’s “critical and invaluable” role in strengthening bilateral ties in his former role as vice president under president Barack Obama, and said he looked forward to working closely together again with the president-elect. This message, Biden’s past support in critical areas such as the civil nuclear cooperation and counter-terrorism, and strong bipartisan support in the US for bolstering the strategic partnership with India to address global challenges are expected to set the tone for the future course of ties, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Biden has been a strong proponent of India-US relations since his days as a senator in the 1970s. During his second stint as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he wrote to then president George W Bush in 2001 to unilaterally drop US sanctions against India. In his third stint in the same post, Biden was seen by India as a critical ally in getting the Senate’s approval for the India-US civil nuclear agreement in 2008 and also co-sponsored several legislations on terrorism. “Biden was a consistent proponent of the nuclear deal, and certainly was critical to its success,” said a person who declined to be named. Peter Lavoy, a former US assistant secretary of defence for Asian and Pacific security affairs, said: “US-India relations improved steadily under presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. The Biden administration certainly will view India as a key global partner and can be expected to further deepen economic, political and strategic ties.” Also Read: Allies prepare for abrupt US U-turn as Joe Biden shifts prioritiesThe India-US relationship stands to benefit as it is one that Washington won’t have to repair post-Trump, said Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “In general, it will likely be more of the same, since the relationship continued its steady progress despite Trump disrupting relations with other partners such as Germany and South Korea,” Narang said. In a 2006 interview, Biden had presciently said: “My dream is that in 2020, the two closest nations in the world will be India and the US. If that occurs, the world will be safer.” Biden was also part of the Obama administration when the US declared India as major defence partner and backed its candidature for permanent membership of a reformed UN Security Council. As recently as last month, Biden wrote in an op-ed in India West newspaper that a Biden-Harris administration will build on the “great progress” in ties with India under the Obama-Biden administration. “We can and should be natural allies,” he said. Also Read: Americans pivot from red-hot Trump to Biden’s seasoned coolBiden also offered support on issues such as counter-terrorism and the aggressive actions of China. He wrote: “The US and India will stand together against terrorism in all its forms and work together to promote a region of peace and stability where neither China nor any other country threatens its neighbours.” Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash pointed to geo-political convergences and bilateral commonalities on issues such as security, energy and economy between the two sides, and said: “These are areas where both sides meet and the US will be quite happy to work with us. Besides, the US’s relations with India and Pakistan have been de-hyphenated. With India, it’s building on the positives and with Pakistan, it’s containing the negatives.” However, former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said India will have to keep an eye on the new US administration’s policy towards China, which could be markedly different from that of the outspoken Trump. “Biden’s policy for China will take several months to take shape though it is expected he will be less loud on China,” he said. Bhatia and Narang also cautioned that India shouldn’t expect a free pass on issues such as Kashmir and human rights, which Biden and vice president-elect Kamala Harris have raised in recent months. Also Read: Iran’s president calls on Biden to return to nuclear dealWhile the Trump administration was generally muted on human rights issues and the situation in Kashmir, both figured in Biden’s campaign documents. An agenda paper said the Indian government “should take all necessary steps to restore rights for all the people of Kashmir” since restrictions on dissent weaken democracy. Biden was also disappointed by the “implementation and aftermath of the National Register of Citizens in Assam and the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act into law” as he believed these “are inconsistent with the country’s long tradition of secularism and with sustaining a multi-ethnic and multi-religious democracy”. Narang said: “From Delhi’s side, there may be a need to address the perception that the BJP was all-in for Trump and that it attacked Democrats over the past several years for expressing human rights concerns. But in general, I would expect only minor variations on the broader theme of deeper India-US partnership across a wide spectrum of issues, from defence to dollars to diaspora, as well as democracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-looks-to-continuity-in-ties-under-biden-experts-expect-rebalancing-in-some-areas/story-sy3LxpDwFbZfbih89twtZN.html
08-11-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine updates: Race for shot to pick up in January, says expert||The global caseload of the coronavirus disease is hurtling towards 50 million, even as research and trials continue across the world to find a vaccine against Covid-19, which has claimed more than 1.2 million lives so far. The world has been waiting for a shot against Covid-19 amidst a wave of fresh cases in Europe and a ban by the UK on travellers from Denmark following an outbreak of a rare mutation of the virus in the Nordic country’s mink farms.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHere are the latest updates in the worldwide search for a Covid-19 vaccine:1. Dmitry Kulish, a professor at the Skoltech Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, said at a Harvard Club of Russia online discussion that the race for producing a viable vaccine to tackle the coronavirus disease will intensify in January next year. “If we talk about the race [on creating an effective vaccine], the peak of the race will occur at the start of January 2021, when everyone will be comparing serious side effects,” Kulish said while speaking at the online discussion on the topic of vaccine creation.He explained that since most reports on clinical trials of the vaccines being developed in different countries are slated to come out in January next year, everyone will come to know the side effects of each vaccine and that would intensify the already high stakes race. Kulish’s home country Russia has developed its own vaccine, the Sputnik V, named after the first-ever man-made object to orbit the earth, developed by the erstwhile Soviet Union, Sputnik I.2. Hungary’s foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said a Hungarian company may be able to switch from flu shot production to production of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V in December for final testing and licensing.3. Argentina has struck a deal with drug maker AstraZeneca Plc to receive around 22 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine being developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford, with the aim to start deliveries in the first half of next year. Argentina, which is starting to see new cases slow, is hoping to receive some 10 million doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine and a smaller number of doses of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine between December-January.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/covid-19-vaccine-updates-race-for-shot-to-pick-up-in-january-says-expert/story-0mYAip4gt65p0fdJrMJ2YO.html
08-11-2020||India||Will prepare SOP on opening religious places after Diwali: CM Thackeray||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday hinted that places of worship could be reopened in the coming days. Thackeray said that he was criticised for not reopening temples and other places of worship, but those taking a potshot at him would not share the blame, if the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) contagion spun out of control. The CM, in his 33-minute address to the state, which was broadcast via social media, said Maharashtra’s Covid-19 cases were on the wane.However, he cautioned that any sort of complacency could lead to another wave. He said that the state government would prepare a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) to reopen places of worship in Maharashtra after Diwali (November 14). Several political parties and religious bodies have been appealing to the state government to reopen the places of worship. However, the state government has been cautious since senior citizens will predominantly frequent the places of worship and may become super spreaders.“We will prepare a SOP after Diwali. Mostly senior citizens such as our parents and grandparents visit all places of worship. Masks will be compulsory in all places of worship. I am intentionally delaying reopening of all places of worship. I am aware that I am being criticised for my decision. But if there is a bigger spread of Covid-19 cases, those criticising me will not take the responsibility,” he added.Thackeray also appealed to the public to celebrate a firecracker-free Diwali as pollution and smoke would aggravate the health condition of those who suffer from lung ailments.The CM said that the next 20 days would be crucial in the fight against Covid-19. He urged the public to maintain social distancing, avoid crowding, use masks in a bid to prevent another surge in Covid-19 cases in the state. “The upcoming Diwali and 15 days after the festival is a big test for us. European countries, including France, have enforced lockdown restrictions again. It will be tough, if we have to adopt similar measures. Many people are still not wearing masks. Such indiscipline will not be tolerated. The public will be fined for non-compliance. An estimate says a Covid-19 patient without a mask can infect up to 400 people,” he said. The issue to ban firecrackers was discussed in the state cabinet meeting on Thursday. However, a decision to impose a ban is yet to be taken. State minister for health and family welfare Rajesh Tope said the government might take a call on restricting the use of firecrackers. Sena ministers reportedly suggested promoting environment-friendly crackers instead of announcing a blanket ban. Thackeray said that instead of imposing a ban on firecrackers, he would want the public to voluntarily restrain from bursting them. “Elsewhere in the country, especially in Delhi, there has been a spike in Covid-19 cases. Why is it increasing? It is said it’s due to pollution. I would like to appeal to you not to burst crackers this Diwali. We must maintain self-discipline like we have been doing in our fight against the viral outbreak. A vaccine is yet to be launched. Pollution causes Covid-19 cases to increase. Can we avoid firecrackers? Should we ban it? …There is so much pollution and smoke. What we have achieved [in controlling Covid-19] will be lost in just four days of smoke. I request you not to burst fire crackers in public places and avoid them altogether,” he said.The CM also launched an attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for what he said was the latter’s bid to derail a Metro Rail project that would benefit Mumbaikars. The BJP has been accusing the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, comprising coalition partners such as CM Thackeray’s Shiv Sena, the National Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, for trying to build a Metro Rail car depot at Kanjurmarg that is a salt pan.Thackeray, in a veiled attack on the BJP, said that the state has attracted proposed investments of over Rs 5,000 million, despite a campaign to defame the MVA government.The plot for the Metro Rail car depot in Kanjurmarg has become the latest flashpoint between the Centre and Maharashtra government. The Centre has claimed that the plot, where the Metro Rail car shed is proposed, belongs to it and is a salt pan. “Some people said that the plot is a salt pan. But they don’t understand that they are trying to derail the project meant for Mumbaikars,” he said.He hit out at the MVA government’s detractors and said it did not work with its “eyes shut”. “During the last few months, while we were battling the Covid-19 in Maharashtra, those who have a grudge against us launched a campaign to defame the state. [They said] Maharashtra’s law and order has collapsed. It is a safe haven for drug addicts. However, we overcame these trenchant criticisms and signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) worth Rs 1,700 million in June. Last week, we signed MoUs worth Rs 3,500 million. Several companies, both Indian and multinationals, will invest in Maharashtra. I was criticised for not stepping out of the home. However, I got all the investments for the state while sitting at home. Maharashtra’s economy is gaining momentum, despite the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added. Thackeray said that the Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, etc were on the wane, thanks to the state government’s “My Family, My Responsibility” campaign. “Several people were criticising us for the pandemic situation was getting out of control. But our determination, self-confidence and discipline has helped flatten the Covid-19 curve,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-prepare-sop-on-opening-religious-places-after-diwali-cm-thackeray/story-CZf3w40iUbHkCp6FsHqJQM.html

Since then, it has simultaneously invigorated formal economy and brought unprecedented financial benefits to all sections of society,” Chandrasekhar said.His remarks came after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi slammed the government over demonetisation, alleging that the move four years ago was aimed at helping a few of Prime Minister Modi’s “crony capitalist friends” and had “destroyed” the Indian economy.Without taking names, Chandrasekhar said,”If there is anybody who shouldn’t talk about loot, mismanagement of the economy it should be people from the Congress. During the lost decade of the Congress-led UPA government, there was rampant black money and corruption in the country’s economy.” The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) was in power at the Centre for two terms from 2004 to 2009 and from 2009 to 2014.From 2014, the Modi government embarked on transforming the economy and demonetisation was part of it to ensure government resources reach the poor and the downtrodden without corruption and leakage, Chandrashekhar said.“Demonetisation had three significant and tangible impacts -- cleaning up of the economy, formalisation of the informal sector as it helped us to reach the poor and needy, and revenue aggregation,” the BJP leader said.Chandrasekhar said the economic transformations or decisions taken by Modi government in the last six years had an overall positive impact on the Indian economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demonetisation-cleaned-up-the-economy-dealt-body-blow-to-black-money-bjp/story-Q6wKvY8oRAlmU7XgTlgI3O.html

She wanted to set up a hospital in Wayanad in north Kerala, where she had spent her formative years and studied till Grade X, they said.Nita, who was pursuing her post-graduate studies in surgery in Miami, Florida, was travelling to her residence at Naples, when she lost control of the vehicle and plunged into a canal in a neighbourhood called Alligator Alley. Reports suggested an American couple, who travelling behind her vehicle, stopped their car and tried to rescue her. The man managed to pull her out and when he was about to drag an unconscious Nita out of the canal, alligators rushed towards him. His wife, who was helping him to rescue her, alerted him about the lurking alligators and he was compelled to let her go, the police said. Later, the police fired at the alligators and brought her ashore. She was dead by then, the police added. “Nita was a hard-working girl. She always nurtured a dream to set up a hospital in Wayanad to treat the poor. Charity was in her blood. We could not believe she is no more,” said her uncle K Stephan, who was informed about the fatal accident on Saturday night. Her father Thomas Kunnumpurath had migrated to the US after he retired from his government job. Nita had completed her Grade X from De Paul Public School in Kalpetta, the headquarters of Wayanad district. Her brother is a pharmacist and sister is a physiotherapist.Her burial would be held in a church in Chicago in a couple of days, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/she-had-a-dream-says-family-of-kerala-doctor-who-died-in-us/story-MkaxNHJAuMypUtKytDZ29K.html

Raut alleged that the BJP stopped journalists from entering western Uttar Pradesh’s (UP) Hathras district, where a Dalit teenager (19) was allegedly gang-raped and murdered by four upper-caste men in September. The party arrested and slapped cases against those journalists, who wrote against its leaders, he further alleged. He said the same party was talking about the freedom of press. Raut, in his weekly column RokhThok in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, alleged that the entire Union cabinet, except Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and BJP chief ministers backed Goswami. Goswami was arrested in Mumbai by Raigad police on November 4 morning after a high drama. After his arrest several top BJP leaders unleashed a coordinated attack at the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government (MVA), comprising the coalition partners the Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, for allegedly muzzling the media.They alleged that Goswami was singled out for his criticism of the MVA government. The BJP launched demonstrations across Maharashtra and protests against his arrest.Raut, who is also the executive editor of Saamana, wrote, “A suicide note written by [Anvay] Naik named Goswami holding him responsible for his death. The then BJP government hushed up the case, despite tell-tale evidence. Investigating the suppressed case has become a crime? How does the arrest of Goswami become an attack on the freedom of press? The entire Union cabinet, barring the PM, chief ministers of BJP-ruled states stood beside Goswami, while the voice of Naik’s wife and daughter were suppressed.”Goswami denies the charges against him and alleges harassment by the state administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sena-s-sanjay-raut-hits-out-at-bjp-over-arnab-arrest-issue/story-KlB43TKMZY5KTnFOacm0wL.html
08-11-2020||India||Shipping ministry to be renamed, will bring ‘clarity in work’: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the Ministry of Shipping is being expanded and renamed as the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways.He was addressing a gathering after inaugurating a Ro-Pax ferry service between Hazira in Surat and Ghogha in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat, which will reduce the 370-km road distance between the two places to 90-km by sea route.The service will also cut the travel time between the two places to about four hours from 10 to 12 hours.Modi said work is being done so that the country’s sea area emerges as an important part of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India).“To boost the government’s effort, one more big step is being taken. Now, the Ministry of Shipping is being renamed as the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways,” he said.Also Read: Ropax Ferry Service will decrease transportation costs, aid ease of business, says PM Modi“It (the ministry) is being expanded. In developed economies, in most places, the shipping ministry also takes care of ports and waterways. In India, the shipping ministry does a lot of work related to ports and waterways. Clarity in name will also bring about clarity in work,” he further said.He also said the new Ro-Pax ferry service launched on Sunday will reduce the distance between Bhavnagar to Surat, which is around 375-km by road, to 90-km by sea route.This will also reduce the travel time from 10-12 hours to three to four hours, he said.“The service will help people save both time and cost and also reduce traffic congestion on roads and reduce pollution,” Modi said.The three-deck Ro-Pax Ferry Vessel Voyage Symphony connecting Hazira in Surat district in south Gujarat and Ghogha in Saurashtras Bhavnagar has a load capacity of 30 trucks, 100 passenger cars, and 500 passengers plus 34 crew and hospitality staff, as per a statement earlier released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).The ferry will make three trips daily, annually transporting five lakh passengers, 80,000 passenger vehicles, 50,000 two-wheelers and 30,000 trucks, as per the release.Modi said to strengthen the ‘blue economy’, it is important to strengthen logistics related to the sea.Compared to other countries, the cost of carrying goods from one part to another is high in India even today.Through water transport, this (cost) can be reduced drastically, he said.“Therefore, our focus is to create such an ecosystem where seamless movement of cargo is ensured. Today, for better maritime logistics along with better infrastructure, we are working on a single-window system,” he said.“To reduce the cost of logistics, the country is moving ahead with a holistic and long-term view of multi-modal connectivity. The effort is to improve connectivity between road, rail, air and shipping infrastructure by removing silos between them,” the PM said.Also Read: You have ease of doing business, work on ease of living: Modi tells IIT-Delhi graduatesHe said multi-modal parks are being constructed not just in India, but also neighbouring countries.“With all these efforts, we shall be able to reduce the cost of logistics. These efforts will also give a new direction to the economy,” he said.Modi said the country always had resources and expertise in waterways, but the past governments lacked the vision to use them, despite the fact that transportation through waterways is much cheaper compared to road and rail, and causes minimum adverse affect on the environment.“Despite this, it was only after 2014 that work was done with a holistic approach in this direction. These rivers and seas existed even before Modi became the prime minister.What was lacking was the vision that the country has experienced after 2014,” he said.Modi said to boost the ‘blue economy’ and fishing business, his government also focused on fishermen and has come up with the ‘Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana’ with an outlay of ₹30,000 crore to help improve the fishing infrastructure.“Today, the port capacity of coastal areas across the country is being increased and new ports are being constructed. Efforts are being made to ensure that the 21,000 -km ‘jal marg’ (waterways) are used for the country’s development,” he said.For this, work is underway on more than 500 projects under ‘Sagarmala’. Many of these projects worth lakhs of crores are ready, he said.Modi said Gujarat accounted for over 40 per cent share of the country’s entire trade through sea route last year.Work is on at fast pace to create infrastructure and capacity building for sea routes, like maritime clusters and maritime university, as well as the world’s first CNG Terminal in Bhavnagar, he said.TheGujarat Maritime Cluster coming up in the GIFT (Gujarat International Finance Tec-City) City at Gandhinagar will be a dedicated system to address logistics of ports and seaways, he said.“This will help in value addition of this sector,” the prime minister said.India’s first chemical and LNG Terminal was constructed at Dahej in Gujarat, he said, adding that a ‘Ro-Ro (roll on roll off) terminal, a liquid cargo terminal and a container terminal are being set up in Bhavnagar.“The new terminals will increase Bhavnagar’s port capacity by many times,” he said.The prime minister further said the government is trying to restart the ferry service between Ghogha and Dahej that was launched in 2017, but stopped due to natural reasons.“Many challenges related to nature came up before this project. With the help of modern technology, they are being removed, and I hope people of Ghogha and Dahej will soon be able to take the benefit of this facility,” he said.Modi also interacted with a few people like farmers, pilgrims and businessmen, who expressed their happiness over the new ferry service.Union Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh Mandaviya and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani were present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shipping-ministry-to-be-renamed-will-bring-clarity-in-work-pm-modi/story-8m1OmJT4oQIx8FRYx3apNK.html

A video released by the Republic Television showed him speaking to media from the police van which shifted him from Alibag primary school in Rajgad district to Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai.“I had requested them please let me talk (to my lawyers). But they denied. I am telling everyone my life is at stake. My police custody was rejected. They tried to shift me at night only. Today morning they have dragged me. Everybody is seeing what is happening to me. They want to delay the process and keep me in jail. Please give me bail, I am appealing to the Supreme Court,” the 47-year-old journalist could be seen saying with folded hands in the video.Goswami was arrested on November 4 from his Lower Parel residence in connection with 2018’s abetment to suicide case of interior designer Anvay Naik who, in his suicide note, had blamed Goswami and two others for his and his mother’s suicide.Since November 4, he was lodged at the primary school which has been converted into a Covid-19 facility. Now, he will be kept for a few days in a quarantine centre inside Taloja jail before he is shifted to the barrack, Kaushtubh Kurlekar, superintendent of police (SP), Taloja jail, said.Goswami was supposed to be moved to Alibag jail after he would have finished his quarantine period in the Covid-19 facility. But the decision to shift him to another jail was prompted after Goswami was allegedly found using someone’s mobile phone in the quarantine centre. Meanwhile, Delhi Police on Sunday detained BJP leaders Kapil Mishra and Tajinder Bagga and foiled their bid to hold a protest at Rajghat in support of Arnab Goswami.Two hearings in the suicide abetment case are scheduled on Monday.The Bombay High Court will pronounce its order on Goswami’s interim bail application. On Saturday, a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik after a day-long hearing in the pleas reserved its order without granting any immediate relief.A notice issued late Saturday night on the high court’s website said the bench would assemble at 3 pm on November 9 for pronouncement of the order.The sessions court at Alibag will also hear the police’s plea challenging a magistrate’s order which denied them Goswami’s custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-being-allowed-to-talk-to-lawyers-says-arnab-goswami-as-he-was-being-shifted-to-taloja-jail/story-ObtyOVaQz9jQwZdv86ttSN.html

He said that he will not impose a ban and requested people to show self-discipline and celebrate firecrackers-free Diwali. “Whatever we have achieved (in controlling Covid-19) will go away in four days due to pollution through firecrackers,” Thackeray said in an appeal. “No firecrackers in public places. I am not imposing a ban on crackers or an Emergency,” he also said. “We can ban firecrackers but we can avoid bursting firecrackers by exercising self-discipline,” said CM Thackeray.Referring to the recent spike in Covid-19 cases in the national capital, Thackeray said, “The Covid curve is coming down in Maharashtra and Mumbai with discipline and determination of the people. We are seeing that cases are going up in Delhi. It is due to pollution.”“15 days after Diwali are still crucial. We should be cautious so that the need for lockdown does not arise again” he also said.This comes as a number of states have banned firecrackers ahead of Diwali, including Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and West Bengal, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the cases of the viral respiratory disease fall in Maharashtra, Thackeray announced reopening of places of worship and said will prepare the guidelines after Diwali. Once the worst-affected state by Covid-19, Maharashtra has been reporting a steady fall in Covid-19 cases since the last week of October. However, the number of deaths has not reduced in proportion. So, the case fatality rate (CFR) is yet to come down. As of Saturday evening, the state have 17,14,273 total Covid-19 cases out of which 99,151 were active cases. The death toll stood at 45,115.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-ban-on-firecrackers-in-maharashtra-uddhav-urges-people-to-exercise-discipline/story-USzmlhZOm5vTTNDTGFMUkL.html

Besides, the tribunals lack the technical manpower to conduct VC, he has said, adding that, at least two technical persons are required for the tribunal at Mumbai and one each at its benches.Therefore, from June 2020, the tribunal has been conducting physical hearings - with two benches at Mumbai and one each at Nagpur and Aurangabad, the report states.Working twice a week, MAT benches have during the Covid-19 pandemic heard a total of 1,220 cases filed during this period along with several other urgent matters, and have disposed of 599 cases, the report adds.Joshi has filed the report pursuant to October 28, 2020 order passed by the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, on a petition filed by advocate Yogesh Morbale, a resident of Ichalkaranji in Kolhapur district.In his petition filed through advocate Vinod Sangvikar on October 6, Morbale complained that he had been stuck at his native place because of the pandemic and thousands of lawyers like him and litigants were deprived of access to MAT because of lack of online filing and hearing at the tribunal.He had, therefore, sought directions to the MAT to conduct hearings through video conferencing on a daily basis and update its website to support the e-court system and make it user friendly.As regards MAT website, Joshi said in his report that the tribunal has started its own website way back in July 2013. It is designed by Mahaonline Limited, only with certain basic features. He added that the space provided for the website on the state government’s server is insufficient and therefore whenever data is required to be uploaded on it, the tribunal has to approach the director, information technology.The MAT registrar’s report also said that the tribunal has a chairman, three vice chairmen and five members, of which posts of three members - one member each at Mumbai, Nagpur and Aurangabad - are vacant, and two of the three vice chairmen are due to retire on November 17, 2020 and January 22, 2021.Thus, no bench will be available at Aurangabad from November 17, 2020 and government employees from Marathwada region will have to move either to Mumbai or to Nagpur in case of urgency. For hearing regular matters from Marathwada region, MAT will have to make arrangement of circuit benches, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-t-hear-matters-through-vc-with-outdated-computers-mat-tells-bombay-hc/story-CFHjKdHb7RdoxWw7t15U6L.html
08-11-2020||India||Robin Hood like Odisha tribal leader walks out of jail after 6 years||On Friday evening, soon after he was released from the Koraput jail, Nachika Linga was given an emotional welcome by people of Bhaliaput village in Narayanpatna block of Koraput district. Back home after a painful six years in jail as an undertrial with 45 cases against him, the 47-year-old Linga hugged tight his mother Juro Nachika, whom he had not seen since he went behind bars. He did not sleep the entire Friday night, busy chatting with his mother and family members, trying to catch up on the lost years and recounting his prison experiences.Declared the most-wanted Maoist by Odisha police more than a decade ago for trying to convert Narayanpatna block of Koraput into a Maoist fortress, Linga, a Kui tribal, was released two days after the Orissa high court granted him bail in the last of the 45 cases with charges ranging from loot to waging war against the state.In 44 cases, the trial courts acquitted him due to lack of evidence and witnesses while he continued to be behind bars in a 2009 case of attack on Narayanpatna police station. After a nudge by the Supreme Court last month, the Orissa high court early this week granted him bail. On Friday, the trial court of Koraput district judge released him on a bail bond of Rs 50,000 with two persons standing as guarantor, a little more than 6 years after he surrendered before Odisha police.“I would like to thank the government and the law. I could become free due to the blessings of everyone. I would continue to work for people,” said a much-mellowed Linga, the poster-boy of a tribal movement that threatened to turn Narayanpatna block into a Maoist fortress a decade ago.Under the banner of Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh, a Maoist-backed outfit, the tribals of Narayanpatna block in 2006 launched a movement to drive the moneylenders and landlords of the area whom they called ‘Sundi-Sahukar-Sarkar’ (liquor vendor-landlord-government). Led by Linga, CMAS mobilised over 30,000 tribals in the block with the slogan ‘mada mukti, jami mukti and goti mukti’(freedom from liquor, freedom from usurping of tribal lands and freedom from bonded labour).In his 2020 book, “Land alienation and politics of tribal exploitation in India”, Surath Malik, a political science professor of Midnapore’s Vidyasagar University wrote that using the age-old issue of tribal land alienation by non-tribals in the block, CMAS immediately became popular.“Of the 43,000-odd population in the block, around 82% were tribals. Though it was a Scheduled Area and tribal land could not be transferred under Odisha Scheduled Areas Transfer of Immovable Property by Scheduled Tribes Regulation, 1956, the executive could not properly implement it. The landlords from the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh joined the liquor vendors of Narayanpatna area and exploited the tribals forcing them to become daily wage labourers in their own lands. Though the tribals in Narayanpatna were 85% in population, the actual land possessed by them was about 10–15%. The tribals of Narayanpatna under the banner of the CMAS launched the movement to drive the moneylenders and landlords out of the Narayanpatna area and posted red flags on the land,” Malik wrote in his book.Like his father and grandfather, Linga too started as a bonded labourer working under an upper caste landlord in Bhaliaput village of Narayanpatna block for a wage of Rs 5 per day. Five generations of Linga family were bonded labourers, but he was determined not to let that continue and fled to neighbouring Parvatipuram of Andhra Pradesh in early 2000, where he probably came in contact with Maoists. He returned home a few years later.In 2006, Linga became one of the key members of the Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangha, a tribal body that had Maoist links. The Ryot Coolie Sangha, a tribal body, had been banned in Andhra Pradesh in August 2005 over its alleged links with Maoists. In anticipation of a similar ban by the Odisha government, the RCS-Koraput changed its name to Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh in 2006.Under Linga, the tribals of Narayanpatna launched a movement to drive the moneylenders and landlords away, bringing more and more tribals into the fold of CMAS.In 2006, Genua Vahini, the militant brigade of CMAS led by Linga captured some 50 acres of non-tribal land in the Podapadar gram panchayat after which he was charged with several cases including that of waging war against the State and sent to jail. He was released in 2008. In that period, CMAS had chased away upper caste landlords and distributed around 3000 acres of land among the landless poor tribals. The CMAS activists would post red flags on the occupied lands, and cut crops from the acquired land despite the presence of police force.“For tribals, he had become some sort of Robin Hood who would get their land back by terrorising the upper caste people as well as Dalits,” said a senior CRPF official posted in Koraput in mid 2000.Also Read: Alcohol, superstition take a toll on tribals in Odisha villagesActivist Prafulla Samantra, who for long has supported Linga, says in his short stint with CMAS movement, Linga had achieved what was thought to be impossible. “Alcoholism is believed to be the bane of the tribal society and that leads to indebtedness and prolonged exploitation by the ruling elite in the area. By taking on the liquor mafia, he ensured prohibition in Narayanpatna. It was his success in the anti-liquor movement that led him to the land reclamation movement. In many ways he was perhaps the most popular tribal leader to have emerged from the grassroots in undivided Koraput,” said Samantra.Though Linga was on a path of confrontation with the state, police officials who worked in Koraput during the CMAS days said the government wanted a political resolution. However, the state government shut out the idea of a political resolution when a landmine blast on the Laxmipur-Narayanpatna road near Palur killed 9 policemen of the Odisha Special Striking Force.“When the policemen were killed in the blast, any chance of a political resolution to the tribal movement was swiftly over. It was just an overground arm of Maoists. The situation turned worse in November 2009 when Linga led over 1,000 tribals under the banner of CMAS to launch an attack on Narayanpatna police station, in which 2 CMAS leaders were killed. He was declared the most wanted man by the Odisha police and posters with his photo were all over Koraput,” said deputy inspector general of police Anup Kumar Sahoo, who worked as SP Koraput during that time.Also Read: Tribal burnt alive for not returning Rs 5,000 taken during lockdown: PoliceAfter the attack on Narayanpatna police station, Linga went underground for five years and kept giving police the slip while the CMAS unleashed their fury in the region, killing anyone who opposed the organisation, often slitting their throats. Linga fell out with the CPI (Maoists) in 2012 after the kidnapping of Biju Janata Dal MLA Jhina Hikaka. The tribal MLA was released after prolonged negotiations, but led to souring of relations between Maoists and Linga.Without the active help of CMAS, Maoists could not remain active in Narayanpatna which they wanted to make a red fortress. The schism between Maoists and Linga helped police gain an upper hand in the treacherous region. In October 2014, Linga finally surrendered before Odisha police and was charged with 45 cases including murder and waging war against the state. Like most cases involving Maoists, no one came to testify against Linga leading to his acquittal.Activist Samantra said despite being away for a long time, Linga still has the potential to revive the movement. “Due to his absence the organisation had become inactive.

Kaushtubh Kurlekar, superintendent of police (SP), Taloja jail, said: “He will be kept for a few days in a quarantine centre inside the prison before he is shifted to the barrack.”Samyabrata Ray Goswami, senior executive editor of Republic TV and Goswami’s wife, put out a statement appealing for his “immediate release” and lashing out at the Maharastra government for its “human rights abuse and excesses”. “On Sunday morning, my husband, who has spent four nights in judicial custody (JC), was being dragged and lugged by the Maharashtra Police in a blacked-out police van to Taloja Jail. He was repeatedly saying ‘my life is under threat’ but to no avail. He repeatedly said that the jailer assaulted him after he asked for access to his lawyers, which was shockingly denied. He detailed the assault being inflicted on him during this custody and pleaded, hands folded, to the Supreme Court (SC) for intervention and bail. An innocent man and journalist of decades of repute, who is doing his duty for the nation, has been assaulted, harassed and framed on fake charges. He has been thrown into jail with no reprieve...,” she said in the statement.Goswami was arrested on November 4 along with two other accused, Feroz Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda, from Mumbai in connection with the 2018 abetment suicide case of architect and interior designer Anvay Naik, and they were produced in the Alibag district and session court on the same day. Goswami was sent to a 14-day judicial custody later at night on that day following a hearing that lasted for six hours. His custody expires on November 18.The security at the Alibag makeshift prison facility was strengthened on Sunday morning at around 10 am, as the prison authorities decided to shift Goswami to Taloja jail. Alibag police have challenged the judicial custody and sought a permission for custodial interrogation of Goswami, Shaikh and Sarada, who have been booked for non-payment of late Naik’s dues of over Rs 5 crore. The Alibag court will hear the plea on Monday (November 9).Goswami also moved the Bombay high court (HC) on Saturday, questioning his arrest and sought immediate relief. His legal team argued that Goswami’s arrest and detention were illegal because the case was closed in April 2019 by the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government in Maharashtra.The high court is expected to take up his bail application at 3pm on Monday.Earlier this year, the case was reopened by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, a coalition of the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, without obtaining necessary court order, his legal team further argued. Shaikh and Sarda moved a similar plea in the HC, which reserved its order on the interim bail plea of Goswami and the other two accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-shift-journalist-arnab-goswami-to-navi-mumbai-s-taljola-jail/story-o4VNHmaua670EoD4cJZ4QL.html

08-11-2020||India||Yediyurappa confident about winning RR Nagar& Sira assembly bypolls by huge margins||Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Sunday expressed confidence about the ruling BJP winning both Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Sira assembly bypolls, results for which will be declared on November 10, by huge margins.“We will win R R Nagar by (a margin of) 35,000-40,000 votes. In Sira also we will win by about 20,000-25,000 votes.I’m not saying it today, I had said it ahead of the elections and on the polling day,” he told reporters here. The Chief Minister the Congress has probably taken this prediction lightly and would know the truth once the results are out.“If Yediyurappa says something, it will be after thinking ten times and after understanding the public opinion. So 100 per cent we will win both seats by a huge margin,” he added. To a question about Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah’s claim that the results would be in favour of Congress, he said, “Siddaramaiah will get to know when the results are out on November 10. I wish him good luck.” Exit polls have indicated that the BJP will sweep Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Sira bypolls.Read more: Karnataka bypolls: What’s at stake and why are they so important?Voting for both assembly constituencies took place on November 3, with a turnout of 82.31 per cent and 45.24 per cent respectively. The Sira byelection was necessitated following the death of JD(S) legislator B Sathyanarayana in August, while the R R Nagar seat here fell vacant following the disqualification of the then Congress MLA N Munirathna under the anti-defection law last year.The BJP, which has never won the Sira seat, had fielded radiologist Dr C M Rajesh Gowda, son of former Congress MP C P Mudalagiriyappa, who recently joined the party. The Congress and JD(S), considered traditional rivals in the region, had fielded former Minister T B Jayachandra and Ammajamma. Ammajamma is the wife of late JD(S) MLA Sathyanarayana. In R R Nagar, Congress had fielded a fresh face -- Kusuma H, wife of late IAS officer D K Ravi. She was pitted against V Krishnamurthy of JD(S) and N Munirathna of the BJP. Munirathna, after his disqualification last year, had joined the BJP.The outcome of the bypolls would be seen in many quarters as a reflection on the performance of the Yediyurappa government, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the opposition parties-Congress and JD(S)- would be keen to strike after facing a rout in December 2019 bypolls. The Chief Minister has already indicated that the much awaited cabinet expansion would take place at the earliest and he would talk to the high command in this regard, soon after the assembly bypoll results.Expressing confidence about the NDA forming the government in Bihar, Yediyurappa said “let there be no doubt about it...exit poll may be showing some variations, but according to me, 100 per cent we will be forming the government there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yediyurappa-confident-about-winning-rr-nagar-sira-assembly-bypolls-by-huge-margins/story-yJZBenlBqc5eRSAAwQ4mRO.html

The new administration is expected to reverse some of the decisions of the outgoing Trump rule, including that of the H-1B. Tens of thousands of Indian professionals will be benefitted if the new rule plans to increase the number of high-skilled visas. Also Read: Biden will ‘stand with India’ if elected, highlights Trump admin’s ‘harmful’ action on H1B visaThis was a part of the comprehensive immigration reform that the Biden administration plans to work on, either in one go or in separate pieces, PTI reported.In June, Trump had temporarily suspended the H-1B visas along with other types of foreign work visas until the end of 2020 to protect American workers from unemployment aggravated by Covid-19 pandemic. In October, the Trump administration had announced new restrictions on the H-1B non-immigrant visa programme, which was aimed at protecting American workers, restoring integrity and to better guarantee that H-1B petitions are approved only for qualified beneficiaries and petitioners. These proposals were not applicable to those who are already in the US, but were meant for new visa-holders who will be going to the US.Also Read: ‘Green Card waitlist for Indians runs into 200 years’: US senator on country capThe Biden administration plans to create a new visa category to allow cities and counties to petition for higher levels of immigrants to support their growth.“High skilled temporary visas should not be used to disincentivise recruiting workers already in the US for in-demand occupations. An immigration system that crowds out high-skilled workers in favour of only entry level wages and skills threatens American innovation and competitiveness,” according to a policy document issued by the Biden campaign.“Biden will work with Congress to first reform temporary visas to establish a wage-based allocation process and establish enforcement mechanisms to ensure they are aligned with the labour market and not used to undermine wages. Then, Biden will support expanding the number of high-skilled visas and eliminating the limits on employment-based visas by country, which create unacceptably long backlogs,” it said.Technology companies depend on H-1B visas that allows them to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. Employment-based visas, also known as green cards, allow migrants to gain lawful permanent residence in the US in order to engage in skilled work. Currently, the number of employment-based visas is capped at 140,000 each year. According to the policy document, Biden will also exempt from any cap recent graduates of PhD programmes in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields in the US who are poised to make some of the most important contributions to the world economy.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has issued a notification for promotion of digital and IT based payment of fees through FASTags. The government has issued a notification “making FASTag mandatory to be available by January 1, 2021 in old vehicles also i.e. M and N category of motor vehicles (four wheelers) sold before December 1, 2017 through amendments in CMVR, 1989”, the MoRTH said in a statement. As per Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, the FASTag had been made mandatory for registration of new four wheeled vehicles since December 1, 2017 and is being supplied by the vehicle manufacturers or their dealers. “It had further been mandated that the renewal of fitness certificate will be done only after the fitment of FASTag for the transport vehicles. Further that for national permit vehicles the fitment of FASTag has been mandated since October 1, 2019,” the statement said. The government also said that a valid FASTag is mandatory while getting a new third party insurance through an amendment in FORM 51 (certificate of Insurance), wherein the details of FASTag ID shall be captured. This shall be applicable w.e.f. April 1, 2021. The move is a major step for ensuring that the payment of fees is done at toll plazas through the electronic means only and that the vehicles pass seamlessly through the toll plazas. “The steps for ensuring the availablity of FASTag at multiple channels are being made through physical locations and also through online mechanism so that the citizens are able to have them affixed at their vehicles within the next two months at their convenience,” the statement said. The National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) programme, the flagship initiative of the MoRTH, has been implemented on a pan-India basis in order to remove bottlenecks and ensure seamless movement of traffic and collection of user fee as per the notified rates, using passive radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. FASTag is a prepaid tag that enables automatic deduction of toll charges and lets the vehicle pass through the toll plaza without stopping for the cash transaction. The radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based FASTag is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle. It allows for direct payment of fee from the prepaid or savings account linked to it and enables vehicles to drive through without stopping for transactions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fastags-mandatory-for-all-four-wheelers-from-jan-1-2021/story-KLCqZ8k0asXTMwi9x3DJHN.html

Dr Arindam Kar, head of the team of doctors treating Chatterjee, said, “His renal functions have taken a toll due to volume loss and some of the antibiotics that are not kidney-friendly. We have to get rid of the additional fluid and improve the renal function. We have decided on plasmapheresis and tracheostomy, which have been accepted by his family members, as a long-term care management.” The Dadasaheb Phalke Award winner (85) was admitted to the hospital on October 6 after he tested coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive. He tested Covid-19 negative on October 14, but his neurological system was affected because of the infection. Chatterjee’s health condition has drastically worsened over the past two weeks. The thespian is still drowsy. He had tried to open his eyes a few times over the last few days.“Our nephrologists and haematologists are discussing whether plasmapheresis will work for him. We will take a call on this on Monday. Tracheostomy will most likely be done on Monday, if the coagulation function and platelet count remain stable in the next 24 to 36 hours,” said Dr Kar. Plasmapheresis is a process in which the plasma is separated from the blood cells. The plasma is either replaced with saline or albumin or it is treated and injected back into a patient’s body. Tracheostomy is a medical procedure that involves creating an opening in the neck to place a tube into a patient’s windpipe. “His neurological functions are neither improving nor worsening. The lung functions are good. He is still on minimal ventilator support. Lever functions are more or less stable. Coagulation functions have improved. His haemoglobin count is normal. While his platelet count is over one lakh,” said Dr Kar. The doctors said Chatterjee’s infection is getting cured and he did not have a fever in the past two days. “We have stopped antibiotics from Saturday,” Dr Kar added. On November 2, he had undergone a vascular surgery to stop an internal bleeding, which was leading to loss of haemoglobin. Millions of people in Bengal and beyond have been praying for Chatterjee’s recovery ever since he was admitted to the hospital. Initially, the doctors made Chatterjee listen to music and audio clips of literature of his choice. He had also communicated with his daughter Poulomi Basu about two weeks ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/actor-soumitra-chatterjee-stable-but-his-kidney-functions-affected-doctors/story-WFk3RLA2v2M8QJ6mfm4hAK.html

In the ensuing firefight, two more terrorists were killed,” Kalia said.The colonel said that three army soldiers were killed in action and two wounded. “The injured soldiers have been evacuated to a medical facility,” he said.While the army was yet to reveal the details of those personnel who died in the line of duty, sources said that an officer was among the dead.The operation was going on till this report was being filed.On October 24, the army shot down a quadcopter along the Line of Control in the Keran sector in the Kupwara district. This was the first time when the quadcopter was shot down by the army in the sector.The LoC in north Kashmir this year witnessed a lot of action between the troops of India and Pakistan in Kupwara, Baramulla and Bandipora districts.On October 7, the army had said that Pakistan opened fire in what they said was an unprovoked ceasefire violation in Uri sector of Baramulla. On October 1, the Indian army had lost two soldiers in a ceasefire violation from the Pakistan side in Kupwara district.India and Pakistan, who have fought at-least three wars since 1947, had agreed in 2003 to maintain peace along the border, but violations intensified after bilateral relations plummeted in 2016. India often accuses Pak of violating the ceasefire to give cover to infiltrating terrorists. This year the army said that their forces have been able to stop three-fourth of infiltration of terrorists through the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir as compared to last year.Lt Gen B S Raju , GOC of army’s strategic Chinar Corps, on October 10 said that the forces have been able to stop infiltration to a great extent. “Last year around 130 persons had infiltrated and this year the figure is below 30. Such is the change. And I hope this will also lead to improvement in the internal situation,” he had said.The GOC had said that a few hundred militants were ready on the launch pads across the LoC. “As per our intelligence, around 250-300 terrorists are ready on launch pads on the Pakistan side to infiltrate. We have been able to stop them despite their efforts to infiltrate,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-foils-infiltration-attempt-eliminates-1-terrorist-at-j-k-s-machil-operation-underway/story-8Qld29F2akUBu4nUJPVFgI.html

The VHP which was one of the major players in the campaign for the Ram Temple at Ayodhya, is not keen to mark the anniversary of the court’s judgment since the temple construction has already begun.“Construction of the Ram temple has already begun after the Supreme Court’s historic judgment. Now, there is no point in organising any event to mark the anniversary of the court’s judgment,” said VHP’s Ayodhya-based regional spokesperson Sharad Sharma.“At the individual level, people can distribute sweets. But there will be no planned celebrations. Devotees will go to Ram Janmabhoomi to seek the blessings of Ram Lalla,” Sharma added. The saints of Ayodhya have also decided not to organise any public event. “Our larger objective was construction of the Ram temple which has now been fulfilled. Construction work has begun. A special puja ceremony will be organised at Mani Ram Das Chhavni Peeth but there will be no public gathering,” said Mahant Kamal Nayan Das.He is the successor designate of Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, chairman of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, no outsider will be allowed during the Deepotsav celebrations in Ayodhya or other festivities that will continue till Kartik Purnima on November 30.Only locals will be able to take part in celebrations with Covid -19 protocols. The boundaries of temple town will be sealed from November 11 to restrict the entry of people. The Ayodhya administration was expecting more crowd this year on Deepotsav and Kartik Purnima as work on the Ram temple has begun. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath will attend the Deepotsav celebrations in Ayodhya on November 13. The five-day celebrations will begin from November 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vhp-says-it-has-no-plans-to-mark-anniversary-of-sc-verdict-on-ram-temple/story-WrzCy1FD8ZVRSShEtAeoVK.html

It said Adityanath was personally monitoring the preparations for the Deepotsav and had already seen presentations on what is to take place and where.The chief minister also asserted that all Deepotsav celebrations in Ayodhya will be conducted under the Covid-19 guidelines. Adityanath also stressed on lighting diyas (earthen lamps) made of cow dung on Diwali. The chief minister will be in Ayodhya for Deepotsav to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla at Ram Janmabhoomi and light earthen lamps at Ram Ki Paidi. The Ayodhya administration will strive to set the Guinness world record on November 13 by lighting 5.51 lakh diyas on 28 ghats of the Saryu river. Last year, the Ayodhya administration created a Guinness World Record by lighting 4.10 lakh earthen lamps at the ghats. This will be the fourth consecutive Deepotsav in Ayodhya under the Yogi Adityanath regime. Though people are very excited over the Deepotsav, because of the Covid-19 pandemic, only a handful of people will be able to participate in the event physically this year, the spokesperson said.The people, however, will be able to celebrate the event digitally from the comfort of their home, he added.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-ram-temple-bhoomi-pujan-deepotsav-is-special-this-year-adityanath/story-o8tJimQAAtucKYVJezX8CJ.html

Online registration for the pilgrimage began on Saturday and is set to close on December 10, minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said. The pilgrimage was suspended this year due to the ongoing pandemic.“The applicants can apply online, off-line or through Haj mobile application as well. In view of the coronavirus pandemic, we are making it mandatory for all the pilgrims to submit their COVID-19 negative report of RT-PCR test. The date of testing should be 72 hours prior to boarding a flight to Saudi Arabia,” he said.Under the guidelines, the applications filed for Haj 2020 by women travelling without a male companion (without mehram category) will be valid for the next year’s pilgrimage also. The embarkation points for the pilgrimage have been reduced to 10 from the earlier 21. The embarkation points are Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Cochin, Delhi, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai and Srinagar, the ministry said.The guidelines for the pilgrimage were framed after deliberations that included officials from the ministries of minority affairs, health, external affairs, civil aviation; the Haj Committee of India, Indian Embassy in Saudi Arabia and India’s Consul General in Jeddah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-test-age-restriction-likely-for-haj-pilgrimage/story-a97i63S9cChy52R0iXICyL.html
08-11-2020||India||ISRO launches new earth observation satellite on board PSLV||India successfully launched an earth observation satellite EOS-01 and nine customer satellites on board its Polar rocket from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on Saturday.The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C49) lifted off from the first launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota at 3.11 PM at the end of a 26-hour countdown and injected the satellites into orbit one after another 20 minutes later.The lift off was delayed by nine minutes due to rain brought on by the winter monsoon, Isro said. This is the first mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation this year. The space agency had last launched a satellite on December 11 last year, when the PSLV had put in space an earth observation satellite similar to the one launched on Saturday.Apart from the Indian satellite, the launch vehicle carried on board an experimental satellite from Lithuania, four marine application satellites from Luxembourg, and four remote sensing satellites from the United States. The satellite launched on Saturday marked the beginning of a new nomenclature for the series of earth observation satellites with the name EOS-01. The satellite will be used for agriculture, forestry, and disaster management support. “This mission is very special and unusual for ISRO. Space activity cannot happen with work from home. Each and every space engineer has to be available in lab, industry, integration area as well as the field especially when we are talking about launch missions like this,” said ISRO chairperson K Sivan. He said the work was done keeping in mind safety of the team following health protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-launches-new-earth-observation-satellite-on-board-pslv/story-ad7E1eudxXB1DHrEjddYaP.html
08-11-2020||India||No immediate relief for Arnab Goswami as HC reserves order on bail||The Bombay high Court on Saturday reserved its order on the interim bail plea of Republic TV’s editor Arnab Goswami who was arrested by Alibag police in connection with a 2018 abetment to suicide case.The division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik said it would try to pronounce the order as early as possible. Goswami has been in judicial custody since Wednesday. The bench also allowed Goswami and two others arrested in the case, Firoz Sheikh and Nitish Sarda , to approach the sessions Court at Alibag for regular bail and asked that the court deal with this within four days. All three are in judicial custody till November 18. On Wednesday, the Republic TV editor moved high court questioning his arrest and sought immediate relief. His legal team argued that his arrest and detention were illegal, as the case, closed in April 2019 by filing an A- summary report, was being re-investigated without a necessary court order. They also argued that the police officer could not have reopened the case without first obtaining necessary order from the judicial magistrate concerned. Sheikh and Sarda followed suit and challenged their arrests in HC. The Maharashtra government on Saturday responded to the pleas, submitting that unlike B and C summary reports, A-summary reports aren’t closure reports, and that, therefore, no permission from the magistrate is required for further probe. Senior advocate Amit Desai, who represented the government, said A-summary indicates that the allegations made in the complaint are true, but no one can be prosecuted for want of adequate evidence. B summary means the allegations are found to be false, whereas C summary indicates that no offence is disclosed. Thus, Desai claimed, an A-summary report reflects an incomplete investigation and cannot be construed a closure report. He also pointed out that there was efficacious alternative remedy available to the accused, filing a regular bail application; filing habeas corpus petition was no substitute for bail application, and can’t be granted by way of interim relief when the petition itself was not maintainable, he added.The bench found merit in the submission. Judges said granting bail as interim relief in a writ petition will set a wrong precedent. “The current danger is that this court will be flooded with petitions seeking bail as interim relief,” said the bench. Goswami’s counsel, senior advocates Harish Salve and Aabad Ponda, insisted that the HC can grant bail in a writ petition and urged the bench to forthwith release Goswami on bail.The court on Saturday also issued notices to the state government and the accused in the case on a petition filed by Aadnya Naik, daughter of the deceased architect and interior designer Anvay Naik, challenging the April 2019 magisterial order closing the case.Anvay Naik, 53, died by suicide at his residence on May 5, 2018. His mother, Kumud, too, was found dead at their home. His wife Akshata lodged a complaint with police alleging that the two were forced to take the step as they were under mental stress because of non-payment of dues collectively amounting to ₹5.40 crore by Goswami and the two others, something that was also mentioned in a suicide note. After his arrest on November 4, Goswami’s news channel accused that he was “physically assaulted by the police” and forcefully taken away. Police, however, said nobody assaulted him. Later, the magistrate court rejected Goswami’s allegations after the police submitted his medical report.Also on Saturday, a sessions court in Alibag adjourned the hearing into the revision application filed by the local crime branch of Alibag police seeking custodial interrogation of Goswami and two others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-immediate-relief-for-arnab-goswami-as-hc-reserves-order-on-bail/story-SvwFBbtlWJHSDBR418UmsJ.html
08-11-2020||India||NIA widened probe to 14 states to crack case||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) investigated at least 6,500 people and conducted field verifications across least 14 states for nine months to catch two thieves who stole critical electronic components, including processors, Random Access Memory (RAM) and Solid State Drives from aboard INS Vikrant – India’s first Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC), under construction at the Cochin Ship Yard Limited (CSL). The theft took place sometime between July and September 2019 and it was suspected that there was a larger espionage network at work as the solid state drives went missing from five MFCs (multi function control) processors, critical equipment on a carrier. The NIA was handed over the probe on September 26, 2019. The agency found that 1,500 to 2,000 people worked on the aircraft carrier during the day; 600 to 700 worked overtime, after 6 pm; and 200 to 300 worked through the night. “Frisking all the persons entering or leaving the vessel, at the gangways, was not possible, while footage from two CCTV cameras installed on the gangway, was of low quality and hence not amenable to any technical analysis,” said an officer at the agency who didn’t want to be named. NIA officers, along with Kerala police, prepared a list of employees of CSL, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), Work Oversight Team (WOT) of Indian Navy and contractor Inelmech who had authorised access to INS Vikrant. A list of 3,638 contract employees who entered the shipyard between August and September 2019, besides those who had passes to work, and a total of 195 contractors was created. Teams were constituted to examine everyone. Everyone was subjected to layered voice analysis (LVA) – a technology used to identify the underlying emotion of a person, regardless of their language and tone of the speech. LVA technology uses bio-markers to trace the genuine emotion reflex that reveals the true sensations and feelings of a person. LVA was also conducted on 22 people no longer in India, using VoIP (Voice over internet Protocol) but nothing suspicious was found, the officer added. Several NIA teams travelled to 14 states -- Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Bihar, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Gujarat to conduct field verifications about former staff of CSL and their fingerprints were collected. By April 2020, finger/palm prints of 6,014 people were examined at the Single Digit Bureau, Kochi City to match with the seven prints lifted from the crime scene but it didn’t yield any result. Desperate to get a breakthrough, NIA announced a reward of ₹5 lakh for any information. Meanwhile, finger/palm prints of more people who entered INS Vikrant were examined and by June 3 a total of 6,504 prints were checked, said a second NIA officer. On June 3, the owner of Maxeve Engineering Constructions Pvt , engaged in painting work at INS Vikrant from September 2018 till 2019 informed the agency that some of his staff was involved in petty theft of power tools. Two employees, Sumit Kumar Singh, a native of Munger (Bihar) and Daya Ram, native of Hanumangarh (Rajasthan) came under the scanner after the right palm impression of Singh matched with one of the lifted prints. They were arrested on June 10. One stolen drive and a RAM was also recovered from Sumit’s place. Investigations revealed that they sold one processor over OLX in September 2019; this was recovered from the buyer. Both were chargesheeted in September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-widened-probe-to-14-states-to-crack-case/story-ocBjSA6SeL85DavmV0S7bL.html

As the VP, your contribution to strengthening Indo-US relations was critical and invaluable. I look forward to working closely together once again to take India-US relations to greater heights,” PM Modi tweeted on Sunday.Political leaders from around the world were quick to congratulate Joe Biden after US networks declared him the winner of the bitter White House race over President Donald Trump.As crowds poured onto the streets of Washington and other cities in exuberant celebration and former US president Barack Obama hailed Biden’s win as “decisive” and “historic”Democrat Joe Biden captured the US presidency on Saturday, several major television networks said, as voters narrowly rebuffed Republican incumbent Donald Trump’s tumultuous leadership and embraced Biden’s promise to fight the coronavirus pandemic and fix the economy in a divided nation.Additionally, Kamala Harris made history on Saturday with her election as Joe Biden’s vice president, becoming the first woman, first Black American and first Asian American to win the second highest US office.Biden had a 273 to 214 lead in the state-by-state Electoral College vote that determines the winner, having won Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes to put him over the 270 he needed to secure the presidency, according to Edison Research.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-congratules-us-president-elect-joe-biden-on-spectacular-victory/story-qtxL6ZO4lsY4VhgG56WneM.html
08-11-2020||India||TN Congress chief opposes release of convicts in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case||Tamil Nadu’s Congress chief K S Alagiri opposed the call by political parties, including its ally DMK for the release of the seven prisoners in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.“It is up to the court to decide whether to release the killers of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi,” he said in a statement on Saturday. “If they are released, there will be a demand for the release of all Tamil murderers who have been in prison for more than 25 years.”The demand to release all seven convicts - Nalini Sriharan, V Sriharan alias Murugan, A G Perarivalan, Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and P Ravichandran has been gaining momentum since the Supreme Court expressed unhappiness, earlier this week, over the recommendation for remission of sentence of Perarivalan pending with the Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit for more than two years. “We will accept the release of the seven people if the court announces it,” Alagiri said. “But it is not appropriate for political parties to demand their release.” The Tamil Nadu Congress Committee’s president’s stance comes in the backdrop of several parties including the AIADMK supporting the release of the convicts. DMK president MK Stalin wrote to the Governor to accept the recommendation without further delay. In 2014, the Supreme Court commuted the death penalty of Perarivalan and two other convicts (Murugan and Sathan) to life sentences. In 2018, Tamil Nadu government had recommended the release of Perarivalan after remitting his life sentence. But the Governor is said to be awaiting a report of the Multi Disciplinary Monitoring Agency which is looking into a ‘larger conspiracy in the case’.Governor Purohit met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah in Delhi on November 4 and on the following day he met vice-president Venkaiah Naidu to discuss “important issues of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-congress-chief-opposes-release-of-convicts-in-rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case/story-MWgDwWjYovoT0074LyHcUP.html

Covid-19 has changed the way things are being conducted today. Virtual reality and augmented reality are becoming the working reality now...it has taught us while globalisation is important, self-reliance is equally important. Today, a favourable environment has been created for the implementation of the ideas and innovation of technocrats and to scale them and market them easily. The country is now committed to giving you the ease of doing business so that you can work on providing ease of living to your countrymen through your ideas and innovations,” the Prime Minister said in his address as the chief guest at IIT Delhi’s 51st annual convocation ceremony, via video conferencing. Modi urged the students to work towards finding solutions to the country’s existing problems. “Indians have immense faith in technology… There are immense possibilities for you in the country and there are immense challenges confronting the country for which you can give solutions. A lot of work can be done in areas such as disaster management, maintaining the groundwater level, solar power generation, telemedicine, and big data analysis. I can place before you several other examples of the country’s needs,” he said. Modi added that the challenges could be addressed with innovations, new ideas, and efforts…“That is why it is my request to identify with the aspirations of the common people in the context of Atamnirbanar Bharat.” Modi asked the students to try to turn the adversity into opportunity amid the pandemic. “You may be feeling your batch is not lucky. I am sure you are asking why did this happen with our graduating batch. But think of it differently. You have a first-mover advantage. You have more time to learn and adapt to the new norms emerging in the workplace and beyond. So, make the most of it and look on the brighter side too,” he said. The Prime Minister gave four mantras to the students for their workplace. Focus on quality, never compromise, ensure scalability; make your innovations work at a mass scale. assure reliability; build long-term trust in the market and bring in adaptability; be open to change and expect uncertainty as a way of life. Modi asked the students to continue challenging themselves. “It is important that one keeps challenging oneself and continues to learn every day. It is also important that you treat yourself as a student for life. Never think that what you know is enough.” Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who was the guest of honour at the event, congratulated the graduating students for their hard work, commitment. He said, “A new chapter begins today that has to pass the test of the time and in future students should come back to your alma mater one day to offer your ‘Guru-Dakshina’. I appeal to you all to contribute to nation-building initiatives as we are the world’s biggest nation in terms of human capital, and we must all work towards fulfilling the vision of our Prime Minister in creating a 5 trillion dollar economy by 2024.” Nishank also launched an online certificate programme called e-VIDYA under which the institute will offer online certificate courses in areas like cyber-physical system, security, renewable energy storage, and conversion, embedded systems, machine learning, and construction project management, etc. During the convocation, 2,019 students were awarded degrees, of whom 873 are undergraduate students, 848 postgraduates, and 298 PhD scholars. Presenting the Director’s report on this occasion, IIT-D director V Ramgopal Rao said, “In the last five years, IIT Delhi faculty and students have written over 10,000 high-quality papers, filed over 500 patents, executed roughly 150 industry projects and obtained over Rs 1,300 crores of research funding from competitive grants from all over the world. We have also created 18 new Centers of Excellence with funding from alumni, industries, and government agencies in the last five years. These numbers are anywhere from 2 times to 4 times higher compared to any previous five-year periods since the inception of the institute.” ENDS||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-have-ease-of-doing-business-work-on-ease-of-living-modi-tells-iit-delhi-graduates/story-CVt5ZY7JW4j1j2QAVITcbK.html
08-11-2020||India||Sangh affiliate SJM opposes cracker ban||NEW DELHI: The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, has criticized the complete ban on firecrackers during Diwali in states like Delhi. It said it has been done even as green firecrackers certified by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute are known to cause 30% less pollution.SJM said the complete ban will adversely affect the industry in places like Tamil Nadu and West Bengal as well as the livelihoods of nearly one million.The SJM has opposed the bans saying they are based on “false propaganda in terms of ill effects of firecrackers.”SJM’s national co-convenor, Ashwani Mahajan, in a statement, said: “…For some time, without any factual information, governments have been taking action like banning all types of firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali, which is completely inappropriate.”Mahajan said it has to be understood that till now the pollution caused by firecrackers was primarily due to illegally imported firecrackers from China. “There has been pollution due to the mixing of potassium nitrate and sulfur in Chinese firecrackers.” He backed green firecrackers and said the “pollution-free firecrackers” are made in India and are free from potassium nitrate and sulfur and other pollutants such as aluminium, lithium, arsenic, and mercury have been reduced to the minimum.SJM asked the governments to revisit the ban on all types of firecrackers. It regretted that government agencies have failed to solve the problem of stubble burning, which contributes to pollution in the national capital and surrounding areas.“Swadeshi Jagran Manch also urges all state governments to make efforts to find a permanent solution to the problem of pollution of stubble burning. Swadeshi Jagran Manch wishes to underline that the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its order in October 2018 has given permission to firecrackers for two hours on the occasion of Deepawali, keeping in view the tradition of burning firecrackers on the occasion of Deepawali and the livelihood of lakhs of people engaged in cracker production,” Mahajan said.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of Centre for Science and Environment however underlined the need for public awareness and support to back regulations banning the use of firecrackers. She said the health care sector is already overburdened by the coronavirus pandemic and the worsening air quality will further impact the delivery of care. “This year we have a special challenge, apart from respiratory problems caused by air pollution, we have corona as well. Doctors have presented evidence that air pollution exacerbates corona. We need more public support and awareness about the impact of concentrated bursting of firecrackers on air pollution,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sangh-affiliate-opposes-cracker-ban/story-e9aLwbN2TexH6zGxrjjg7K.html
08-11-2020||Editorials||The likely emergence of Tejashwi Yadav | HT Editorial||Exit polls, conducted after the three phases of the Bihar assembly elections, are out. And they either show a decisive win for the Mahagatbandhan (grand alliance of the Opposition parties, led by Tejashwi Yadav), or a close contest with an edge to the grouping led by Mr Yadav, with the incumbent National Democratic Alliance (NDA) slipping. If the exit polls have captured the trend correctly — do note that many exit polls have often got it wrong, and Hindustan Times has not independently verified the results — it will mark a significant rupture in Indian politics.After 15 years in power — with a short nine-month break — Nitish Kumar may exit Patna’s secretariat. For the second time in a row, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) may fail to win the confidence of Bihar’s voters. New social equations may form. And it will mark the emergence of the youngest possible chief minister in India — Tejashwi Yadav will turn 31 on Monday.Mr Yadav, as Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi’s son, grew up, surrounded by power. But politics has also tested him. His party lost two state elections and won the third only to lose power in a short time because Mr Kumar shifted sides. He also saw two Lok Sabha losses and his father get convicted. But Mr Yadav’s campaign showed that what he appears to have drawn from these setbacks is the need to find a new vocabulary of politics — with a clear focus on bread and butter issues that matter — combined with a more inclusive social alliance. If he does succeed, his challenge will be translating this vision into governance. But even if he doesn’t make it, Mr Yadav’s rise has signalled that citizens want economic relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-likely-emergence-of-tejashwi-yadav-ht-editorial/story-AqI64GXhmK7jzJRfs3aJeM.html
08-11-2020||Editorials||Groundwork done, Modi govt all set to deal with incoming Biden administration | Analysis||The White House will have a new occupant shortly. What does this mean for India? The Modi government’s connection with President elect Joe Biden goes back to the days when External Affairs S. Jaishankar was Indian Ambassador to US during the Obama administration and present Ambassador to US Taranjit Singh Sandhu was his deputy. The two have kept in touch with close advisors of President elect Biden ensuring that US maintains its bipartisan consensus towards India.As far as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is concerned, he runs foreign policy on a personal touch with Indian interests as a top priority. He only gives up on a country or an institution after the latter shows duplicity in bilateral relations. No marks for guessing the countries in that category.While the Indian foreign policy will indeed have to recalibrate its approach towards the incoming Biden administration, New Delhi knows that president-elect is a collegial guy, who was more approachable to Republican adversaries as a vice president than the president during the Obama years. A quintessential politician who stayed more than half his life in Washington and knows the wrangling at Capitol Hill.Unlike President Trump who hid his strategy behind a brash style, the incoming President will be more predictable in dealing with the world. He is expected to be tough yet not confrontational with China, will mend fences with Europe and be slightly rough with Russia. Even though the Chinese experts are gloating over President Trump’s defeat, the US system now firmly believes that Beijing is not only an adversary but also a threat to future. So one should not expect bombastic statements against the Communist Party of China during Biden-era but US policy on China has turned full circle and there should be a build-up on the Asia pivot that was promised but not delivered in the Obama administration. Trump, on his part, may be down but not out and will campaign for the Senate run-offs in Georgia to remain politically relevant in Republican party.China’s all weather ally Pakistan also heaving a sigh of relief at the exit of President Trump but New Delhi believes that incoming administration will be tough on terrorism, particularly after the recent Islamist attacks in Europe by migrants. The president-elect will continue with past policy of exiting from Afghanistan but that won’t be easy as the US intelligence agencies and Pentagon (Trump dismissed their advice) have been reporting the escalation of Taliban violence with the backing of Haqqani network and Quetta based Shura with direct involvement of Pakistan deep state. As president-elect is expected to work with expert advice on Afghanistan, then the role of British, who are tied up with Pakistan, may diminish in the near future. Islamabad’s double play in Afghanistan is now known to its former friends like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia with proof. Pakistan’s problem in fact may multiply with president-elect Biden having a very poor opinion about Islamabad’s newfound ally Turkey. Iran’s belief that US sanctions may be lifted by incoming Biden administration’s hitching back with Europe on nuclear deal with Tehran may come true as the new administration will move towards multilateralism, which was scorned by the present Trump administration. With the US expected to seek accommodation with Europe on global issues like Climate Change and health due to on-going pandemic, frayed ties with Germany will be on the mend. The US ties with Russia are expected to decline further under the incoming administration.While New Delhi will wait till January 2021 for formal engagement with the new administration, it appears most confident in dealing with the new occupant of the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/groundwork-done-modi-govt-all-set-to-deal-with-incoming-biden-administration-analysis/story-kEjqnMeyVjvrMptWRVksvJ.html
