19-11-2020||News||In Bihar, how caste shapes politics and governance||What does the Bihar election say about the social balance of power? Though most parties attempted to reach out beyond their core social base, there were some predictable patterns. About half the candidates fielded by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) belonged to the forward castes and, according to the Lokniti-CSDS post-poll, most upper-caste voters supported the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Half the tickets in the RJD went to Yadavs and Muslims who overwhelmingly voted for it. The Kurmis and Extreme Backward Classes (EBCs) supported the Janata Dal (United). It is no surprise that caste matters in elections, but should it matter in what the sarkar does? Do historical trends teach us something about the kind of policies that the next government is likely to prioritise?In the first few decades after Independence, the forward castes in the Congress dominated Bihar politics. Upper caste landlords consistently made up more than 40% of the ruling alliance until the 1990 elections. More than a third of the state budget in these decades, perhaps not surprisingly, went into investments in agriculture and irrigation. An Other Backward Caste (OBC) middle-class began to emerge from the 1950s after the abolition of zamindari and due to the gains of the Green Revolution. As the stronghold of upper caste landlords weakened, Yadavs, Kurmis and Koeris asserted themselves politically. This was first reflected in caste conflict within the Congress. As Samuel Huntington predicted, the inability of existing institutions to absorb the rising social mobilisation resulted in political chaos. Between 1967 and 1972, Bihar went through nine different changes in government and three periods of President’s Rule.The decline of the Congress in 1967 created the space for smaller parties to emerge. This period further witnessed the emergence of the Jayaprakash Narayan (JP) movement. Most contemporary OBC political leaders, including Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar, trace their political career to the JP movement. The first non-Congress government, led by Karpoori Thakur, won in 1977. And, in 1990, the first OBC-majority government led by Prasad assumed power. This election marked an end to upper caste dominance in Bihar.The RJD’s poor record in governance is no secret. The state’s development expenditure declined in both absolute terms as well as in proportion to its overall budget. As the rest of the country reaped the benefits of economic liberalisation, Bihar’s per capita income declined. But this period proved to be transformational for lower caste empowerment. For the first time, social justice was explicitly discussed in the state assembly. In fact, about 20% of the policy speeches were devoted to identity-based issues. Appointment of lower caste officials in positions of power became the key agenda of the government. Based on my primary research, though the higher bureaucracy remained dominated by upper castes, Yadav and Muslim state civil officers were five times more likely to be promoted to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) under the RJD. More importantly, at the local level, the proportion of OBC and Dalit BDOs and SHOs doubled in this period. In the process though, chain of command and official procedures were broken. Power came to be centralised in the Chief Minister’s Office. To avoid perpetuating upper caste dominance in the bureaucracy, positions remain vacant. State capacity deteriorated as a result.The next 15 years, under Nitish Kumar, represents yet another distinct phase in the state’s politics. A Brahmin CM would be unimaginable in contemporary Bihar, but upper caste representation in the government increased once again under the BJP-JD(U) alliance. According to the data from the Trivedi Centre for Political Data, the proportion of upper castes in 2020 is even higher than the last election. This has implications for policy.While State capacity during the RJD tenure was low, spending patterns shifted towards social sectors. Under the JD(U)-BJP alliance, the state witnessed a proportional increase in economic spending, with the most dramatic increases in roads. Absolute spending in social sectors too increased, in large part due to greater availability of resources from the Centre.While it is difficult to predict the policy agenda of the government in the next five years, past trends strongly suggest two outcomes. One, the presence of BJP at both the Centre and the state will help Bihar fiscally through central transfers. And two, a larger share of these resources is likely to be devoted to economic sectors. Research suggests that greater representation of upper castes leads to sharper focus on growth-oriented, rather than redistributive policies, even after we account for other factors such as political ideology, participation, income, and State capacity.In short, caste and caste-based representation matter in not just understanding the outcome of elections, but also matter for policy. Who is in power in the state has a bearing on what the state does.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-bihar-how-caste-shapes-politics-and-governance/story-p4qsmLi3zNY5Apfz3eYR2L.html
19-11-2020||Mumbai||Sushant Singh Rajput death: Australian national held in drugs case granted bail||A special holiday court on Thursday granted bail to Australian national Paul Bartel who was held in connection with the drug trail linked to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had arrested Bartel on Friday alleging that he was in touch with arrested accused and drug supplier Agisilaos Demetriades, a South African national and brother of actor Arjun Rampal’s girlfriend Gabriella.On Thursday, Bartel’s lawyers Abad Ponda and Subhash Jadhav contended that the agency has no evidence to link him to the drug trail.The agency has relied on the WhatsApp chat of Bartel with two other accused — Demetriades and Nikhil Saldahna, and claimed that Bartel is a drug supplier.The court, however, noted, “In the absence of any substantial material, taking into account the fact that no contraband was recovered from the accused and except the statements of co-accused and WhatsApp messages, there is no substantial evidence to treat the accused as peddler/supplier of drugs; it may not be justified to refuse to extend the concession of bail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sushant-singh-rajput-death-australian-national-held-in-drugs-case-granted-bail/story-ven41Ijba55e0xpXyS7HiJ.html
19-11-2020||Mumbai||BJP leader Kirit Somaiya targets Aaditya Thackeray; Shiv Sena rubbishes allegations||After targeting chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s wife, Rashmi, over a land deal, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya on Thursday alleged the CM’s son, Aaditya Thackeray, who is also the state environment minister, violated the office of profit rules by holding a position in a private firm even three months after he was sworn in as a minister.While Shiv Sena rubbished the allegations and said that they do not take Somaiya seriously, Aaditya Thackeray did not respond to the calls and text messages.Somaiya, at a press conference, said as per records with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Aaditya was designated partner in M/S Hibiscus Food LLP (limited liability partnership) and Eliora Solar LLP until March 31, 2020, before he resigned, almost three months after he was sworn in as a minister in the state cabinet. He was designated partner of the first entity since July 14, 2015, and in the second firm since April 26, 2015, Somaiya said.“Aaditya was actively involved in the real estate business even after being sworn in as a minister last year. This is a clear violation of office of profit law. The family should also clarify whether Aaditya is in partnership with a leading Thane-based developer. The family has been misusing their position for their land and building businesses. In his election affidavit, CM Thackeray has shown three land records twice and it needs to be clarified if there was any intention of hiding other three plots,” Somaiya said. “As per rule 2(1) (X) of the Limited Liability Rules, 2009, an officer of the LLP means all of them who are partners, designated partners, employees and any person under whose directions/instructions the partners of the LLP has been accustomed to act. Aaditya was in an executive position in the firms and it leads to the violation of the office of profit law.”Somaiya said in the affidavit submitted by the CM in his Legislative Council election in May, three survey numbers 42/1/B, 43/1/D/3 and 41/1/A/1 have been shown twice in the column describing the land parcels owned by his wife, Rashmi. Somaiya said the CM should clarify this as the “people of Maharashtra would like to know about the details, the legal provisions, the role of Thackeray family members in these companies and deals”.Sena legislator from Dindoshi and the party’s chief whip in Assembly Sunil Prabhu said, “There is nothing wrong in holding a position in any company and I do not think it has led to any type of violation of office of profit law. I have not gone into the details of allegations, but I am sure there was no violation done by Aadityaji. As far as the land deals are concerned, everything was transparent and shown in income-tax returns and election affidavits. Somaiya has been doing this for publicity.”Somaiya had last week raised questions over the joint land purchase deals by Rashmi Thackeray and Manisha Waikar, wife of Sena legislator Ravindra Waikar. The land parcels were purchased from Anvay Naik and his family in 2014. Naik died by suicide in May 2018, holding journalist Arnab Goswami responsible in his suicide note. Waikar had then clarified that the transactions were mentioned in the income-tax returns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bjp-leader-kirit-somaiya-targets-aaditya-thackeray-shiv-sena-rubbishes-allegations/story-YulXMT2b1XyQPd7GyBSJ6L.html

A case has been registered at the Sector 20 police station in this regard.The woman has filed a complaint against her husband, who is a 32-year-old gym instructor, as well as his maternal uncle and friend. The complainant stated that she first met the suspect in December 2019 at a gym in Delhi.“He was a dedicated instructor and directed me for fitness training and diet control. We were on good terms and would sometimes help him financially. But he never shared details about his family, except to say that his father had passed away. In April 2020 he asked me to marry him,” stated the woman.However, he did not want to include the woman’s family in the wedding. “I kept using the Covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to avoid discussing this but he kept pushing me. One day when I met him in May, he surprised me with traditional wear and took me to a temple in Delhi. I even asked him how the temple was open during the lockdown and he said that the priest was an acquaintance. A friend of his was there who acted as a witness and clicked photos and made videos while we married,” she alleged.She alleged that the man’s behaviour towards her became very aggressive after that. On May 16, the woman said she came back to her family and filed a marriage dissolution application. She said later she found out that he belonged to a different religion and had made fake documents for identity and educational qualifications.“We were then approached by a man who demanded that my family pay him as well as my husband Rs 25 lakh to end the marriage. He threatened to release objectionable photos of mine on social media and demanded Rs 2 lakh in cash immediately, which we paid them after they threatened us with connections to powerful people,” alleged the woman in her complaint.Based on her complaint, a case was registered at the Sector 20 police station for cheating, extortion and criminal intimidation, among others.“The husband is a Delhi resident and is absconding from his house, along with other family members. His parents have different religions, of which he did not inform the woman. A probe in the matter is underway and we will know more once he is nabbed,” said RK Singh, station house officer, Sector 20 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-woman-alleges-blackmail-by-husband-over-divorce-fir-filed/story-CyrnWOggEApLrdYErTg9SM.html
19-11-2020||Noida||Noida: District lawyers strike against police ‘misconduct’||Greater Noida: Lawyers of the Surajpur district court went on strike on Thursday to protest against the alleged misconduct of police personnel with advocates. Lawyers gathered in the morning at the court premises and locked the gates, keeping police personnel from entering the grounds. This comes a day after some police personnel allegedly misbehaved with a lawyer at the executive magistrate’s office in Sector 6. The protesting counsels alleged that the lawyer who had gone to the Sector 6 office with a client, who had been booked under Section 151 (cognisable offences) of the CrPC, was told by police personnel to leave and not interfere with their proceedings. The protesting lawyers alleged that the lawyer in question and an assistant commissioner of police had an argument as well. “They misbehaved with him and the conduct of the police with lawyers is often like that. We get no support from them, are often insulted at police stations and instead of working with us, they often create roadblocks for us,” alleged Ranpal Awana, an advocate with the district court.The lawyers said that they will speak with senior police personnel and if they are satisfied with improvements and developments, the strike will be called off but for now, they will continue to protest.A senior police official, on condition of anonymity, said that the lawyer in Sector 6 was pulled up over his alleged interference in magisterial proceedings despite several warnings.“He kept treating the executive magistrate like a mere cop even though everything was being carried out in the chamber according to procedure, thereby reducing the dignity of the proceedings and the officer. He kept on interfering and was warned several times,” said the police officer.When contacted, the joint commissioner of police of Gautam Budh Nagar district said that the allegations of both sides are being looked into.“We have spoken to the lawyers and are working on rectifying the situation as soon as possible while listening to both sides,” said joint commissioner of police, Luv Kumar.Police said they are also working on installing CCTV cameras at the office to keep from such issues from arising again in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-district-lawyers-strike-against-police-misconduct/story-aMWxSkXYgggsg4lI1gZncI.html

19-11-2020||Noida||New education policy promotes multidisciplinary studies, says HRD minister||Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Thursday urged students to work towards nation building in an effort to make India a “vishwaguru (global teacher)”. He said that the newly implemented National Education Policy (NEP) was historic as it promoted regional languages and multidisciplinary studies. “India had great mathematician like Aryabhata and philosopher Nagarjuna. We had the world’s best and oldest universities like Nalanda, and Takshila/Taxila. We need to make India great. We have a tradition of shiksha, diksha and then gurudakshna. We want the students to make India vishwaguru as gurudakshna,” Pokhriyal said 35 minute speech delivered in Hindi during Sharda University’s fourth convocation day.Pokhriyal said that India had an asset of 330 million students. “These students in different colleges and universities have done great research in the recent times. Even in medical fields, the students have done research on Covid-19 vaccine. They have produced PPE kits, masks and other safety equipments and medicines. We have become self dependent in medical sciences due to our young students and researchers,” he said. The education minister said that the former prime ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given slogans “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan,” and “Jai Jawan Jai Kisan Jai Vigyan” respectively. Pokhriyal added that PM Narendra Modi had added “Anusandhan” in this slogan to promote research. On the NEP, the minister said, “A student of science can opt papers of arts, and vice versa. The students will have options to exit in the middle of the course if they want to due to any problem. The students will be given certificates, diplomas and degrees based on their credit completed. There is also option for them to continue the education later. We will promote education in 22 regional languages through the new education policy. We will also introduce artificial intelligence programmes in schools and colleges... We have seen that Japan, France and Israel, etc. provide education in their own mother languages and excel in different fields,” Phokriyal said. Sharda University on Thursday conferred degrees to 3593 graduate students, 1203 post graduate students, and 51 Phd candidates. Pokhriyal, along with Meghalaya CM Conrad Sangma, and Ravi P Singh, secretary general Quality Council of India were conferred upon honorary Phd degrees by the University. They also inaugurated University’s modern library on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/new-education-policy-promotes-multidisciplinary-studies-says-hrd-minister/story-SyH7yfcbc6VwoQlC3qLyzH.html
19-11-2020||Noida||Banyan tree chopped off: After complaints to UP officials, Ghaziabad forest department initiate inquiry||Following complaints from environmentalists over chopping the branches of a banyan tree on Hapur Road in Ghaziabad, the divisional forest officer has initiated an inquiry into the incident.The district forest officials had earlier given permission to translocate the tree to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) campus near Govindpuram. However, the NDRF confirmed that they had not given permission to translocate the tree to their campus.Divisional forest officer (DFO) Diksha Bhandari on Thursday said that she is conducting an inquiry and have sought explanation from her subordinate officers. Earlier, Bhandari had said that she had given permission to translocate the tree in public interest citing obstructing traffic.“I am conducting an inquiry and will be submitting the report to chief conservator of forest (Meerut). I have sought an explanation from the forest ranger who had initially given to me in writing that the NDRF had given verbal permission for translocation. But their officials got transferred in between,” she said. But now the tree will not be translocated.“We plan to strengthen the base of the tree and if the public does not want translocation, we will allow it to grow at the same place. Even if NDRF had not given permission in writing we have enough forest areas available with us and could have translocated it elsewhere. So we are now maintaining status quo,” she said. Dr Rajiv Kumar Garg, UP’s principal chief conservator of forest, said he will get the incident inquired in detail and would seek more details whether the procedures were followed or not. “Translocation is always a costly affair and it requires a lot of expertise. There are chances that the tree which is translocated may not survive. It seems there have been some issues for which I will seek details from officials and get the entire incident inquired in detail,” Garg said. Environmentalists have alleged that there were several “procedural lapses” during the incident and have also demanded action. “The permission on November 7 was given for translocation. When there was no permission from the NDRF then why the chopping activity was initiated and what was the motive behind it? If the subordinate officials had given in writing about any such permission (from NDRF) to the DFO it amounts to concealment of facts,” said Akash Vashishtha, city-based environmentalist and a lawyer. “Instead, the DFO should also have demanded a copy of written permission by the NDRF from her officers. We have raised the issue with the PCCF, UP and will raise complaints to the highest level with the Ministry of Forest. There seem to be series of irregularities and action should follow. The inquiry by the DFO will be incomplete if the lapses and motive are not brought to fore,” he added. Ruchin Mehra, another environmentalist, said that he had raised two objections on the Integrated Grievance Redressal System of the UP government on September 5 and September 26 against the chopping of the tree and the chopping activity was stalled and translocation permission was issued instead. “We have failed to understand if there was no permission from NDRF then why the activity was initiated so hurriedly? Now, they are planning not to relocate the tree. By entire sequence it seems that someone had motive to get the tree chopped off by one way or the other. Instead, this is an old tree in the heart of the city and should have been preserved,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/banyan-tree-chopped-off-after-complaints-to-up-officials-ghaziabad-forest-department-initiate-inquiry/story-8NcEytqVgajbhq32prOV5N.html

19-11-2020||Noida||In Ghaziabad, those who accompany Covid-19 patients to hospitals to be tested too||Ghaziabad: In order to deal with post-festival rise in the number of coronavirus (Covid-19) disease patients and also to bring the attendants of Covid-19 positive patients under the testing net, Ghaziabad on Thursday issued directions to all hospitals that details of every attendant coming to hospitals along with positive patients be made available to the district administration. Officials said that they have also asked private hospitals to increase the number of ICU beds and also reserve at least 20% of the same.Officials said they are gearing up for any possible spike in Covid-19 cases and have directed for measures. In this connection, district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey held meetings with office bearers of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) along with officials of various private hospitals. “As part of a more comprehensive strategy to deal with high-risk groups, we have asked hospitals to note down details of every attendant who is coming to the hospital along with Covid-19 positive patients. Such persons will also include drivers of any private cabs. Once the details are received at our control room, we will encourage these persons to get tested. Although we already have teams for contact tracing but such persons are at high risk as they come in direct contact with positive patients,” Pandey said. He said that he had also asked hospitals and sought support from the IMA, Ghaziabad for more ICU beds and to reserve at least 20% ICU beds for patients who may need referral from government hospitals. “The hospitals have agreed to 20% reservation as there is already a government order which directs for 50% reservation. But, gauging the present requirement, we have asked them to reserve only 20% at present. In case need be, we will scale the number of reserved beds further,” the DM added. According to the health department, there are 13 private hospitals which provide paid treatment to Covid-19 patients in the district and have a combined strength of 934 beds. Overall, they said, the district has 189 ICU beds which include 34 in government hospitals and rest 155 in private hospitals.“We have assured the administration that hospitals will increase beds and also ICU beds. There is one more private hospital with 100 beds which will start functioning and it also has 30 ICU beds. So, it is estimated that the private setup will be able to add about 50-75 beds in coming days,” said Dr Ashish Agrawal, president of IMA – Ghaziabad. He said that the requirement of reservation of 20% of ICU beds will also be fulfilled. “In case need be, the hospitals will increase the beds and keep 20% ICU beds reserved. So, the 20% of ICU beds will be made available. There is focus on ICU beds as we are witnessing that that severity of the disease has increased in present times and patients require more of L3 category treatment,” he added. The L1, L2 and L3 category hospitals are part of the state government’s three-tier hospital structure to deal with Sars-Cov-2 patients. The L1 are basically for asymptomatic patients while L2 and L3 hospitals deal with patients who suffer moderate and severe symptoms, respectively. The district administration has chalked out a comprehensive “post festival strategy” to deal with any rise in Covid-19 cases. The plan will be put in place after the end of Chhath festivities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/in-ghaziabad-those-who-accompany-covid-19-patients-to-hospitals-to-be-tested-too/story-6nlZCXd3i1UVyFBE78ByvO.html

19-11-2020||Gurugram||Wind from snowy regions help cool city||Gurugram recorded a minimum temperature of 10°C on Thursday, the lowest of this season so far. The maximum temperature was recorded at 24.1°C, four degrees below the normal. Weater experts said that recent snowfall in the northern hills and winds blowing in from them helped bring down temperature.India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said that the minimum temperatures were likely to fall gradually by another 2-4°C over northwest India in the next three days. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that the minimum temperature was expected to drop under 10°C by the end of the week. As per the IMD’s weekly forecast, both the minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to hover around 10°C and 24°C, respectively on Friday. As per the weekly forecast, clear skies will prevail during the day this whole week. Navdeep Dahiya, a Rohtak-based meteorologist, said that the minimum temperature could hover around 7-8 °C from November 22 while the maximum temperature would stay around 23-24°C. “The wind direction has changed from easterly to north-westerly. Cold winds are blowing from the Himalayas where snowfall has taken place. These cold winds from the mountain have brought down the temperature. The temperature will continue to be in a similar range for the next days and will dip further from November 22,” said Dahiya.The air quality in the city deteriorated to the ‘poor’ category on Thursday with a reading of 253 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This is significantly up from Wednesdays AQI reading of 141 in the ‘moderate’ category. Experts said that with the dip in temperature, air quality was expected to deteriorate on account of thermal inversion and lowering of mixing height. According to the early air quality warning system for Delhi-NCR, the air quality is likely to improve but remain in the ‘poor’ category on Friday. The air quality is likely to stay in the ‘poor’ to ‘moderate’ category on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/wind-from-snowy-regions-help-cool-city/story-9ZX3B1CkSWp3nPlyVPmuEJ.html

Police say these are from the same body. In long-drawn investigations into a major incident of crime after the Covid-19 lockdown, police have so far scanned all the records of pregnant women in the city and reached a dead end.Three-month records of pregnant women from various hospitals had been sought by police to identify the person whose feet had been severed, but no leads have been established.Information shared with Haryana and Punjab too did not yield any results, with investigation delays attributed to skeleton staff in offices and police stations due Covid-19.On June 23, Ajit Kishori, a manager at the State Bank of India (SBI)’s local head office in Sector 17 was walking on the cycle tracks after lunch when he spotted a detached human foot wrapped in a newspaper. Police reached the spot on receiving his call and recovered another foot as well as a foetus close by.Postmortem had revealed that the feet were that of a woman severed from the body after death while the eight-month foetus had died due to haemorrhagic shock (extreme blood loss due to broken blood vessels). It also had injury marks around the head and neck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dna-match-found-between-severed-feet-and-foetus-recovered-in-chandigarh-s-sector-17/story-UgRsEQkhSx7PvRnMlo0OYN.html
19-11-2020||Gurugram||Schools asked to strictly enforce safety measures in view of cases among students||The state education department has directed schools to ensure that all Covid-19 measures, such as temperature checks and physical distancing, are strictly enforced, after over 150 government school students in Jhajjar, Jind and Rewari districts tested positive for Covid-19 this week. In a directive shared with district education officers of all districts on Thursday, the directorate of school education said that schools needed to comply with the standard operating procedures and share daily data about temperature readings of students and teachers. Reiterating the norms in place, the directorate said that all students needed to undergo thermal scanning on a daily basis at designated spots within the school. Further, the temperature readings of students and teachers need to be shared with the department via a mobile application. The department has also asked schools to share details of students who are being turned away on account of high body temperatures. Gurugram block education officer Sheel Kumari said that while schools were already complying with temperature checks and other procedures, the directive will ensure there is no scope for laxity of any kind. “We have been adopting precautionary measures since schools reopened. Each school has been asked to maintain a record of the daily temperature readings of students and teachers. We have also noticed that many staff members testing positive are asymptomatic. Keeping these things in mind, we asked schools to ensure that daily updates are sent to the department without any delay,” said Kumari. Suman Sharma, the principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, said that the department had asked schools to share details, especially that of teachers and students having high body temperatures, with the health department without delay. “As per the Covid-19 protocols in place for schools, we are required to upload daily data on an app. While we have been doing it without fail since classes started in school, the department has sent a reminder to all schools in view of the rising cases and laxity in some schools. If we find a student with a high temperature, the parents are informed and asked to get the child immediately,” said Sharma.Shyam Raghav, the principal of Government Senior Secondary School, Bhondsi, said that the school had designated staff members for carrying out temperature checks and had not recorded any case of people with high temperatures entering the school. “As per the norms in place, any student with a high body temperature needs to be isolated immediately. Until now, we have not had a single case where students have been found with a high temperature or tested positive,” said Raghav. He said that only 40-50% of students had been visiting the school for classes.Gurugram’s chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav said that students, teachers and other staff members could get tested at Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHC) if they experienced symptoms or suspected that they had contracted the virus. He said that the department was, however, not carrying out any special drive to test all schools. “The health department had assisted schools in getting teachers tested earlier when schools started academic guidance sessions. Students and teachers are free to visit any health centre for testing. We will get the tests done if people visit the centre. The health department is not undertaking any new testing drive catering specifically to schools,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/schools-asked-to-strictly-enforce-safety-measures-in-view-of-cases-among-students/story-3wsLvYfC73PipwSS7pIZzH.html
19-11-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram hits 6k tests per day, positivity rate down||The district on Thursday, setting a record for the number of tests in a day, tested 6,036 samples for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Of these, about 25%, or 1,475 samples, were tested using rapid antigen tests while the remaining 4,561 samples were tested using the Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. This development marks a nearly 40% increase in daily tests from the previous record — of 4,300 tests — logged just a day prior.On Thursday, Gurugram reported 645 new infections, taking the total number of cases in the district to 41,825.Officials in the health department attributed Thursday’s spurt in testing to fresh supplies of antigen kits, use of which had slowed down, to between 300 and 400 tests per day, earlier this month due to supply issues. “We are expecting to continue conducting about 6,000 daily tests in the district, with an increase in rapid antigen kits in coming days, since the availability issue has been resolved,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.Yadav added that this boost in testing would suffice in bringing down the district’s test-positivity rate, which has hovered between 15% to 18% over the past two weeks. This was indeed the case on Thursday. With just 645 samples of 6,036 testing positive for the virus, as against 659 positives out of 4,324 samples on Wednesday, the daily district’s daily test-positivity rate dropped from 15% to 10% in a single day. Officials said this is a positive sign. “We are hoping to see this same trend in the next few days. If the positivity rate doesn’t start climbing again, we can expect the number of daily new cases to start coming down soon. This will also depend on how soon colder temperatures set in, which may cause cases to spike. It’s still too early to say if we are past a third peak,” said Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer, Gurugram. The health department on Thursday also said that it may seek assistance from private laboratories in the district to help boost testing for Covid-19, as the outbreak progresses into the winter. Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with three private labs in the district, signed soon after the epidemic hit Gurugram earlier this year, remain valid, with the health department likely to leverage their infrastructure in coming weeks, officials said. The three laboratories with which MoUs have been signed are located in Udyog Vihar, Sector 18 and Sector 34. “In all, these labs can each test at least 3,000 samples per day, and MoUs with them have already been signed months ago. The labs presently are not testing anywhere near their full capacity, so the available resources are on standby for us, when we need it. The department has sent samples to these labs earlier, when its daily capacity had been exhausted. If things worsen in a few weeks, we will not face any resource constraint,” said Yadav.As of Thursday, the total tally of positive cases in the district stands at 41,825. Of these 5,543 are active patients. While 426 active cases are hospitalised, 5,110 are under home isolation and seven are under observation at district Covid care centres. Gurugram also recorded three Covid-19 related deaths on Thursday, taking the total toll to 253.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-hits-6k-tests-per-day-positivity-rate-down/story-xVwhCA5TiltMJMs3ya2jkN.html
19-11-2020||Gurugram||Ardee City residents find power supply cut; discom points to unpaid dues||Residents of Palm Grove Heights condominium in Ardee City were in for a shock on Wednesday evening after the discom Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) disconnected the power supply for non-payment of dues that it claimed collectively ran over ₹1 crore. The residents, however, said that they paid the dues to the developer regularly who did not pay the power utility. The developer has denied this.In the adjacent Ardee City plotted colony too, residents complained that power connection of 15 to 20 houses was disconnected despite them either not having received the bills or had been regular with payment. Colony residents pay their bills directly rather than to any developer.Mayank Agarwal, a resident of Palm Grove condominium, which is a part of Ardee City, complained that the connection was cut despite meeting the DHBVN officials and assuring them that they would make the payment within a day or two. “There are around 20 Covid-19 patients in the apartments and around 2,000 residents were impacted. The payment has not been made by the developer,” said Agarwal. Brigadier (retd) MJS Sandhu, who is the president of apartment owners association, said that the residents have been paying rental to the developer every two months. “Around ₹1.40 crore is pending as bill and due to the power disconnection the residents are facing a lot of problems. The residents had gone to meet the DHBVN officials but there was no solution. This is nothing but harassment,” he said. In Ardee City colony, a number of residents alleged that the DHBVN had disconnected power without giving them any notice or bill. Surinder Kaul, a senior citizen, said, “I didn’t receive any bill since August when I had paid my dues last. We are senior citizens living alone and it is difficult to survive without electricity. I called several DHBVN officials in the evening but there was no response. I spent the whole Thursday trying to meet the officials. I hope this is not repeated.”Pravin Yadav, president, Ardee City RWA, said that no notice was issued to residents for disconnection of power. “The residents are suffering because the bills were either delayed or not issued at all,” he said. The developer of Palm Grove Heights condominium and Ardee City, Ardee Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, when asked about the matter said that residents of Palm Grove Heights condominium had not paid electricity bills for the last eight months. “The consumers have to pay electricity bills and these have remained unpaid for last eight months. As soon as the residents pay the bill, we will make payments to DHBVN and get power restored,” said Anil Hasija, vice president, Ardee Infrastructure Pvt Ltd. Hasija also said that the RWA is not allowing their staff to enter the condominium, which is also causing problem in operations. He, however, said that consumers of plotted area paid bills directly to DHBVN. Sachin Yadav, executive engineer, DHBVN, said that they had disconnect power after repeated notices elicited no payment. “If the payment is not made DHBVN would have no option but to disconnect power. The developer has to make the payment and only then the electricity will be restored,” he said. Referring to the disconnections in Ardee City, Yadav said that it was routine action. “The bills are generated online and consumers must pay these on time to ensure such supply,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/ardee-city-residents-find-power-supply-cut-discom-points-to-unpaid-dues/story-B5mjlMjWyeZnILtVQ6bZNP.html
19-11-2020||Gurugram||1,000 robberies solved with arrest of trio: Police||The police have claimed to have solved over 1,000 cases of armed robberies and snatchings with the arrest of three alleged robbers in the murder of a 26-year-old woman on Golf Course Extension Road. The police said they have recovered an inventory of 1,010 snatched mobiles phones that were sold to a mobile phone shop owner in Nuh over the past year. The gang used to make calls to the victims demanding money on the pretext of misusing their phone data, such as private pictures and videos. Many such cases also went unreported, said police. Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the suspects used to contact the family members on the pretext of returning their lost mobile phones and later demand money. “In many cases, victims have paid the amount and have not informed the police. The idea of blackmailing was shared by a shopkeeper in Nuh who used to buy these snatched mobiles from them,” he said. The suspects were identified as Irshad alias Golu, of Nuh, Hari Om alias Kuldeep, of Datia in Madhya Pradesh, and Jitender alias Jeetu, of Narnaul in Mahandergarh. A crime team led by sub-inspector Gunpal was able to track the suspects through tip-offs from their informants. The police said the suspects are in their early 30s and are primary school drop outs. They have been involved in criminal activities since 2011 and have been jailed at least thrice since 2013. They were arrested for cases of loot, robbery, snatching, theft and violations of the Arms Act. “Jitender and Irshad had met in Bhondsi Jail and started snatching mobile phones. Later, Hari Om joined them and gave them the idea of procuring weapons from Madhya Pradesh,” he said. Sangwan said that the suspects used to target victims commuting in SUVs and luxury cars on isolated stretches near the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR), which leads to the Golf Course Extension Road and the Faridabad Road. “They used to follow victims and snatch their mobile phones and cash at gunpoint. Later, they sold the phones to a shopkeeper in Nuh for Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000, depending on the condition of the phone. Even newly bought phones were sold at throwaway prices. They used to sell 25 mobile phones per week and made Rs 80,000 from the shopkeeper, on an average. They have sold over 1,000 snatched mobile phones in the last one year and had maintained an inventory of the same,” he said. The shopkeeper used to change the IMEI number and replace the tempered glass screen guards, and then sold it in Uttar Pradesh for higher prices, the police said.According to the police, the gang had a target of robbing at least five mobile phones a day. They used to spend their money on maintaining their lifestyle, besides sending some to their family members. They were fond of expensive clothes, watches and shoes, and used to drink expensive liquor at prominent restaurants, the police said. KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said, “Jitender is the gang’s kingpin. They used to rob people by brandishing pistols and they rarely shot at victims, as they (victims) easily handed over their phones to them. They also targeted women returning from work and they were most active in the stretches around Sohna Road, Golf Course Extension Road, Sector 29, Old Railway Road, Palam Vihar, Sector 57 and Sector 47.” Rao said the gang had bought a second-hand Swift car for Rs 80,000 from the money they made by selling the phones. “Even during the lockdown, they were successful in snatching mobile phones. They have also stolen parked motorbikes from residential areas and sold them in Nuh and Uttar Pradesh. They have conducted a recce of the stretches with low visibility and no CCTV cameras, to evade being identified,” he said. The suspects used to sell gold ornaments to a goldsmith in Nuh and Palwal, and they are also under the scanner, the police said. A crime team has been deployed in Nuh in plain clothes as the shop owner they sold the phones to is at large and his shop has been locked since Thursday morning, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/1-000-robberies-solved-with-arrest-of-trio-police/story-HQotgSAYTiVzaDdebdqFYM.html
19-11-2020||Gurugram||Trio held for murder of woman on Golf Course Extension Road||The police on Wednesday night cracked the case of attempted robbery and murder of a 26-year-old woman near Golf Course Extension Road on November 3, and arrested three persons in connection with the case from a village in Bhondsi.The three are snatchers and had fired at the woman, who was behind the wheel, to intimidate her when she had tried to drive off, the police said. The police were tipped off about the gang and arrested them when they were shifting accommodations.Preet Pal Sangwan, the assistant commissioner of police (crime), said the suspects are involved in more than 1,000 snatching cases and several murders in Gurugram. The suspects were identified as Irshad alias Golu, of Nuh, Hari Om alias Kuldeep, of Datia in Madhya Pradesh, and Jitender alias Jeetu, of Narnaul in Mahandergarh. They lived in a rented accommodation in Bhondsi village and had changed three locations since the incident, the police said.“During questioning, they revealed that they had reached Vatika crossing around 11.20pm and had taken a right turn towards Sector 56, when they saw the car (the victim was driving). The car crossed them at the signal and took a U-turn, when they that there were only two people and would be easy targets. They followed them and stopped at the corner of the road where the victims were looking at an under-construction site and they noticed two guards present there,” he said.The victim, Pooja Sharma, who was driving towards Sector 40 with her fiance, Sagar Manchanda, had applied the brakes when the trio had intercepted them by riding on the wrong side of the road, the police said.Sangwan said that when the suspects threatened them to roll down their windows, Sharma tried to speed away. Then they fired a shot at Manchanda, which missed him, following which they shot at Sharma. “The suspects revealed that they fled the spot within minutes and returned to Bhondsi. Manchanda drove Sharma to a private hospital in his car. A 9mm bullet was lodged in her head, which could not be removed despite surgery,” he said.Sharma worked with the medical claims and insurance department of an IT company in Sector 38, and Manchanda is a software engineer with the same company.Sangwan said the suspects, two of whom met in Bhondsi Jail last year, mostly targeted people on isolated stretches and conducted reconnaissance of the area before targeting their victims. Since lockdown was lifted, they used to snatch at least four mobile phones or gold chains every day.“The suspects used a motorbike with a fake number plate and they had a car too. After the incident, they revisited the spot in their Swift car. They thought the victim had survived. The following day, they did not go out and kept checking news channels for information on the case. They also bought an English daily newspaper for three consecutive days to get updates on the case and was keeping a track on police movement,” he said.KK Rao, the commissioner, Gurugram Police, said that it was a blind case, as the CCTV footage recovered from the spot was of little help. “Our teams had questioned nearly 500 people in a bid to crack the case. Policemen were deployed in civvies at several spots to get leads on the gang. The arrest has solved over 1,000 cases of snatching and at least three murder cases in Gurugram,” Rao said.Rao said it took almost 15 days to zero in on the suspects as they had changed their location three times and had used different autorickshaws to shift their household items. “They were cautious and tried to mislead the police by shifting houses in three vehicles and tried best to avoid getting captured in any of the CCTV cameras. We had activated secret informers and the team had got a lead that this gang might be involved,” he said.The police said they scanned the footage of the area where they used to stay and confirmed that the three were their suspects. Eleven teams were deployed in civvies in areas close to Bhondsi and Rithoj, and they were arrested when they had come to pick their items from their rented accommodation, the police said.Rao said three of them got acquainted last year. “They had bought a .32 bore countrymade pistol from Madhya Pradesh for Rs 51,000 in the last week of October through Hari Om. They used to make nearly Rs 80,000 a week by selling snatched mobile phones. We have identified the shopkeeper in Nuh who helped them in erasing the data and change the IMEI number of the mobile phones,” he said.The police said the gang was also involved in snatching the mobile phone of a 45-year-old woman from a mall in Sector 51 and later trying to extort her for Rs 10 lakh, by threatening to misuse her personal data, as reported by HT earlier. They had also shot dead an acquaintance, Gaurav Kumar, on Diwali night, in Shivaji Nagar, over an argument when they were inebriated, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/trio-held-for-murder-of-woman-on-golf-course-extension-road/story-VbKPFkZ9eLryj1vIvf3W9M.html

19-11-2020||City||Fleecing at parking lots in Ludhiana: Nexus of MC, pvt staff taking toll on visitors||The staffers of the previous contractors of six parking lots in the city continue to fleece residents. This is being done in presence of the municipal corporation (MC) staffers who have been deputed to manage the lots. Receipts of MC are being issued by the private staff.Private staff can be seen charging visitors at all six parking lots, the contracts for which expired last month, and are currently being managed by the MC. The nexus is taking a toll on the public, and senior MC officials are turning a blind eye to the situation.The lots include multi-storey parking near MC Zone-A office, Model Town Extension (tuition market), BRS Nagar (near Orient Cinema), Sarabha Nagar Market Block-I, Bhadaur House and Feroze Gandhi MarketThe staff is charging upto Rs 50 against the approved fee of Rs 20 for parking a car. Either no receipt is issued, or used manual receipts are given at some of the lots, This is resulting in harassment for residents and a loss to the exchequer. An MC official, requesting anonymity, said that senior officials are aware of the issue, but they can’t take action due to involvement of MC staff and politicians. Also, the MC does not have the number of staffers needed to manage the lots. Most of the time, no receipt is issued to the visitors, and the amount collected is pocketed by private staff and contractors.The MC has also been receiving complaints from residents regarding misbehaviour by the private staff. A resident of BRS Nagar, Gurkirat Singh, said: “The staff at the parking lots are rude to visitors and I have also been a victim of the same. When I questioned them about the overcharging, they misbehaved with me. When people gathered at the spot, they went away. The MC should take strict action against the private staff of contractors and overcharging should be stopped.”MC secretary, Neeraj Jain said, “We have deputed the MC’s staff at the parking lots. Directions have been issued that no private person should be allowed to collect parking fee. Some private persons have also been removed from the lots in the past and I will direct the ground staff to keep a check on the illegal practice.”The finance and contracts committee (F&CC) of MC on Thursday held a hearing for two parking contractors, who were earlier blacklisted by MC, at the mayor’s camp office. Mayor Balkar Sandhu did not participate in the meeting. As per information, the contractors had moved court against MC’s decision and the court had directed them to first take up the case with the arbitrator, who in this case is the MC commissioner. Senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra said: “The contractors have been heard, but the decision to blacklist them cannot be rolled back as it has been decided by the F&CC.“||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fleecing-at-parking-lots-in-ludhiana-nexus-of-mc-pvt-staff-taking-toll-on-visitors/story-o7QW3GK84lEuJMr6vb4SLN.html

President of JNSSMA, Jaswinder Thukral, said: “The sales tax department has waken up from its deep slumber after seven years. But, it is very difficult for traders to arrange documents of that time now. Many industrialists have shut down their units and some have even passed away. The state government should intervene and the last date for replying to the notices should be extended from November 20 to March 31, 2021.”Thukral further demanded that the sales tax department should dispose of the cases on a deemed assessment basis by charging 1% tax on per lakh sales.Earlier, the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal had announced that it will raise an agitation if the state government fails to come up with a one-time settlement (OTS) policy to resolve the pending cases.General secretary of the beopar mandal, Sunil Mehra, said: “A state-level meeting of the beopar mandal will be held in Amritsar on December 13. We will announce an agitation against the government if an OTS policy isn’t announced by then. Over 70,000 notices have been served across Punjab and traders are facing harassment at the hands of department officials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vat-assessment-notices-industrialists-in-ludhiana-seek-more-time-to-submit-reply/story-0LXFyOjYi5RcbjsDyBKoQO.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Staff association at Stephen’s asks for help for needy students||New Delhi: In the wake of the recent death by suicide of a student of Lady Shri Ram College due to financial distress and the pressure of online education, the staff association of St Stephen’s College on Thursday wrote to the principal, requesting the formation of a committee to look into the needs of marginalised students.Nandita Narain, president of the Staff Association at St. Stephen’s College, said that in a meeting held on November 17, the staff council had made recommendations to assist marginalised students during the Covid-19 pandemic. The former Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) president wrote to college principal John Varghese in connection with the matter on Thursday.“The Staff Association would like to request you to set up a committee comprising the Heads of all 11 courses taught in college to consider the needs of students for financial support and disburse all scholarships, financial aid and bursaries urgently,” Narain wrote in her letter to the principal.The staff association pointed out that, “faculty members have been receiving requests from students for help with both the payment of fees and for obtaining devices to attend the online classes.”Despite repeated calls and messages, Varghese did not comment on the matter. The faculty members highlighted the need for devices such as laptops to successfully pursue online education. “Some years ago, Delhi University had sent a large number of laptops to each college for use by the students and the faculty. If some of them are still functional, they could be made available to students in need. We request the college administration to reach out to students and let them know of the availability of these devices,” Narain wrote in the letter. In 2013, the university had decided to provide laptops to all undergraduate students irrespective of their courses.The association also recommended that the laptops be sent to students to their place of stay by courier. “Requiring the students to come to Delhi to collect these devices would not be advisable due to the added risk of infection as well as the substantial cost of travel,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/staff-association-at-stephen-s-asks-for-help-for-needy-students/story-evAXDomsmgeqxfBIK7tGaI.html
19-11-2020||City||Sisodia launches helpline number for construction workers||New Delhi: Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday launched a helpline number -- 1076 -- for construction workers across the city to register with the government for various schemes. The registration and renewal of construction workers with the labour welfare board will now be done through a ‘doorstep delivery system’, wherein workers can just dial the helpline and an executive will pay a visit at their homes for the paperwork.“Workers will no longer have to stand in long queues. The Delhi government has launched a helpline number, which is functional from today itself. It is our priority that workers receive benefits of all schemes in time,” Sisodia said in a statement.He said workers can now just dial 1076, and tell their details such as name and area of work. A government executive will go to the worker’s home at a suitable time, and relevant documents will be uploaded there. It’ll be approved online, and he/she will receive the acknowledgement SMS and a call, confirming his registration.Construction workers’ welfare cess is collected from construction companies, and this amount is used for the welfare of workers. To avail this amount, a construction worker needs to be a registered worker with the government labour welfare board.“Due to the complex process of registration and renewal, middlemen illegally ended up taking anything between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000 from the labourers in the name of filling up their forms. Moreover, the workers had to repeatedly go to the labour office on several days and spend hours in queues, which resulted in loss of daily wages. To provide relief to workers, and ease this process, we have started the doorstep delivery of registration and renewal of workers,” the deputy CM said.Now with just a phone call, a member of the Delhi government will visit the worker’s house, fill up their documents. The workers will just have to pay Rs 25 and a service charge of Rs 50, he added. Until now, only 111,000 workers have been registered in Delhi even though the city has an estimate of 10 lakh construction workers, said Sisodia. The Delhi government had in September organised a 12-day camp across assembly constituencies to help construction workers register. However, the camp was not a hit, as it was also marred by long queues and technical glitches in uploading and verification of documents.Construction workers include beldar, painter, concrete mixer, tiles and stone fitter, whitewash and POP worker, blacksmith, crane operator among others. Watchmen at construction sites, plumbers, carpenters, electricians, fitters, welders, shuttering workers, pump operators and bar winders are eligible for the same.Registered workers can avail of different schemes such as an amount of Rs 35,000 to Rs 51,000 for their children’s marriage, health benefits and maternity benefit of up to Rs 30,000, monthly pension of Rs 3,000 for workers over the age of 60, among others. Besides, a compensation of Rs 2 lakh in case of accidental death, one lakh in case of natural death, a cover of Rs 1 lakh for disability and Rs 10,000 for covering the costs of funeral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-launches-helpline-number-for-construction-workers/story-M6IYcy8RFaV1AYLw1RH54I.html

Meanwhile, the court continued the stay on termination of the contract. Earlier this year, the contractor: Horizon Connect Transways Private Limited had submitted an application with the MC in which he had sought an increase in the fare by₹2 to 5, citing the increasing fuel rates. The MC refused to increase the fare stating that the court had ordered a stay in the case.The contractor, however, had stated that the court had only ordered a stay on termination of contract and that the application could be entertained. As the civic body remained adamant, the company moved court. The court has now ordered that municipal corporation can consider the application seeking fare hike as no stay had been issued for the same. Last year, the civic body had served a termination notice to the company as it had failed to submit dues to the tune of around ₹4 crore and its failure to run the service at full capacity. Following this, the company had moved the court against Ludhiana City Bus Service Limited, after which the court ordered a stay on termination of the contract.MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said that a meeting regarding the city bus service had been scheduled for Friday, wherein the matter will be discussed.The city bus service was put to a halt in March after the imposition of the curfew and, it resumed in July. As per the information, the MC had purchased 120 buses under the project, of which 83 have been transferred to the company. The remaining 37 buses are gathering dust in the depot situated at Tajpur road. At present, only 27 buses are plying on city roads.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-mc-told-to-consider-contractor-s-application-for-bus-fare-hike/story-e7itRl6AJv2R7lRm2d2woN.html

He said that four districts of the state including Lahaul-Spiti, Shimla, Mandi, and Kinnaur were among the top ten districts in the country with the highest infection rate which was a matter of concern.“CPI(M) demands government formulate comprehensive strategy and constitute a task force in order to prevent the rapidly growing infection, provide adequate resources and; increase the number of tests to at least 10,000 per day,” said Chauhan.He said that new quarantine centres should open up and those which have been closed shall be reopened immediately.An adequate number of beds should be increased in dedicated Covid hospitals and appropriate steps should be taken to overcome the shortage of doctors, nurses, lab technicians as well as make available an adequate number of ventilators and other equipment.In view of the rapidly increasing number of infected patients in Shimla, the new OPD blocks of Indus Hospital and IGMC should be made Covid Hospital to treat the infected patients, he said.To prevent community spread in the state, the government should conduct a door-to-door survey and isolate the infected people and work on war footing to break the infection chain, Chauhan suggested.He alleged that there is no ceiling on gathering in social, religious and other events and the government is running away from its responsibility that has led to the spike in infections.He alleged that the chief minister officers and other people associated with the ruling party in the government were gathering crowds in political rallies and flouting the norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpi-m-slams-hp-govt-for-failure-to-control-covid-19-spread/story-iLtdIHl2WMiFeU0sC9hPQI.html

19-11-2020||Chandigarh||Tiff over ₹10 led to plumber’s murder, three arrested: Chandigarh Police||A brawl over Rs 10 led to the murder of plumber Jaspal Singh, 35, who was found dead near Labour Chowk in Sector 44 on Tuesday morning. Police claim to have cracked the case with the arrest of the victim’s three friends, identified as Dinesh, 40, of Dhanas, Anil Kumar, alias Neelu, 37, of Sector 52, and Parvinder Singh, 36, who lives near the Labour Chowk. All accused are migrant labourers and used to have drinks together regularly. They were arrested following information that they were seen drinking with Jaspal on Monday. According to investigators, Jaspal, Dinesh, Parvinder and Anil were having drinks near Labour Chowk since 5pm on Monday. Before dispersing, they decided to have one last drink each, for which Jaspal gave one of the accused Rs 50 to get a 250ml liquor bottle. As the accused returned, Jaspal asked for the Rs 10 balance, as he said the bottle cost Rs 40, while the accused insisted it was for Rs 50. This led to an argument between them, following which Dinesh and Anil bludgeoned Jaspal’s head and face with a stone as Parvinder restrained him.Accused jumps of police station’s first floor, fractures feetFollowing his arrest, Dinesh landed in hospital after he jumped off the first floor of the Sector 34 police station in an attempt to escape. He was rushed to GMCH, Sector 32, with fractured feet, and was later referred to PGIMER. A court sent Parvinder and Anil to two-day police remand, while Dinesh was sent to judicial custody. While the trio is facing a case of murder, Dinesh has also been booked under Sector 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tiff-over-10-led-to-plumber-s-murder-three-arrested-chandigarh-police/story-th7f6r8dwYjzA4BWh3rcsL.html

19-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi LG Baijal, CM Kejriwal deem increased fine necessary to create effective Covid-19 deterrence||Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal on Thursday met chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at Raj Niwas to review the prevalent Covid-19 situation in the national capital. During the meeting, Baijal emphasised the need to implement the decisions taken in a meeting, chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah, in a time-bound manner. The decisions were pertaining to enhanced testing, augmenting of hospital infrastructure and human resources, house to house survey, and review of home care arrangements among others. The Lt Governor also emphasised that as Delhi witnesses unprecedented trying times due to Covid-19 pandemic, IEC (Information, Education Communication) activities through all modes of media should be effectively utilised to inform, sensitise and persuade people to strictly adhere to the Covid-19 safety norms.The duo appealed to the residents of Delhi to strictly adhere to Covid-19 measures, however,they considered it necessary to increase the fine, from the existing Rs 500 to Rs 2000, for not wearing face masks, with an aim to create effective deterrence. The decision was taken as an extraordinary measure in the face of a sudden surge in the coronavirus cases in Delhi during the last fortnight.They felt that some people were disregarding the measure with impunity and, in turn, it was not only exposing them to the deadly virus but was also putting others at risk due to their irresponsible behaviour. In a situation already made complex by the onset of winters, high levels of air pollution, seasonal respiratory disorders and crowding caused by the ongoing festival season, they believe that such disregard of preventive and protective measures to has significantly contributed to the uncontrolled spike in the number of Covid-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delhi-lg-baijal-cm-kejriwal-deem-increased-fine-necessary-to-create-effective-covid-19-deterrence/story-Q9plw964bwZKo6pcYMgI3H.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Mask up or get fined: Delhiites say ₹2,000 penalty is OK, but not sufficient||The pandemic continues to have a steady presence in the Capital, and assumingly after observing a sea of people crowding public places, that too without wearing masks, it has now been announced that a fine of ₹2,000 will be levied instead of a penalty of ₹500, for those caught without masks. But, the question that this arises is: are fines enough to stop people from being lax or do we need stricter measures to control this surge of Covid-19?Pulkit Chhabra, a resident of Shalimar Bagh, says the increase in fine will definitely increase mask compliance but Delhi needs to do much more to tackle the alarming situation. “People have lowered their guards and are behaving like the pandemic is over! And what’s the use of wearing masks if half the population doesn’t wear it properly People roam around with their masks down to the neck, and pull them up only when cops are nearby. This defeats the whole purpose of wearing masks in public... it has become like wearing a customary helmet while riding a two wheeler, to avoid challan,” he adds.Many denizens like Chhabra are of the opinion that fines aren’t sufficient as non-monetary penalty has become the need of the hour. “I think there needs to be more vigilance on the ground, to ensure social distancing norms are adequately followed in crowded areas. Deployment of more Police is needed to keep people in check,” says Anysha Kumar, a third year student of St Stephen’s College, Delhi University. “There are so many people who can pay the fine and get away with it. We need to have non-monetary penalties to straighten people who can afford to pay these fines,” she says, highlighting the need for better provisions to avoid people from stepping out for essentials.But Greater Kailash based Pooja Bhateley concurs that the steep fine will indeed make people more cautious. “I was charged ₹500 when I forgot to wear my mask in public, and that made me careful for the next few days. So a fine of ₹2,000 will definitely make me think again since it’s not a small amount for sure,” she says, adding that personal vigilance is need of the hour. She shares, “I genuinely forgot my mask at home, but I know people who have stopped wearing masks since they say it’s inconvenient to them. Human error is inevitable, but in Delhi, the repercussions for these lapses can be huge. We all need to be more careful, and ideally step out only when necessary, and definitely not without masks!” And some denizens feel that it’s hard to enforce rules when enforcement agencies themselves don’t abide by them. Aman Saxena, a Delhi-based lawyer, says, “Everyday I travel from Faridabad to Delhi, and rarely do I see police officers wearing masks. Near various markets, I have seen policemen sitting in small groups and talking. There is laxity all around... There was a strict compliance initially when fines were being levied, but people are now congregating in huge numbers in clubs, markets and public places, and barely a handful of them are being pulled up for not following the norm. We certainly need more measures to deal with the pandemic than simply higher fines for violations.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mask-up-or-get-fined-delhiites-say-2-000-penalty-is-ok-but-not-sufficient/story-rYBShjF7BA2UZRlSlqAzzK.html

19-11-2020||Kolkata||No Chhath puja at two main water bodies in Kolkata, rule Supreme Court, Calcutta HC||The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday ruled that Chhath puja will not be allowed at the Rabindra Sarobar lakes in south Kolkata, which is considered the lungs of the densely populated city because of its greenery. In a simultaneous development, a division bench of the Calcutta high court (HC) banned Chhath puja at Subhas Sarobar, a water body of equal importance and located in the north-eastern parts of the city. The puja will be held on Friday. Amid allegations by opposition parties, including the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), that ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief and Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is eyeing the votes of Hindi-speaking people in the upcoming assembly polls slated to be held in April and May, 2021, the Kolkata Municipal Development Authority (KMDA), the custodian of these water bodies, moved both the SC and the HC with appeals to allow the puja at these sites, albeit, in a regulated manner. Also Read: Chhath puja 2020: Delhi’s Anand Vihar railway station makes special arrangement for safety of women commutersOn September 17, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had ruled that Chhath puja cannot be held under any circumstance at Rabindra Sarobar. On November 10, a single bench of the Calcutta HC had passed a similar order in regard to Subhas Sarobar. The KMDA had moved the SC against the NGT and Calcutta HC orders. On Monday (November 16), the SC refused to order a stay on the NGT’s ruling and listed the matter for hearing on November 23. The KMDA appealed for an early hearing since the puja will be held on Friday (November 20). Both appeals of the KMDA came up for hearing on Thursday in Delhi and Kolkata. While green activists in Kolkata welcomed Thursday’s court orders, CM Banerjee appealed to the Hindi-speaking population to observe Chhath puja at home or in their respective neighbourhoods, using artificial water tanks that the government created over the past few days. “We have created 300 artificial water bodies for your convenience. In case you need to visit a river bank please follow health protocols related to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and travel in small groups. Follow court orders and do not form processions,” Banerjee said in a televised message. The word Chhath means six. The festival is dedicated to Lord Surya (Sun God) and Chhathi Maiya, who is known to be the sister of Lord Surya. The festival is celebrated mostly in Bihar, Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Delhi. Devotees express their gratitude towards Lord Surya and perform intricate rituals over a span of four days. The NGT had passed an order in 2018, banning Chhath puja at Rabindra Sarobar after environment activists and wildlife lovers had started a movement. The petition was moved by environment activist Subhas Dutta, who is also a party in the case heard by the SC. Covering 192 acres of artificial lakes and with 7,000 trees, some of which were damaged by cyclone Amphan in May, Rabindra Sarobar is a birders’ paradise. At least 200 species of resident and migratory birds have been sighted in the water body by birders. It is also home to several species of fish. Hundreds of devotees had flouted the ban and broke open the gates of Rabindra Sarobar in front of the police in November 2019 to perform the puja. They had even used loud crackers and played songs on loudspeakers even though the state government had earmarked alternative water bodies in the city. The incident made headlines and had triggered a huge row. Anticipating that its appeals might be turned down by both the courts, the KMDA started putting up fences around Subhas Sarobar a few days ago. Exposed portions of the boundary walls around Rabindra Sarobar were also covered with metal sheets and cordoned off with bamboo poles. Sumita Banerjee, a green activist and a part of a movement to save Rabindra Sarobar, said, “We welcome the court order but the government must ensure that there is no repetition of last year’s chaos. We are surprised to see the KMDA, which is the custodian of this site, move the apex court to seek permission for destroying nature.” Dilip Ghosh, the president of the BJP’s Bengal unit, took a jibe at the ruling TMC. “Hindi-speaking people in Bengal had been performing Chhath puja for decades, but the TMC never bothered about them. Today, the government has moved the SC because assembly elections are round the corner. It is the TMC’s political compulsion,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/no-chhath-puja-at-two-main-water-bodies-in-kolkata-rule-supreme-court-calcutta-hc/story-VT6jgxiuCDwJC9SEQj7C6I.html
19-11-2020||Patna||I want self-reliant Bihar; Sushil Modi is our guardian, says new deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad||Tarkishore Prasad (64), who was born in Saharsa district in Bihar’s Kosi division and worked in the Seemanchal division, has surprised several political pundits following his overnight elevation to deputy to chief minister Nitish Kumar.Prasad was never a front-runner in the race for Bihar deputy CM, where Sushil Kumar Modi was firmly ensconced since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in alliance with the Janata dal (United) in October 2005.Prasad, a four-time BJP lawmaker, is yet to be defeated since being elected to the 243-member Bihar legislative assembly from the Katihar seat in the Seemanchal division 15 years ago.Though Prasad was born at Salkhuwa in Saharsa district in 1956, his family had settled at Mirchaibari in Katihar and was engaged in a small business. Prasad was reluctant to join his family business and instead joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological parent of the BJP, during his formative years and held several posts in Katihar district.Later, he joined the BJP’s students’ wing, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), in the 1980s.The BJP awarded him a party ticket from the Katihar assembly in 2005 because of his dedication to politics. He did not disappoint his party and its leaders. Excerpts from an interview with the Prasad:Though you were born in the Kosi division, you chose Katihar in Bihar’s Seemanchal division for politics?Yes. I am related to both the Kosi and Seemanchal regions. However, now, I’m only thinking about Bihar. It’s true that people from these divisions are hopeful after I was elevated to the deputy CM’s post and I will never disappoint them.How did you enter politics?It was not accidental. I have been an RSS worker and was active in the ABVP and held several posts in the latter. In 1982, I was made BJP nagaradhyaksha in Katihar. I am fortunate that I have never disappointed my party and its leaders. In my maiden assembly election in 2005, I won the Katihar seat by a slender margin of 116 votes. However, I bettered my margin in 2010 and won by over 20,000 votes. In 2015, though the JD (U) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) had formed an alliance, I managed to retain my seat.Don’t you think your RSS background will affect your relationship with CM Kumar?No. RSS is an organisation, which always thinks about the nation, about the well-being of its people and the nation. There will be no question of any difference between me and CM Kumar over the RSS. Besides, most BJP leaders have an RSS background. Did you ever think of being elevated to a coveted post such as deputy CM?No. I never hankered after power and post. I have worked all along for my party. It is up to my leaders, who have reposed faith in me. I am grateful to them for entrusting me with the responsibility for this onerous task.What are your priorities?My priorities are clear. I have to carry forward Prime Minister Narendra Modiji’s Aatmanirbhar Bihar dream. I shall also realise CM Kumarji’s seven-resolve 2:0 in the state. I want a self-reliant Bihar in line with both the PM and the CM’s cherished dreams.Isn’t unemployment the biggest challenge in Bihar? I have just started my job and we are drawing up a roadmap. Everything will be in the right direction and on the right track. There are several other issues related to joblessness. Plans are afoot to boost all things that can lead Bihar’s holistic growth and development.What do you think about your predecessor Sushil Kumar Modi?I have learnt a lot from Modiji and he is still the party’s guardian in Bihar. I gather that the party will give him some key assignments in national politics.What do you think about his abrupt removal from state politics?I can’t say anything on this. But I can say that Modiji will be assigned an even bigger task in the coming days. It was the party’s decision. At the end of the day, we are all workers of the party. Our duties and responsibilities are assigned by our leaders in the interests of the party and the nation.What are the immediate major challenges before you as the deputy CM?Any new role comes with challenges at every step. The biggest challenge in political life is to live up to the public’s aspirations, who have voted you to power. I have been a public figure for long. I have been associated with various social and political organisations during my political journey. I have done quite a bit of work on infrastructure such as building schools and healthcare centres. Now, we need to think about many big projects for our state’s growth and development. I admit that there are many challenges, but we are determined to make Bihar self-reliant under the leadership of PM Modiji and CM Kumarji.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/i-want-self-reliant-bihar-sushil-modi-is-our-guardian-says-new-deputy-cm-tarkishore-prasad/story-JpUVa9XpDnKP1lO8GGI3pK.html
19-11-2020||City||Yogi asks Cong to clarify stand on Gupkar alliance||LUCKNOW Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday took potshots at the Congress, saying the party was playing with the integrity of the nation by supporting the restoration of Article 370 and demanded that the party makes its stance clear on the issue. “The presence of Jammu and Kashmir Congress leaders at Gupkar meetings proves that the Congress, which calls itself a national party, is double-faced. It says something in Delhi and something else in Kashmir,” said Yogi while addressing a press conference at his official residence. “The Congress’ double standards have been exposed in J&K. It has been playing with national unity and sovereignty by encouraging those involved in separatism and terrorism. The Congress is responsible for not letting Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat (one country, great country) concept become a reality. For its politics at the local level, the party is undermining the nation,” Adityanath told newspersons.“Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad talks about the restoration of Article 370. The Congress leadership needs to clear its stand on Gupkar alliance. The nation also wants clarity from the Congress on Article 370,” he said.The UP chief minister said the Congress was creating hurdles in the development works and empowerment of local bodies started in J&K after the abrogation of Article 370 last year.“Statements by Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq Abdullah and separatists’ leaders are dangerous. The Congress party’s association with them is a dangerous indication. Their leadership needs to clarify that how are they tolerating their leaders’ attempts to play with India’s sovereignty and integrity in the garb of the Gupkar alliance,” he added.Yogi said while the development dream of Jammu and Kashmir, as envisaged by the Prime minister Narendra Modi and union home minister Amit Shah, was being realised, the Congress was not able to digest it. “Under the leadership of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, evil designs against the unity and sovereignty of the nation will not be allowed to succeed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/yogi-asks-cong-to-clarify-stand-on-gupkar-alliance/story-3ssQH5gN7KzoK3T5L2cyPN.html
19-11-2020||Chandigarh||Anurag Thakur jibe at HP CM over Central Varsity deepens rift among rivals in BJP||At a time when the party is gearing up for panchayati raj elections, Union minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur’s jibe at chief minister Jai Ram Thakur at a public function in Kangra over delay in transfer of land to the Central University of Himachal Pradesh (CUHP) appears to have widened the rift between rival factions within the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.Anurag Thakur at the function blamed the state government for delay in transfer of land for the university that he identified as his “dream project.” Hitting out at the bureaucrats for dragging their feet in completing the project allocated to the state 11 years ago during former CM Prem Kumar Dhumal’s tenure, he also suggested that the CM hold them accountable for it.The CM, however, felt the issue should not have been raised by Anurag Thakur on a public platform. Underplaying the Union minister’s angry outburst, he said he was unaware of the technical realities of the matter related to the university, which is split into two campuses – Dhauladhar in Dharamshala and Beas, which has yet to come up in Dehra.Kangra DC asked to transfer landEven as additional chief secretary RD Dhiman on Wednesday ordered the Kangra deputy commissioner to transfer the land to the university, Hoshiar Singh, Dehra independent legislator, said matters related to the institute were the concern of the Central government.A first time legislator and an associate member of BJP, Hoshiar Singh trained his guns on Anurag Thakur, urging him to see to it that the available funds of Rs 500 crore for the university were released immediately for Dehra.Singh also questioned why the foundation laying of a part of the campus at Dehra was done just ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.Meanwhile, the Congress launched a fresh offensive against the ruling BJP with state party chief Kuldeep Rathare saying the internal feuding signified the power struggle within the party.How it startedFormer prime minister Manmohan Singh announced the decision to set up CUHP on August 15, 2007, and it became functional in 2010 with a temporary campus at Shahpur.In the same year the then BJP-led state government proposed two campuses at Dehra and Dharamshala.In 2013, the Congress led state government proposed a unified campus and identified land for it at Indrunag Hill and then again in 2016 it identified 600 acres of land for another campus at Jadrangal, both in Dharamsala.Former HRD minister Prakash Javadekar then laid the foundation stone of the CUHP at Dehra and Dharamshala ahead of the general elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/anurag-thakur-jibe-at-hp-cm-over-central-varsity-deepens-rift-among-rivals-in-bjp/story-42tZYq4u2sWN6tb1c5NkJN.html

The tiger had left the reserve in 2012 when it was four years old.Forest officials said they were initially surprised when they spotted the tiger first on October 19 in the reserve’s Bhadlav area. They added they became sure it was indeed T-38 when it was again caught on camera on October 24 near Chiroli and later on November 15 in Taleda area of the reserve.The department officials then started analysing the camera footage to confirm the T-38’s presence in the reserve, where it is currently in the Kundera range.Ranthambore Tiger Reserve’s field director, TC Verma, confirmed T-38’s return and said it moved to Kuno in 2012 and was caught on cameras installed there. Thereafter the tiger remained there until it was spotted in the reserve in October.Also Read: Delhi zoo’s 15-year-old tiger B-2 diesA forest official the tiger was tracked till Madhya Pradesh in 2012 and the Kuno administration was accordingly informed about its presence there. “Many tigers might have moved towards Madhya Pradesh by crossing Chambal but he [T-38] was tracked from the beginning until he reached there,” said the official, who did not want to be named. He added around two years later another tiger named T-56 moved to Kuno and its movements were also tracked. “He has not returned. Then another tiger, T-91, moved but he returned from border villages of Madhya Pradesh.”Officials said rain or another tiger may have pushed T-38 to leave Kuno. “The Ranthambore Tiger Reserve administration has written to the Kuno National Park about the tiger’s arrival and asked its administration to ensure effective monitoring and camera installation... one or two tigers may have migrated from there,” said the official cited above.Ranthambore Tiger Reserve’s former field director, YK Sahu, said the return of T-38 is surprising as the tiger would have made Kuno its territory. “It might have returned either due to territorial fight or due to human disturbance.”Six tigers left Ranthambore between 2002 and 2013. Some of them went to Kuno. Only one of them returned, while three were found dead later.Ranthambore Tiger Reserve has around 74 tigers, including 27 cubs and sub-adults. This month, two tigresses gave birth to six cubs there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-s-ranthambore-tiger-returns-from-madhya-pradesh-s-kuno-after-8-years/story-RzfPjgbBGq8GODHjjbaN6J.html

19-11-2020||Pune||Stripped hyena falls into open well in Otur village, rescued by Maha forest dept, wildlife SOS team||Members of the Maharashtra forest department and Wildlife SOS team rescued a five-year-old male striped hyena from 15 feet well in Ane village, Otur, taluka Junnar, Pune district, on Tuesday (November 17).Junnar Taluka has more than 200 hyenas in the area. Hyenas are seen as dangerous animals and they are widely misrepresented in culture, folklore and even in movies. The striped hyena is the only hyena species that is found in the Indian subcontinent and are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Their estimated populations are under 10,000 and are classified as ‘Near Threatened’ in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list.Yogesh Ghodake, range forest officer, Otur, said, “This striped hyena was foraging in the night, when he fell into an open well. It was the local farmers who alerted us, thus with the help of four-member rescue team operating out of Wildlife SOS run Leopard Rescue Centre in Junnar to assist, we began rescue operations.”“This hyena was probably in search of food, especially any cattle, sheep or goat. They tend to be near human settlements, like agriculture fields which are often their hiding place,” he said.The villagers who have been trained by Wildlife SOS and the Forest Department in conflict mitigation and awareness workshops, cordoned off the area for the team to conduct the rescue operation.Ghodake added that after a quick assessment of the situation, a trap cage with food bait was lowered into the nearly 15 feet deep well to lure the hyena into a trap cage.“Once safely inside, the team carefully lifted the cage out and they conducted a detailed on-site medical examination of the hyena, following which it was released back in the wild,” he said.“The animals trapped in such situations are already stressed so ensuring their safety and comfort is our priority. Open wells are a common threat to wildlife around villages, and our teams are vigilant constantly to provide any assistance when it comes to rescuing animals in distress,” he further added.Nikhil Bangar, wildlife veterinary officer, Wildlife SOS, said, “The male hyena was about five-year-old and did not sustain any severe injuries from the fall. We provided topical treatment for minor abrasions on the face and limbs before the animal was released back into the wild.”Major threats to hyenas in India include man-animal conflict, poisoning, habitat destruction, hunting and poaching for body parts.“Their skin is illegally traded and body parts are used in traditional medicine. The striped hyena is an underrated species that deserves more conservation attention as the survival of this species is crucial for the survival of a healthy, well-balanced ecosystem. Therefore, it is imperative to educate the local communities about conservation ethics and to inspire them to coexist with the wildlife that lives in close proximity to human settlements,” said Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO, Wildlife SOS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/stripped-hyena-falls-into-open-well-in-otur-village-rescued-by-maha-forest-dept-wildlife-sos-team/story-BK8BG6LzjYeB0bWykVtwcL.html
19-11-2020||Pune||“Safety first” puts small car segment on the top during Diwali||Vehicle sales have seen a significant rise during this Diwali despite the Covid-19 pandemic, and majority of the buyers have preferred for small cars compared to bigger ones. A similar trend of buying smaller segment cars under Rs 20 lakh was seen during the Navratri period too. Although the total number of vehicles sale is slightly less than last year’s sale during the Navratri period as per the Pune Regional Transport Office’s (RTO) new vehicle registration data, the sales seem to be rising. Interestingly the revenue generation has increased by almost Rs 4 crore this year. Last year a total of 16,200 new vehicles were registered during the Diwali period starting from October 8 to 27, 2019 with total revenue of Rs 70,66,02,718 whereas this year starting from October 25 to November 14, 2020, new vehicle registrations have gone down to 14,794 but the revenue increased to Rs 74,49,72,232, which means there is an increase of Rs 3,83,69,514 revenue this year. In the car segment last year, a total of 2,878 cars were registered and this year it has risen to 4,068. According to Pune deputy regional transport officer Sanjeev Bhor, there has been a steady rise in the sale of smaller cars below Rs 20 lakh since Navratri. “Post lockdown as the Covid situation continues people prefer the safety of family first and so go to buy cars. So, there is a drastic rise seen even during the Diwali period this time and we hope that the rise in sales continues until New Year. Also, our revenue generation has increased by almost Rs 4 crore compared to last year,” Bhor said. While in the motorcycle sale, last year the new motorcycles registered were 11,562 which went down to 10,044 this year. Similarly, there is a drastic drop in the sale of tourist taxi vehicles this year, last year 311 tourist taxis were registered during Diwali period and this year only 28 of them were registered. Also, there is an impact on the auto-rickshaw and commercial vehicle sale which has also reduced this year compared to last year’s sales. Pawan Dahinje, automobile car sales expert said, “There was a very good response during the Navratri period for car sales and it continued during the Diwali period too, as across the car brands smaller segment cars were sold at a good range. We are expecting the market to increase from now, as people are preferring safety first for travelling within the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/safety-first-puts-small-car-segment-on-the-top-during-diwali/story-b3kLBIS7vsK2ky8BXn7BJP.html
19-11-2020||Mumbai||Will thwart BJP design to make Mumbai ‘doormat of Delhi’: Shiv Sena||The allies-turned-rivals – the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiv Sena – are warming up to an intense fight to control the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the richest civic body in the country, which goes to polls in early 2022. On Thursday, the Sena lashed out at the remarks of Devendra Fadnavis, the leader of opposition and former Maharashtra chief minister, on the previous day that the BJP would win the 2022 civic polls and wrest control of the BMC, which remained the former party’s bastion over the last three decades. The Sena said it would thwart the BJP’s design to make Mumbai, “a doormat of Delhi”, alluding to the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.Also Read: Fadnavis hits out at MVA government, calls it anti-developmentIn the last civic polls in 2017, the BJP and the Sena had contested against each other, despite sharing power in the Fadnavis-led government.The Sena had fared marginally better than the BJP, and kept its sway over the 227-member BMC intact. But, the BJP, which has been kept off the frame since last year’s assembly polls, is spoiling for an electoral fight.Fadnavis was his belligerent self during the BJP’s Mumbai unit’s executive meeting on Wednesday.“It’s a certain sign of downfall, when power goes to people’s heads. We should be prepared to fight the corrupt Sena, while keeping in mind the welfare of the Mumbaikars,” he urged his party colleagues at the meeting. He asserted that a saffron flag would fly atop the BMC headquarters after the civic body elections in 2022, which would weed out Sena’s corruption.Sanjay Raut, Sena’s chief spokesperson and a member of the Rajya Sabha (RS), took the battle to the opposition BJP’s camp on Thursday. He told media persons in Delhi that Mumbaikars would never hand over control of the BMC to a party, which back people, who had insulted Mumbai and equated the Maximum City to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), while taking a veiled dig at the BJP’s support to actor Kangana Ranaut’s uncharitable remarks. Raut alleged that the BJP would like to control Mumbai in a bid to usurp its land and businesses. “The people at the Centre do not want to keep Mumbai in Maharashtra, and we are their biggest hurdle… An actress, whose [structure] was demolished by the BMC recently, is a BJP worker. She called the Mumbai Police mafia and equated Mumbai to Pakistan. The people of Mumbai and Maharashtra opposed it. But who supported her? It was the BJP. Will the public allow Mumbai to be controlled by such people? We stood with the late architect and interior designer Anvay Naik’s family. But these people supported that TV anchor (Arnab Goswami) and held relentless protests. Does this show their love for the Marathi people?” Raut asked.Raut made an impassioned plea whether Maratha legend Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s saffron flag atop the BMC headquarters implied unholy. “Mumbaikars decided which saffron is pure and which one is not. They have hoisted Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s saffron flag for the last 30 years,” he said.Sena minister Anil Parab said that Mumbaikars always supported his party and would continue to do so. “Several people came, made statements and went away, but Mumbai remained the bastion for the Sena. History is witness to our party’s hold in the city,” said Parab in an oblique reference to Fadnavis.Raut took a swipe at the BJP top brass over its alleged bids to cut off Mumbai from the rest of Maharashtra. “They [BJP] are interested in the BMC because they want Mumbai’s land, it’s businesses and a hold over it’s booming stock market. This has been the pattern for the past 50 years. They want to make Mumbai the slave of Delhi and a doormat of the national capital. But we won’t let it happen. Mumbai belongs to the working class, not only industrialists and businessmen … Many have tried to remove the saffron flag [atop the BMC] and failed miserably. They will not be able to succeed for the next 100 generations,” he dared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/will-thwart-bjp-design-to-make-mumbai-doormat-of-delhi-shiv-sena/story-zOkFw779AZlsj4SLY31aZJ.html

19-11-2020||Dehradun||Uttarakhand Congress disowns senior leader’s promise of free power and water, rift shows||As Uttarakhand Assembly elections draw near, differences within state Congress are emerging over senior party leader and former chief minister Harish Rawat’s promise to provide 100 to 200 units of electricity and 25 litres of water free to people in the state if the Congress was voted to power in 2022 state elections. The state Congress leadership has distanced itself from Rawat’s stand, maintaining that it has not been discussed by the state party leadership. Harish Rawat, who is party national general secretary and in-charge for Punjab, said he had made the promise for free power and drinking water given the robust power generation network developed in the state over the years and good availability of water resources in the Himalayan state. “I am firm on my stand as we have the capacity to provide free electricity in the range of 100 to 200 units. Our power distribution and generation capacity has developed over the years to the extent that we can provide it free to some extent. In case of drinking water supply, with the hill state having good water resources, we can provide 25 litres of pure water to each family free of charge. All this is possible,” he insisted. When questioned about his party leadership’s reluctance to endorse his view citing the poll manifesto had not been prepared yet, Rawat said, “Ideas are floated first and then made part of the manifesto. In this case also, I will present it before the party, discuss it with them, so that these could be made part of the manifestos” he said. State Congress has distanced itself from Rawat’s promise, emphasising the issue has not been discussed by the party yet. Pritam Singh, Congress state president, said, Harish Rawat is a senior leader of the party who has come up with this idea. “But as a party president in the state, I can tell you it is not the party stand, nor has the party come up with the manifesto yet. As the idea has been floated, in the coming time, we will discuss it in the party and take appropriate action,” he said. Also Read: Chhath Puja banned in public places in Dehradun due to Covid-19 surgeSuryakant Dhasmana, state Congress vice president, said, Harish Rawat’s suggestions are valuable given his vast political experiences but such announcements are made by the party and not by any individual leader. “Our poll manifesto committee will decide what promises the party needs to make. The party will discuss this idea also, but we have to ensure that we make promises that the party can fulfil in future. Otherwise, it will be very embarrassing for the party,” he said. Also Read: Work on to get UNESCO World Heritage Site tag for Adi Kailash in UttarakhandBansidhar Bhagat, state BJP president said the promise made by Rawat was an election gimmick.“The state is not in a position to do such things at present.

Congress needs to do some introspection first,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/uttarakhand-congress-disowns-senior-leader-s-promise-of-free-power-and-water-rift-shows/story-HqV9YCE8kXTMILjm89QwVI.html
19-11-2020||Pune||Temperature will continue to rise in Pune city till November 23: IMD||The minimum temperature in the city continues to rise after cold weather in the initial weeks of November. From 9.8 degrees Celsius on November 12 it has risen to 18.5 degrees Celsius on Wednesday (November 18).“The minimum and maximum temperature will continue to rise till November 23. After that, there will be a partial moist shift and as a result, northern components of wind will start reaching northern parts of Maharashtra including Pune so from November 24 morning there is a slight chance of fall in minimum temperature,” said Anupam Kashyapi, head, weather department, India Meteorological Department, Pune.The rise in the temperature is due to consecutive western disturbances affecting the western Himalayan region and strong easterly wind flow over southern peninsula due to which northeast monsoon is active so IMD models have suggested that night temperatures will be on the higher side.“On Thursday (November 19), there may be an interaction (confluence) between easterlies and westerlies even over central, northern parts of Maharashtra, viz. Konkan, Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada,” he said.“As a result, IMD, Pune has forecast clouds over Pune city and district around November 19, 20, 21 with a chance of isolated very light rains over the district even in the city. Therefore, night temperatures are predicted to be in the range of 16-18 degrees Celsius in Pune till at least November 21-22,” said Kashyapi.There is also strong easterly wind influence over peninsular India, which is causing moisture incursion and clouding over areas of Maharashtra, even in Pune district and city.“Humidity level in the air is on the high side during the day with maximum temperature will be near to 31-32 degrees Celsius,” he said.Cloudy weather during the night is causing a rise in minimum temperature as clouds to prevent the escape of longwave radiation from the earth’s surface into the atmosphere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/temperature-will-continue-to-rise-in-pune-city-till-november-23-imd/story-pM3dPWcdcjugC9BLdolJbP.html
19-11-2020||Lucknow||Radha Mohan Singh to begin new role as BJP UP in-charge with Prayagraj visit today||Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) new Uttar Pradesh (UP) in-charge Radha Mohan Singh will visit Prayagraj on Thursday to begin his latest assignment as part of streamlining the party’s strategy for the teachers’ and graduates’ constituency polls to the Legislative Council. The BJP is actively contesting these elections for the first time. Radha Mohan Singh, who is also the BJP’s national vice-president, was the union agriculture minister during Narendra Modi’s first term as Prime Minister. The Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council has 100 members, of which 52 are with the Samajwadi Party and 19 with the ruling BJP. The BSP has eight members while Congress has just two, with one of them, Dinesh Kumar Singh, having already joined the BJP. While there are 14 vacant seats in the Legislative Council at present, polls have been announced for 11 seats of the graduates’ and teachers’ constituencies. Polling will take place in December. Also Read: UP CM welcomes SC order on assistant basic teachers recruitmentThe two previous UP in-charges, JP Nadda and Amit Shah, went on to become party chiefs following their resounding success in the 2019 and 2014 Lok Sabha polls, respectively. The BJP will now contest the 2022 UP assembly polls with Singh as the state in-charge. “Radha Mohan Singhji will be in Prayagraj for meetings over the Allahabad-Jhansi graduate seat polls,” said UP BJP general secretary Amarpal Maurya, the in-charge of graduates’ and teachers’ constituency polls. BJP general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal will accompany Radha Mohan Singh. The Allahabad-Jhansi graduates’ constituency spans 10 districts, including Prayagraj, Kaushambi, Fatehpur, Chitrakoot, Banda, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Jalaun, and Jhansi. It is among the five graduates’ constituency seats which will go to the polls on December 1, along with six teachers’ constituency seats. The tenure of 11 MLCs – five from the graduates’ constituency and six from the teachers’ constituency – ended on May 6, but the elections to these seats had been delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak, officials said. The Allahabad-Jhansi seat is prestigious for the BJP as party candidate Yagya Dutt Sharma, 78, has been winning it for the past four terms. Each stint has been six years long. Sharma had served as principal of the Sewa Samiti Vidya Mandir Intermediate College from 1980 to 2001 in Prayagraj (then Allahabad). After Prayagraj, Radha Mohan Singh and Bansal are expected in Varanasi on November 20 to strategise the party campaign. The duo will visit Moradabad on November 21 to campaign for the Bareilly-Moradabad teachers’ constituency seat. On the same day, Bansal, along with UP BJP vice president Braj Bahadur, will go to Bareilly for the party campaign there. State BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh would be in Kannauj on Thursday while additionally visiting Agra and Meerut, Maurya said. On November 22, Swatantra Dev, along with the party’s UP vice-president Santosh Singh, will campaign in Sitapur for the elections to the graduates’ and teachers’ constituency in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/radha-mohan-singh-to-begin-new-role-as-bjp-up-in-charge-with-prayagraj-visit-today/story-ozulGKoC2rkp1fm2jm0jsI.html

The appellate tribunal for the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on Thursday directed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to de-seal the Teja Khera farmhouse by November 23 and hand over its possession to the Chautala family for the limited purpose of holding the wedding of the grandsons of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader. The counsel for the Chautalas has given an undertaking that the possession of the attached property will be handed back to the ED by December 7. The Punjab and Haryana high court had on Tuesday allowed the ED plea, challenging the tribunal’s October 20 order to de-seal the property for a month. The high court bench of justice AG Masih asked the appellate tribunal for a fresh decision. Om Prakash Chautala’s son Abhay Singh Chautala had sought permission from the tribunal to use the farmhouse for the wedding of his two sons on November 27 and 30. The initial tribunal order said that the farmhouse be de-sealed from November 6 to December 7. The high court stayed the tribunal order on November 6. The farmhouse has been sealed by the ED in view of the ongoing probe against Om Prakash Chautala for money laundering. The ED had told the high court that there is no provision in the PMLA to de-seal an attached property connected with the proceeds of crime even temporarily. In case it is allowed, it would set a wrong precedent that would be exploited by the accused to enjoy the proceeds of crime till the decision is rendered by the appellate tribunal, the ED had argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chautala-gets-access-to-teja-khera-farmhouse-in-haryana-for-wedding-of-grandsons/story-024AhSMPb8CflUB3uOEmSJ.html

We have agreed that a lot of people don’t wear masks so the penalty for not wearing masks will be increased from Rs500 to Rs2,000. I appeal to social, religious and political organisations to distribute masks and urge people to wear masks. Masks are a major saviour against Covid-19,” said Kejriwal in a video press briefing, after convening an all-party meeting with political leaders to discuss the Covid-19 situation.Also Read: Covid-19: ICU beds with ventilators not available at nearly 60 hospitals in DelhiA notification in this regard will soon be issued, said a government official. The police and the government’s revenue department are the enforcement agencies which can prosecute individuals for not wearing masks in public places.The chief minister said that at the all-party meeting on Thursday, he urged political leaders to join hands in the fight against Covid-19 and direct their volunteers to distribute masks across the city.“Today, 7,461 non-ICU beds and 446 ICU beds available across Delhi. Recently, the Supreme Court allowed the Delhi government to issue directions to reserve 80% ICU beds in 33 private hospitals for Covid-19 patients. This direction would now apply to all private hospitals. Also, till now, private hospitals had to reserve 50% non-ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. That would be increased to 60% for now. And, hospitals have been asked to postpone all non-critical surgeries that have been scheduled,” said Kejriwal.Similar directions were issued in May and June as well, when the city had witnessed the first sharp rise in Covid-19 cases but later some of them were relaxed when the cases went down.The chief minister appreciated the role of healthcare professionals in Delhi during the pandemic and urged people to celebrate Chhath Puja at home this year.“There have been arguments regarding Chhath Puja in the past few days. We want people get to celebrate Chhath Puja in Delhi, but this year there is a pandemic and there is an immense amount of health risk. Imagine how much transmission can happen at the Chhath ghats where people take dips in water bodies. Water can make the transmission worse. The prohibition this year is only in public places.

Locals said that the blast took place around 11am when nearly 20 workers were working inside the factory, which recycled plastic, iron and brass. “The explosion was so powerful that people staying at least two kilometres away could also hear the noise.

One Ketabuddin Sheikh used to look after the daily activities in the factory,” said a local resident who refused to be identified. Police said that they are now searching for the factory owner.

19-11-2020||Delhi||No big fat Delhi wedding: Wedding industry wary of 50 guest cap, again||With the wedding season round the corner, the wedding industry was hoping to recoup losses incurred during the year due to the pandemic. But now with the acceptance of Delhi government’s proposal to cap the number of wedding guests at 50, those associated with this industry say it has once again cast a shadow on their survival. “We were getting requests for wedding planning every day. So many people who had postponed their wedding due to the lockdown are planning their nuptials in the coming weeks. What will happen to their plans now? Will they uninvite people now?,” says Tushar Malik, a Delhi-based wedding planner. He adds that this is the wrong time for this decision since there is just a week left for the wedding season to kick start in the Capital. “The season for weddings this year falls between November 24 and December 12. From an average of 300-400 guests, people have reduced the gatherings to 150-200. We have made plans as per the previous guidelines, and are taking all precautions. But now the new order leaves little room for improvisation,” says Malik, sharing how he has been advising people to opt for destination weddings since the Covid-19 situation in Delhi is pretty grim. Even banquet owners are in dismay, due to the return of 50 guest rule for weddings. Community Welfare Banquet Association in Delhi had met with authorities, asking for concessions. “From florists to vegetable sellers, cleaners, cooks — there are so many people associated with us. This decision adversely impacts everyone,” says Sandeep Madan, who owns a banquet hall in north Delhi, adding, “This is the peak wedding season, lasting barely two weeks. We make a bulk of our earnings in this period. There are over 10 lakh families associated with our business, many of whom we had called back from their home towns when the business picked up after restrictions were relaxed. The return of this cap might mean the death of our business!” Those who capture intimate wedding moments, that is the photographers, are also at the threshold of losing a major chunk of their earnings. “Booking for any wedding is made in advance, and according to the scale of the wedding we make investment in equipments and employ staff. All of this goes waste when we face last minute cancellations! Not everyone wants to have a small scale wedding; many might thus postpone their plans, and it will certainly mean that our business will be hit,” says Akanksha Verma, a Delhi-based wedding photographer. Although most associated with the wedding business are anxious, some admit that the curb is necessary to control the rising number of cases in the Capital. Varinder, a tent house owner in Ashok Vihar says, “Even after restrictions were lifted, we did not get much work since people are choosing banquet halls over tents now. We will continue to suffer, but it’s important to deal with the virus first. What if we send our employees to a wedding and they contract coronavirus? Pehle se hi markets kholne ki wajah se cases badh gaye hain. Kya fayda hoga paise kamane ka agar zinda hi na rahe? So it’s better that marriage gatherings are restricted in the city for now.”Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-big-fat-delhi-wedding-wedding-industry-vary-of-50-guest-cap-again/story-fpzFTba0F4oJHUepZocwFK.html

The tiger was suffering from acute symptoms of chronic kidney disorder (CKD), Delhi zoo officials said in a statement. “The tiger had not been well for the past few months and breathed his last at 9.25am,” Delhi zoo director Ramesh Pandey said. He added that the tiger had been brought from Van Vihar Zoo, Bhopal in 2014 and had completed his average life span. “The best possible treatment was being given to the animal in consultation with experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izzatnagar, Bareilly. The animal was under intensive care for over 20 days. The autopsy of the animal will be conducted by a panel of veterinary doctors and viscera will be sent to lVRI for histo-pathological and other examinations to ascertaining the cause of death,” the director said.Also Read: Elephants to birds: Delhi zoo provides special care, food for 200 old animalsMeanwhile, the Delhi zoo also got a Royal Bengal tigress, the first in six years, from the Kanpur zoo for conservation breeding under an animal exchange programme, said officials. “The tigress, Barkha, is six years old. She will be paired with tiger Karan, who is also around six years old,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be named. The zoo now has only one male Royal Bengal tiger (Karan). The Delhi zoo had three Royal Bengal tigers till a year ago. One of the three tigers, eight-year-old Rama, died at the zoo in September last year due to kidney failure. He had been brought from the Mysore zoo in 2014.There are around 88 species of animals in the Delhi zoo at present and efforts are being made to increase the number up to 100, said officials.The conservation breeding programme involves conserving a species by preventing imminent population collapse in the wild due to a large number of eliminative pressures such as habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, industrialisation, poaching, illegal trade and climate change among other factors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-zoo-s-15-year-old-tiger-b-2-dies/story-1LSdimhs0zHMP8NIkod2NO.html

19-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi HC asks Centre to respond to plea seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages||The Delhi high court on Thursday sought the Centre’s response to a plea seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriages. The plea has contended that the Hindu Marriage Act does not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual marriages if one were to go by how it is worded. It added the Act very clearly states that marriage can be solemnised between “any two Hindus”.The court has tagged the matter with two similar pleas and posted them for hearing in January.Four members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex community filed the plea in September saying there is nothing in the Act that mandated that a marriage can take place only between a Hindu man and a Hindu woman.The petition referred to the 2018 Supreme Court order that read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised homosexuality.“The non-recognition of the rights of gay couples, especially when their sexuality has been recognised as such as valid by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India is violative of various provisions of the Constitution of India as well as various conventions that India as a sovereign state is a signatory to,” the plea said.Also Read: EU launches LGBT protection strategy as homophobia rises in eastThe petition said it will be against the Constitutional mandate of non-arbitrariness if the right is not extended to homosexual apart from heterosexual couples.“…the denial of this right to homosexual couples is also against the mandate of various international conventions that India is a signatory to. Finally, the eponymous Golden Rule of Interpretation also states that plain 7 meaning has to be imparted to words in a statute, unless such interpretation were to lead to an absurdity,” the plea said.This is the second petition to be filed on the issue of same-sex marriage rights. In January, a couple filed a petition in the Kerala high court challenging the Special Marriage Act.In October, the Delhi high court sought responses from the Centre and the Delhi government to pleas by two same-sex couples seeking legal recognition of their marriages under the Special Marriage Act and the Foreign Marriage Act. It observed that “laws are gender-neutral” and are for the rights of “every citizen”.Two mental health professionals filed the first petition saying they had been living together as a couple for eight years, took care of each other’s parents, are in love but unable to get married.“The petitioners are like any other couple you might meet, except they are both women,” their petition said.Two men, who got married in 2017 in the US where same-sex marriages are legal, filed the second petition. An Indian consulate refused to register their marriage this year under the Foreign Marriage Act.The two had been in a relationship since 2012 and are supported by families and friends. They said during the Covid-19 pandemic, India’s non-recognition of their marriage prevented them from travelling to India as a married couple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hc-asks-centre-to-respond-to-plea-seeking-legal-recognition-of-same-sex-marriages/story-tzCktdDL717Awgb42BGB4J.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Why did you wait for court order to start taking action, Delhi HC asks govt||The Delhi High Court on Thursday pulled up the Delhi government for its delayed action in controlling the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital while seeking to know why it was waiting for the court’s order to reduce the number of attendees at the weddings.A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that the Delhi government cannot blame the Centre for non-cooperation and that both the authorities should put their heads together to tackle the situation. It said that the situation has worsened in the last 18 days and it was only after the court pulled the Delhi government up that it set things in motion.“Why did not you wake early? The alarm bells should have rung loud in your head. Why did you wait for a court’s direction to reduce the number of people? The city is reeling and you allowed the transport in full capacity. Tell us the rational object behind this decision. Why didn’t you wake up even after the situation worsened since November 1?“You were shaken out of slumber, you turned turtle after we asked questions. Do you know about the number of lives that has been lost in the last 18 days? Yesterday there were 134 deaths in a single day and the government is claiming that you were alive to the situation. The ground is full of dead bodies. Why were you have to look at the Centre and the Lieutenant Governor (L-G) for directions,” the bench said.Also Read: Delhi: Wedding curbs back as coronavirus cases hit 500,000The court was hearing a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking directions to the Delhi government to ramp up the number of tests in the city.On Thursday, senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that they have reduced the number of wedding attendees. He said that people are being fined for not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing norms.However, the court said that even fining people is not acting as a deterrent and people who have not stepped outside of their houses due to the fear of the infection have also contracted the virus.The court said that there should be a strong deterrent and fine collection is not for revenue.“It should be a strong deterrent so that the people abide by the rules of wearing a mask,” the bench said.The court said that it is disheartening to note that the number of deaths have been increasing on a daily basis with the highest number of deaths shooting up to 134. Justice Kohli asked the Delhi government to indicate the steps they are taking to ensure that there are adequate facilities for victims of Covid-19 at the burning ghats and crematoriums.“What steps are you taking to manage the crematorium grounds? They are overflowing and funeral pyres are working throughout the night….Considering the steep rise in the death rates in the last 14 days, the Delhi government is directed to indicate the steps it has taken for adequate arrangements for those who have lost their lives to Covid-19,” the court said in its oral order.The court also said that the Delhi government should be cognizant of the fact that rapid antigen tests are no longer helping because of the large number of asymptomatic persons, while adding that more RT-PCR tests should be conducted for better results. The judge also noted that only about 50% RT-PCR tests have been conducted as against over two lakh rapid antigen tests between November 9 and November 17. The court said that testing via RT-PCR should be increased.During the proceedings, the court noted in its order that the Delhi government is not conducting the fifth sero-survelliance stating that the third wave of Covid-19 is still in progress, even though the government told the press that the third wave has already peaked in the city.“The Delhi government has informed us that the fifth sero survey has not taken place because the city is reeling under the third wave. However, statements have made to the press where the government has stated that the third wave has already peaked even though it has not been reflected in the ground situation,” the court said.When additional standing counsel of the Delhi government Satyakam objected and urged the court not to take not of anything that has been published in the press, the court said, “Why would not we take this? We can take judicial note of the statements made by your ministers in the court. If you retract from whatever you have said in the media, I would remove it.”The court also asked the Delhi government to properly publicise its order of September 12 order reserving 80 ICU beds in 33 private hospitals in the city both in print and electronic media.During the hearing, ASC Satyakam told the court that the government would be adding 663 ICU beds (both ventilator and non-ventilator) to the existing number of 1,167 ICU beds in government hospitals. He also told the court that about 750 ICU beds are being added after assistance from the Centre, and a decision to shut down a few busy markets is yet to be taken pending confirmation from the Union government.The court directed that the ICU beds in the government hospitals should be made functional within the next week.During the proceedings, the court also remarked that the Delhi government had anticipated the situation and still chose to open all the activities.“You had very well anticipated the situation because you had passed the September 12 order (reserving 80% ICU beds in the city). The cold wave along with the pollution during the winter months is a cocktail of death for the citizens, especially those who have breathing issues,” the court said.The matter will be now heard on November 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-why-did-you-wait-for-court-order-to-start-taking-action-delhi-hc-asks-govt/story-dPivbX9u2dPBvIuFCzgMJL.html

Police arrested the three suspects from Bhondsi village in Gurugram on Wednesday night. The trio, who are hardened criminals, had allegedly fired at the victim in a bid to intimidate her after she had tried to beat a hasty retreat.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Gurugram Police, said the suspects were involved in over 1,000 snatching cases and at least three murders in the millennium city.“The suspects revealed during questioning that they had intercepted a car to rob the occupants, but the woman at the wheel tried to speed away following which they shot at her to threaten the duo. Unfortunately, the bullet hit the woman and she collapsed,” he said.Also Read: Woman gets extortion call seeking Rs 10 lakh for lost phone with sensitive dataPooja Sharma, the victim, was driving towards Sector 40 with her fiancé, Sagar Manchanda, when the accused on a motorcycle allegedly asked them to stop and step out of their vehicle. Manchanda had told the police that the attackers fled soon after the shooting incident following which he drove Sharma to a private hospital, where she passed away a day later. Sharma had sustained a bullet injury in her head, which could not be removed, despite a surgical procedure, the police said.She worked for an information technology (IT) company’s medical claims and insurance department. Manchanda, a software engineer, was his colleague. The accused belong to Nuh, Mahendergarh in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh (MP) and shared a rented accommodation in the village. They used to rob the public in Gurugram after dark.Sangwan said the accused largely targeted people at isolated stretches and conducted reconnaissance of the area before targeting their victims. “The trio used a motorbike with a fake number plate and they own a car as well. They had visited the spot in their car soon after the shooting incident. They were under the impression that Sharma had survived. The following day, they gave their evening exploits a miss and vigorously scanned TV news channels for any information on the incident. They also bought an English daily newspaper for three consecutive days to get updates on the case,” he said.KK Rao, commissioner, Gurugram Police, said that it was a blind case, as the closed-circuit TV (CCTV) footage recovered from the spot was of little help. “Our teams had questioned nearly 500 people in a bid to crack the case. Policemen were deployed in civvies at several spots to get leads on the gang. The arrest has led to the cracking of over 1,000 cases of snatching and at least three murder cases in Gurugram,” Rao said.Police said the gang was also involved in snatching the mobile phone of a woman (45) from a mall in Sector 51 and was later trying to extort Rs 10 lakh from her. They had threatened to make her pictures, videos and other content stored in her smartphone public, if she did not cough up Rs 10 lakh.The woman had lodged a complaint at Sector 50 police station on October 2, but the police had failed to trace the suspects.The accused had even shot dead one of their friends on Diwali night at Shivaji Nagar in Gurugram, the police added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/snatchers-in-gurugram-had-shot-woman-driving-back-home-at-night-case-solved-police/story-GwTCtksQNUisKXpwf8ShdO.html

19-11-2020||Kolkata||Howrah in West Bengal tops the list of most polluted cities in India||West Bengal’s Howrah topped the list of the most polluted cities in India on Wednesday. Its air quality was much worse than Delhi and other cities in the National Capital Region, which have seen an improvement in the situation over the last few days because of rain and wind.Bhiwadi in Rajasthan was the second-worst polluted city followed by Kolkata in terms of the Air Quality Index (AQI), a colour-coded tool used to monitor air quality in major Indian cities on a real-time basis.According to the daily AQI bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board, the 24-hour average AQI value of Howrah at 4pm on Wednesday was 285, followed by Bhiwadi (267), Kolkata (266) and Delhi (211).Also Read: To make Yamuna pollution-free by 2023, DJB working out a concrete plan: CMOn the AQI scale, a value of 0-50 is considered good quality air; 51-100 satisfactory; 101-200 moderate; 201-300 poor; 301-400 very poor and 401-500 severe. On May 1, during the pan-India Covid-19 lockdown, both Kolkata and Howrah registered AQI values of less than 50.According to West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) data, the level of PM10 (coarse pollutants that are seven times finer than the human hair) at Ghusuri in Howrah shot up to 852 micrograms per metre cube around 6 am and to 915 micrograms per metre cube around 10 am on Wednesday. The PM10 should not ideally go above 100 micrograms per metre cube.“Ghushuri is an industrial area, densely populated and registers heavy traffic movement. We have asked the police and local authorities to sprinkle water on the roads so that pollution levels could be kept under control,” said a WBPCB official.Most of the monitoring stations in Kolkata recorded PM10 two times above the safe limits.The level of PM2.5 (finer particles that can reach up to the lungs) also shot up three to four in some places during the night, primarily because of temperature inversion in winter that traps pollutants close to the surface.“Steps have also been initiated to keep pollution levels under control in hot spots of Kolkata. Fire tenders have been deployed at the dumping sites to douse flames which often break out because of methane gas. The leather units which burn scarps leading to severe pollution in east Kolkata have been closed down,” said the WBPCB official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/howrah-in-west-bengal-tops-the-list-of-most-polluted-cities-in-india/story-2ekPGATV6csRI7n0LttvhL.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Businessman killed in Delhi, body thrown off train in Gujarat||A 46-year-old businessman was killed in north Delhi’s Adarsh Nagar, his body packed in a suitcase and loaded on a Rajdhani Express and then thrown off the running train somewhere in Gujarat by the fiance of a woman he was in an extramarital relationship with, the police said.The man’s head was first smashed with a brick, after which he was stabbed thrice and his neck slit, said Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west).“The businessman had objected to the woman getting married to someone else,” said the DCP. The victim, Neeraj Gupta, ran a finance firm in Karol Bagh and lived with his wife and children in Adarsh Nagar.On November 14, one of Gupta’s friends filed a missing complaint when he didn’t return home. That was followed up with Gupta’s wife filing a first information report (FIR) on Wednesday about his disappearance, said the DCP. “Gupta’s wife told us that for the last 10 years he had been in an extramarital relationship with his 29-year-old employee, Faisal,” said the DCP. Also Read: Delhi policewoman promoted for tracing 76 missing kids in last 3 monthsThe police began probing the disappearance from that angle and soon arrested Faisal, her fiance Juber, 28, and her 49-year-old mother, Shaheen Naaz. “It turned out that Faisal had recently got engaged to Juber. When Gupta got to know, he discouraged her from getting married and landed up at her rented home in Azadpur on the night of November 13,” said the DCP. There, an argument ensued in which Gupta allegedly pushed Faisal. “An enraged Juber first smashed his head with a brick. He then stabbed him thrice and slit his throat using a knife,” the DCP said. To dispose the body, they allegedly purchased a large suitcase, stuffed the body inside, hired an app-based cab and took it to Nizamuddin railway station. “Thereafter, Juber took over and loaded the suitcase on a Rajdhani train headed towards Goa. He works in the pantries of trains and that made his work easier,” said the DCP. While the train was passing through Bharuch in Gujarat, Juber allegedly threw the suitcase out. The police have recovered the knife and brick allegedly used in the murder. “We are making efforts to recover the body,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/businessman-killed-in-delhi-body-thrown-off-train-in-gujarat/story-qmd4qy9RfuNSqroo8VGhmK.html
19-11-2020||Mumbai||Mandatory Covid test for Maharashtra school teachers triggers rush, inconvenience||As the Maharashtra education department has made it mandatory for teachers to undergo an RT-PCR test for Covid-19 before schools reopen for classes 9 to 12 from November 23, some teachers have raised concerns about the process. On Wednesday, some teachers shared their difficulty in getting tests done from public hospitals in different parts of the state. “At the civic hospital, where a few of us went, we were first told that tests will happen only if a doctor prescribes or if patients have any symptoms. After we insisted on a test and showed the government rule mandating the test, we were finally allowed to take one. It was a terrible experience,” said the teacher of an aided school in suburban Mumbai. On Wednesday, the education department asked principals of schools to ensure that all the teachers are tested before school reopens. Principals said teachers were under immense pressure.“Priority should be given to the teachers who teach English, maths and science first, as classes for those subjects will begin first after reopening. After that, other teachers can be tested,” states the circular.Also Read: Mumbai’s Covid-19 cases continue to slide after the peaksAnil Bornare, president of the BJP teachers’ cell said more centres need to be made available for teachers testing without any hassle. “In some parts of the state, there are very few testing centres and relatively a high number of teachers and teaching staff that need to undergo the tests. We request the government to make additional centres available so that they can all be tested before schools reopen,” added Bornare.

As per the SOPs, parents would have to sign a written consent before students attend school. Similarly, students can study from their homes with the consent of their parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mandatory-covid-test-for-maharashtra-school-teachers-triggers-rush-inconvenience/story-AJVCc8iWIbig2HCzFuaPuI.html
19-11-2020||Bhopal||14 tribal families ostracised for donating Rs 50 less for Durga Puja in MP||Fourteen tribal families were ostracized in Madhya Pradesh’s Balaghat district, 431 km north east of Bhopal, for donating Rs 50 less for installation of Durga Puja pandal in the village, said police. Home minister Nirottam Mishra ordered an inquiry and asked police to take tough action against villagers for boycotting these families. The matter came to light after a month when the residents of Mote village lodged a complaint with Balaghat additional superintendent of police Gautam Singh Solanki on Wednesday. A villager, Dhan Singh Parte, said, “The musclemen of the village were setting up a pandal for Durga puja in October. They asked all the villagers to donate Rs 201 for the puja pandal but a few families, who were already facing financial constraints, donated Rs 151. But the organisers didn’t accept the donation and announced a social boycott of 14 such families.” Another villager Saghan Singh said, “The villagers stopped us from grazing our cattle and working in the other people’s farms. They even banned us from availing medical facilities at the primary health centre of the village. They stopped inviting us for functions in the village.” Balaghat, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Gautam Singh Solanki said, “The representatives of 14 families had come to lodge a complaint on Wednesday alleging that some villagers boycotted them for not paying donation for Durga puja pandal as demanded by them.” Also Read: Madhya Pradesh to get ‘gau cabinet’, announces CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan“They said they lodged a complaint at the nearest Lamta police station a few days ago.

Mishra said, “Sub-divisional officer of police (SDPO) Paraswada has been asked to inquire into the matter and punish the villagers, who called for boycott of the 14 families.” Congress spokesperson JP Dhanopia said, “The law and order situation has collapsed in MP. Scheduled caste and scheduled tribe and women are being harassed in MP but BJP-led state government ministers are busy in making hollow announcements. A team of Congress leaders will go to the village and stage a protest, if police don’t take any action.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/14-tribal-families-ostracised-for-donating-rs-50-less-for-durga-puja-in-mp/story-OOWrQuuo5sNXTkOmYybO2O.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi policewoman promoted for tracing 76 missing kids in last 3 months||Delhi Police head constable Seema Dhaka, 33, did not take a single day off for almost three months she worked to trace and reunite 76 missing children with their families. She would go home for two-three hours on most days and even if she got a clue about a child in the middle of the night, Dhaka would leave to follow it up at that hour.Dhaka, who is now an assistant sub-inspector, was on Wednesday awarded for her feat with an out-of-turn promotion under a new initiative that promises quick promotions for constables and head constables for tracing missing children. Also Read: Businessman killed in Delhi, body thrown off train in GujaratDhaka said some of the children have developed a special bond with her and a few of them wept when she handed them over to their families. “There were these two children whom I traced. While accompanying them to their homes in West Bengal, they developed a special bond with me during the train journey. They were crying when it was time for me to leave them with their parents,” said Dhaka.Watch: Delhi woman head constable awarded ASI rank for tracing 76 missing kids Being a mother, it was easier for her to bond with the children. “I have an eight-year-old son. I could feel what the children felt on being separated from their parents, what the parents felt on losing their children. That motivated me to work harder,” said Dhaka.She said a child she helped reunite with his family in Bengal after travelling on two separate boats in flood-hit areas in October did not want to go back to his stepfather.“The boy said that his stepfather was abusive. I had to ensure that the mother knew of it and that she would take care of the boy after I was gone. I ensured that the boy and the parents were counselled,” said Dhaka.Dhaka said that a lot of the children she helped reunite with their parents had been separated for long. She added some of them had quarrelled with their parents before running away from their homes.“Every tracing; every reunion posed its own challenges. It was often so difficult to make children help with the details of their parents and homes. But my senior officers lent all possible support. Police in different states also helped my work.”Dhaka even tested positive for Covid-19 and had to be isolated for three weeks in July. She returned to work as soon as she recovered. “The happiness on the faces of the parents of children upon their reunion motivated me.”Delhi police spokesperson Eish Singhal said Dhaka traced the 76 missing children to states like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.“Dhaka traced these children since August 7 this year when police commissioner SN Shrivastava announced incentives for those tracing a large number of children,” said Singhal. She said 56 of the children Dhaka traced are aged under 14.The Delhi police have traced 1,440 missing children since August 7 even as 1,222 were reported disappeared during this time.According to the incentives announced, constables and head constables, who trace 50 or more missing children in 12 months, are eligible for the out-of-turn promotions.In 2019, of 5,412 children reported missing, 61.64% of them were traced. This year, so far, the number of missing children is 3,507 while the recovery rate is 74.96%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-policewoman-promoted-for-tracing-76-missing-kids-in-last-3-months/story-kHBp092luFX6m84AduJYHI.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||After a short breather, pollution levels rise in Delhi||The national capital’s air quality remained in the “poor” category on Thursday morning, the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) data showed. Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) reading at 7am stood at 267. Thursday’s AQI reading was higher, as compared to Wednesday, when the 24-hour average stood at 211 based on the data collected from 37 monitoring stations across the city. An AQI reading between 0 and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Delhi’s AQI has fluctuated between poor and severe and moderate from November 13 to 17. On November 15, the AQI reading was 435, which fell in the “severe” category and improved to poor (221) the following day and further improved to moderate (171) on November 17. Also Read: Covid-19: CM Kejriwal calls all-party meeting as Delhi records highest deaths in single dayRain, good wind speed and low farm fire counts in neighbouring Haryana, Punjab and parts of western Uttar Pradesh (UP) after Diwali, which was celebrated on November 14, led to a significant improvement of the AQI. An analysis of the AQI data showed that Delhi experienced a moderate air quality day between November 13 and 17 for the first time since 2017. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), an initiative of the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), said the farm fire count rose to 427 on Wednesday, as compared to 98 on the previous day.The farm fires contributed to a spike in Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels -- ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres – and had peaked to around 40% in October, which came down appreciably after Diwali.“The stubble burning share in PM 2.5 levels in Delhi’s air is estimated at 8%. AQI may further worsen to the higher end of ‘poor’ to the lower end of the ‘very poor’ category on November 21 (Saturday), as the conductive meteorological environment created after rainfall is gradually retreating,” the SAFAR bulletin stated.V K Soni, the head of the environment monitoring research centre of India Meteorological Department (IMD), said wind speed is likely to remain high over the next two days and no significant deterioration is expected.“The average wind speed is likely to remain between 12 and 15 kilometres per hour (kmph), which will allow continuous dispersion of pollutants. Wind speed is likely to reduce Saturday, when the AQI may plunge to the lower end of the ‘very poor’ zone,” Soni said.The temperatures are also likely to dip in the national capital this week and are expected to be in single digits between Saturday and Monday (November 21-23).According to the IMD forecast, Delhi is likely to have a foggy Thursday morning, which may clear during the course of the day. The minimum and maximum temperatures are likely to be 10 and 26 degrees Celsius (C), respectively. On Wednesday, Delhi’s minimum temperature, recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is considered the official reading for the city, was 10.6 degrees C --- two notches below the season’s average. While the maximum temperature was 25.4 degrees C-- two notches below normal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/after-a-short-breather-pollution-levels-rise-in-delhi/story-sNgefjtvB5fPUSOnHW3TZJ.html

Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks from Uttarakhand have already been added to the list of world heritage sites by UNESCO in 1988 and 2005 respectively. Dhananjay Mohan, director of Wildlife Institute of India (WII), said that the institute is preparing a report about the importance of the Adi Kailash area which will soon be sent to the Centre. “We conducted a preliminary survey of Adi Kailash and nearby areas in the month of October, to learn more about the place. Adi Kailash is an important site both from the point of view of wildlife and cultural aspects. We are now working to prepare a report which will be sent to the Centre for writing to the appropriate authorities for getting a UNESCO World Heritage Site tag for it,” said Mohan.

19-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Wedding curbs back as coronavirus cases hit 500,000||Only 50 people will be allowed at weddings in Delhi, down from a cap of 200, according to an order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) that has accepted the first of two suggestions by the Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s government to reinstate some curbs in a bid to control the spread of the coronavirus disease.Delhi has been in the grip of a third, and the deadliest yet, wave of Covid-19 infections, with latest data showing 131 more people died due to the disease -- the most number of fatalities in a 24-hour period. According to the Delhi government’s health bulletin, there were 7,486 new infections, taking the total number of cases to above 500,000. The caseload has already stretched thin Delhi’s hospitals, with ICU and ventilator bed availability running at the risk of being overwhelmed.The tighter limit on weddings follows a request sent by Kejriwal on Tuesday to Union government authorities, from whom he has also sought the permission to lock down market places if they seem to be turning into infection hot spots. The request has been sent to the Union home ministry via Delhi’s lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal. Officials aware of the process said they are yet to hear back from the central authorities. Also Read| Coronavirus in Delhi: Feluda test kit set to hit the market today“In closed spaces, the maximum of 50% of the hall capacity will be allowed, with a ceiling of 50 persons… In open spaces, keeping the size of the ground/space in view, subject to a ceiling of 50 persons,” said the order, a copy of which HT has seen.Kejriwal said the move should not be seen as a lockdown as such.“For the next few days, we will observe the situation on the ground, especially violation of Covid-19 regulations and assess if any particular market can turn into a hot spot. It is not that we are shutting down markets. Saving economy is equally important for us as fighting against Covid-19. We will try all means. We will not close any market unless it is extremely necessary,” he said.The situation has been described as alarming by officials and experts. “The situation is as bad as it was a week ago; almost every hour I get a call to arrange a bed. Even though more beds have been added, there is still a shortage, and I do not see any signs of the situation improving any time soon. Probably 10-12 days later we may see a decrease in numbers but not right now,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory and critical care medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital.The CM has called an all-party meeting on Thursday to discuss the situation.It was on October 31 when Delhi, in line with recommendations from the Union government, raised the ceiling on wedding guests to 200. A little over a week later, the city added 8,593 cases – the highest it has recorded so far. As new cases poured in, the Capital’s vacant hospital beds – particularly intensive care units (ICUs) and ventilator beds – dwindled. On November 15, the Union home minister Amit Shah held a meeting with top officials of both administrations and decided to augment the infrastructure and double the rate of testing.Also Read: Covid-19 pandemic fears kill the rush on trains, buses, many prefer to drive home for ChhathAccording to officials aware of the preparations, orders are likely to be issued to lay down a road map of how tests will be increased from the current 60,000 odd to about 100,000-120,000. A core challenge would be to increase the proportion of RT-PCR tests that require labs.“Currently, the city does about 57,000 tests a day, of which nearly 20,000 are done using RT-PCR method. Delhi has a capacity of 27,000 tests. This existing capacity will be utilised,” Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said on Tuesday. “Also, laboratories under the ICMR and the health ministry will be used to add 10,000 tests. Another 1,000 will be added by scientific institutions in the city,” Paul added. On Wednesday, the Delhi government issued fresh orders to hospitals under its control to increase the number of ICU beds. Kejriwal said this will add around 663 beds in these institutions and, along with the 750 committed by the Union government, it will increase the number of such beds in the Capital by around 1,400.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic“This will be accomplished by day after tomorrow.

So around 1,400 beds will be ready,” he said while visiting the GTB Hospital.He reiterated his assurance that while there is a spike in cases, there are enough hospital beds available. But, he added, “there is a shortage of ICU beds and we are looking into it”.According to figures tracked by the government and updated daily, of the 3,600-odd ICU and ventilator beds, less than 450 remain available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-wedding-curbs-back-as-coronavirus-cases-hit-500-000/story-bdhAnXAbfS4Qq57rEr3ogK.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: CM Kejriwal calls all-party meeting as Delhi records highest deaths in single day||As the national capital grapples with a spurt in Covid-19 cases, the Delhi government is working to add 660 ICU beds in its hospitals in the next few days and the Railways will be providing coaches with 800 beds, while an all-party meeting has been called by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday to discuss the situation. Delhi recorded 7,486 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the infection tally in the city to over five lakh, while 131 new fatalities, the highest single-day death count till date, pushed the toll to 7,943, authorities said. With medical facilities under strain, as many as 45 doctors and 160 paramedics of the paramilitary forces have also arrived in the capital to serve the people.Also Read | Coronavirus in Delhi: Feluda test kit set to hit the market today A day after Kejriwal spoke of reimposing certain restrictions, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Wednesday reverted to the earlier cap of 50 guests at marriage functions instead of 200 allowed through its October 31 order. The national capital has been witnessing a spurt in coronavirus cases since October 28 when daily cases breached the 5,000-mark for the first time. The single-day rise in cases crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11. The city had recorded 104 deaths in a day on November 12, the highest in five months. On Thursday, Kejriwal will hold the all-party meeting to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the city, even as Opposition parties said that they would raise issues like “inadequate” testing and press for proper enforcement of precautionary measures. An AAP leader said discussions would be held on the rising cases of Covid-19 cases, and the chief minister would seek cooperation from all party leaders, MPs and MLAs in spreading awareness and advocating Covid-appropriate behaviour in their constituencies. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said he will attend the meeting, but added the move has come late. “I will suggest the AAP government strictly enforce Covid-19 safety measures like using face masks and social distancing in the markets instead of talking about lockdown. I will also ask the chief minister to improve facilities like ICU beds at its hospitals in Delhi so that more patients can be treated there,” Gupta said. DPCC chief Anil Chaudhary will also attend the all-party meeting on Thursday. “We have been raising the issue of inadequate testing. Besides this, we will also raise the issue of ban on Chhath Puja at public places in the meeting,” Chaudhary said. Meanwhile, the chief minister visited GTB Hospital and said that over 660 ICU beds will be added in various Delhi government hospitals in the next few days in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city. He said, “We had a meeting with doctors at GTB Hospital and they have agreed to add 238 ICU beds in the next two days.” “In all, 663 ICU beds shall be added in various Delhi hospitals in the next few days,” he said. Also, the Union Home Ministry on Tuesday said that 45 doctors and 160 paramedics of the paramilitary forces have arrived in Delhi while the Railways is making available coaches with 800 beds at a station here to be used as health and isolation centres. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is going to add 250 ICU beds to the existing 250 in addition to creating 35 BIPAP beds in the next 3-4 days at its Covid-19 hospital near the Delhi airport, a home ministry spokesperson said. These developments come in the wake of 12 decisions taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday following concern over the spurt in Covid-19 cases. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, however, said that the Delhi government has no plan to impose a lockdown. It may press for certain restrictions in market areas for some days to prevent the spread of Covid-19, if such a need arises, he said. Lockdown was not a solution to the pandemic. It could be tackled through proper medical arrangements which the government was doing effectively, he said while interacting with reporters at the Delhi Secretariat. While capping the number of 50 guests at wedding functions, Chief Secretary Vijay Dev, in an order, said that the decision was taken in view of the sudden surge in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, which has further been aggravated due to rising pollution levels owing to various factors. “In closed spaces, a maximum of 50 percent of the hall capacity will be allowed, with a ceiling of 50 persons. Wearing of face masks, maintaining social distancing, provision for thermal scanning and use of hand wash or sanitizer will continue to be mandatory,” Dev said. He also said, “In open spaces, keeping the size of the ground/space in view, subject to a ceiling of 50 persons and with strict observance of social distancing, mandatory wearing of face masks....” On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 6,396 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the infection tally to over 4.95 lakh, while 99 more fatalities pushed the death toll to 7,812.

19-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Dancing in the park||A romantic pair is holding hands, etc. An overly-dressed couple is posing for pre-wedding photography. A noisy family is busy over chips packets. Two guys are playing badminton. A jhaal muri seller is watching a Haryanvi music video on his mobile. A woman in a track suit is walking purposefully in circles. A bunch of sweating male athletes are playfully tossing cuss words at each other. So far, so Lodhi Garden. It is early evening in the central Delhi public park.Suddenly something unusual surfaces, not part of the park’s regular sights. This is a group of young women, wearing the same kind of saris, same kind of bangles, but not the same kind of face masks. Each of them has her eyes heavily lined with kohl. They are walking along the narrow track running between the Bara Gumbad and Sheesh Gumbad monuments. Every eye turns to look at them. But the women keep walking. The women are heading to the lawn that faces the western wall of Bara Gumbad. They take off their sandals. All feet are decked with what appears to be henna.Members of a Mehrauli-based troupe, the women are Bharatanatyam dancers. They came to Lodhi Garden to make a dance video for their group’s Instagram handle, @team__maugdha__. Everyone in the group, including the cameraman—Vishnu Sathish, an aspiring videographer—is a native of Kerala. Mr Sathish’s principal equipment is his mobile. “Lodhi Garden is just the right place for our sequence... it is full of greens, and flowers, and there’s a lake with ducks.” By now it is getting dark. The women remove their masks and help each other apply a fresh layer of lipstick. Minutes later they put back the masks and start to rehearse their dance steps for the day’s last shoot. But before that, on request, they pose against the backdrop of centuries-old Sheesh Gumbad, making dance mudras inspired from the life of Lord Krishna. It is a beautiful moment, and also very poignant because of the masked faces reminding one of the horrors of the ongoing pandemic coronavirus. The women leave the park an hour later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-dancing-in-the-park/story-WJBA5HeKW8p9bbWlTFfZoO.html
19-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab farmers refuse to end rail blockade||Punjab’s farmer unions on Wednesday decided against lifting the blockade on passenger trains, drawing criticism over their “unyielding” stance from chief minister Amarinder Singh who has otherwise been sympathetic to their cause. After a meeting, the farm bodies said they would consider allowing passenger trains to run in the state if the Centre started running goods trains first. The decision came five days after a meeting with Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar (agriculture) and Piyush Goyal (railways) in Delhi. During the meeting, the farmer bodies were asked to move away from railway properties as a precondition for resumption of goods trains.Though the farmer bodies’ meeting with the ministers was said to have been held in a conducive environment it failed to reach a fruitful conclusion. The farmer unions demanded that new central laws detrimental to farmers’ interests must be repealed.In a statement, the chief minister called the farmer unions’ decision “extremely unfortunate”, saying their blockade of passenger trains was obstructing the movement of goods trains as well. He said he had expected them to back down from their “unyielding” approach, particularly in view of the state government’s absolute support for their cause. “They should realise things cannot continue like this ad infinitum, and if rail transportation continues to remain suspended any longer, the state will be plunged into an irreversible crisis,” he said.On November 13, the unions had said they would take a call on allowing passenger trains on November 18. “All farm bodies unanimously decided that the moment the Centre will allow passage of goods trains to Punjab, the farmer unions will allow passenger trains,” said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakounda). According to him, all aspects were discussed in the meeting but leaders of the farmer unions wanted the Centre to show a good gesture. On September 24, farmer organisations had blocked trains, including freight carriers, against the new laws. On October 1, the unions again started a ‘rail roko’ (stop trains) movement for five days. They announced allowing passage of freight trains from October 6, but said passenger trains would continue to be blocked. The movement of freight trains was halted by the railway board on October 7 and the ban has been extended till November 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-farmers-refuse-to-end-rail-blockade/story-yH5MHnCaKFPZ94mLcBIllJ.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: Bad air days retreat, but next spell may not be far||Delhi has registered a drastic improvement in its air quality in the last couple of days. The PM2.5 concentration was in the moderate and poor categories on November 16 and 17. This was a welcome relief after 25 days of severe and very poor PM2.5 concentration days in a row. What explains this sudden improvement? Does it mean that the rest of the winter season will be pollution-free? An HT analysis of historical trends suggests that Delhi’s pollution status depends on a mix of meteorological, outside (such as farm fires) and local factors. As the importance of farm fires will come down for the rest of the season -- the process of stubble burning is almost over – the pollution situation will depend on the first and the third factors. As temperatures drop further, air quality is expected to worsen again after what is at best a temporary respite. 1. How bad was pollution this year? In terms of the seven-day average of PM2.5 concentration, the first two weeks of November were much worse this year than November 2019 and slightly worse than November 2018. A long-term comparison shows that air pollution usually starts rising in October, peaks sometime in late October or early November, and then comes down before rising again in December. . To be sure, the average PM2.5 concentrations used in this analysis are based on just three of 38 air quality stations for which the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) provides historical data on its website. This is because only these three stations; IHBAS Dilshad Garden, RK Puram and Shaidpur, have consistent data available for the September to November 17 period from 2016 onwards. 2. Is there a direct correlation between farm fires and pollution in Delhi? The number of fires detected in Punjab and Haryana this year between September and November 17 were 77,703, according to satellite data. This number was 46,649 in 2019, and 60,536 in 2018. The 2020 number is the third highest since 2012, the earliest period for which comparable data is available. The number of fires detected in the same period was 97,985 in 2016 and 79,511 in 2014. The fires did, however, start earlier this year. The 1,111 fires detected in September are the highest for the month since 2012. The role played by farm fires in air quality in Delhi can, however, be assessed when we have comparable air quality data, which is available from 2016. A seven-day rolling average of farm fires since 2016 shows that it is only in 2016 that farm fires were almost consistently higher than in 2020, except a brief period in late October when the 2017 figures were also higher than those in 2020. Also Read: Air quality falls to poor as stubble fires rise againAlthough there is no long-term data on this, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) publishes a chart on contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s air pollution during the stubble burning period. This chart shows that the highest contribution that farm fires have made to Delhi’s air pollution (42%) this season was on November 5. HT’s analysis shows 5,239 fires on the day in Punjab and Haryana, the second-highest number for a day this season. On the day the highest number of fires was recorded (5,316 on November 7), the contribution of farm fires was 32%. 3. Meteorology and local factors Delhi’s air improved to moderate quality after two days of Diwali this year. A comparison since 2016 shows that this is an extremely rare event. What explains this? The answer is rain and wind. Delhi received a rainfall of 1.2 millimetres a day after Diwali, something that has never happened since 2016. Even though the wind speed was lower than what it was in earlier years, it was blowing from east to west (Delhi to Punjab) rather than west to east. This means that Delhi was spared the limited impact of even the reduced farm fires in Punjab and Haryana. And one of the biggest reasons why air quality worsened relatively earlier this year was the lack of rains and low wind speed in Delhi from September onwards. The 20.4 mm rainfall recorded in Delhi in September is lower than all the years since 2016.  Unless meteorology continues to favour Delhi, the improvement in AQI will not stay. Then there are local factors -- the burning of bio-mass, traffic, industrial pollution, and dust from construction activities. The SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research) app predicts deterioration in air quality from November 20 to 21 for Delhi from “poor” to the lower end of the “very poor” category. This is where the challenge of controlling pollution persists, even after farm fires are over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-bad-air-days-retreat-but-next-spell-may-not-be-far/story-0YjFZyj6JHG5QfEoP62gQK.html
19-11-2020||Chandigarh||Cracks of mistrust visible in coalition, says Deepender||Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda on Wednesday said there were “cracks of mistrust” in the BJP-JJP coalition in Haryana.Addressing a press conference, Deepender said the mistrust between the two allies was visible following the impressive win of the Congress in Baroda bypoll. “The chief minister had to publicly say that the BJP candidate did not get the JJP vote,” he added. The MP said the JJP should clarify if it agreed to or discarded the chief minister’s remarks. “The bypoll result has created a crisis of confidence among the ruling coalition. During the elections, the BJP candidate had lost confidence in the CM as his photograph was missing from party posters,” he added.Deepender said the state government has passed the ‘Right to Recall’ law for sarpanches, but it should first apply this law to its MLAs and they should resign and get re-elected. “The people of Baroda have used their right to recall against the government. The public has passed a motion of no confidence against the government and we will go to different parts of the state with this message,” he said.Abhay slams ‘anti-conversion law’INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala on Wednesday said that the “anti-conversion law” proposed by the BJP-JJP regime will create an atmosphere of fear in the state. The proposed legislation has been termed a law against “love jihad” by home minister Anil Vij. “The BJP has already weakened the country economically. Now, it wants to damage the social fabric of this nation,” Abhay said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cracks-of-mistrust-visible-in-coalition-says-deepender/story-do1o4phgfMZkyxrWHCcKgM.html
19-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid-19 cases continue to slide after the peaks||After witnessing two peaks in its Covid-19 cases graph, since the pandemic began in March, Mumbai has seen a steady decline in infections over the past few weeks. The city has recorded fewer than 1,000 Covid-19 cases daily since November 1. The dip comes after infections in Mumbai spiked in May, September and the first half of October, with 2,848 cases being reported on October 7 – the highest so far in 24 hours in the city. While the drop in cases can partly be attributed to reduced number of tests being conducted, health experts said the positivity rate coming down to 15.9% this week from 18.7% in September also indicates an overall dip in infections in Mumbai. Positivity rate is the number of Covid-19-positive cases from the total tests conducted. Mumbai has so far conducted 1,707,237 tests (as of November 17), and has 270,660 cases. In September and October, there were around 17,000 tests conducted daily in the city, and in the past few weeks, this number has dropped to around 4,000.“We should be testing more in Mumbai if we compare the number of tests to the city’s population. Mumbai’s maximum capacity to conduct tests is around 20,000. In the past week, testing has reduced, but that is also because there are fewer infections. Who will you test, if there are fewer people infected,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra government’s task force to reduce Covid-19 mortality in the state.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) public health department, too, said the situation in Mumbai has definitely improved. “We are seeing fewer Covid-19 cases every day in November. We also have more vacant hospital beds. But we are in wait-and-watch mode right now.”As of Wednesday, Mumbai has 71%, or 12,529, of 17,467 hospital beds vacant, while 4,938 beds are occupied. A senior civic official, on condition of anonymity, said the burden on hospitals has also reduced as cases have gone down in November. “We have informally directed all hospital administrations to grant doctors leave of absence if they apply for it and wish to rest and recover from the fatigue of the previous eight-nine months. Right now, they have scope to do so, as after the festival season, post-Diwali, Christmas and New Year’s, cases may go up again,” said the official. Kakani, too, said the next month will be crucial. “Despite the present scenario, we are on alert owing to unlock of restrictions and the festival season. Our core strategy – of testing, quarantining and ensuring sufficient hospital beds are available – remains in place. I would say we have to wait and watch until the end of December,” said Kakani.The civic administration is expecting yet another peak in cases in the coming weeks. Another senior civic official, who did not wish to be named, said, “Although we thought September was the second wave, BMC is not categorising it as a wave. It was a peak. This is because prior to September, Mumbai’s daily cases did not drastically fall. Only cases being reported over the next few days will determine if there will be the second wave, or it will be yet another peak in Mumbai.”While the administration is hoping herd immunity kicks in and helps keep Covid-19 cases fewer, officials have also noticed that citizens, who tested positive in the first few months after the pandemic broke out in March, still have antibodies to fight the infection. Herd immunity is used to describe the indirect protection conferred to a population in which the majority of people have natural or acquired immunity to an infection.The BMC conducted two rounds of sero survey in Mumbai’s slum and non-slum residences in Chembur, Matunga, Sion and Dahisar. The results of the survey conducted in August indicated that 45% among those tested in slums had Covid-19 antibodies and 18% among those tested from non-slums had antibodies. The results of the survey conducted in July indicated that 57% among those tested in slums had Covid-19 antibodies and 16% among those tested from non-slums had antibodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-covid-19-cases-continue-to-slide-after-the-peaks/story-xufQ3I3lQqXJYme6wvQsqL.html
19-11-2020||City||Paddy payment of about 50,000 Haryana farmers stuck, officials blame wrong bank details||Despite the tall claims of the government of disbursal of money within 72 hours, thousands of farmers in Haryana are still awaiting the payments of the produce they had sold to the government a month ago. As per the information provided by the Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board, as many as eight lakh farmers had registered themselves on the ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora’ portal to sell paddy to government agencies this kharif season.But till date, about 50,000 farmers did not get their payment, which is reportedly stuck as the farmers furnished wrong account numbers and Indian Financial System Code (IFSC).“I had sold my produce of six acres to government on October 9 in Ladwa grain market of Kurukshetra district. Forty days have passed, but I did not get a single rupee of my payment of Rs 4 lakh from the government,” said a farmer, Balbir Singh, of Rajepur village in Karnal district.“Farmers, who adopted payments via commission agents, have already got their money,” he added. Amit Kumar, a small farmer from Kandroli village of Yamunanagar district, has filed a complaint on the CM Window as he did not get his payment of Rs 5.32 lakh for 282 quintal parmal variety he had sold between October 6 and 16.As per the information, the payment of those farmers is stuck, who had adopted direct payment option, while the farmers who had sought the payment via commission agents did not face any problem.Officials of the Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board said that payments were stuck as the farmers provided wrong information either about their bank accounts or IFSC at the time of registration on the ‘Meri Fasal Mera Byora’ portal.Haryana food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department additional chief secretary PK Das said, “Yes, payments of about 48,000 farmers could not be disbursed due to wrong bank account details and the issue came to the fore during the disbursement process.”He said have been sent to these farmers to get their bank account details updated so that the payments could be disbursed without any further delay. Das said that officials have been deputed and the issue will be resolved within a week. As per the figures of the Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board, the government agencies have so far procured around 54.8 lakh MT of parmal varieties of paddy and procurement was still going on in some mandis. Officials expect that the procurement may reach around 56 lakh MT this year. Out of the total paddy procurement of over Rs 10,000 crore, the procurement agencies have so far made the payments of around Rs 9,016 crore, including Rs 4,390 crore by Haryana Food and Supplies Department, Rs 3,119 crore by HAFED and Rs 1,607 crore by Haryana State Warehousing Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/paddy-payment-of-about-50-000-haryana-farmers-stuck-officials-blame-wrong-bank-details/story-rjf3uGRhBFPW6hmSKvyY3J.html
19-11-2020||Chandigarh||Over 150 Haryana government school students test positive for Covid-19 in a fortnight||More than 150 Haryana government school students have tested positive for Covid-19 in Jhajjar, Jind and Rewari districts since the educational institutions reopened after eight months for Classes 9 to 12 on November 2. Seventy-eight students of government schools were found infected in Rewari, at least 30 in Jind and 34 in Jhajjar. Rewari district education officer (DEO) Rajesh Kumar said of the 78 cases reported since the reopening, 25 students tested positive in the past two days. “We have sealed the Government Senior Secondary School at Kund village for two weeks after 19 students tested positive for Covid-19. According to norms, a school is closed for 48 hours for sanitisation if one positive case is detected. The school is closed for two weeks if the contacts of the students are found positive,” he said. Dr Gopal, deputy civil surgeon Jind, said as many as 49 people, including 10 teachers and over 30 students, have been found infected so far in the district.“ We have been asking the school management to follow safety guidelines and inform us if any of their student and staff experience any symptom of the disease. It is not advisable to shut down the schools as the students have suffered a lot. If the school will follow safety guidelines, the students will able to continue their studies,” he added.Dr Sunil Lakhra, the district medical officer at Jhajjar, said samples of 1,197 students from 12 government schools have been collected in the past two weeks. Of them, 34 tested positive. “Most students found positive are asymptomatic. We have sanitised their schools,” he said. Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted, “It is a sign of worry that a total of 149 students and 12 teachers have tested positive for the virus.”“Will CM and education minister take cognisance of the situation. Is government adhering to social distancing and other guidelines in the schools? Does CM have any plan to stop the spread of the virus?” he questioned.Social distancing norms violatedWhen this reporter visited the Government Senior Secondary School at Kheri Asadh village on the Rohtak-Delhi road last week, most students were found violating social distancing norms. Students had not been provided coloured masks and badges to segregate them into groups for distancing. At the Government Senior Secondary School for Girls at Bohar village, students said that they were being allowed to enter only after checks, including thermal screening. Tanu Nandal, a student of the school, said, “Thermal scanning is done at the gate itself and we observe distancing in the classroom. We carry our own water bottles and tiffins. Only one student is allowed to go to the toilet at a time.” Three students had tested positive for the virus at a government school in Jind’s Narwana on November 6, four days after schools reopened amid the pandemic. Haryana on Wednesday reported 30 more coronavirus deaths, its highest single-day fatality count so far, even as 2,562 fresh cases pushed the state’s infection tally to 2,07,039. So far, 2,093 people have died from the infection in the state, according to a health department bulletin.Bharat Biotech will start the phase 3 clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, at Rohtak’s PGIMS from Friday. PGIMS V-C Dr OP Kalra said the trial will be conducted in partnership with ICMR. “The phase 3 trials will involve 1,000 volunteers from Haryana out of 25,800 across India. The trial has been registered and approved. We will administer two intramuscular injections, about 28 days apart. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either two 6microgram injections of Covaxin or two shots of a placebo. The volunteers will be 18 years and above. This time, patients suffering from other diseases can also take part in the human trials,” he added.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/112-haryana-government-school-students-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-a-fortnight/story-NIlIlT3qkQBXprxog2kVHP.html
19-11-2020||Chandigarh||11 arrested for grabbing HUDA plots in Faridabad||Haryana state vigilance bureau has arrested 11 people allegedly involved in fraudulent grabbing of HUDA (now Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran) plots, which were meant to be allotted to slum dwellers in Faridabad. The 11 people are in addition to the 15 others arrested earlier by the vigilance bureau. A bureau spokesperson said the accused acted in collusion with a HUDA official in Faridabad. The spokesperson said that the matter pertained to allotment of 36 square yard plots to slum dwellers near Badarpur border in Faridabad. In 1993, HUDA got the land occupied by the slum dwellers vacated and allotted 36 square yard plots in lieu to 388 slum dwellers in Sector 30, Faridabad. However, possession of 38 such plots was allegedly taken by ineligible persons in a fraudulent manner. The spokesperson said the matter was inquired by the vigilance bureau. After obtaining permission from the state government, a criminal case under sections 448 (house trespass), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/11-arrested-for-grabbing-huda-plots-in-faridabad/story-jLn5sNPdMHlwSdoRIhrZkL.html
19-11-2020||Chandigarh||J&K government to implement Forest Rights Act||The Jammu and Kashmir government will implement the Forest Rights Act, 2006, which was not applicable in the union territory for the last 14 years, to grant and safeguard the rights of forest dwellers, an official spokesperson said on Wednesday.The Forest Rights Act provides for the granting of rights of forest lands to forest dwellers. However, the rights conferred under this act shall be ‘heritable but not alienable or transferable’, he said.This step is being taken in view of the large scale encroachment of huge forest lands and its illegal sale in Jammu and Kashmir.Chief Secretary B V R Subrahmanyam on Wednesday chaired a meeting to review the implementation of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act and Rules, which became applicable in the union territory post the enactment of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, the spokesperson said.He said departments of tribal affairs, and forest, ecology and environment started working on its implementation in October this year.“It may be pointed out that the Forest Rights Act of 2006 provides for granting of rights to forest dwellers across the country,” the spokesperson said.This central Act was, however, not applicable or implemented in Jammu and Kashmir in the last 14 years. It became applicable only after October 31, 2019.On August 5, 2019, the Centre revoked the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and split it into two union territories -- Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.The two UTs came into existence on October 31, 2019.The spokesperson said it was decided that the ‘survey of claimants’ by the forest rights committees for assessing the nature and extent of rights being claimed at village level be completed by January 15, 2021, for their further submission to the respective sub-divisional committees.The sub-divisional committees shall complete the process of scrutiny of claims and preparation of ‘record of forest rights’ by or before January 31, 2021.Similarly, district level committees shall consider and approve the record and grant forest rights by March 1, 2021.The spokesperson said it was decided that the forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers will be provided with the rights over forest land for the purpose of habitation or self-cultivation, livelihood, ownership, access to collect, use, and dispose of minor forest produce, and entitlement to seasonal resources among others.“However, the rights conferred under this Act shall be heritable but not alienable or transferable,” he said.The Act also provides that on the recommendation of the gram sabha, forest land up to one hectare can be diverted for the purpose of developing government facilities including schools, hospitals, minor water bodies, rainwater harvesting structures, minor irrigation canals, vocational training centres, non-conventional sources of energy, roads, etc.It also empowers the holders of forest rights, and gram sabhas to protect wildlife, forest, biodiversity, catchment areas, water sources and other ecologically sensitive areas besides ensuring that the habitat of forest dwelling STs and other traditional forest dwellers is preserved.Chief Secretary Subrahmanyam impressed upon the forest department to immediately constitute the four-tier committees -- state level monitoring committee, district level committee, sub-divisional level committee, and forest rights committee -- to implement the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 in the UT.For periodic review of the process and procedures associated with the Forest Rights Act and Rules, the forest department was asked to devise a suitable review mechanism along with monitoring formats, the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-government-to-implement-forest-rights-act/story-7v4PLQG5h55lIUtZwOKjWJ.html
19-11-2020||Education||Maharashtra HSC, SSC supplementary exams: MSBHSE announces Covid-19 pandemic rules||The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) announced the rules for conducting the supplementary exams of HSC (Class 12) and SSC (Class 10) which begin on November 20. Allowing only 12 students in every classroom, sanitising classrooms, providing hand sanitisers and hand wash to students are some of the rules.While supplementary exams of students who failed to clear the February-March round of regular exams are held in July every year, this year due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdown, the exams will be held in November-December. Supplementary exams for HSC will be held between November 20 and December 10 while those for SSC will be held between November 20 and December 5. In Mumbai division, which consists of Thane, Raigad and Palghar and usually has the highest number of students appearing for the exams, more than 22,000 students have registered for HSC exams and around 12,000 students have registered for SSC exams this year. Sandeep Sangave, secretary of Mumbai divisional board, said several precautions are put in place to ensure that exams are safely conducted. “We have provided hand sanitisers to centres and have also provided them allowance to get the premises sanitised. Hand wash and thermal guns are also provided in each centre. Similarly, instead of 25 students per class, this time we have allowed only 12 students in a class to ensure physical distancing,” Sangave added. HSC exams will be held in 103 centres while SSC exams will be held in 95 centres across Mumbai division. Teachers from schools in the state are required to get RT-PCR tests done before schools reopen for Classes 9 to 12 from November 23. “So almost all teachers will be tested before the exams begin,” said an official from the state education department. While the board does not have any specific instructions for students with suspected Covid-19 or those with symptoms, Sangave said that permissions with respect to separate seating might be granted depending on the case. “If such a case comes to us and a student has to be isolated, we shall ensure he/she writes the exams with proper care and isolation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hsc-ssc-supplementary-exams-maharashtra-board-announces-covid-19-pandemic-rules/story-HFeYGZwFIxTmKiSv9ab4wM.html
19-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s KEM, Nair hospitals to conclude phase 2 of Oxford Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial||BYL Nair Hospital and King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital are set to conclude the second round of phase-2 human trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 (Covishield) vaccine. Hospital authorities said they expect phase 3 of the trial to begin by the first week of December.In August, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) selected the two hospitals to conduct the phases 2 and 3 clinical trials of Covishield vaccine. As per ICMR rules, after completion of 28 days from the first dose, volunteers are given the second dose, following which hospitals have to wait for another 28 days before starting phase 3 with the approval of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (the national regulatory body for medicines).Nair Hospital was initially instructed to administer the first vial of the vaccine to 100 volunteers. Later, with a nod from ICMR, an additional 48 volunteers were selected for the first round of phase 2. “A total of 148 volunteers have been given the first dose, of which 96 have been given the second dose. Phase 2 of the clinical trial will conclude in the next week,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean, BYL Nair Hospital.According to sources, KEM Hospital is also in the last stage of the second round of phase 2 of the trial. “We have given the first vial to 100 volunteers. We have administered the second vial to more than 95 volunteers. In the next one to two days, it [phase 2] will conclude,” said a senior doctor from the hospital. Despite repeated calls, Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital was unavailable for comment.After phase 1 of the clinical trial, Covishield vaccine was found to induce a strong immune response. It provokes a T cell (white blood cells that can attack cells infected with the coronavirus) response within 14 days of vaccination, and an antibody response within 28 days.“Phase 3 will mostly be initiated by the first week of December. The same volunteers will have to participate in the next phase,” said Dr Bharmal.Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), which is the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines in terms of volume, and British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca partnered to manufacture the experimental Covid-19 vaccine candidate formulated at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-kem-nair-hospitals-to-conclude-phase-2-of-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trial/story-rzUMI4TAHdanw07xpLNWVP.html
19-11-2020||Mumbai||BMC to focus on Mumbai slums with possibility of Covid-19 surge due to reverse migration||Anticipating reverse migration after Diwali and a resurgence of Covid-19 cases, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will refocus its Covid containment efforts on slums, where the spread of the infection has been brought under control. BMC says it is preparing to handle a surge of 40,000 active cases in the city and health infrastructure set up for Covid-19 will not be deactivated despite the current dip in recorded cases.In a meeting undertaken by guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray on Wednesday, it was decided that along with a focus on high-rises, attention upon slums will be increased. Thackeray posted on Twitter about the review meeting, saying, “We discussed multiple scenarios, our preparations to control an expected surge in Covid-19 cases in a review meeting. Post the festival season and a lot of reverse migration going on, we must ramp up our surveillance, awareness and screening.”BMC officials said facilities would be ramped up to handle around 40,000 active cases at a time. The highest number of active cases in Mumbai so far was over 34,000 in September.Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We have decided to be ready for 40,000 active cases in the city, in case there is a surge post-Diwali.” He added, “We have around 150 facilities active and around 400 facilities are on standby for handling any possible surge. The focus will also be on slums considering there is a possibility of reverse migration post-Diwali. We will be stationing mobile testing vans in areas with a high population of slums.”Areas like Borivli, Kandivli, Malad and Andheri were also reviewed at the meeting. Kakani said, “In western suburbs, we used to earlier have 500-550 cases daily, but that has now gone down to 200-250. This indicates it has gone down, but the numbers are still high, and we are taking measures to control the spread.”Testing figures, which reduced in November, will be increased to around 12,000 to 15,000 tests daily. Till now, 17.07 lakh tests have been completed, and the positivity rate is 15.85%. The average period of doubling of Covid-19 cases is 320 days, and the average growth rate is 0.22%.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based physician, said, “It has been a global trend that post unlock, a surge or second wave is witnessed in three to four months. In the case of Mumbai too, there is a possibility of a surge unless we take proper precautions. However, authorities need to ensure that daily testing is the same or increased in the coming days.

19-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government issues guidelines for Chhath Puja celebrations||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday issued guidelines to be followed while celebrating Chhath Puja in the state. As per the standard operating procedure (SOP) chalked out by the state home department, which was approved by chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday, citizens have been urged to not crowd the waterfronts and beaches to celebrate the festival, and instead, celebrate it from their homes.This year, Chhat Puja celebrations started on Wednesday and will end on Saturday morning. The festival is observed mostly by Bihar natives along with people from Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh. The guidelines of the state came a day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced restrictions on Chhath Puja celebrations near natural water bodies in the city, and asked devotees to avoid crowding, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Thackeray, according to a statement from the CM’s office, has directed local administrations to set up artificial ponds across the city to ensure that people can conduct rituals without crowding. The state government has banned bursting of firecrackers and use of loudspeakers at the sites where artificial ponds will be set up. According to the SOP, celebrants have been urged to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, including using masks when in public and ensuring that social distancing is followed.After the BMC denied public celebrations, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called it an injustice to devotees. It demanded Chhat Puja celebrations be allowed with some restrictions like those issued for Ganesh Utsav and Durga Puja. The state government is expecting a surge in Covid-19 cases after Diwali, and hence, largescale public gatherings at such festivals are not permitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-government-issues-guidelines-for-chhath-puja-celebrations/story-ZaqvQ36t1mUHLmS9y8zT3O.html

The patient was suffering from pulmonary issues and was on the ventilator for almost 28 days. Sandeep Malvi, deputy commissioner, TMC, said, “The 92-year-old woman facing breathing problems but our doctors efficiently handled the critical case and discharged the patient on Wednesday after she recovered. Similarly, a few policemen were also discharged on Wednesday after they tested negative.” The nonagenarian was admitted to the Covid care centre built within Maulana Abdul Kalam Stadium in Kausa, Mumbra in the first week of October. “She was having breathing problems and there were other age-related issues as well. Although she was under medication, her lungs had become weak. This is a common phenomenon among Covid-19 positive patients as the virus affects the lungs. We put her under Bipap, which is a type of ventilator that helps to push air into the lungs. This positive-pressure ventilation was done for almost 28 days, and helped her become healthy and fit again,” said a medical officer from the Covid care centre in Mumbra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/92-year-old-covid-patient-discharged-after-28-days-on-ventilator-at-thane-facility/story-vx83NpdLkhcntg2h7zZcDJ.html
19-11-2020||Mumbai||Palghar lynching case: BJP demands CBI inquiry, Congress says demand made to save party workers||The Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have again engaged in a faceoff over Palgar lynching case after the later demanded a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe in the case and announced a protest march at the spot where the lynching took place. The Congress, in turn, accused the BJP of politicising the issue and creating communal tension by raking up the issue. BJP leader Ram Kadam had announced to take out a protest rally from Mumbai to Palghar on Wednesday to condemn ‘inept handling’ of the case. As part of the protest, he also announced lighting of diyas and staging a hunger strike in Gadchinchale, where the two seers and their driver were killed by the mob in April this year. Demanding that the probe be handed over to CBI, he asked as to why the state government was opposing the move. “The Sadhu fraternity kept quite over the lynching because of the pandemic. But it’s time; they want justice and will take to the streets for the same,” Kadam said before he and his supporters were detained by the Mumbai Police from his Khar residence on Wednesday when they were about to begin Jan Akrosh Yatra. The Congress has hit back at the BJP and said CBI probe was being demanded to save BJP members involved in the lynching case. “Accused number 61 and 65 and most of the other persons arrested are related to the BJP. Gadchinchale village, where the incident took place, is the citadel of the BJP and has been represented by the party’s sarpanch for the last 10 years. The party is demanding the CBI probe just to save the accused,” said Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant.“The police have arrested more than 225 people in Palghar mob lynching case. Of the arrested accused, 154 have been arrested for alleged involvement in the lynching and 75 for violating prohibitory orders. A few police officers, too, have been suspended for negligence in their duty. The case is currently being probed by Maharashtra crime investigation department (CID) and the judicial process has begun,” Sawant said. He added, “Despite this, the BJP has been raking up the issue after seven months for political reasons. Why did BJP leaders keep mum when the sadhus were killed in BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka? Three sadhus were killed in Karnataka, but no BJP leader raised questions over it. The party has been using such incidents for politics by linking them with the religion.”Leader of Opposition in legislative Council Pravin Darekar said the state government has been suppressing the voice of the people seeking justice. “We will continue to fight for justice and for Hindutva what may come. The autocratic rule of the Thackeray government would not be able to stop us from speaking up for Hindutva and in the interest of Maharashtra,” he said. On April 16, three men — two seers and their driver — were dragged out of their vehicle outside Gadchinchale, around 110 kilometres from Palghar, and beaten to death by a mob on suspicion that they were child-lifters. The incident occurred when the victims were going from Mumbai to Surat to attend a funeral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/palghar-lynching-case-bjp-demands-cbi-inquiry-congress-says-demand-made-to-save-party-workers/story-HrLdGno91P4HnbdleSh78I.html

19-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray pushes for rehabilitation of Sardar Sarovar dam project PAPs||Maharashtra has expressed its discontent with the report on compliances of relief and rehabilitation and other issues arising out of the Sardar Sarovar dam project, saying it cannot agree to it unless rehabilitation was completed.Chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, in a meeting with Union jal shakti minister Rajendra Singh Shekhawat and chief ministers of three other stakeholder states, categorically pressed on the rehabilitation issue on Wednesday and said that the rehabilitation of the project affected persons (PAPs) is the priority.The meeting via video conference was held on the order of the Supreme Court (SC) which had asked CMs from all four states — Maharashtra, Gujrat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh — to discuss the five contentious points related to relief, rehabilitation among others. The SC had refused to accept the compliance report submitted by Narmada Control Authority last year. The court had, last October, asked the Centre to submit a fresh report with clarification on the points raised by the organisations representing PAPs. During the meeting, Thackeray said that 230 families who have been waiting for rehabilitation for years should be given shelter first. He also reminded that Gujarat has failed to pay ₹352 crore towards rehabilitation. Thackeray sought firm assurance from Gujarat before agreeing to the compliance report to be submitted in the Apex court, said an official privy to the developments.Thackeray also expressed discontent with Gujarat government for its failure to provide Maharashtra’s share of electricity generated from the project. Shekhawat is expected to speak to Thackeray separately over the reservations expressed by him. Medha Patkar of Narmada Bachao Andolan said hundreds of families affected due to the dam project in Maharashtra are yet to be rehabilitated while infrastructure works such as bridges and roads are yet to be completed. “Rehabilitation and completing the infrastructure works are responsibility of Gujarat government. Hundreds of families from Maharashtra are still waiting for their rehabilitation. Despite of this, the dam was filled at its fullest capacity. Other states, such as Madhya Pradesh, have raised concerns over losses to them because of Gujarat’s failure to provide its share of electricity and charging excessively towards their share in the project cost. We had requested CM Thackeray to raise all these issues during the meeting with Union jal shakti ministry,” she said. She has a meeting with Thackeray on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-pushes-for-rehabilitation-of-sardar-sarovar-dam-project-paps/story-9Wf3eaZVd39JqWe3K5EAUP.html
19-11-2020||City||SAD accuses Bains brothers’ of possessing ‘disproportionate income’||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday demanded an ED and CBI probe against Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief and Atam Nagar legislator Simarjeet Singh Bains, for allegedly amassing disproportionate income and “running a parallel mafia in connivance with the ruling Congress”.Addressing a press conference, former jail and tourism minister Hira Singh Gabria questioned how Simarjeet, who used to work at a brick kiln, and his elder brother Balwinder Singh Bains, who Gabria claimed worked as a driver, managed to amass so much wealth.Extend support to woman who accused Simarjeet of rapeSenior SAD leaders Maheshinder Singh Grewal, Harish Rai Dhanda and Sharanjit Singh Dhillon also addressed the conference and extended support to the woman who had leveled rape allegations against Simarjeet. The SAD leaders said that the LIP leader had raped the woman, who is a widow, when she had approached him for help. Dhanda said the Ludhiana police should follow Supreme Court guidelines and register a case instead of marking an inquiry into it. Grewal and Dhillon further added that it was an open secret Simarjeet is shielded by the Congress and chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh as he is a close friend of food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu.“The Congress has also been trying to woo the Bains brothers to join them,” said Grewal.The SAD leaders also lambasted the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for keeping mum on the issue. They said it was “shocking that a party which was fond of talking about morality and ethics in public life was supporting a rape accused” simply because Simarjeet was in an alliance with the AAP during the last assembly elections.The SAD also said that they would launch an agitation if justice is not delivered to the victim.Claims baseless, says Simarjeet Simarjeet Bains, meanwhile, claimed that the rape allegations were baseless and alleged that the SAD leaders had pulled a “cheap political stunt” on a day when he started the “Punjab Adhikar Yatra” from Harike Pattan to secure the river waters of Punjab.“It is not the first time that flimsy allegations have been levelled against me. I have been accused of running mafias, amassing wealth, but I have always come out clean. It is unfortunate that instead of standing with the farmers of the state, SAD is busy playing cheap politics,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sad-accuses-bains-brothers-of-possessing-disproportionate-income/story-77ltVS9wKh5wlO71qihbGJ.html
19-11-2020||Chandigarh||Mobile-based survey rolled out in Himachal to assess Covid’s impact on mental health||With around 500 people committing suicide during the lockdown, the Himachal Pradesh State Mental Health Authority in collaboration with the Himachal Pradesh University department of psychology is conducting a mobile-based survey in Shimla, Mandi, and Chamba in order to formulate a strategy to deal with mental health issues and suicidal tendencies arising due to the pandemic. Around 75,000 people from the three districts will be sent a questionnaire. Respondents will be asked to answer 10 questions such as whether they had lost their job due to the pandemic and if they had experienced suicidal thoughts or suicidal tendencies during the pandemic. The survey sample will include respondents below the age of 25, people between the age of 26 to 60 and above 60 years, residing in both rural and urban areas. Within the five categories, the sample will include government employees, self-employed people, unemployed people, and students. The survey will be conducted over three weeks. ‘Expect at least 5,000 responses in first week’ HP State Mental Health Authority chief executive officer (CEO) Dr Sanjay Pathak said the study will be used to plan, design and implement strategies to tackle mental health problems.“The questionnaire is anonymous and the responses will be kept confidential. We will first wait for a week to see if we are getting sufficient responses. If we receive less than 5,000 responses, the questionnaire will be sent to another set of people,” he said.Since the Covid outbreak in Himachal and the lockdown imposed to contain its spread, there has been a spike in suicides in the state with around 500 people taking their lives during the lockdown. The weekly suicide rate had increased from 10 in January to 25 in July. Police said most suicides had taken place in Shimla, Hamirpur and Kangra districts. 18-25 age group most vulnerable: Police As per the police people between the ages 18 and 35 are most vulnerable to suicide. The most common reasons for taking the extreme step are financial crisis, unemployment, marital issues, bankruptcy, drug addiction, health issues or illness, failure in examinations, love affairs, or family problems.Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) psychiatry department head Dr Dinesh Dutt Sharma said mental health problems, including suicide, had increased during the pandemic. “Unfortunately, most people do not seek treatment due to lack of awareness, stigma associated with mental disorders and limited availability of treatment.”  ‘70%-80% people who die by suicide have psychosis’Sharma said, “Approximately 70–80% people who commit suicide are likely to have psychosis. Depression is the most common psychiatric condition associated with suicide. Therefore, early detection of depression and suicidal behaviour is important for prevention. Some early signs of suicidal tendencies are being alone, talking about suicide, threatening to kill oneself, searching for ways to commit suicide and saying goodbye to close family members and friends, and distributing valuable possessions.These signs should be taken seriously and such people or their relatives should immediately seek assistance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mobile-based-survey-rolled-out-in-himachal-to-assess-covid-s-impact-on-mental-health/story-10Ebn8RfTGYqtkdRwyF0YI.html

All three men died on the spot.The car driver, who was later identified as Dharminder, a serviceman from Uttar Pradesh, tried to escape after the accident but passersby nabbed him.The police has so far been able to identify only one of the victims—Ritesh Miglani, 45, a yarn trader from Durgapuri of Haibowal. Ritesh was walking towards Sherpur Chowk, with his cousin when the mishap took place. His cousin, Vishal, told the police that they were returning after collecting some payments at the time. “We were crossing the Sherpur Flyover on foot to get a bus to reach Samrala.

19-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees jump in fresh Covid-19 cases to 5,011||Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 5,011 Covid-19 cases, a 5,000-plus spike after nine days, pushing the infection count to 1,757,520. Active cases in the state further reduced to 80,221. The toll reached 46,202 as 100 more casualties were reported. Of them, 51 were from the past 48 hours and 26 were from last week. The remaining 23 deaths were from before last week, health officials said. The case fatality rate (CFR) stood at 2.63%.Wednesday was the 32nd day the daily caseload was below the 10,000-mark. Compared to the last week of September, when daily cases were above 20,000 a day, the number of fresh cases is on a decline. The state reported 76,886 cases this month till date, whereas last month, over 200,000 (212,809) cases were recorded in the corresponding period. The average number of cases per day, too, has declined to 4,271, from 11,782 in the corresponding period last month, according to statistics issued by the state health department.However, the concern of a surge in cases by November or from December still persists.Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state-appointed task force for the clinical management of critical patients, said they were worried over a possible second wave. “Coronavirus rises well in winter. With Delhi, we have the same experience in the country where spurt in cases is being observed after Europe and the United States. Festive seasons have just sort of slowed down when meeting and visiting people was very often. That helps increase the spread and now Christmas and New Year is also coming up,” he said.“Third and most important reason is testing. The overall number of cases has come down and so have testing figures. We need to keep our guard up, by increasing testing and contact tracing. Even in Mumbai, testing has come down to 4,000-5,000 per day, against 15,000-16,000 used to be carried out before. We need to get back on track,” he added.Mumbai saw 871 new cases and 16 deaths, taking the tally to 271,531 and the toll to 10,615.Following Mumbai, Pune registered the second-highest number of cases at 339, and six deaths, followed by Nagpur city, which saw 269 cases and three deaths.Along with a fall in the daily caseload, the number of institutionally quarantined cases and home quarantined people has also come down significantly. As of Wednesday, only 5,354 people in the state are institutionally quarantined and 750,992 people are quarantined at home.A look at the previous figures showed that 36,827 people were institutionally quarantined while those quarantined at home were 1,770,748 on September 17. A month later, on October 17, the number of institutionally quarantined people declined to 23,749 and 2,395,552 people were home quarantined.Infected patients without symptoms or mild symptoms or their close contacts are institutionally quarantined at the Covid-19 facilities set up by the state government in all districts. Similar is the case with people quarantined at home.“The decline in the number of people institutionally quarantined and quarantined at home is because the cases have reduced. Since fewer people are testing Covid-19 positive, consequently, the number of their close contacts has also reduced, thus fewer people are quarantined at home and at institutional quarantine facilities,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer.The state has completed 9,900,878 Covid-19 tests, with 53,400 tests conducted on Wednesday. The positivity rate for the day was recorded at 9.38%, against the overall positivity rate of the state at 17.75%.The number of recovered patients reached 1,630,111 with 6,608 recorded in the past 24 hours. The recovery rate was recorded at 92.75%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-sees-jump-in-fresh-covid-19-cases-to-5-011/story-Thmqf2PcM9JtneiI1bmMwK.html
19-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai: ₹500-crore properties of late gangster Iqbal Mirchi forfeited under SAFEMA||Three buildings in Mumbai, worth ₹500 crore, belonging to gangster Dawood Ibrahim’s aide Iqbal Mirchi have been declared forfeit by the competent authority under Smuggling and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (SAFEMA). Officials of competent authority under SAFEMA in Mumbai told HT that earlier Mirchi and his associates had managed to avoid forfeiture of the properties by misleading the court. “Once it was established that the said properties belonged to Mirchi, we have started forfeiting proceedings,” the officer said.In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said, “The investigation conducted by ED revealed that, in 2005 Iqbal Mirchi, in connivance with Sir Mohamed Yusuf Trust, misrepresented…the ownership of these buildings before the Competent Authority (SAFEMA/NDPS Act).” The three properties are Rabia Mansion, Mariam Lodge and Sea View, all located in Worli. The order for the forfeiture was issued on November 9 under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substance (NDPS) Act. All transactions with respect to these properties have been declared null and void.Mirchi, who died in 2013, and his associates had managed to avoid forfeiture by misleading the competent authority (SAFEMA/NDPS Act), the chief metropolitan magistrate (CMM) and the additional CMM. The properties were falsely claimed by Sir Mohamed Yusuf Trust on the pretext that Mirchi had not been given possession because of incomplete payment. Consequently, the court released the properties from attachment on March 11, 2005.On November 6, 2019, ED officials established Mirchi’s ownership of the properties before the competent authority by presenting evidence collected while investigating a money laundering case linked to Mirchi. The evidence includes complete payment receipts issued by the trust along with corresponding bank entries; a letter issued by the trust handing over possession to Iqbal Memon; and submissions to the income tax department admitting the sale of these properties, said ED sources. According to ED, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) had extended loans to Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd, which purportedly routed money to Mirchi. Mirchi used this money to buy the three properties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-500-crore-properties-of-late-gangster-iqbal-mirchi-forfeited-under-safema/story-Rq4f77lA55kR9xlkLxWIRJ.html
19-11-2020||Noida||After being moderate after six weeks, air quality dips again in Noida, Ghaziabad||Noida: The air quality of Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad fell back into the “poor” category after being in the “moderate” zone for one day.Favourable weather conditions ventilated or washed away the toxins from the area that had accumulated over past few weeks and that spiked on Diwali.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department predicted that temperatures is expected to drop as another spell of snowfall in the northern regions. Weather analysts believe that the fate of city’s air quality for at least next three days will depend directly on the number of farm fires in neighbouring states from where the winds are now entering the national capital region (NCR).“The wind direction has changed from easterly to north-westerly on Tuesday night, which means that additional smoke is set to enter the region. Now even though the wind speed will increase over the course of next few days till November 22, the dispersion of pollutants will be difficult because the temperatures are also set to fall by three to four degrees in the same time. When temperatures are low the air becomes heavier and traps the pollutants well, making it difficult for winds to ventilate them easily. So the course of city’s air quality will depend on the number of farm fires in neighbouring states as well as the local emissions. The wind speed on Wednesday was around 6 kmph and this will increase and could reach upto over 15 kmph till November 22,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre, India Meteorological Centre (IMD).On Wednesday, Noida recorded a minimum temperature of 14.8 degrees Celsius against 15.6 degrees a day earlier. The maximum temperature, as per the the automatic weather station installed in Noida was 24.5 degrees Celsius against 26.2 a day earlier.“By November 19, the minimum temperature for this area could hover around 9 or 10 degrees Celsius because of good winds coming from well snowed mountains of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir,” said Srivastava.According to the central pollution control board (CPCB), the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Wednesday dropped to 207 or ‘poor’ against 178 or ‘moderate’ on Tuesday. The AQI of Greater Noida was 228 against 186 a day earlier. The AQI of Ghaziabad saw the worse drop amongst three cities falling from 166 on Tuesday to 236 on Wednesday.The AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and above 400 is ‘severe’.The last time ‘poor’ category air quality was recorded in Noida was on November 2 with an AQI of 299, while the last ‘moderate’ air quality for Noida was recorded on October 06, when the AQI was 176 The pollution mass also aggregated marginally in the city due to plumage of additional smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana where the winds are currently coming from. The PM2.5 levels in the past 24 hours in Noida dropping to 92.81 microgrammes per cubic meters (µg/m³) against 83.69µg/m³ a day earlier. The PM2.5 for Greater Noida also dropped to 101.79µg/m³ against 84.86µg/m³ on Sunday.According to the System of air quality and weather forecasting and research (SAFAR), the AQI may improve drop towards Thursday.“Surface winds are calm and boundary layer wind direction is North-Westerly (favorable for intrusion). Effective Stubble fire counts with sufficient potential estimated from SAFAR-multi-satellite products are marginally increased and are around 427...The AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate and forecasted to be in moderate to the Poor category for tomorrow. AQI is forecasted to further deteriorate to the higher end of the Poor to the lower end of the Very Poor category on 20th and 21st November,” said a statement from SAFAR on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/after-being-moderate-after-six-weeks-air-quality-dips-again-in-noida-ghaziabad/story-LFsqUxPVrS4uvrkNYdl4rJ.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Districts with high number of containment zones have most number of Covid cases: Govt data||Two of the revenue districts with the highest and the second highest number of containment zones in the national capital also account for the highest and the second highest number of active Covid-19 cases, prompting experts to call for a revisit of Delhi’s containment policies. The figures tabled in a meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday showed that as on November 15, the south-west district, which has the highest number of containment zones in the national capital at 740, also has the highest share of active cases at 6,391. The south-west is followed by the south district with 5,815 active cases and 700 containment zones. The north-west district, which accounted for the highest share of active Covid-19 cases till last month, now stands third with 5,225 active cases, the records show. Overall, Delhi has 43,774 active Covid-19 cases and 4,430 containment zones across its 11 revenue districts, as on November 15, records show. Also Read: 131 Covid-19 deaths, highest spike in a day so far in DelhiAlso, 35.35% of Delhi’s total active cases, as on November 15, were reported from the 4,430 containment zones. The remaining were isolated cases reported from outside the containment zones.In light of these figures, experts argue that Delhi’s containment policy may need to be tweaked to contain the surge in cases.  Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases department in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “Delhi definitely needs to revise its containment policy because the current one is evidently not working at its best in the light of the current surge in Covid-19 cases. The transmission rate is too high now and containment efforts have to be scaled up.These figures were tabled on Sunday in a meeting convened by Union home minister Amit Shah to discuss the surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, said senior government officials. The meeting was attended by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal.In the meeting, Shah directed the Delhi government to scale up its containment efforts. A senior official of the revenue department said a new strategy is being drafted and it will be finalised within the week.Also Read| ‘Saving the economy is equally important’: No lockdown, assures KejriwalOn September 12, around 19% of the city’s total active cases were from containment zones. The share had increased to 33% on October 18, the records show. The data was tabled at two separate meetings chaired by Baijal, which HT had earlier reported.The government had attributed the increase to a change in policy which focuses on micro containment zones, the records said. The change in policy is reflected in the numbers. For instance, in late-June, Delhi had around 300,000 people residing in 421 containment zones. On the other hand, around 160,000 people are currently residing in the 4,430 containment zones, as on November 15.The policy, senior officials said, has allowed the government to spread containment zones across the city and cover more proportion of active Covid-19 cases. Currently, some of the containment zones are limited to a single unit of residence – equivalent to home isolation for cases in which at least three members of a residence are infected, said officials.The government spokesperson refused comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/districts-with-high-number-of-containment-zones-have-most-number-of-cases-shows-govt-data/story-rtAxoWYWFruZtzzftEnidO.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||AAP writes to air quality panel, points role of farm fires in Delhi’s pollution||Senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and legislator Atishi on Wednesday wrote a letter to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas, highlighting how stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana relates to the increase and decrease in pollution in Delhi. Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Atishi said instances of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana have come down to around 100 from 2,000-3,000, which has improved the air quality in Delhi. “We want to appeal to the air quality commission, as well as the Supreme Court, to take a suo-moto cognisance of the matter and file cases of criminal negligence against the chief ministers of Haryana and Punjab, who have put the entire north India in a public health emergency,” Atishi said. Also Read| Delhi: Bad air days retreat, but next spell may not be farShe said due to the “criminal negligence” of chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana, the people of Delhi-NCR have been suffering for the last 1.5 months from pollution due to stubble burning. Atishi said that on October 28, the central government got an ordinance signed by the President, and a commission for air quality management in Delhi NCR and adjoining areas was formed because, “it was noticed that there is a lack of a permanent, dedicated and participative mechanism that can adopt a collaborative and participatory approach involving all relevant central ministries, state governments and other stakeholders to tackle air pollution.” Also Read: Air quality falls to poor as stubble fires rise againAtishi said, “Today, I wrote a letter to the chairperson of the commission, showcasing the data regarding pollution in Delhi, how stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana relates to this, and how when the instances of stubble burning increase, the AQI of Delhi crosses 300 and how when the instances eventually decrease, the AQI of Delhi decreases. Therefore for the mandate of Delhi-NCR, it is extremely clear upon whom the onus of pollution in Delhi falls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aap-mla-atishi-writes-to-air-quality-panel-points-to-role-of-farm-fires-in-delhi-s-pollution/story-PRS8A78xsykIx4hZ5L1ejO.html
19-11-2020||Education||JNU should encourage innovation in research on epidemiology: Kovind||President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday said universities such as Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) should encourage innovation in research on epidemiology keeping the current Covid-19 pandemic in mind.Speaking during the fourth annual convocation of JNU on Wednesday, the president congratulated the institute for its high-ranking accreditation and appreciated “every person associated with JNU for setting high standards”.Due to the pandemic, the university held its convocation in the virtual mode this time, conferring degrees to 603 students from 15 schools and centres. Kovind was the chief guest at the occasion while education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal was the guest of honour. Around 430 students were conferred the degree during last year’s convocation, which saw high drama due to the students’ protests over the hostel fee hike.Stressing on the importance of research in areas such as infectious diseases, epidemiology, virology, diagnostics, instrumentation, vaccinology in the Covid-19 era, President Kovind said, “The related social issues need to be studied, preferably with the multi-disciplinary approach. In this endeavour, universities like JNU should be at the forefront to develop specific hand-holding mechanisms and promote innovation among student communities.”He said the varsity represents “blending of inclusion, diversity and excellence” and should “be at the forefront” to promote innovation among student communities. “Students aspiring for very different career paths come together in JNU. The university represents the blending of inclusion, diversity and excellence,” Kovind said.The President congratulated JNU for receiving the highest-ranking grade from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and ranking second among all the universities under the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF).“The university has produced many eminent personalities and has been guided by some of the greatest minds...I appreciate every person associated with JNU for setting high standards in various academic domains. Ranging from social sciences to science and technology, both teaching and research have made an impact in the world of academics. That is why JNU attracts students from all parts of the country and even from abroad,” said Kovind.“It must be a matter of pride for students of the university that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and minister of external affairs Dr. S. Jaishankar are its former students. From among the over 80,000 former students of JNU, many have made an impact in India and abroad through contribution in the civil services, academia, politics, social work, science and technology, media and communications, fine arts and business leadership,” he said.President Kovind said while dealing with present-day challenges, one can draw inspiration from the ancient universities of Takshashila, Nalanda, Vikramshila and Vallabhi which had set high standards of teaching and research.Vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said, “Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, we decided that this tradition of convocation should continue using digital technology to hand over degrees to research scholars through the online ceremony.”Pokhriyal also asked students to stick to Indian values and update, upgrade and educate themselves.Talking about innovative work at the varsity, Kumar said, “Several products have been developed within the university such as the Learning Management System (LMS) by two students from School of Engineering to conduct and manage classes online. Last month, a start-up company of JNU launched a cloud-based biological data analysis platform, which will be of great use in understanding pandemics like Covid-19.”Education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal said the Atal Innovation Centre and several start-ups being set up by the university will contribute to realising “Make in India, Digital India and Atmanirbhar Bharat.”Several students, however, boycotted the event on Wednesday to protest against the administration’s decision to allow a phase-wise entry to only science students. Former JNU students’ union president Ashutosh Kumar, who completed his PhD from Centre for Russian and Central Asian studies this year, said, “The administration has had anti-student policies for the past few years now. Current students have been protesting for months now demanding a return to campus but they have not done anything on it and are organising virtual convocations instead where the graduands are asked to pay Rs 800 to attend the convocation. This is what prompted us to boycott the event.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jnu-should-encourage-innovation-in-research-on-epidemiology-kovind/story-jLnS1JxGLhFbtKZmsoUfDM.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Private car not a personal zone, mask is a must: Delhi govt submits in HC||The Delhi government on Wednesday said in the Delhi high court that a private vehicle is a public place and not a personal zone and thus every person moving around in his private or official vehicle must “compulsorily” wear a mask. The submissions were made before Justice Navin Chawla during the hearing on a plea by a lawyer who challenged the Rs 500 challan issued to him for not wearing a mask while he was driving alone in his private car. In his plea, the petitioner, Saurabh Sharma, said that on September 9 while driving to work he was stopped by Delhi Police officials and was fined for not wearing a mask even though he was alone in the car.In an affidavit filed through advocate Devesh Singh, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, the court was told that “it is true that the public may not have access for such private vehicle, as a matter of right, but the public have the opportunity to approach the private vehicle when it is on a public road”. It also said that the Supreme Court has held that a private vehicle is a public place.The government submitted that wearing masks while driving was made compulsory in April and the order remains in force till date.Representing the petitioner, advocate Joby P Varghese told the court that subsequent to the April 4 office order of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), the Union health ministry held a press conference where it said persons driving alone in a car are not required to wear a mask.Advocate Farman Ali Magray, appearing for the ministry, sought time from the court to place the correct position before the court. Justice Chawla granted the time but warned that no more time would be given on the next date of hearing.Sharma, in his plea, has sought quashing of the challan, refund of the Rs 500 paid as fine and compensation of Rs 10 lakh for alleged mental harassment suffered by him.In his plea, Sharma claimed that the officials who issued the challan to him failed to provide any executive order to establish that it was mandatory to wear masks while travelling alone in a private vehicle.They also did not heed his request to write on the challan that he was driving alone and he paid the “illegal” fine under protest, the petition said.The court listed two other similar pleas by Aditya Kaushik and Deepak Agarwal on January 7, when the matters would be heard together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/private-car-not-a-personal-zone-mask-is-a-must-delhi-govt-submits-in-hc/story-znDt0IhHFFq3tVFZd60WpI.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||131 Covid-19 deaths, highest spike in a day so far in Delhi||Delhi on Wednesday crossed the psychological mark of 500,000 Covid-19 cases, adding 7,486 new cases to its daily count, according to the Delhi government’s daily bulletin.The city also recorded 131 deaths due to the infection, highest even seen in a day. Before this, the highest single-day death toll of 104 was reported on November 12.This pushed the seven-day average case fatality ratio (CFR) – the proportion of deaths among those who test positive – to 2.12%. This is much higher than the cumulative CFR – calculated on the basis of total number of cases and deaths so far – indicating that the recent deaths are driving up the CFR.The city’s total Covid count now stands at 503,084. A total of 43,147 rapid antigen tests were conducted and 19,085 of the more reliable RT-PCR tests, with a positivity rate of 12.03 %.On Tuesday, NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul had said Delhi had shown “dramatic improvement” in reducing deaths due to delay in admissions. Also Read| ‘Saving the economy is equally important’: No lockdown, assures Kejriwal“Initially, when the pandemic had started – till about June – nearly 60 to 70% of the deaths in hospitals happened within the first 72 hours. Half of these deaths happened within the first 24-hours of admission. In Delhi, there has been a dramatic change since. We are still monitoring the mortality as it shows the efficiency of the system – mobilising patients from home, ambulance service, access to beds, and efficiency of the treatment,” he had said.Eleven Delhi government-run hospitals will add 663 intensive care unit beds to the city’s existing 3,600 beds over the next few days, with 232 beds at Guru Teg Bahadur hospital being operationalised in the next two days, according to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. “In view of … increased demand of ICU beds in hospitals… directors of Covid hospitals… are directed to augment ICU beds by upgrading existing oxygenated beds at their respective hospitals,” read an order by the special secretary (health) SM Ali. The order was issued after the health minister Satyendar Jain met directors and doctors of various Coivd-19 hospitals on Wednesday.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe increase in the number of beds comes after a meeting of Delhi officials with union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday where the Centre had also promised to increase ICU beds in its makeshift hospital in Dhaula Kuan. Health ministry officials during a press briefing on Tuesday had said the ICU bed capacity will be increased to 6,000, with the army-run hospital in Dhaula Kuan adding 537 ICU beds, the central government hospitals 45, and 2,680 beds by the Delhi government, mostly through the order reserving 80% ICU beds in 33 big private hospitals.“Overall, there are Covid beds available but there is a shortage of ICU beds. We are making all efforts to increase these. Today, I met doctors of GTB hospital and the doctors immediately agreed to increase 232 beds; it is very difficult to do this in just 48 hours but our doctors have responded to the need,” said Kejriwal. With the third surge in cases paralleling many cities from the West and Europe, the CM said, “If you look at places like New York, Sweden, Italy and France, when they had as many cases the videos that emerged showed patients in the corridors and street. There were no beds available. In New York, when 6,300 cases were reported in a day, there were 550 deaths at that time. Our doctors have managed the pandemic very well.” Also Read| ‘Centre yet to provide 250 ICU beds facility for people in Delhi’: AAP spokesperson Saurabh BhardwajEven though Delhi had seen a dip in the number of new cases for the last three days owing to fewer tests being conducted during the festivals, the number of hospitalisations due to the infection continued to rise. There were 9,343 Covid-19 patients in various city hospitals as on Tuesday, the daily health bulletin shows. Despite the government continuously increasing the number of beds, 56% of all beds earmarked for Covid-19 were occupied as on Wednesday night, showed the Delhi Corona app. The situation is worse for ICU beds, with almost 89% being occupied.“The situation is as bad as it was a week ago; almost every hour I get a call to arrange a bed. Even though more beds have been added, there is still a shortage, and I do not see any signs of the situation improving any time soon. Probably 10-12 days later, we may see a decrease in numbers but not right now,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory and critical care medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-records-7-486-new-cases-131-deaths/story-fNKNVtcCyuHPZK1EtcKOAJ.html

Even though the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration had announced on Tuesday that commuters from Delhi will be randomly tested at roads and Metro stations connecting Noida and Delhi, Ghaziabad officials launched testing as part of a new strategy to curb the surge in Covid cases post festive season. Of the total 11 -- three tested positive on their way to Noida. Eighty-one tests were conducted at the DND Flyway where one person tested positive, while two out of 84 tests returned positive at the border on the Link Road. In Ghaziabad, 72 people were tested near the UP Gate of whom eight were found positive. All tests were conducted using the less reliable rapid antigen method. Also Read| Districts with high number of containment zones have most number of Covid cases: Govt dataA team of three lab technicians each had been deployed at DND Flyway and Noida link road.Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “If those who test positive are Noida residents, they will be sent to the hospital or home isolation depending on the symptoms. The rapid antigen test results come out in 4-5 minutes, so there is no hassle for commuters.” Ohri said that the health department was told to not pressure commuters into being tested. “If they are not willing, we will not force them and let them go,” he said. He added that the exercise will go on for a few more days and did not commit to an end date.District Magistrate Suhas LY said this is being done in order to assess spread of infection and would help in issuing advisories to employers and organisations, where large number of people work and commute between Noida and adjacent areas. Ganesh Saha, deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Noida, said traffic was not hit during the exercise.Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said though they have not chosen particular border points but teams were being deployed in areas where most commuters come from Delhi. He said testing teams have been deployed in areas such as Indirapuram, Vaishali, Khoda and Loni, which are close to Delhi.

So, our teams are testing them, as well as locals. Further, we have chalked out a comprehensive post festival strategy which will come into effect from November 21, a day after Chhath Puja ends,” Pandey said.A health department official said of the eight who tested positive, four were travelling in a car. “We will adhere to Covid-19 protocols with regard to those residing in the city, while Delhi authorities will be informed about the status of their residents,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/11-test-positive-on-noida-ghaziabad-borders/story-JCuLf54KqD0eV8VsNpyFVL.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||RWA president, his German Shepherd, killed in toilet wall collapse in Vasant Kunj||The 67-year-old president of the Vasant Kunj Enclave B Block residents’ welfare association and his German Shepherd dog were crushed to death after a portion of the wall adjacent to their building collapsed on them on Monday evening, the police said. The elderly man, Pratap Singh Tanwar, had recovered from Covid-19 just last week and was relaxing in the lawn of his bungalow with his family when the mishap took place around 7pm on Monday, said his son Siddharth who escaped with minor injuries. Siddharth accused the builder who constructed the four-storey building, as well as the owner of that floor, of negligence as well as not paying heed to their requests for safety. “In the past, construction material falling from the under-construction building had damaged our cars twice. This time, it claimed my father’s life,” said Siddharth. The police have registered a first information report at Vasant Kunj South police station under Indian Penal Code sections pertaining to causing death by negligence, negligent conduct with respect to repairing buildings and causing hurt by a rash act, said Ingit Pratap Singh, deputy commissioner of police (south-west).The officer said that the house owner, Pankaj Singh Pundhir, has been arrested. “He is an ex-serviceman working with a private firm in Gurugram,” said Singh. The Tanwar father-son duo ran an engineering instrumental company. Years ago, they had constructed a single-storey house and a lawn. “Ten years ago, my father had started the RWA here. He had been its president ever since,” said Siddharth. Other RWA members said Tanwar was an active man who worked hard to get basic facilities to the neighbourhood. “He would constantly complain about illegal constructions in the neighbourhood and about structures being erected beyond the permissible height, but no one cared to stop it,” said Manish Aggarwal, the RWA general secretary. Tanwar’s family alleged that problems began soon after the construction of the neighbouring building commenced about three or four years ago. “The builder didn’t follow the safety norms. We would complain about construction materials falling on our property, but he didn’t listen. They would also use substandard construction material,” alleged Siddharth in his police complaint. Sometime last year, Siddharth alleged, the top floor was purchased by a man who about three months ago began constructing a toilet on the terrace. “The construction material continued falling on us, but he didn’t care about our request,” said Siddharth. Around 7pm on Monday, the family was sitting in their lawn and had ordered food from a restaurant for the first time since the lockdown when a large portion of the wall of the bathroom on the top floor suddenly fell. “The food was 15 minutes away when I heard a loud sound. I managed to jump away from the falling wall, but my father and our German Shepherd were crushed to death. My mother had a lucky escape as she had walked away from the lawn just moments earlier,” said Siddharth. Siddharth and his father were rushed to the Indian Spinal Injuries Centre where the elderly man was declared brought dead. The DCP said that further probe into the death is on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rwa-president-his-german-shepherd-killed-in-toilet-wall-collapse-in-vasant-kunj/story-xkl7BMIT9UcqKdrrJMZcEN.html
19-11-2020||City||Fraud call centre busted in Rajendra Place||New Delhi: A fraud call centre in central Delhi which was being used to dupe British citizens was busted last week with the arrest of two people, police said on Wednesday.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said the operators at the call centre, which was being run from two offices in the Gagandeep building in Rajendra Place, posed as UK tax department officers to cheat people. Bhatia said two men identified as Parvinder Singh,36, and his relative Pankaj Kapoor,40 have been arrested. At least 13 men and six women were working at the call centre. The DCP said Prasad Nagar police station was informed about the call centre on November 7. A police team raided two offices on the sixth floor of the building and caught the employees while they were calls to the UK. “They were making and receiving calls over the internet through their laptops. One person, whom we later identified as Parvinder Singh was supervising the operations there. He was also making the calls. We found out that they were posing as UK tax department officials and cheating people,” said Bhatia adding that police are probing how many persons have been duped so far. After the raid on November 7, police had registered a case of cheating the following day and started probe. DCP Bhatia said police found Singh was running the call centre with his accomplice Pankaj Kapoor, who was arrested later. “Our probe revealed that the two got the contacts of the UK residents from different websites, social media companies and other fraud call centres. They had set up the call centre about one and a half years ago. They recruited employees through advertisements in newspaper and other means. They ran the call centre discreetly between 1.30 pm and 9.30 pm under the cover of a travel agency,” the DCP said.Singh’s employees would randomly call the UK ciitzens and tell them that they were calling from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and warned them of dire consequences if they would not pay their tax dues immediately, Bhatia said. They would receive money through online transactions in various accounts. Police said they suspect Kapoor of running Hawala transactions. Police recovered Rs 19.64 lakh in cash and 32 laptops apart from other equipments that was being used to run the call centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fraud-call-centre-busted-in-rajendra-place/story-N8J4NY6owLcNdvTZdJ1SUK.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 pandemic fears kill the rush on trains, buses, many prefer to drive home for Chhath||This Chhath would be the first time in two decades when Delhi-based businessman Shashi Kaushik did not go home to Bihar. For his family of four, that includes two children, trains and buses were unsafe with the pandemic is tightening its grip on the capital, and flights were too costly. Driving down to Bihar was the only feasible option he had, but he couldn’t muster the courage for the long journey. “My brother drove home with his family, but I regret not being home for Chhath,” said Kaushik, 45.“The festive fervour seen at railway stations during the previous Chhaths was on the highway this time. There were so many cars heading to Bihar and Jharkhand,” said Ritesh Shekhar, who drove to his home in Gaya. The trains and buses plying to these areas did see a reduced rush this Chhath season, said stakeholders.Deepak Kumar, spokesperson for Northern Railway, said the number of passengers seeking train tickets for Bihar and eastern states this time were fewer and he attributed this to the pandemic and people’s concerns about social distancing.Another railways officer, who didn’t want to be identified, pegged the decrease at almost 40% when compared to last year, but HT could not independently verify this.Buses to Bihar too saw a decrease in passengers. GS Yadav, who runs the Jai Mata Di Travels and operates buses from Delhi to Bihar, said the number of passengers have dipped by 20% compared to the Chhath last year. But sufficient arrangements were in place to cater to the festive rush, insisted the railways spokesperson. “To cater to the rush, we planned over 1,000 train trips from Delhi to the Northern states since October 15 to November 30. For Chhath alone, we ran around 700 train trips during the festive period from November 8 to 20,” said Kumar, adding that a number of special trains were introduced to cater to the increase in demand. Also Read| ‘Saving the economy is equally important’: No lockdown, assures Kejriwal“Those with wait-listed tickets are not being allowed on trains as we have to ensure one seat is just for one passenger,” said Kumar.But passengers had more problems even then. Chanda, who managed to find a berth on a train to Katihar, said that she had to make compromises to ensure her safety. “I didn’t use the toilet during the 21-hour journey,” said the woman. Bus operators said that though there was a dip in the overall number of passengers this season, they had to turn away many. “To ensure social distancing, we allowed only one passenger every two seats. So, many of those waiting at bus stops without a confirmed ticket were turned away,” said Anand Sharma, who operates buses from Delhi to Bihar. “There may have been separate seats for each passengers, but toilets are shared by many during a long journey. It wasn’t a risk I was willing to take,” said Satyendra Sinha, an advocate who drove 1,200km to Banka in Bihar.Dipak Jha, a Delhi-based journalist, said he found travelling by car to his home in Jamshedpur the safest for his family of four. “We only got out of the car during the 24-hour journey to use toilets. We even carried our own meals. This ensured that we hardly ever exposed ourselves during the journey,” said Jha. And as Jha drove on, he realised that he wasn’t alone on the journey. “One five-seater car had eight occupants stuffed inside. That is how desperate people were to get home for Chhath,” said Jha.HC upholds celebration banMeanwhile, the Delhi high court on Wednesday refused to entertain a plea which had challenged the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) decision of banning Chhath Puja celebrations at public places in the city due to the Covid-19 pandemic.While dismissing the plea, a bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad, remarked that “it appears the petitioner is not alive to Covid-19 situation in Delhi” and “any such permission if granted would necessarily result in such function turning into a super spreader”.Also Read| Districts with high number of containment zones have most number of Covid cases: Govt dataMayor writes to L-G for Chhath celebrationsBharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash on Wednesday wrote letters to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and request them to reconsider their decision to ban Chhath Puja at public places in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that he had request them to allow the puja with certain riders and guidelines.“I have written letters to the CM and the L-G and requested them not to ban celebrations of Chhat Puja at public places in the city.

The medical students, interns, or dentists who are hired will be paid Rs 1,000 for an 8-hour shift and Rs 2,000 for a 12-hour shift. The interns will receive this “honorarium” over and above their stipend. It is difficult to work longer hours with the personal protective equipment, the order read.

The newly constructed hospitals in Burari and Ambedkar Nagar had already been directed to do so for any laboratory tests. The government has also instructed hospitals to get the expensive IL-6 test from the four government hospitals that perform it Guru Teg Bahadur, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital, Lok Nayak hospital, and Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital. The test is done to check inflammatory markers to predict a cytokine storm, a condition in which the body’s immune response goes into an overdrive and starts attacking its own tissues and organs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-orders-hiring-of-medical-students-to-ramp-up-staff-for-covid-patients/story-n9cbpzMQleudWsiKqFiYxM.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||Covid: Experts suggest early discharge of stable patients to ease burden on hospitals||New Delhi: With hospitalisations from coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on the rise in Delhi, experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) have suggested early discharge of stable patients who can then continue home isolation.Doctors from AIIMS, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences-Rohtak, and Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow participated in a discussion on protocols to be followed for home isolation during the National Grand Rounds, a virtual platform for doctors across the country to discuss challenges in Covid-care. “In one of the cases presented, the patient was discharged early after he stabilised. In places like Delhi, where the number of cases are high, this is a policy we are more aggressively looking at. This will decrease the burden in hospitals and the home isolation will continue as an extension of the hospital service,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, AIIMS. He, however, warned that such patients have to carefully monitor their signs and symptoms as there is a possibility that they are brought back to the hospitals with a cytokine storm. Cytokine storm is a condition where the body’s immune system goes into an overdrive and starts attacking its own tissues and organs. Also Read: Govt orders hiring of medical students to ramp up staff for Covid patientsThe case referenced by Dr Guleria was that of a 53-year-old man with controlled diabetes, who had to be admitted to the hospital because his oxygen saturation had dropped to 93%. The normal oxygen saturation is between 95 and 100%. The patient was given low-flow oxygen and steroids and he stabilised in 72 hours. As he did not have any other symptom, he was advised home isolation. Currently, nearly 60% of the total active cases or those with the infection in Delhi are in home isolation, 20% admitted to hospitals, with the rest – who did not have proper isolation facilities – being in Covid care centres. The suggestion by experts was proposed a day after the union health ministry announced that home isolation in Delhi will be augmented to support up to 35,000 to 40,000 people. “The support system needed for patients in home isolation – telemedicine support, pulse oximeter, etc – will be ramped up, as the number of active cases might go up in the future,” NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul had said during a press briefing on Tuesday. He had also said that Delhi had dramatically improved when it came to early admissions of patients who needed hospital-based care. “Initially, when the pandemic had started – till about June – nearly 60 to 70% of the deaths in hospitals happened within the first 72 hours. Half of these deaths happened within the first 24-hours of admission. In Delhi, there has been a dramatic change since,” Dr Paul had said. The necessity of close monitoring and timely shift to the hospital was demonstrated in another case presented during the grand rounds. A 43-year-old man with no comorbidities who was in home isolation noticed that his oxygen saturation had dropped to 86% on the sixth day of symptoms. He had what is called happy hypoxia where patients do not have apparent breathlessness despite low oxygen saturation. In hospital, the doctors found that he had a pulmonary embolism, a clot that blocks the blood vessels in the lungs. The condition can be fatal if not treated in a timely manner. Also Read: Delhi logs 131 Covid deaths, highest single-day fatality count till date; 7,486 new casesPatients in home isolation must rush to a hospital if they have any breathing difficulty, drop in oxygen saturation, persistent pain or pressure in chest, confusion, slurred speech, any weakness or numbness, or bluish discolourations, the doctors said. The doctors also added that antiviral medicine Remdesivir should not be given to patients in home isolation. Doctors advised that drugs such as anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine, anti-parasitic ivermectin, and anti-viral Favipiravir that are thought to prevent viral replication to be given cautiously. “Remdesivir should not be given to patients in home isolation because it may lead to several complications such as kidney or liver injury. Unfortunately, it has become a common practice among medical professionals in smaller cities. Many are prescribing all three – hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and favipiravir – together and sometimes along with steroids. This will cause more harm than good,” said Dr Dhruv Chaudhary, head of pulmonary and critical care medicine at PGIMS Rohtak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/experts-suggest-early-discharge-of-stable-patients-to-ease-burden-on-hospitals/story-fzRRYiBSpOQUffHc91XX1H.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||50% Covid-19 patients in Delhi hospitals from UP and Haryana: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday said around 50% of Covid-19 patients in Delhi hospitals are from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, which shows the state of health care infrastructure in the two states. The party criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments in the two states for the health infrastructure there, and claimed the central government was yet to provide 250 ICU beds in a facility assured on Sunday.“More than half of the Covid-19 patients in Delhi hospitals are from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. We are happy to provide them with quality health care but this shows the utter failure of the BJP government in these two states in the field of quality health care. Delhi, on the other hand, has a proper strategy in place,” AAP’s national spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said in a press conference at the party’s head office.Also Read| Delhi: Wedding curbs back as coronavirus cases hit 500,000He said, “Despite promising, the Central government is yet to provide 250 ICU beds for the people of Delhi. BJP ministers found time to put up posters promoting their advocacy, but they could not comply with our request to increase ICU beds.”After his meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said the central government assured 750 ICU beds for Delhi, of which 250 would be added in the next two days. The ICU beds are supposed to be added in the central government’s DRDO facility.Neeraj Daftuar, principal officer on special duty to the Haryana chief minister, said AAP’s assertion was “preposterous”. He said, “Covid-19 patients from Delhi are regularly getting admitted in Gurugram hospitals like Medanta. What does that indicate? It seems the Delhi government needs to look at their own health infrastructure rather than do nitpicking on us.” Also Read| Covid-19: CM Kejriwal calls all-party meeting as Delhi logs highest deaths in single dayThe CM’s aide said 58% of the total active infections in Haryana were confined to four national capital region districts bordering Delhi. They are Gurugram, Faridabad, Rohtak and Sonepat. Out of the four, Gurugram and Faridabad alone accounted for 48% of active infections. “It’s so unfortunate that instead of taking proactive measures and self-introspection, the Delhi government is getting into the blame game,” he said.The Centre and Uttar Pradesh governments did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/50-covid-19-patients-in-delhi-hospitals-from-up-and-haryana-aap/story-7PcFt6e33fYUWk3xjXbOXK.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||‘Saving the economy is equally important’: No lockdown, assures Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday allayed fears that the government may enforce another lockdown as coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases surge in the capital, saying saving the economy is equally important as fighting Covid-19 even as he called an all-party meeting to discuss the pandemic situation in the city. Kejriwal had said on Tuesday that he has sought permission from the central government to allow the Delhi government to temporarily shut down markets, which are assessed as potential Covid-19 hot spots from time to time due to rampant violation of social distancing norms and other Covid-19 regulations. The CM said that his decision should not be seen as a move to enforce “lockdown”. A day earlier, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had said that a lockdown was out of the question.Under the current guidelines, states need the approval of the Union home ministry for imposing any local lockdown-like restrictions.The file concerning the Delhi government’s proposal was sent to the office of Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal and later forwarded by him to the Union home ministry. A response from the Centre is awaited, said a senior government official.“It should not be called a lockdown. For the next few days, we will observe the situation on the ground, especially violation of Covid-19 regulations and assess if any particular market can turn into a hot spot. It is not that we are shutting down markets. Saving economy is equally important for us as fighting against Covid-19. We will try all means. We will not close any market unless it is extremely necessary. As of now, we have only sought permission,” Kejriwal said.Also Read: Delhi logs 131 Covid deaths, highest single-day fatality count till date; 7,486 new casesDeputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also weighed in. He said, “We believe the solution to Covid-19 is in better management of healthcare resources and not in a lockdown. We have done our best in terms of healthcare management so far and we would continue our efforts. If needed, regulations would be increased in some markets. We have sought permission for that from the Centre. It should not be seen as a lockdown.”While the Delhi government is yet to chalk out the modalities in this regard, Kejriwal’s announcement has led to concern among traders.Brijesh Goyal, president of the chamber of trade and industry, said: “Due to the news of the lockdown in Delhi and the closure of the Delhi markets, there has been restlessness among the traders of Delhi. We convened a video conference today with more than 200 trader bodies and they opined that there should be no lockdown in Delhi nor should any market be closed.”Praveen Khandelwal, national secretary-general of the confederation of all India traders, said: “The Delhi CM did not consider it appropriate to talk to the traders of Delhi before sending yesterday a proposal to the central government, seeking permission to close the Delhi markets. It is a unilateral decision of Delhi CM which has caused a lot of resentment among the traders. The fast-spreading Covid-19 epidemic in Delhi is a matter of concern and the trading community is more eager to play an active role. But certainly at this stage instead of temporary solutions, an effective and comprehensive strategy is required.”On Wednesday, the Delhi government issued a notice for an all-party meeting in the light of the Covid-19 situation in the Capital, said a senior government official.Delhi on Wednesday recorded 7,486 new Covid-19 cases and 131 more deaths, said the government’s health bulletin.Also Read: ‘Measures being taken to address shortage in number of ICU beds’: Kejriwal“The chief minister has desired to convene an all-party meeting of major political parties,” said a notice issued by the additional secretary to the CM. Government spokespersons, however, did not elaborate on the agenda.The meeting is scheduled at 11 am in the premises of the Delhi Secretariat.Leader of Opposition in Delhi Legislative Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “No further decision should be taken till the all-party meeting is convened on Thursday.”Bidhuri, a BJP MLA, further said that he has written to the L-G, urging him to postpone the implementation of the cap of 50 guests in wedding-related gatherings, and also requested him to delay the proposal regarding markets.Chaudhary Anil Kumar, president of Delhi Congress, said, “The Congress will participate in the all-party meeting and submit suggestions that would contribute to the fight against Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/saving-the-economy-is-equally-important-no-lockdown-assures-kejriwal/story-37tCbtMhJ2wTwJyhVVjHzN.html
19-11-2020||City||Child sexual abuse case: JE targeted kids from deprived families, say CBI officials||LUCKNOW/KANPUR UP irrigation department junior engineer Ram Bhawan, who was arrested by the CBI from Banda on Monday for allegedly sexually abusing about 50 children, used to target children mainly from unprivileged families, said senior police and CBI officials.The JE clicked photographs and made video clips while sexually abusing children, all aged between five and 16 years, and later sold the content on the dark net to other paedophiles across the globe, said CBI officials.The CBI team had prepared a list of children who had been victimised by the JE in the past. The accused targeted children of street vendors, daily wagers, pavement dwellers and domestic helps who worked at his house, said a senior CBI official. Sleuths were verifying the details of nearly 50 victims who were seen in photographs and videos recovered from Ram Bhawan. Of these, 11 children had been found, he said.He said the children on the victims’ list were mainly from three districts of Uttar Pradesh -- Chitrakoot, Banda and Hamirpur. The engineer, a native of Banda, was posted in adjoining Chitrakoot district and many of his relatives were from Hamirpur. The CBI team was trying to trace the victims to further record their statements and prepare a strong case against Ram Bhawan, said the official.“During interrogation, the accused revealed that he targeted children who could easily be lured with money, electronic gadgets, eatables or any other thing they were deprived of. Ram Bhawan believed that he could easily handle the families, if the children shared these details with their kin,” the official stated while explaining modus operandi of the accused.The official said the JE remained successful in his approach as no major complaint was made with the police in the past 10 years and he continued to sexually abuse children after luring them into his trap. He said the engineer was about to be exposed at least twice in the past when the sexually abused children complained to their parents, but he managed things by paying some money to them.The accused was a humble and shy person for his colleagues and others he met outside. He was staying in a two-room rented house in SDM colony of Chitrakoot for the past seven years. Prior to this, he lived in another rented house in Chitrakoot for around three years, added the official.The official said Ram Bhawan would have continued to sexually abuse children had he not come on the radar of the CBI’s special unit ‘Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Prevention/Investigation (OCSAE)’ constituted for matters pertaining to online child sexual abuse and exploitation.The accused came on the CBI radar after the location of uploading child pornography content was traced. The scrutiny of emails of the accused revealed that he was allegedly in constant touch with several individuals (Indian and foreign nationals) for the purpose of sharing child sexual abuse material, said the official. The JE allegedly created and shared a huge quantity of child sexual abusive material, over the years, using various social media platforms and websites over dark net etc, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/child-sexual-abuse-case-je-targeted-kids-from-deprived-families-say-cbi-officials/story-vHtKtNjtZUTrXx2pGGBi3H.html
19-11-2020||City||HC junks plea challenging ban on Chhath Puja in public places||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Wednesday refused to entertain a plea which had challenged the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) decision of banning Chhath Puja celebrations at public places in the city due to the Covid-19 pandemic.While dismissing the plea, a bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad, remarked that “it appears the petitioner is not alive to Covid-19 situation in Delhi” and “any such permission if granted would necessarily result in such function turning into a super spreader”.“The right to health must be respected first. The person has to live to be able to practice any religion,” the bench said while hearing a plea by Durga Jan Seva Trust, challenging the DDMA’s November 20 order.The petition had also sought permission to hold a gathering of 1,000 people for Chhath Puja.However, this did not go down well with the court which remarked, “Oh really! Today when the Delhi government is not allowing marriages with over 50 persons, you want only 1,000 persons.” It said that the authorities have passed the order after considering the spread of infection in Delhi and the petition was without merit.“In today’s day and time, such a petition is belied by the ground reality,” the court said while noting that the petitioner should have taken into consideration the current circumstances in the city.“The infection rate is hovering between 7,800 to 8,593… the death rate is in double figures. There are 42,000 active cases,” it noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-junks-plea-challenging-ban-on-chhath-puja-in-public-places/story-J6iXBGAlUbTSrF3pA7P78I.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||North Delhi mayor writes to L-G, CM; asks them to reconsider ban on Chhath Puja||New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash on Wednesday wrote to lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, requesting them to reconsider their decision to ban Chhath Puja at public places in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Prakash said he had requested them to allow the puja with certain riders and guidelines.“I have written letters to the CM and the L-G and requested them not to ban celebrations of Chhath Puja at public places. The puja should not be completely banned and instead, special arrangements should be made,” he said.Prakash said a huge number of people from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh live in Delhi and Chhath is one of their most important and popular festivals. He said the ban on the Puja in public places will force people to celebrate the festival locally, which can lead to a spread of the virus. “It is better that we allow Chhath Puja with strict guidelines about crowd control and social distancing at ghats.”In the letter, Prakash suggested that a limit of 50 people at a ghat can be set and devotees can be allowed on the basis of cards issued by their Chhath committees. He said to control crowds, the number of ghats can be increased by creating temporary pools in municipal parks, which are available in almost every colony. “Only devotees who observe fast should be allowed at these ghats. These precautions can really help in managing crowds. We are ready to extend our full support to the government if it allows Chhath Puja,” Prakash said.There are nearly 1,200 Chhath Ghats across the city where devotees would celebrate the festival annually.The Delhi government has banned community celebrations of Chhath at public places such as river banks, temples, and ghats to control the spread of the virus. The move came after a sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases.The BJP on Tuesday had staged a protest to oppose the ban.Ruling Aam Aadmi Party leader Durgesh Pathak said the BJP-ruled central government had issued guidelines to stop the celebration of Chhath Puja. He accused the BJP of “falsely accusing” the Delhi government of disallowing the celebration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-delhi-mayor-writes-to-l-g-cm-asks-them-to-reconsider-ban-on-chhath-puja/story-LxVxY42QhR84EcpaY0e0yM.html

The MSEPP – formerly the department of economics – is an autonomous body of the University of Mumbai (MU). AS Dave, an alumnus of the department and former chairperson of the Unit Trust of India donated ₹5 crore to set up and develop a centre for research and training in finance. MSEPP director and professor Mala Lalwani said that the centre will be set up at the Kalina campus of the university at the earliest. “The cheque has already been deposited. We have the corpus. All we need is to sort out the formalities of the university to get the centre started,” said Lalwani. The centre will collaborate with the industry and carry out research in the financial sector. Apart from research, the centre will also offer certificate and diploma courses in the emerging fields of data science, quantitative finance and business analytics, among others.In 2017, the autonomous department of economics was relaunched as MSEPP, along the lines of the Delhi School of Economics, to promote research and policy interventions. Since then, the school has partnered with several initiatives of the state government to implement and measure the effectiveness of government schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mu-s-mumbai-school-of-economics-and-public-policy-gets-5-crore-donation-for-research-centre/story-9kYwygXETnSHziq4rxhMvO.html

He has been transferred to Karkadooma and Ravindra Kumar Pandey will replace him.ACMM Pahuja had not reserved the order in the case, though lawyers of both parties had finished their final arguments.On November 13, the high court listed 16 promotions to the post of Delhi Higher Judicial Services. Prominent among them were promotions of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Purshottam Pathak who was hearing cases pertaining to the North East Delhi riots and Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur who was hearing cases pertaining to the foreign nationals who had participated in the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in March. The transfers, though routine, are likely to delay the cases where in some cases the pleadings would have to be heard again due to the reshuffle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/transfer-promotion-of-judges-in-district-courts-may-affect-pace-of-cases/story-zvaNec7UIy60JVNEOiKmIP.html

The orientation programmes were held online, and students were introduced to departments, different societies and clubs; the new semester timetable and other nitty-gritty of college life virtually. Some colleges, including St Stephen’s and Hindu, started online classes for the first-year students on Wednesday. Radhika, an 18-year-old from Charkhi Dadri in Haryana, who started her Political Science (Honours) at Daulat Ram College, said she missed the chance of going to college on the first day. She and the other students attended an online orientation organised by the college. “We were told about the college alumni and societies through recorded videos. The virtual orientation was nice because parents also get to see everything. We also enjoyed the music and dance performances by our seniors during the online introduction. While I do miss coming to college, teachers have assured us that they will help us with whatever we need.”Also Read| Give date by when OBE results will be declared: Delhi HC to DUFalit Sijariya, 17, a resident of Meerut in Uttar Pradesh, who enrolled in BA Programme at St Stephen’s College, said he and his new classmates are in touch over WhatsApp groups. “We created the group because we did not know when we would get the opportunity to meet in person. It’s a very different experience but we will have to accept the reality. We have also created an Instagram handle for first-year students so that they can introduce themselves and share their interests. We have also organised a talent show next week for students to get to know each other better,” he said. The experience was very different for colleges well. At Miranda House, the college administration has begun a week-long orientation programme for their first-year students on Wednesday. The college had given a virtual tour to students on Wednesday and the principal also addressed them remotely. From Thursday onwards, there will be live performances of all the societies and clubs available in the college for the first-year students. College acting principal Bijayalaxmi Nanda said the personal feel was missing on the first day. “It’s a challenge but also an opportunity to connect with so many people. The college auditorium can accommodate 500 students at a time but through the online mode, we had about 700 students connected on the online platform and many more had watched the live streaming on Youtube. But I missed the face-to-face connection. So, starting tomorrow, I will have online office hours for them. Students can log in and interact with me personally and we can discuss their future,” she said. At Ramjas College, all departments held their individual orientation programmes online on Wednesday. College principal Manoj Khanna said, “It’s a very different experience. The campus completely missed the colours and energy of the first day of college.”Hindu College, which had managed to complete their orientations earlier, began full-fledged classes on Wednesday. College principal Anju Shrivastava said, “We had our orientation day on November 11 and also held a long session for new students with the college counsellor. They were informed about when they should seek counselling as it is important for students to identify when they or their friends need help. On Wednesday, we started full-fledged classes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/du-first-year-students-logs-in-to-college-life/story-ThhepqvgAJaFWlkBdBXOkJ.html

19-11-2020||Education||Give date by when OBE results will be declared: Delhi HC to DU||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed Delhi University to give details of courses whose results for the online Open Book Examination (OBE) have been declared and sought to know by when the rest of the results will be declared. The court said that taking into account the grievances of students, it will have to monitor things again like it had done during the conduct of the examinations in August.Justice Pratibha Singh asked the University to file an affidavit within five days on the declaration of the results of various subjects after DU did not file its affidavit on the data retention policy. On October 12, the court had sought to know from the varsity about its stand on legal issues that arise with respect to data of students, privacy, etc., after some data was leaked from a student’s admit card.The court had asked DU to place on record, its contract with the cloud service provider, with whom the data related to the entire examination process, including answer papers. etc., has been stored.A section of final-year undergraduate students of various colleges had raised concerns over a possible breach of privacy on the varsity’s online portal for issuing admit cards for the online exams conducted in August.  Students had alleged that anyone can access a student’s admit card that carries personal details such as their mobile phone number, address, date of birth and email id.Expressing concern over the leak, the court had said, “In order to adjudicate legal issues that arise in respect of the data of the students, privacy etc., DU is directed to place on record, its contract with the cloud service provider, with whom the data, in relation to the entire examination process, including answer papers etc., has been stored…”“DU shall also place on record, its policy, if any, in respect of retention of answer scripts both in physical and electronic forms, before the next date of hearing,” the court had said on October 12 after several students had raised grievances of their data being leaked on social media.The high court was hearing students’ plea that results of their final-year exams, which were conducted in August, have not been declared yet and due to which they are unable to join higher studies.In an affidavit filed through advocate Prateek Sharma, some students said it is pertinent to mention that after making payment, the students got their confidential result along with “No Backlog Certificate”, but despite the certificate, students have been marked as absent in the final results declared by the university. On Wednesday, the court was displeased with the non-filing of an affidavit on DU’s data retention policy.“There is non-compliance by Delhi University. It is really shocking. It is happening every time,” it said, adding, “now we will have to monitor things again”.The court asked the varsity to file an affidavit before November 25 and posted the matter for further hearing on November 26. It asked professor D S Rawat, Dean of Examinations, to be present in the next video hearing.A division bench of the high court had earlier directed the university to declare results of all post-graduate courses by October 31 and to upload the marksheets on its website.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/give-date-by-when-obe-results-will-be-declared-hc-to-du/story-1KIZLDSBdgx2NkDwlrsREP.html
19-11-2020||Delhi||To make Yamuna pollution-free by 2023, DJB working out a concrete plan: CM||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said his government is working on a concrete plan to reduce 90% pollution in the Yamuna river by 2023. The CM had chaired a meeting of the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) where a detailed action plan to clean up the Yamuna, including the use of innovative technology and reuse of treated water, was discussed.The water utility presented a plan to reuse 436 MGD (million gallons per day) of treated wastewater, against the current utilisation of 90 MGD only. The DJB treats 520 MGD of wastewater on a daily basis at its 35 sewage treatment plants (STPs), out of which only 90 MGD is used. This wastewater will be reused to fill water bodies and lakes, for irrigation, gardening, forests, groundwater recharge, etc.The DJB plans four major interventions to clean up the river, said a statement issued by the CM’s office. In the first major intervention, the Delhi government will use natural wetlands and aeration methods to treat around 150 MGD (million gallons per day) of polluted water coming from the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, it said.Secondly, wastewater in small or big drains will be tapped into STPs. Third, steps will be taken to improve the quality of the existing STPs, including upgrading all the equipment. Also Read: L-G orders removal of debris from Yamuna floodplain, installation of CCTVs for surveillanceFourth, sludge and septage from the septic tanks (mostly used in unauthorised colonies where sewer lines have not been laid) across Delhi will be collected and reused in bio-gas plants to generate electricity and gas.The river remains heavily polluted inmost parts of the year mainly because of a huge volume of untreated sewage and industrial effluents being discharged directly into it.Five major outlets carry wastewater into the Yamuna, including Najafgarh drain, Shahdara drain, Barapulla drain, Delhi Gate drain, Mori Gate drain. The Najafgarh and Shadhdara drains, apart from receiving wastewater from within the city, get polluted water from Haryana and UP.“All the interventions will have different timelines, to be completed by March 2021, 2022, and 2023,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/to-make-yamuna-pollution-free-by-2023-djb-working-out-a-concrete-plan-kejriwal/story-LTOr7uRC0gbepeUsY94YXM.html

Police said a case was registered after victim’s father Vijaykant Chaudhary submitted a written complaint at a police station in Muzaffarpur, Bihar. However, since the incident took place under the jurisdiction of Amboli police station, the case was transferred to Mumbai for further investigation. Chaudhary in his complaint has alleged that a struggling actor who was a friend of Akshat wanted to marry him. But when he refused to marry her, she with the help of her sister killed him, said Amboli police officers. Someshwar Kamthe, a senior inspector said, “A case under section 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered by Bihar police. The case was then was transferred to Amboli police station. We are investigating the case.” According to Amboli police, Akshat was under depression and died by suicide. His family, however, dismissed this claiming that the aspiring actor was murdered. The police officers said Utkarsh lived with his friend in a flat at the Andheri RTO lane where the incident happened. According to the friend’s statement, they had their usual conversation before having dinner and he then went to sleep. “At around 11.30pm when she woke up to use the washroom, she found Utkarsh dead in his room, after which she immediately called the police,” said an officer from Amboli police station. A team of police officers rushed him to a private hospital where he was declared dead before arrival. After which the body was shifted to Cooper Hospital for the autopsy report, added the officer. “We have registered an accidental death record (ADR) and were inquiring the matter. Preliminary inquiry and autopsy report do not indicate any foul play. The doctor informed us that cause of death was asphyxia due to hanging,” Kamthe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/actress-her-sister-booked-for-killing-television-actor-in-mumbai/story-jRfNaO0N37N52CQgrGyy0I.html
19-11-2020||Chandigarh||Covid: Vitamin D deficient people on supplements less likely to test positive, finds PGIMER study||A study conducted on asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic Covid positive individuals by researchers at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has found that vitamin D deficient individuals on a high dose of oral supplementation tested negative for Covid-19 in a greater proportion than those who were not taking the supplement.The study was conducted by doctors from endocrinology department including, Ashu Rastogi, Anil Bhansali and Naresh Sachdeva, doctors from internal medicine department including, Niranjan Khare, Vikas Suri, and Pankaj Malhotra and doctors from anaesthesia department including, GD Puri and Narayana YaddanapudiDuring the study, individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection without comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive airway disease, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease) admitted to the institute with vitamin D deficiency, were randomised to receive a daily dose of cholecalciferol in the ‘intervention arm’, while individuals of the control group (placebo) were given distilled water.As many as 89 SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive individuals were evaluated out of which 40 were subsequently randomised (16 in the intervention arm and 24 to the control arm). In the study, it was found that 10 out of 16 (62.5%) participants in the intervention group achieved SARS-CoV-2 negativity compared to five out of 24 (20.8%) participants in the control arm.Also, the level of fibrinogen (a blood plasma protein and one of the factors for normal blood clotting, levels of which spike in patients due to Covid) in individuals who had achieved normal vitamin levels compared to vitamin-D deficient individuals had a significant difference, suggesting a possible immunomodulatory effect of vitamin D.However, the changes in the fibrinogen level, though statistically significant, were modest and may not be clinically meaningful, the researchers stated.The researchers noted that the recommendations by the Centre for Disease Control and other regulatory bodies including the Indian Council of Medical Research do not mandate repeat SARS CoV-2 RNA testing to document SARS CoV-2 negative before the discharge of asymptomatic individuals, hence achieving SARS CoV-2 negativity in greater proportions is likely to be beneficial.However, certain limitations of the study included that only mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals were enrolled in the study which limits the generalisability of the results, and the placebo used in the study was not exactly matched with regard to the taste and consistency with the cholecalciferol nanoformulation. Also, the dose of cholecalciferol used in the study is high compared to conventional treatment, which warrants close follow-ups to look for vitamin D toxicity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/vitamin-d-deficient-individuals-put-on-supplement-test-negative-for-covid-in-greater-proportion-finds-pgimer-study/story-pYScyGfryygYbxKS4idIoL.html

The high court was hearing a plea from one candidate, Aanchal Setia, who had demanded that the first degree relatives of NRIs be eligible for the NRI category seats offered by the institute. The petitioner had brought before the court the contradiction in the eligibility criteria laid down in prospectus by the college stating that for the admissions to MBBS / BDS courses for students under the NRI category, Harvansh Singh Judge Dental College, Panjab University, has expanded the scope of the definition of NRI candidates to include first degree NRI relatives like uncles and aunts of the candidate in the NRI category, but GMCH excludes first-degree blood relatives and limits the criterion for candidates who resided in a foreign country for a certain period or have their parents or grandparents residing in other nations. Both the institutes are affiliated to the Panjab University therefore, there can’t be two different sets of rules for admissions for the same course, the court was told. The girl has studied in Chandigarh and, her paternal uncle resides in the United States of America. The Chandigarh administration has to respond to the plea by Thursday. The college has 150 MBBS seats, of which 115 are under the UT quota. Of the remaining, 23 are under the all-India quota, three under the central pool, and nine under the NRI quota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-asks-gmch-32-to-keep-proceedings-of-nri-seat-counselling-sealed/story-bXTvqT7Rblwoxb0cCrEqAK.html

19-11-2020||Pune||‘Superspreader’ test drive to cover PMPML and PMC staff, school teachers||Pune: As part of the possible Covid second wave prevention measures, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has begun following the state government guidelines of identifying and testing “superspreaders”. The civic body will also cover its staff and school teachers under the drive. The civic body will soon issue a circular and carry out testing of “superspreaders”. As per the guidelines, the testing drive will mainly cover unregistered population, including vendors and hawkers, who come in contact with multiple people. PMC health chief Dr Ashish Bharti said, “We have collected data of some “superspreaders” during our earlier state survey of ‘My Family My Responsibility’. We will use that count and also ensure that all such people who come in contact with a large number of people are tested. The biggest challenge is to identify and test ‘superspreaders’ since most of them are vendors and hawkers who do not have licence or are unregistered.” Additional commissioner Rubal Agrawal said, “We will include school teachers since schools are about to restart. So, for private schools, it would be compulsory to get staff tested before the classes resume. In addition, we will also test our own staff, including Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) and other employees who fall under the category of ‘superspreaders’, since they also come in contact with many people.” Currently, PMC operates 18 testing centres across the city. The civic administration will use both RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Detection tests to identify “superspreaders” based on the symptoms as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. The testing exercise would put an additional burden on the civic body that is facing cash crunch. Agrawal said, “We are yet to take any policy decision regarding the cost for testing. If we get requests from banks or private organisations, they are welcome to get their staff tested at our testing centres.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/superspreader-test-drive-to-cover-pmpml-and-pmc-staff-school-teachers/story-PPKkhk8wzLiTxUe1G6HtkI.html

I am happy that the state authorities have allowed reopening of religious places under the latest unlock measures.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dagdusheth-temple-reopens-in-phases/story-FuajnzfmiL1QaIvPXGXkEO.html
19-11-2020||Pune||Pune garbage unit: NGT panel to submit action report by Nov 24||PUNE: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) principal bench on Tuesday issued an order to form a committee comprising Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and Pune district collector to recommend action on Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) garbage processing unit in Ambegaon. The order was passed by a bench comprising chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel, judicial member SK Singh and expert members SS Garbyal and Nagin Nanda. This bench had earlier issued an order to relocate the Baner-Sus road garbage processing unit, according to the information released on the environmental watchdog’s website on Wednesday. “Before considering the matter, we direct constitution of a joint committee of CPCB, state PCB and collector, Pune. The state PCB will be the nodal agency for compliance and coordination. The said committee may look into the grievance and take such further action as may be found necessary, following due process of law,” reads the order. The action taken report has to be submitted by the committee before November 24. The order was passed during the hearing of an application demanding relocation of the unit filed by Dhananjay Balwant Kokate and Jaysing Dahrath Jadhav, residents of area in close proximity of the unit. The unit had caught fire on November 2. While the police registered a case against unidentified people, an official of a private company that manages the unit, on condition of anonymity, said that it was residents living on unit’s neighbourhood who did it. “There are no buffer zones around the unit, requisite permissions are missing, and there is no approach road to the unit. It is flouting multiple rules. The applicant is a local villager who owns neighbouring land,” said advocate Saurabh Kulkarni who is representing the applicants. “Once we receive the order, we will take action. All the due verifications will be looked for as per the law. We will be required to send an action taken report,” said Pratap Jagtap, sub-regional officer (SRO), MPCB. A case under Sections 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage to amount of one hundred or (in case of agricultural produce) ten rupees), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 143, 147, and 149 of Indian Penal Code was registered at Bharati Vidyapeeth police station against unidentified people one day after the fire incident. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ambegaon-garbage-unit-ngt-panel-to-submit-action-report-by-nov-24/story-9sBStJhi8TfHYCeQUA8S0M.html
19-11-2020||Pune||PMC keeps beds ready for possible Covid ‘second wave’||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) administration has assured that it is prepared to tackle the worst-case scenario of a possible Covid-19 second wave in December-January. The civic body has put in place required beds for the virus treatment. The preparation for beds is based on the calculation of the highest active cases reported in the city and keeping the count 1.10 times of that figure. With home isolation for asymptomatic patients now a part of the virus prevention measure, PMC has more beds available for the anticipated aggressive return of the coronavirus. Dr Satish Pawar, director, Maharashtra directorate of health services said, “We have asked local authorities to prepare for the worst. So, for example, if a city saw its highest active cases to be 100, then they have to prepare for 100 multiplied by 1.10 which is 110 Covid patients. This count has been bifurcated based on patients’ requirements for ICU with and without ventilators, oxygen isolation beds and other requirements.” The civic body has issued a list of required beds which it has prepared according to the highest active cases of 17,781 recorded by PMC on September 20 in Pune city. According to the count, the anticipated highest active case would be around 19,560, and the civic body has assured that it has more than the required beds at Covid care centres, oxygen beds and ICU beds. According to Pawar, as home isolation for asymptomatic cases was not recommended during the beginning of the pandemic, more beds is now available for fresh cases. “This is just a preparation for the worst. Residents must continue to wear masks and maintain respiratory hygiene norms as it is the only vaccine available for now.” Pawar said. Additional commissioner Rubal Agrawal said, “The number of possible cases could go higher or lower, but this is the ideal preparation that we have now. We can increase the bed count if the need arises. This includes both private and public hospital facilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-keeps-beds-ready-for-possible-covid-second-wave/story-T3JAwAjSZBAKTETYVhll5I.html
19-11-2020||World||Trial ordered for accused gun supplier in Kenosha killings||The man charged with buying the rifle that police say an Illinois teen used to kill two people during a Wisconsin protest over police brutality will stand trial, a court commissioner decided Thursday.Dominick Black, 19, was is charged in Kenosha County Circuit Court with two counts of intentionally providing a dangerous weapon to a minor, resulting in death.Commissioner Loren Keating determined there was sufficient evidence for the case to proceed. A Kenosha detective testified that Black told him during an interview about how he purchased the assault-style rifle at a Ladysmith hardware store after getting some money from Kyle Rittenhouse, who at 17 was too young to legally buy a gun, the Journal Sentinel reported.Black’s attorney, Robert Keller, argued for the charges to be dismissed or at least reduced to a single count, a motion Keating denied.The weapon was stored at Black’s stepfather’s house in Kenosha until Black and Rittenhouse each took rifles downtown on Aug. 25, according to police records. Late that night, police said Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz.Rittenhouse is charged with first-degree intentional homicide, attempted homicide, reckless homicide, recklessly endangering safety and illegal possession of a firearm. His attorneys say Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense.His preliminary hearing is set for Dec. 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trial-ordered-for-accused-gun-supplier-in-kenosha-killings/story-MhO4vEV0NFVBkATgNgYSEJ.html
19-11-2020||World||Ethiopia accuses WHO chief of backing Tigray rebels by leveraging his ‘international profile’||Ethiopia’s military accused the World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Thursday of supporting and trying to procure arms and diplomatic backing for Tigray state’s dominant political party, which is fighting federal forces.“He himself is a member of that group and he is a criminal,” army chief of staff General Birhanu Jula said in a televised statement, before calling for him to be removed. Birhanu did not offer any evidence to support his accusations. There was no immediate WHO comment on the allegation against Tedros, who is Ethiopian of Tigrayan ethnicity.The accusations came at a time when the WHO is under considerable strain trying to coordinate global efforts against the Covid-19 pandemic after the United States, its biggest donor, froze funding over a spat involving China. Cases and deaths are rising again in many countries around the world.Tedros served as Ethiopia’s health minister and foreign minister from 2005-2016 in a ruling coalition led by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).The TPLF effectively ruled Ethiopia for decades as the most powerful part of the coalition, until Prime Minister Ahmed Abiy took office in 2018.Abiy has since folded the other three regional parties into his own national party, but the TPLF refused to join.Birhanu accused Tedros of using his international platform to try to get diplomatic support and weapons for the TPLF. “He has been doing everything to support them, he has campaigned to get the neighbouring countries to condemn the war. He has worked to facilitate weapons for them (the TPLF),” he said in a televised news conference. “He tried to lobby people by using his international profile and mission to get support for the TPLF junta.”Birhanu did not give further specifics.Unverified accusations from Ethiopia are not enough to remove Tedros, 55, from his post. He was elected in May 2017 as the WHO’s first African director-general on a platform of promoting universal healthcare. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump announced the United States would withdraw from the WHO in July 2021 - in line with US law requiring a year’s notice - after accusing Tedros of not doing enough to hold China to account for what Trump described as initial attempts to cover up the Covid-19 outbreak.Tedros has dismissed the suggestions, saying: “We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind.”The United States was the biggest overall donor to the Geneva-based WHO, contributing more than $400 million in 2019, roughly 15% of its budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ethiopia-accuses-who-chief-of-backing-tigray-rebels-by-leveraging-his-international-profile/story-TOayZ4gS7XjStU2XHfLFRJ.html

The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has released findings from an inquiry commissioned by in 2016 after rumours and allegations of war crimes on members of the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2016.General Angus Campbell told a press conference on Thursday that the ADF is rightly held to account for allegations of “grave misconduct” by some members of the elite forces. He said that the Inspector-General’s report detailed credible information regarding “deeply disturbing allegations” of unlawful killings. “This shameful record includes alleged instances in which new patrol members were coerced to shoot a prisoner in order to achieve that soldier’s first kill in an appalling practice known as ‘blooding’,” said General Campbell.Also Read | Elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghans, report findsWhat lies ahead for the soldiers accused of unlawful killings?Army chief Lieutenant General Rick Burr said in a statement that he has directed removal of the title ‘2 Squadron, Special Air Service Regiment’ from the Australian Army’s Order of Battle.

This may be through disciplinary or administrative action,” said Burr.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier indicated that a special investigator would be appointed to mull over prosecutions from the findings of the report.

If so, vaccines could be created even faster.Other speakers include Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Anne Wojcicki, co-founder and CEO of genetic testing firm 23andMe Inc.; Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization; Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund; and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies.The forum opened with remarks from Justin B. Smith, CEO of Bloomberg Media and executive chair of Bloomberg New Economy. “This will not be the last pandemic to menace society,” he said.Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said even a modest investment in vaccines against the most-threatening viruses could help companies like his create inoculations much faster during the next emerging epidemic.Moderna brought its Covid-19 vaccine to the verge of regulatory authorization in about 300 days. But if health authorities had invested in early testing of vaccines against 10 or 20 of the most-threatening emerging viruses, Moderna could shave several months off those timelines in the next epidemic, he said.During the panel, he said Moderna’s vaccine trial was on track for getting final results from its big trial in a week or so.“What makes me more excited is the fact that 11 people with severe disease, they were all on placebo,” Bancel said. That suggests that not only will the vaccine prevent almost all cases but that the remaining few infections will be mild.People still need to employ public-health measures like wearing masks, Bancel said. The vaccine “is not a silver bullet,” Bancel said.Also Read | HTLS 2020: ‘Oxford Covid-19 vaccine will be priced at Rs 500-600,’ says Adar PoonawallaThree of the world’s top virus hunters said that nations need to invest in systems that would detect emerging viruses before they infect people and spread around the world.“We haven’t had the kind of early-warning system and investment in this kind of early-warning system that we’ve needed from the very beginning,” said Anne Rimoin, a professor or epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. “We really need to be able to invest in protecting ourselves from viruses.”Rimoin spoke on a panel with Peter Daszak of EcoHealth Alliance and Linfa Wang, director of the program in emerging infectious diseases at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.Viral outbreaks are “happening more frequently, they’re spreading quicker, they’re killing more people and they’re crushing our economies most substantially,” said Daszak. He estimated that there are 1.7 million unknown viruses in the world. It would cost over a $1 billion to identify 70% of them, but it would be money well spent, Daszak said potential emerging viruses should be viewed as a national security threats and tracked with the same intensity the government watches out for terrorist threats abroad, Daszak said.After 9/11, the US government “tracked every single phone call coming into the US, a pretty revolutionary piece of surveillance,” Daszak said. “Why aren’t we doing that with pandemics?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-ceo-says-covid-19-vaccines-can-be-made-even-faster/story-40YTYv5aMlxzb43KK6w36J.html
19-11-2020||World||Adviser to Iran’s leader says US attack risks ‘full-fledged war’||An adviser to Iran’s supreme leader who is a possible 2021 presidential candidate is warning that any American attack on the Islamic Republic could set off a “full-fledged war” in the Mideast in the waning days of the Trump administration.Speaking to The Associated Press(AP), Hossein Dehghan struck a hard-line tone familiar to those in Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, a force he long served in before becoming a defence minister under President Hassan Rouhani.A soldier has yet to serve as Iran’s top civilian leader since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, in part over the initial suspicion that its conventional military forces remained loyal to the toppled shah. But hard-liners in recent years openly have suggested Iran move toward a military dictatorship given its economic problems and threats from abroad, particularly after President Donald Trump pulled America out of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.“We don’t welcome a crisis. We don’t welcome war. We are not after starting a war,” Dehghan said Wednesday. “But we are not after negotiations for the sake of negotiations either.”Dehghan, 63, described himself as a “nationalist” with “no conventional political tendency” during an interview in his wood-paneled office in downtown Tehran. He’s one of many likely to register to run in the June 18 election as Rouhani is term-limited from running again. Others likely include a young technocrat with ties to Iranian intelligence and former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Dehghan’s military service came under presidencies representative of the groups that largely compose Iran’s tightly controlled political arena — reformists who seek to slowly change Iran’s theocracy from within, hard-liners who want to strengthen the theocracy and the relative moderates between. Those calling for radical change are barred from running for office by Iran’s powerful constitutional watchdog known as the Guardian Council, which serves under Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.While discussing the world Iran finds itself in, Dehghan’s points mirrored many of Khamenei’s. The former head of the Guard’s air force who achieved the rank of brigadier general said any negotiations with the West could not include Iran’s ballistic missiles, which he described as a “deterrent” to Tehran’s adversaries.Propaganda involving Iran’s missile program has surged in recent weeks.The front page of the English-language Tehran Times on Wednesday showed a map of Iran’s missile ranges with red stars marking American bases across the region under the words “Back off!” printed in big, bold letters. A headline above warned Iran would respond to “any melancholy adventure by Trump.”“The Islamic Republic of Iran will not negotiate its defensive power with anybody under any circumstances,” Dehghan said. “Missiles are a symbol of the massive potential that is in our experts, young people and industrial centers.”Dehghan warned against any American military escalation in Trump’s final weeks in office.“A limited, tactical conflict can turn into a full-fledged war,” he said. “Definitely, the United States, the region and the world cannot stand such a comprehensive crisis.”President-elect Joe Biden has said he’s willing to return to the nuclear deal, which saw sanctions on Iran lifted in exchange for Tehran limiting its uranium enrichment, if Iran first complies with its limits. Since Trump’s withdrawal, Iran has gone beyond all the deal’s restrictions while still allowing United Nations nuclear inspectors to work in the country. Dehghan said those UN checks should continue so long as an inspector is not a “spy.”In the time since, an advanced centrifuge assembly plant at Iran’s Natanz nuclear site exploded and caught fire in July. Dehghan said that reconstruction at Natanz was ongoing after satellite photos showed new construction at the site. He described the incident as “industrial sabotage.”“Those who were in charge of installing some devices possibly made some changes there that led to the explosion,” Dehghan said, without elaborating.A Dehghan presidency likely would be looked upon with suspicion in Washington and Paris. As a young commander in the Guard, Dehghan oversaw its operations in Lebanon and Syria between 1982 and 1984, according to an official biography given to Iran’s parliament in 2013. Israel, Iran’s arch-enemy in the Mideast, had just invaded Lebanon amid that country’s civil war.In 1983, a suicide bomber in a truck loaded with military-grade explosives attacked a US Marine barracks in Beirut, killing 241 American troops and 58 French soldiers. While Iran long has denied being involved, a US District Court judge found Tehran responsible in 2003. That ruling said Iran’s ambassador to Syria at the time called “a member of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and instructed him to instigate the Marine barracks bombing.”Dehghan vehemently denied he was involved in the bombing, though he was the Guard’s top commander there at the time.“The US tries to link anything happening in the world to someone in Iran,” he said. “Do they really have evidence? Why do they link it to me?”While stressing he wanted to avoid conflict, Dehghan warned Israel’s expanding presence in the Mideast could turn into a “strategic mistake.” Israel just reached normalization deals with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.“It is opening an extensive front,” he said. “Just imagine every Israeli in any military base can be a target for groups who are opposed to Israel.”Dehghan also said Iran continues to seek the expulsion of all American forces from the region as revenge for the US drone strike in Baghdad that killed Guard General Qassem Soleimani, the head of its expeditionary Quds Force in January. That strike saw Iran launch a retaliatory ballistic missile strike on US troops in Iraq that injured dozens and nearly sparked a war.Iran’s retaliatory strikes were a mere “initial slap,” Dehghan said. And there would be no easy return to negotiations with the US in part due to that, he added.“We do not seek a situation in which (the other party) buys time to weaken our nation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/adviser-to-iran-s-leader-says-us-attack-risks-full-fledged-war/story-T2Q9otKeK4G6oOgvbhAZSP.html
19-11-2020||World||Cyber and space domains focus of £16.5 billion UK defence push||The UK government on Thursday announced the establishment of a National Cyber Force manned with intelligence and military personnel as part of a £16.5 billion push in the defence sector as the country prepares for life out of the EU from January 1, 2021.Setting out the new impetus, Johnson told the House of Commons that £1.5 billion will be invested in military research and development, designed to master the new technologies of warfare. The new funding raises the UK’s defence spending to at least 2.2% of its GDP.Officials said the multi-year settlement of £16.5 billion takes the total extra spending to £24.1 billion over the next four years.Johnson said, “(We) will establish a new centre dedicated to Artificial Intelligence and a new RAF (Royal Air Force) Space Command, launching British satellites and our first rocket from Scotland in 2022.“I can announce that we have established a National Cyber Force, combining our intelligence agencies and service personnel, which is already operating in cyberspace against terrorism, organised crime and hostile state activity.”“And the RAF will receive a new fighter system, harnessing Artificial Intelligence and drone technology to defeat any adversary in air-to-air combat,” he added.Johnson also announced the building of more ships for the Royal Navy, including the ongoing construction of two aircraft carriers, each estimated to cost £3 billion. They are expected to be operational in 2023 as part of the force’s Carrier Strike Group.“Next year, HMS Queen Elizabeth will lead a British and allied task group on our most ambitious deployment for two decades, encompassing the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean and East Asia. We shall forward deploy more of our naval assets in the world’s most important regions, protecting the shipping lanes that supply our nation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cyber-and-space-domains-focus-of-16-5-billion-uk-defence-push/story-6zRkebPnhD05t8H9j8MJfO.html

As a result, it is crucial that Covid-19 vaccines are tested in this group who are also a priority group for immunisation.”Co-author Maheshi Ramasamy said, “The robust antibody and T cell responses seen in older people in our study are encouraging. The populations at greatest risk of serious Covid-19 disease include people with existing health conditions and older adults.”Melissa Andrew of Dalhousie University, Canada, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a linked comment, “It is encouraging that more studies in older adult populations are underway and will hopefully bring opportunities to implement nuanced analyses of how underlying health status and frailty affect vaccine safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and efficacy in older adults in real-world settings. Older adults and those who care about them are eagerly awaiting this progress towards safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-safe-in-older-adults-induces-immune-response-lancet/story-GPWZkUQpjTaz5Fd3ucuAVO.html
19-11-2020||World||EU warns Hungary against use of Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine||Hungary’s plans to import and possibly use Russia’s touted Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine raise safety concerns and could damage trust in potential shots, the European Commission said, opening a new front in the EU’s fraught relations with Budapest.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s hard line against migration and what critics say is his increasingly authoritarian grip on power - an accusation he has repeatedly denied - as well as his pursuit of close relations with Russia have caused repeated clashes with the European Union.A new showdown is expected on Thursday when EU leaders hold a video conference that may address the bloc’s massive Covid rescue plan and seven-year budget, which Hungary and Poland’s nationalist governments are blocking because they make access to money conditional on respecting the rule of law.Hungarian plans to conduct trials of and possibly produce the Russian vaccine, an unprecedented step for an EU member state, add to existing frictions with Brussels.Asked about these plans, a spokesman for the Commission, the EU’s executive, said: “The question arises whether a member state would want to administer to its citizens a vaccine that has not been reviewed by EMA.”Under EU rules, Sputnik V must be authorised by the European Medicines Agency before it can be marketed in any state of the 27-nation bloc, EMA said.“This is where the authorisation process and vaccine confidence meet. If our citizens start questioning the safety of a vaccine, should it not have gone through rigorous scientific assessment to prove its safety and efficacy, it will be much harder to vaccinate a sufficient proportion of the population,” the Commission spokesman added in an emailed statement.A recent study of 8,000 people in the United States and Britain found that fewer people would “definitely” take a Covid-19 vaccine than the 55% of the population which scientists estimate is needed to provide so-called herd immunity.Also Read | Covid-19 vaccine update: India may produce Sputnik V; Sinovac’s candidate triggers ‘quick’ immune responseExperts have said that misinformation and perceived weak safety checks on candidate vaccines play a central role in reducing confidence in their efficacy. Orban’s government has said it plans to trial and licence Sputnik V, and this week would begin importing a small number of doses that could lead to larger imports and mass-production in Hungary next year if the shot proved safe and effective.Russia’s sovereign wealth fund said last week that interim trial results showed Sputnik V is 92% effective at protecting people from the Covid-19 respiratory disease, and the country is preparing for mass inoculations.Vaccines being developed by US firms Moderna and Pfizer - the latter in cooperation with Germany’s BioNTech - have showed slightly better results on a much larger sample of people exposed to the virus.The Hungarian government did not respond to questions on whether it wanted to licence the Sputnik V vaccine at home or through the required EU process.“Vaccines should be out of politics and countries should have a choice how to protect their citizens,” said Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund which has underwritten the development of Sputnik V.He added that Russia was ready to share data with the European Medicines Agency and said it aimed to produce the vaccine in Hungary and in other willing EU nations. A subsidiary of the wealth fund also requested scientific advice from EMA in late October but has received no reply so far, the fund said.EMA said that it had received no data from Russia or Hungary on Sputnik V or any other Covid-19 vaccine.Sputnik V is expected to be trialled and produced in other countries across the world beyond Russia, with Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates among those who have expressed an interest in the shot.IMPORT DOUBTSBut the EU questions even the import of Sputnik V by one of its member states.Temporary import and distribution of unauthorised vaccines is allowed for emergency use in the EU “in response to the suspected or confirmed spread of pathogenic agents, toxins, chemical agents or nuclear radiation, any of which could cause harm,” the relevant EU law reads.This rare exemption has been widely debated in recent months by EU experts, the European Commission said.“The widely supported view is that it should be considered very carefully,” the commission spokesman said. Such emergency procedures, he said, would also conflict with the EU’s current vaccine strategy.Under that strategy, the EU has signed contracts with five vaccine makers, including Pfizer, for the supply of nearly 2 billion doses of their potential Covid vaccines and is talking with at least two other manufacturers for additional shots.That would cover the 450 million combined population of all EU states, including Hungary, which under those deals also ordered millions of doses of the Pfizer, Astra Zeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines now in development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-warns-hungary-against-use-of-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-sKWno4HlxunpX3aOwbCmVN.html

Cases are also up in Lebanon and Pakistan. Jordan, Tunisia and Lebanon have reported the biggest single-day death spikes from the region.From Pakistan, Faisal Sultan, special assistant to the prime minister for national health services, told reporters the winter surge had arrived. Although Pakistan managed to control the outbreak with targeted restrictions earlier this year, the forecast turned more alarming as the country unlocked, he said.“The second wave is just as risky if not more than the first,” Sultan said, adding that winter in Pakistan brings an increase in social interaction, with schools, events and wedding parties in full swing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-of-deadly-second-wave-of-virus-across-middle-east/story-2oJTIiSGcPSMHqapq7ZJZP.html

Khan was received by Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar and Afghan President’s Special Representative for Pakistan Mohammad Umer Daudzai and senior officials upon his arrival at Kabul airport on his maiden trip to Afghanistan, officials said. He was received by President Ghani received on his arrival at ARG Presidential Palace, situated in the heart of Kabul city. Khan was accompanied by Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, adviser on commerce Abdul Razak Dawood, ISI chief Lt. Gen. Faiz Hamid, foreign secretary Sohail Mehmood and special representative for Afghanistan Muhammad Sadiq. According to officials, the two leaders discussed ways to further strengthen the bilateral relations, the peace process and regional economic development and connectivity. They agreed to strengthen the bilateral relations as the people of Pakistan and Afghanistan are linked through bonds of history, faith, culture, values, and traditions. Khan expressed confidence that his visit would help foster a stronger and multifaceted relationship between the two countries. This is Khan’s first visit to Afghanistan since assuming office in 2018. It is the highest-profile visit by a Pakistani official to Kabul since peace talks began between the Taliban and the Afghan government in Doha in September. It comes days after the Pentagon announced it would reduce the number of US military personnel in Afghanistan from 4,500 to 2,500 by mid-January. The announcement came as there has been an uptick in violence, with the Taliban continuing to carry out attacks targeting government leaders, security forces, and civilians. President Ghani last visited Pakistan in June 2019.The Pakistani Prime Minister’s visit is being billed as a symbol of increasing confidence between the two countries, triggered by Pakistan’s role in bringing the Taliban to the negotiation table, after years of acrimony between Islamabad and Kabul. Earlier, the two leaders had a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the 14th Organisation of Islamic Cooperation(OIC) Summit in Makkah in May 2019. Khan also had a telephonic conversation with President Ghani in September 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-sets-out-to-bolster-ties-with-afghanista-through-imran-khan-s-maiden-visit/story-nssC7yuLgqVGD5NcbnrTpI.html

They used computer models to generate a Covid-free 2020 for comparison purposes and concluded that pandemic restrictions, which led to a reduction in the use of fossil fuels by industry and transportation, subsequently reduced global nitrogen dioxide concentrations by nearly 20 per cent.The researchers received data from 46 countries relaying hourly atmospheric composition measurements in near-real-time. As many as 50 of the 61 analysed cities show nitrogen dioxide reductions between 20-50 per cent. According to the report, NASA model projections accounted for the normal variations in weather and atmospheric circulation since no two years are exactly alike. “We all knew the lockdowns were going to have an impact on air quality,” Christoph Keller, the lead author of the study, said in a statement.“It was also soon clear that it was going to be difficult to quantify how much of that change is related to the lockdown measures, versus general seasonality or variability in pollution,” he added.Also Read | All you need to know about NASA’s plan to involve private players in space explorationThe report suggests that Wuhan, the first epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, was also the first to show reduced nitrogen dioxide emissions. The study showed 60 per cent lower emissions than simulated values expected. As the restrictions were imposed in Milan and New York, the cities recorded a 60 per cent and a 45 per cent decrease respectively.Emma Knowland, a co-author, stated that at times, a decrease in air pollutants was recorded even before the official policies went into place. Knowland opined that people were probably reducing their transit because the talk of the Covid-19 threat was already happening before they were actually told to shut down. The findings of the study were presented at the 2020 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-restrictions-reduced-global-pollution-levels-by-nearly-20-shows-nasa-study/story-j6Kl55d6mJIO9jtxaIE5eL.html

Saeed is already in jail as in February this year, he was sentenced to 11 years in jail in two other terror-financing cases. At present, he is lodged at Lahore’s high-security Kot Lakhpat jail.“The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) of Lahore on Thursday sentenced four leaders of Jamat-ud-Dawa, including its chief Hafiz Saeed, in two more cases,” a court official told PTI. Saeed and his two close aides - Zafar Iqbal and Yahya Mujahid - have been sentenced to 10 and a half years each, while JuD chief’s brother-in-law Abdul Rehman Makki was sentenced to six months imprisonment.“Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta of ATC Court No. 1 heard the case No. 16/19 and 25/19 filed by Counter Terrorism Department in which the verdict has been announced after the statements of witnesses were cross-examined by Naseeruddin Nayyar and Mohammad Imran Fazal Gul Advocate,” the official said.A total of 41 cases have been registered by the CTD against the JuD leaders, out of which 24 have been decided while the rest are pending in the ATC courts.

Governor Yuriko Koike said residents should focus on things such as wearing masks and using disinfectant, and should gather only in small groups for short periods of time.The government lacks the legal means for a harsh lockdown, but has shown it can keep the virus under control without one. In addition, officials want to avoid heavy restrictions as they try to get the country’s recessionary economy back on track.“Even without the virus spread, we were expecting the economy to struggle after a rebound, so this is shaping up to be a double blow,” said Yuichi Kodama, an economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. He added that more than 20 trillion yen ($192 billion) may be needed for a third extra budget, depending on how the situation develops.The city on Thursday reported 534 cases, a new high after the previous day’s tally of 493 overtook a record set in August. The nationwide total also set a daily record -- 2,259, according to TBS -- as prefectures including Osaka, Aichi and Hokkaido posted their highest number of infections.The increase comes as the virus is surging globally with the onset of colder weather in the northern parts of the world. While Japan’s numbers are low compared with other countries, the increase is a reminder that, in the absence of an effective vaccine, even the most successful countries at containing the virus are vulnerable to resurgences.Japanese officials have stressed that hospital capacity isn’t under any strain. Koike said Thursday that avoiding serious cases is the biggest priority.Also Read |  Japan has worst day of Covid-19 cases yet amid fears of winter waveTokyo had lowered the alert from its highest level in September, prompting the city to end voluntary restrictions on operating hours for bars and restaurants.With cases climbing again, a debate has emerged over generous government subsidies for travel and eating out as part of a Go To campaign to support businesses, which some have blamed for fueling the latest wave.

All you need to know||An open letter to Facebook leadership from its content moderators has provided fascinating details regarding the discontent brewing among the workers, who were allegedly forced to return to office spaces amid the coronavirus pandemic. Over 200 Facebook content moderators from across the world have questioned the decision of the social media giant to force them back to the office, despite the risks of contracting coronavirus.Why Facebook ‘forced’ moderators back to the office? Facebook relies on thousands of contractors, who are officially employed with companies like Accenture and CPL, to spot and remove the content found violating the company’s policies. The employees have said that Facebook tried using Artificial Intelligence to moderate the content but failed, and then chose to “risk” their lives by calling them back to the office. They have alleged that Facebook undertook a massive live experiment in heavily automated content moderation without informing the public.“The AI wasn’t up to the job. Important speech got swept into the maw of the Facebook filter - and risky content, like self-harm, stayed up,” they wrote, adding that the platform’s algorithms are years away from achieving the necessary level of sophistication to moderate content automatically. They stated that the algorithms cannot spot satire and cannot respond quickly enough to self-harm or child abuse.“Facebook needs us. It is time that you acknowledged this and valued our work. To sacrifice our health and safety for profit is immoral,” the employees asserted.Also Read | CEOs of Twitter, Facebook defend content moderation practicesWhat are their demands?The content moderators have listed five demands, saying they deserve the rights and benefits of full Facebook staff. 1. To keep moderators and their families safe, the employees have demanded that everyone who is at high risk or who live with someone who is at high risk for Covid-19 should be permitted to work from home indefinitely. 2. The employees said that work that can be done from home should continue to be done from home, demanding to maximize at-home working. They have also claimed that there is a “pervasive and needlessly secretive” culture at Facebook. 3. They want Facebook to offer hazard pay if the company wants moderators to “risk their lives to maintain ‘community’ and profit”. The employees said that people working in the office on high-risk material, such as child abuse, should be paid hazard pay of 1.5x their usual wage. 4. The content moderators stated that Facebook to end outsourcing and bring the content moderation workforce in house, giving them the same rights and benefits as full Facebook staff. 5. The employees want the social media giant to offer “real healthcare and psychiatric care”. They said that content moderators bear the brunt of the mental health trauma associated with Facebook’s toxic content and they deserve “at least as much mental and physical health support as full Facebook staff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-facebook-risking-lives-of-moderators-after-failed-ai-experiment-all-you-need-to-know/story-lJxNxfKhPOIXMykWUDgsbJ.html

But many are now wary of seeming to toe the FAA line after the US agency was faulted for lax oversight. “It’s too soon,” agreed Anton Sahadi, who had two young relatives on board the doomed flight. “It wasn’t just the Lion Air flight, but also the victims in Ethiopia... The victims’ families haven’t 100% recovered yet.”Families of the Ethiopian crash victims said in a statement they felt “sheer disappointment and renewed grief” after the FAA’s decision to return the aircraft to service.“Our family was broken,” Naoise Ryan, whose 39-year-old husband died aboard Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, said.In Indonesia, some of the aggrieved relatives said clearance had been granted faster than compensation. “Why has the flight permit been granted while the affairs of the victims’ family have not been fully resolved?” asked Latief Nurbana, a civil servant who lost his 24-year-old son.He said compensation payments and arrangements with the Boeing Community Investment Fund (BCIF) were still unsettled.The BCIF’s website said that the distribution of funds to provide philanthropic support to communities affected by the crashes would be completed by Jan. 15, 2021.A Boeing spokeswoman and spokesman for Lion Air did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In both accidents a stall-prevention system known as MCAS, triggered by faulty data from a single airflow sensor, repeatedly and forcefully shoved down the jet’s nose as the pilots struggled to regain control.Adita Irawati, an Indonesian transportation ministry spokeswoman, said Indonesia would allow the Boeing 737 MAX to fly once the FAA issued airworthiness directives. On-the-ground and simulator training for pilots would be included in that process, and the timing would be dependent on compliance with the requirements, Irawati said.

We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure.”Late-stage, or Phase III, trials are ongoing to confirm the findings, researchers said, and to test whether the vaccine protects against infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of people, including people with underlying health conditions.The first efficacy data from those Phase III trials is “possible in the coming weeks”, the Lancet report said.Read more | Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine ‘encouraging’ for older age groupsThe Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine candidate, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, had been among the front-runners in global efforts to develop shots to protect against infection with the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2.But rival drugmakers Pfizer Inc, BioNTech and Moderna Inc have in the past 10 days edged ahead, releasing data from late-stage Covid-19 vaccine trials that shows more than 90% efficacy.Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots, both of which use new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), the AstraZeneca experimental shot is viral vector vaccine made from a weakened version of a common cold virus found in chimpanzees.The Phase II trial reported in The Lancet involved a total of 560 healthy volunteers, with 160 aged 18-55 years, 160 aged 56-69 years, and 240 aged 70 or over.Volunteers got two doses of the vaccine or a placebo, and no serious side effects related to the AZD1222 vaccine were reported, the researchers said.AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world as it gets close to reporting results of its late-stage trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-shot-candidate-shows-promise-among-elderly-in-trials/story-3S7atJ8j2KBSrCi9qMZpvK.html

The development came on a day when Canada’s cyber-spy agency warned that “state-sponsored” programmes of countries such China posed the “the greatest strategic threats to Canada”.The opposition motion came in reaction to reports that China was using proxies to coerce Canadians of Chinese origin into silence and not criticising the regime of President Xi Jinping. It calls for a “robust plan” from the government “to combat China’s growing foreign operations here in Canada and its increasing intimidation of Canadians living in Canada, and table it within 30 days of the adoption of this motion”.Meanwhile, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (Cyber Centre), which is part of the Communications Security Establishment, released a report identifying China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as foreign states that posed a security threat to Canada in this realm.“State-sponsored actors are very likely attempting to develop cyber capabilities to disrupt Canadian critical infrastructure, such as the supply of electricity, to further their goals,” the report from the Cyber Centre stated. While it judged such action was “unlikely”, it added that “cyber threat actors may target critical Canadian organisations to collect information, pre-position for future activities, or as a form of intimidation”.It described such state-sponsored activity as the “most sophisticated” threat that Canada faced. The report also pointed out that such nations will “almost certainly continue” their attempts to steal intellectual property related to research in Canada into countering the Covid-19 pandemic. “State-sponsored actors will almost certainly continue to conduct commercial espionage against Canadian businesses, academia, and governments to steal Canadian intellectual property and proprietary information,” it stated.It also warned that such dangers were not restricted to within the country, but was “almost certainly higher for Canadian organisations that operate abroad or work directly with foreign state-owned enterprises”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-mps-urge-justin-trudeau-government-to-toughen-stand-on-chinese-intimidation-huawei-s-role/story-fsKUpMUDu9ZXXc95mzRyqJ.html

Coming ahead of the transition of power from Donald Trump’s administration to President-elect Joe Biden’s administration after the November 3 US presidential election, the detailed policy document highlights that China is undermining the security, autonomy and economic interests of many nations in the region. “China perceives rising India as a rival and seeks to impel it to accommodate Beijing’s ambitions by engaging economically while constraining New Delhi’s strategic partnership with the US, Japan, Australia and its relations with other democracies,” the report said. “China is undermining the security, autonomy, and economic interests of many others in the region — such as member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including those in the vital Mekong Region, as well as the nations of the Pacific Islands,” the report added. The 70-page report states that awareness has been growing in the US - and in nations around the world - that the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has triggered a new era of great-power competition.Read more | China is fortifying defences across Ladakh border, not prepping to disengage “Yet few discern the pattern in China’s inroads within every region of the world, much less the specific form of dominance to which the party aspires,” said the report. The CCP aims not merely at preeminence within the established world order — an order that is grounded in free and sovereign nation-states, flows from the universal principles on which America was founded, and advances US national interests —but to fundamentally revise world order, placing the People’s Republic of China (PRC) at the center and serving Beijing’s authoritarian goals and hegemonic ambitions. “In the face of the China challenge, the US must secure freedom,” said the report. China, it said, seeks to diminish US influence by fostering a sense in the region’s nations that China’s dominance is inevitable. “Prime targets include US treaty-based allies — Japan, South Korea, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines — as well as emerging strategic partners such as India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Taiwan,” it said. The People’s Liberation Army, the report said, recently provoked skirmishes along its disputed border with India, which killed dozens on both sides, and remains in a tense standoff with India’s military.Read more | China increases movement as rifts develop in Nepal Communist Party Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated after the June 15 Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers died. The report also highlighted Beijing’s hard relations with Taiwan, which it claims as its territory. “Beijing menaces democratic Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province, intending to reunify Taiwan with the Mainland — by force if necessary. And the PLA Navy and Chinese Coast Guard increasingly challenge Japan’s administrative control of the Senkaku Islands,” it said. “The Trump administration achieved a fundamental break with conventional wisdom. It concluded that the CCP’s resolute conduct and self-professed goals require the US and other countries to revise assumptions and develop a new strategic doctrine to address the primacy and magnitude of the China challenge,” according to the document. The report also highlighted the outbreak of contagious coronavirus from China’s Wuhan city. The disease has so far infected 56,178, 674 people and killed 1,348,348 others across the world. The US is the worst affected country. “The CCP’s recklessness in allowing the novel coronavirus born in Wuhan to develop into a global pandemic coupled with the concerted disinformation campaign that Beijing undertook to conceal China’s culpability should put doubts to rest. Yet many people lack a proper understanding of the character and scope of the China challenge,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-perceives-rising-india-as-rival-wants-to-constraint-its-partnership-with-us-allies-report/story-XSV96blPwTzWIQQoPlCq6K.html

The findings published in ‘Lancet’ on Thursday based on 560 healthy adult volunteers shows that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine is “safe and well tolerated” with a lower reactogenicity profile in older adults than in younger adults, meaning the older age groups could build immunity to the disease.“These findings are encouraging because older individuals are at disproportionate risk of severe Covid-19 and so any vaccine adopted for use against SARS-CoV-2 [Covid-19] must be effective in older adults,” the researchers note.The team is also testing whether the vaccine stops people developing Covid-19 in larger Phase 3 trials and early results from this crucial stage are expected in the coming weeks.“We were pleased to see that our vaccine was not only well tolerated in older adults, but also stimulated similar immune responses to those seen in younger volunteers,” said Dr Maheshi Ramasamy, an investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group.Read more | Where are we in the Covid-19 vaccine race?“The next step will be to see if this translates into protection from the disease itself,” she said.This means there are now four promising vaccines on the horizon after Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik and Moderna already reporting good preliminary data from Phase 3 trials.The UK has already ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine, being manufactured by pharma major AstraZeneca.The vaccine also has a tie-up with the Serum Institute of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-university-covid-19-vaccine-encouraging-for-older-age-groups/story-1rAkszKRBQYSWEbqQkUf5O.html

Angus Campbell said Thursday the shameful record included alleged instances in which new patrol members would shoot a prisoner in order to achieve their first kill in a practice known as “blooding.” He said the soldiers would then plant weapons and radios to support false claims the prisoners were enemies killed in action.Campbell told reporters in Canberra the illegal killings began in 2009, with the majority occurring in 2012 and 2013. He said some members of the elite Special Air Service encouraged “a self-centered, warrior culture.”The chief was announcing the findings of a four-year investigation by Maj. Gen. Paul Brereton, a judge and Army reservist who was asked to look into the allegations and interviewed more than 400 witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of documents. Brereton recommended 19 soldiers be investigated by police for possible charges, including murder.“To the people of Afghanistan, on behalf of the Australian Defence Force, I sincerely and unreservedly apologize for any wrongdoing by Australian soldiers,” Campbell said.He said he’d spoken directly to his Afghan military counterpart to express his remorse.“Such alleged behavior profoundly disrespected the trust placed in us by the Afghan people who had asked us to their country to help them,” Campbell said. “It would have devastated the lives of Afghan families and communities, causing immeasurable pain and suffering. And it would have put in jeopardy our mission and the safety of our Afghan and coalition partners.”As well as the 39 killings, the report outlines two allegations of cruel treatment. It says that none of the alleged crimes were committed during the heat of battle.Only parts of the report have been made public. Many details, including the names of alleged killers, remain redacted.The report said a total of 25 current or former troops were involved as perpetrators or accessories in 23 separate incidents, with some involved just once and a few multiple times.It said some Australian troops would regularly carry “throw downs” — things like foreign pistols, radios and grenades that they could plant on those they killed so the Afghan civilians would appear like combatants in photographs.The report said most of the alleged crimes were committed and concealed at a patrol commander level by corporals and sergeants, and that while higher-level troop and squadron commanders had to take some responsibility for the events that happened on their watch, they weren’t primarily to blame.The report paints a picture of a toxic culture in which soldiers were competing against those from other squadrons, accounts of deaths were sanitized or embellished, and many procedures to ensure safety and integrity had broken down.“Those who wished to speak up were allegedly discouraged, intimidated and discredited,” Campbell said.The report recommended 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation. Campbell said he’s accepting all the report’s recommendations.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has already announced a special investigator will help pursue possible prosecutions because the workload would overwhelm existing police resources.Many troops are also likely to be stripped of their medals and the defense force will undergo significant structural changes. The report says that where there is credible evidence of unlawful killings, Afghan families should be compensated immediately by Australia without waiting for the criminal cases to proceed.“This will be an important step in rehabilitating Australia’s international reputation, in particular with Afghanistan, and it is simply the right thing to do,” the report states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elite-australian-troops-unlawfully-killed-39-afghans-report-finds/story-5xOKyesB3AHvvPVkOC5yAO.html

Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi addressed the nation live on television and radio, urging people to remain vigilant with their virus precautions. Samoa was among a dwindling handful of nations to have not reported a single case of the virus. According to the Samoa Observer, the prime minister said the patient was a sailor who had been staying in a quarantine facility since flying in from New Zealand on Friday. He said the sailor returned a positive test four days after arriving, but then a second test on Thursday returned a negative result. The prime minister said the Cabinet would meet Thursday to decide on any changes to the current virus settings, the Observer reported. Samoa is home to about 200,000 people. In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region, South Korea added more than 300 new coronavirus cases for a second consecutive day as authorities began enforcing toughened social distancing rules in some areas. The 343 new cases recorded Thursday by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency took the country’s total to 29,654 with 498 deaths. Elevated physical distancing rules took effective in the greater Seoul area, the southern city of Gwangju and some parts of the eastern Gangwon province. In those areas, gatherings of more than 100 people during rallies, concerts and other events is prohibited, while audiences at sporting events and religious services are limited to 30-50 per cent of capacity. Dancing at nightclubs and drinking at karaoke rooms is also prohibited.

19-11-2020||World||‘Get Covered 2021’: Coalition seizes on Covid-19 pandemic to boost ‘Obamacare’ sign-ups||As Covid-19 spreads uncontrolled in many places, a coalition of states, health care groups and activists is striving to drum up “Obamacare” sign-ups among a growing number of Americans uninsured in perilous times.The campaign kicking off Thursday is called Get Covered 2021 and contrasts with a lack of outreach to the uninsured by the Trump administration, which is still trying to overturn the Affordable Care Act, even in the coronavirus pandemic.“There’s renewed energy around getting people covered this year, given how Covid-19 is impacting so many people’s lives,” said Joshua Peck, a former Obama administration official helping lead the effort.About 26 million people were uninsured last year — before the wave of layoffs that followed the virus shutdown this spring. Experts agree that number has risen, perhaps by 5 million to 10 million, but authoritative estimates await government studies that take time to produce.Nonetheless, research from the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that about 6 in 10 uninsured people would be eligible for some form of subsidized coverage under the Obama-era law. Open enrollment for subsidized private plans through HealthCare.gov is underway and ends Dec. 15.The new sign-up campaign will culminate Dec. 10 with a national “Get Covered America Day,” ahead of the final weekend of open enrollment, traditionally crunch time for prospective customers. Some consumers may get a second chance with the incoming administration. President-elect Joe Biden would reopen HealthCare.gov, creating a special enrollment period for people affected by the coronavirus pandemic.The Get Covered 2021 coalition is anchored by 14 states that run their own health insurance marketplaces, plus Washington, D.C. Also participating are groups that represent doctors and hospitals, as well as the health insurance industry and organizations that advocate for patients. Several liberal advocacy groups and a California-based consortium of public and private employers round out the membership.“The focus of our efforts will be on tapping into the networks and reach of these organizations,” said Peck.The Dec. 10 mobilization will feature a national social media campaign and efforts to generate local news coverage in communities across the country. The campaign website GetCovered2021.org will be able to link interested consumers to their state insurance marketplace or the federal HealthCare.gov.Peck said the campaign faces what he called “tailwinds and headwinds.”The pool of uninsured people eligible and potentially interested has grown. Those who have lost employer coverage and have no immediate job prospects may be anxious to have secure health benefits again, with no exclusions for preexisting medical conditions.On the other hand, Peck continued, the uncertain coronavirus economy has strained family budgets for many people, and even a subsidized monthly premium around $80 may be too much. Additionally, the Trump administration is taking no special action to promote the availability of coverage at a time of greater need for many.Administration officials say they are focused on providing a smooth sign-up experience for consumers. About 11.4 million people currently have private coverage under the ACA. For more than 8 in 10, the premiums are subsidized.Earlier this month, a seemingly skeptical Supreme Court heard the Trump administration’s case for overturning Obamacare. A decision is expected by late spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/get-covered-2021-coalition-seizes-on-covid-19-pandemic-to-boost-obamacare-sign-ups/story-f6Z0nCBVHDIwqLvSlb3PFO.html

Raytheon Missiles and Defense develops and produces missile systems for use by the United States military.During his employment with the company, Sun had access to information directly related to defense-related technology. Some of this defense technical information constituted, what is defined as “defense articles”, which are controlled and prohibited from export without a license under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).According to federal prosecutors, from December 2018 to January 2019, Sun travelled from the United States to China on a personal trip. On that trip, Sun brought along unclassified technical information in his company-issued computer, including data associated with an advanced missile guidance system that was controlled and regulated under the AECA and the ITAR.Despite having been trained to handle these materials correctly, Sun knowingly transported the information to China without an export license in violation of the AECA and the ITAR.“Sun was a highly skilled engineer entrusted with sensitive missile technology that he knew he could not legally transfer to hostile hands,” Assistant Attorney General John C Demers said on Wednesday.“Nevertheless, he delivered that controlled technology to China,” he said. The United States relies on private contractors to help build its “unparalleled defence technology”, said United States Attorney Michael Bailey. “People who try to expose that technology to hostile foreign powers should know that prison awaits them. The close cooperation of the victim defense contractor and the dedication of the FBI made this case a success,” he added. “This is not about a laptop mistakenly taken on a trip, this was the illegal export of US missile technology to China,” Assistant Director Alan E Kohler, Jr. of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-american-sentenced-to-38-months-for-exporting-sensitive-military-technology-to-china/story-QEG96vUJwzEyqNUPKSIJ2L.html

That has prompted fears world markets might split into smaller segments with incompatible industry standards, hurting productivity.“We will never go back in history by seeking to decouple or forming a ‘small circle’ to keep others out,” Xi said.Thursday’s event came ahead of a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders hosted by Malaysia. The meeting Friday is due to be conducted via internet due to the pandemic.Xi’s comments followed Sunday’s signing of the world’s largest free trade agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, by Beijing and 14 other Asian neighbors.The Chinese-initiated RCEP appeals to other developing countries because it reduces barriers to trade in farm goods, manufactured goods and components, which make up most of their exports. It says little about trade in services and access for companies to operate in each other’s economies, which the United States and other developed countries want.The Trump administration has cut off Chinese tech giant Huawei’s access to most U.S. components and technology on security grounds. Washington has shut Huawei and a rival Chinese telecom equipment vendor, ZTE, out of the U.S. market. The White House is pressing the Chinese owner of video service TikTok to sell its U.S. operation, which American officials say is a security risk.Xi promised to cut tariffs but gave no details.“We will further reduce tariffs and institutional costs, cultivate a number of import trade promotion innovation demonstration zones, and expand imports of high-quality products and services from various countries,” he said.China’s repeated promises to set up trade zones and ease import restrictions prompt complaints by the United States, Europe, Japan and other trading partners that Beijing is using such isolated steps to avoid complying with promises made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 to allow foreign companies to compete freely in its economy.China is one of the world’s biggest importers, but the United States and other governments complain Beijing is dragging its feet on carrying out two-decade-old promises to open its markets to foreign competitors in banking, finance and other services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-will-avoid-decoupling-amid-tension-with-us-europe-says-xi-jinping/story-hTrPLorzLxx8RAw2ZAyV4O.html

Study claims Hepatitis C drugs can be effective against Covid-19||Even as countries across the world are scrambling to find a vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has claimed more than a million lives, there might be some hope on the horizon. This “hope,” though, is not related to the development of a Covid-19 vaccine but, rather, with Hepatitis C disease.A study conducted by the United States’ Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory has found that several drugs used to treat Hepatitis C can be effective against an enzyme, which has the ability to help Sars-Cov-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease or Covid-19, spread in human cells. The results of the study have been published in science journal Structures.The study found that the enzyme, a protein enzyme called Protease, is used by Sars-Cov-2 to replicate itself once it has entered the human cell. In order to become a functional protein, Protease needs to cut a long chain of compounds that the virus expresses. It is the prevention of the functioning of the main Protease which can be used to stop the virus from spreading. It is here that the Hepatitis C drugs can be used.The study was conducted as part of efforts to develop treatments for Covid-19 by repurposing existing drugs that are used for other viral diseases. As a part of this exercise, researchers looked at several drug molecules, including three Hepatitis C drugs, which are Protease inhibitors: telaprevir, narlaprevir and boceprevir. A technique called ‘in vitro enzyme kinetics’ was used to conduct the study.No vaccine has been developed as yet to treat Covid-19 though several candidates are in different phases of trials across the globe. The disease has affected more than 56 million people and has claimed more than 1.3 million lives, a worldometers tally shows. As per the tally, nearly 40 million people, too, have recovered from the infection thus far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ray-of-hope-study-claims-hepatitis-c-drugs-can-be-effective-against-covid-19/story-57X6PRGxTVWeZZYphDvlON.html

James Story’s nomination as the Venezuelan ambassador was confirmed Wednesday by a US Senate voice vote. Relations between the US and Venezuela have had a long, rocky past that includes President Donald Trump’s administration winning an indictment against Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro as an alleged narcoterrorist. But Joe Biden’s win could be a new chapter in the two countries’ relationship as experts have predicted that the president-elect might move away from Trump’s hard-line approach of isolating Maduro.Who is James Story? Story, 50, a South Carolina native is a career diplomat nominated by Trump in May and he has been serving as the embassy’s charge d’affairs, the diplomat who heads a mission in the absence of an ambassador. His foreign service’ career has taken him to Mexico, Brazil, Mozambique and Afghanistan. He will likely play a key role helping guide US policy on Venezuela during the transition of President-elect Joe Biden and he will carry out the job from the capital of neighboring Colombia.Read more | Indo-US ties will pick up, Joe Biden no stranger to India: S JaishankarHow have US- Venezuela relations been? The two countries haven’t exchanged ambassadors since 2010, when relations first started to fray under the late President Hugo Chávez. The two nations totally broke diplomatic ties last year, each withdrawing its diplomats shortly after Washington backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the country’s legitimate leader. US leads a coalition of dozens of nations that rejected Maduro following his election in 2018 to a second term in a vote widely considered fraudulent because the most popular opposition leaders were banned from running. US has heavily sanctioned Maduro, his inner circle and the state-run oil firm, attempting to isolate them. The Trump administration offered a $15 million bounty for Maduro’s arrest after a US court indicted him on drug charges.What do the experts say on US- Venezuela ties?

In a virtual roundtable with healthcare workers on Covid-19, Biden alleged on Wednesday that his transition team has not been receiving any cooperation from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has refused to concede the November 3 US election and has filed multiple lawsuits challenging poll results in several States. “One of the problems that we’re having now is the failure of the administration to recognise - the law says that the General Services Administration has a person who recognises who the winner is and then they have to have access to all the data and information that the government possesses to be prepared,” he said. It does not require there to be an absolute winner, Biden said, adding that it says the apparent winner. “We have been unable to get access to the kinds of things we need to know about the depth of the stockpiles. We know there’s not much at all. We get to the point where we have a sense of when these vaccines come out, how they’ll be distributed, who will be first in line, what the plan is,” he said.Read more | US Election 2020: Legal battles Trump may face after losing presidential privileges “There’s over 300 million Americans and beyond our border that they’re going to have to be taken care of. There’s a whole lot of things that are we just don’t have available to us. So much as made available soon, we’re going to be behind by weeks or months being able to put together the whole initiative relating to the biggest promise we have with two drug companies coming along and finding 95 per cent effectiveness/efficiency in the vaccines, which is enormous promise,” Biden said. He said it is the only slowdown right now that his transition team is facing. “We put together I think a first-rate team that you would all be proud of and we’re all ready to go and doing an awful lot of work right now,” he noted. This week, some of the nation’s largest medical groups joined Dr Anthony Fauci, as well as members of the Biden-Harris Covid-19 Advisory Board, in calling for the GSA to stop delaying ascertainment and ensure a seamless transition as Covid-19 infection rates surge across the country. The experts emphasised the need for a smooth transition to bolster the Covid-19 response and prevent further harm to the American people. They said that ascertainment was necessary for the Biden-Harris transition to help determine the public health and economic steps to get the virus under control, to deliver immediate relief to working families, to address ongoing racial and ethnic disparities, and to reopen the schools and businesses safely and effectively. In a letter, the CEOs of the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association urged the Trump administration to “work closely with the Biden transition team to share all critical information related to Covid-19.” “Real-time data and information on the supply of therapeutics, testing supplies, personal protective equipment, ventilators, hospital bed capacity and workforce availability to plan for further deployment of the nation’s assets needs to be shared to save countless lives” they wrote in the letter. “All information about the capacity of the Strategic National Stockpile, the assets from Operation Warp Speed, and plans for dissemination of therapeutics and vaccines needs to be shared as quickly as possible to ensure that there is continuity in strategic planning so that there is no lapse in our ability to care for patients,” they said. The letter cited their perspective as ‘providers of care for all Americans” who see the suffering that is occurring due to Covid-19. “We see families who have lost both parents from Covid-19; we see children suffering from long-term effects due to a Covid-19 infection; and we see minority populations disproportionately suffering from the devastation of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is from this front line human perspective that we urge you to share critical data and information as soon as possible,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vaccination-plan-could-lose-weeks-or-months-biden-on-transition-delay/story-j4lFgEJqwJha2DGjmO3TqK.html
19-11-2020||World||Covid-19 negative report gives false hope, don’t go out yet: Experts||Across the world, including India, people are in a midst of festivities with Chhath being celebrated and Thanksgiving approaching followed by Christmas in December. Even as people are learning to live with the pandemic, cases of the coronavirus disease are also exploding and more and more people are taking part in gatherings with Covid-19 negative certificates. But does it really guarantee that the person with a negative test result will not spread Covid-19?Scientists do not agree with this at all and say that there is no guarantee that a negative report will be safe. Rather, they add, it creates false hope. Therefore, they say it is advisable that a person who has been exposed to Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease, should still follow the mandated guidelines as a precautionary measure.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“You should not rely on test results alone to safely socialise in person. A test can only tell you if you are positive at a given moment in time, and can also fail to detect cases if you are infected but not yet shedding substantial virus,” Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security, was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.A person who has been exposed to the virus can take days to actually show symptoms of the viral disease. Experts say a test result could fail to detect the presence of the virus in the body if the exposed person is tested shortly after getting infected. The virus needs to reproduce enough copies of itself for it to be detected in the Covid-19 tests. The incubation period for Covid-19 is up to 14 days. And before that, a person can test negative and have no symptoms at all.There is also a possibility that a person may contract the virus after getting the test done. Hence it is advisable for the exposed person to stay under quarantine for at least a week after exposure to the virus.There are several types of Covid-19 tests that can be taken to confirm whether a person has contracted the coronavirus disease.Antigen tests are rapid tests which give you results within an hour or so. They are performed with nasal swabs and look for the presence of a specific protein on the surface of the virus. As the person gets results within hours, they are widely being used to test asymptomatic persons. However, there is a high chance of getting a false negative report with a rapid antigen test.Molecular tests are the RT-PCR tests which look for virus’ genetic material in the body. This test is performed with nasal swabs or throat swabs or both. RT-PCR tests are more credible but then it can take days to give you results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-negative-report-gives-false-hope-don-t-go-out-yet-experts/story-cgpztiw4LgNIzmg1E2TrYL.html

The claims included that Diana’s phone was bugged and that her bodyguard was plotting against her.Charles Spencer has demanded an inquiry and an apology. The BBC has apologised for faked bank statements purporting to show that two senior aides were being paid for information on Diana. But the corporation has said that the documents played no part in her decision to take part in the interview.Read more | As transition period nears end, where do UK, EU currently stand on Brexit talks?The 1995 interview, in which Diana famously said “there were three of us in this marriage” — referring to Prince Charles’ relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles — was watched by millions of people.Diana died in a Paris car crash in 1997 as she was pursued by paparazzi.The BBC said Bashir, currently its religion editor, is signed off work by his doctors because he is recovering from heart surgery and complications related to contracting Covid-19 earlier this year.The broadcaster said John Dyson, a former Supreme Court judge, is “an eminent and highly respected figure who will lead a thorough process”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bbc-names-ex-judge-to-lead-probe-into-1995-diana-interview/story-fIIEBkZctpHqLIAYfMPM8J.html
19-11-2020||World||Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine deliveries could start ‘before Christmas’||Pfizer Inc and BioNTech could secure emergency US and European authorization for their Covid-19 vaccine next month after final trial results showed it had a 95% success rate and no serious side effects, the drugmakers said on Wednesday.The vaccine’s efficacy was found to be consistent across different ages and ethnicities - a promising sign given the disease has disproportionately hurt the elderly and certain groups including Black people.The US Food and Drug Administration could grant emergency-use by the middle of December, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters TV. Conditional approval in the European Union could be secured in the second half of December, he added.“If all goes well I could imagine that we gain approval in the second half of December and start deliveries before Christmas, but really only if all goes positively,” he said.The success rate of the vaccine developed by the US drugmaker and German partner BioNTech was far higher than what regulators had said would have been acceptable. Experts said it was a significant achievement in the race to end the pandemic.Of the 170 volunteers who contracted Covid-19 in Pfizer’s trial involving over 43,000 people, 162 had received a placebo and not the vaccine, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective. Of the 10 people who had severe Covid-19, one had received the vaccine.“A first in the history of mankind: less than a year from the sequence of the virus to the large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine, moreover based on a whole new technique,” said Enrico Bucci, a biologist at Temple University in Philadelphia. “Today is a special day.” BioNTech’s Sahin said US emergency use authorization (EUA) would be applied for on Friday. An FDA advisory committee tentatively plans to meet on Dec. 8-10 to discuss the vaccine, a source familiar with the situation said, though the dates could change. The FDA did not respond to requests for comment. Covid-19 runs rampantThe final trial analysis comes a week after initial results showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. Moderna Inc on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine showing 94.5% effectiveness.“We now have two safe and highly effective vaccines that could be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration and ready to distribute within weeks,” US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said.The Moderna vaccine is likely to be authorized within seven to 10 days of Pfizer receiving its EUA, US officials said, with states ready to begin distribution within 24 hours.The better-than-expected results from the two vaccines, both developed with new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, have raised hopes for an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life.The news was especially welcome with the virus again running rampant around the world, setting records for new infections and hospitalizations almost daily. The Pfizer-BioNTech shot was found to have 94% efficacy in people over age 65, a particularly high-risk group.“This is the evidence we needed to ensure that the most vulnerable people are protected,” said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at the University of Liverpool’s department of pharmacology.Global shares rose as the trial results countered concerns around the soaring infection rate. Pfizer shares were up 1.6% while BioNTech jumped 3.8% in the United States. Moderna shares fell 3.6%. Investors have treated vaccine development as a race between companies, although there is likely to be global demand for as much vaccine as can be produced for the foreseeable future.Distributing shotsPfizer said it expects to make as many as 50 million vaccine doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.While some groups such as healthcare workers will be prioritized in the United States and Britain for vaccinations, it will be months before large-scale rollouts begin in either country. On Wednesday, Pfizer said it had offered to provide Brazil with millions of doses in the first half of 2021. It also has agreements with the European Union, Germany and Japan where distribution could begin next year. Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s top emergency expert, said it would be at least 4-6 months before significant levels of vaccination were taking place around the world.Distribution of a Pfizer-BioNTech shot is complicated by the need to store it at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius. It can, however, be kept in normal refrigeration for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.Moderna’s vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20C though it is expected to be stable for 30 days at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36°-46°F).Fatigue and headachesPfizer said vaccine was well-tolerated and that side effects were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly. The only severe adverse events experienced by volunteers were fatigue (3.8%) and headaches (2%) after the second dose. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events.“These are extraordinary results, and the safety data look good,” said David Spiegelhalter, a professor and expert in risk and evidence communication at the University of Cambridge. Of the dozens of drugmakers and research groups racing to develop Covid-19 vaccines, the next late-stage data will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson said it is on track to deliver data this year.Authorization of vaccines for children will take longer. Only Pfizer has started vaccinating volunteers under age 18 and as young as 12. Moderna and J&J have said they hope to start testing the vaccine in younger people soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-deliveries-could-start-before-christmas/story-YSPXmP8cnJKs0Be3fVD4yO.html
19-11-2020||World||After 95% efficacy, what’s next for Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine candidate||US pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc on Wednesday announced its vaccine for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) had a 95% success rate, which was higher than an earlier analysis. Announcing the new test results for the Covid-19 vaccine it developed with German biotech firm BioNTech, Pfizer said it is safe and works on older people as well who are most at risk of dying due to the respiratory disease.The news of the final analysis of the trial’s data came as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to worsen across the world. As per the John Hopkins University, as many as 56,166,387 people have contracted Covid-19 so far and 1,346,741 people lost their lives due to the viral disease.While it is encouraging news for the US and European countries, which already have a deal with Pfizer for millions of doses, countries like India are going to face major hurdles with the logistical issue such as cold storage as the Pfizer candidate requires -70 degrees of temperature. Even countries with more robust cold chain systems may have to shed money to store the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.Here is what is next for Pfizer vaccine after the success in the clinical trial:1. The company will send applications to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to seek emergency-use authorisation. The shots will be distributed within 24 hours after the drug regulator body gives its nod to emergency use.2. Pfizer also have begun “rolling submissions” for the vaccine with regulators in Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada and soon will add this new data to its application.3. While the government in the United States has started preparation for the distribution as it has identified 64 jurisdictions that will lead vaccine distribution for their areas.4. Pfizer is also working to determined how long the protection would last after a person takes the two-dose regimen of its candidate. It is also working to understand whether people might need boosters.5. Based on its current projections, Pfizer is expected to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.6. The firm has so far inked deals for hundreds of millions of doses of the Covid-19 vaccine with countries like the US, the UK, Japan and the European Union region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-95-efficacy-what-s-next-for-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-candidate/story-cqK3AGWAmdsDYIUH43fdZM.html
19-11-2020||World||Covid-19: What are clinical trials and how do they work?||To find out whether experimental Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective, researchers design clinical trials involving thousands of volunteers, divided into groups that receive either the drug under investigation or a placebo. Data from such trials have shown that two vaccines -- one developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, the other by Moderna and the US National Institutes of Health -- are about 95 percent effective.Here’s a look at how trials work:Who leads clinical trials? American pharmaceutical Pfizer itself has led and financed a clinical trial of its vaccine involving almost 44,000 people in the United States, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina.Volunteers who are accepted receive two doses 21 days apart and get regular follow-up.The Moderna-NIH vaccine is given 28-days-apart at locations across the US on some 30,000 volunteers, in a trial part funded by the taxpayer.The trials are “blinded” meaning neither the volunteers nor the health care providers know who gets the medicine and who gets a saline solution placebo.How do we know if the vaccines worked? Volunteers have not been deliberately infected with the virus. This option, known as a challenge trial, was considered but deemed too risky given that there aren’t any Covid-19 treatments that are proven as highly-effective.Instead volunteers are expected to go about their lives as normal, and are given the same advice about mask use, distancing and hand washing as everyone else.Over the course of time, a certain number naturally become infected, and since they’re getting regular follow-up, the trial investigators quickly find out.If the vaccine is effective, the number of people who fall sick in the vaccine group should be lower than the number of people who get ill in the placebo group.The aim is to find a difference great enough to exclude the possibility it occurred by chance. Statistical methods come into play to achieve a predetermined level of certainty. It’s worth noting that the primary goal is to prevent people from getting sick, with good vaccines also protecting people from severe illness.Stopping people from getting infected at all, and thus being able to transmit the virus forward, is a secondary goal for Moderna.Moncef Slaoui, chief of the US government’s Operation Warp Speed, said Wednesday he expects the vaccines will achieve these goals too, though at a lower efficacy rate.Why have a placebo?  The only way of knowing whether a vaccine works is by providing a “control”, which is a demonstration of what would happen in its absence. Of course, different people have different risk profiles in terms of their ages, underlying conditions, and how much risky behavior they engage in. That’s why the trials need to be scaled to tens of thousands of people to eliminate confounding factors.Who analyzes the data? To ensure scientific rigor is upheld, the data is firewalled from the companies and analyzed by experts in a “data and safety monitoring board” whose membership is kept secret to prevent political pressure.Over the course of a trial, these committees will lift the hood on the data that’s been collected so far and see which patients belonged to which group.They can then inform the manufacturer in case of conclusive results and the manufacturer can then use the data, if it’s favorable, to apply for a marketing authorization. The boards also closely monitor safety, looking at the frequency and severity of side-effects, a key factor in determining regulatory approval.95 percent efficacy? Pfizer’s efficacy analysis featured 170 people who fell sick with Covid-19 in the seven days following the second dose, which might seem like a small number of people compared to the total trial participants (44,000).But it’s enough to say the result is statistically significant with a high-degree of certainty. That’s because 162 people who fell ill were on the placebo, and only eight were in the vaccine group -- a difference so great it’s extremely improbable to come about by chance.An efficacy of 95 percent signifies that the risk of catching Covid-19 is reduced by 95 percent in the vaccinated group compared to the placebo group.Placebo group get vaccine? They will all be transferred to the vaccine arm -- but it is still being decided when that will happen, said Slaoui. The Pfizer and Moderna trials will therefore lose their “control” groups, but the participants will still be followed for two more years to determine how long immunity lasts and whether there are longer-term safety effects.It will also make it harder to recruit new people to ongoing trials for vaccines that aren’t yet as close to applying for approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-what-are-clinical-trials-and-how-do-they-work/story-YkOas2TfZ7kQY5v2izwzSL.html
19-11-2020||World||‘Tired to the bone’: Hospitals in US overwhelmed with Covid-19 cases||Overwhelmed hospitals are converting chapels, cafeterias, waiting rooms, hallways, even a parking garage into patient treatment areas. Staff members are desperately calling around to other medical centers in search of open beds. Fatigue and frustration are setting in among front-line workers.Conditions inside the nation’s hospitals are deteriorating by the day as the coronavirus rages across the US at an unrelenting pace and the confirmed death toll surpasses 250,000.“We are depressed, disheartened and tired to the bone,” said Alison Johnson, director of critical care at Johnson City Medical Center in Tennessee, adding that she drives to and from work some days in tears.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe number of people in the hospital with Covid-19 in the US has doubled in the past month and set new records every day this week. As of Tuesday, nearly 77,000 were hospitalized with the virus.Newly confirmed infections per day in the US have exploded more than 80% over the past two weeks to the highest levels on record, with the daily count running at close to 160,000 on average. Cases are on the rise in all 50 states. Deaths are averaging more than 1,155 per day, the highest in months.The out-of-control surge is leading governors and mayors across the US to grudgingly issue mask mandates, limit the size of private and public gatherings ahead of Thanksgiving, ban indoor restaurant dining, close gyms or restrict the hours and capacity of bars, stores and other businesses.New York City’s school system — the nation’s largest, with more than 1 million students — suspended in-person classes Wednesday amid a mounting infection rate, a painful setback in a corner of the country that suffered mightily in the spring but had seemingly beaten back the virus months ago.Click here for complete coronavirus coverageTexas is rushing thousands of additional medical staff to overworked hospitals as the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients statewide accelerates toward 8,000 for the first time since a deadly summer outbreak.In the worsening rural Panhandle, roughly half of the admitted patients in Lubbock’s two main hospitals had COVID-19, and a dozen people with the virus were waiting in the emergency room for beds to open up Tuesday night, said Dr. Ron Cook, the Lubbock County health authority.“We’re in trouble,” Cook said.In the Texas border city of El Paso, overwhelmed morgues have begun paying jail inmates $2 an hour to help transport the bodies of virus victims. The crush of patients is forcing the city to send its non-COVID-19 cases to hospitals elsewhere in the state.More than 5,400 extra medical personnel have been deployed around Texas by the state alone, said Lara Anton, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. And that doesn’t include the help surging into Texas from the military and volunteer organizations.“There are only so many medical personnel to go around. And I think what we’re seeing in places like El Paso is not sustainable in all or a large part of the state,” said Dr. Mark McClellan, a former head of the Food and Drug Administration.Ballad Health system, which is located in the Appalachian mountains and includes the Tennessee hospital where Alison Johnson works, has warned that it and its workers are stretched so thin that without a change in course, its hospitals might have to turn patients away. Ballad reported having just 16 available ICU beds Wednesday and about 250 team members in isolation or quarantine. It is trying to recruit hundreds more nurses.In Idaho, doctors warned that hospitals have almost reached the point where they need to ration care, unable to treat everyone because there aren’t enough beds or staffers to go around.“Never in my career did I think we would even contemplate the idea of rationing care in the United States of America,” said Dr. Jim Souza, chief medical officer for St. Luke’s Health System.In Reno, Nevada, Renown Regional Medical Center began moving some coronavirus patients into its parking garage.Video of the converted garage before it opened to patients showed rows and rows of beds separated by moveable white screens set up on one level of the stark, cavernous garage, each section designated by letters and each bed space marked by a number on the ground. The garage unit currently houses 27 patients but at peak capacity will have enough beds to accommodate more than 1,400, said Dr. Paul Sierzenski, Renown’s chief medical officer for acute care.The garage is heated, pressurized to ensure adequate airflow and set up for patients who don’t require long-term hospital care, Sierzenski said.In Kansas, hospitals are converting spaces such as chapels and cafeterias for use by Covid-19 patients, said Cindy Samuelson, spokeswoman for the Kansas Hospital Association.Stormont Vail Health in Topeka, Kansas, devoted an entire hospital floor to Covid-19 patients as their numbers swelled, hitting 90 on Wednesday. The hospital also converted two surgery waiting rooms for use by non-infected patients, spokesman Matt Lara said.Kansas health chief Dr. Lee Norman said a system that he likened to air traffic control for coronavirus patients is being put in place so nurses from rural hospitals can make a single call to find a larger hospital that can take their sickest patients.In some cases, nurses and doctors in Kansas have been spending up to eight hours looking for a large hospital with an opening.Maryland health officials similarly set up a centralized clearinghouse with information on available ICU beds so that hospitals need only make a single phone call. State authorities also issued an emergency order prohibiting most hospital visitors until further notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tired-to-the-bone-hospitals-in-us-overwhelmed-with-covid-19-cases/story-mldv6OcbFW86pam63gklhJ.html

Nearly £500 million will be spent in the next four years for the development and production of electric vehicle batteries, officials said, adding that the ban on sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030 had been agreed with car manufacturers and sellers.Johnson said, “Although this year has taken a very different path to the one we expected, the UK is looking to the future and seizing the opportunity to build back greener. The recovery of our planet and of our economies can and must go hand-in-hand.”The ten-point plan includes making cycling and walking more attractive ways to travel and investing in zero-emission public transport of the future, and producing enough offshore wind to power every home, quadrupling how much the UK produces to 40GW by 2030.It also envisages generating 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 for industry, transport, power and homes, developing the first town powered entirely by hydrogen by the end of the decade.Johnson announced £500 million for the hydrogen-related plan that includes trialling homes using hydrogen for heating and cooking, starting with a “Hydrogen Neighbourhood” in 2023, moving to a “Hydrogen Village” by 2025, with an aim for a “Hydrogen Town” before the end of the decade.Poornima Prabhakaran of Public Health Foundation of India said, “With the spiking pollution levels again choking large tracts of northern India, yet another lesson to emulate for India and the capital city in particular, to deal with its perennial problem of polluting vehicles.“While enhancing public transport and disincentivising private vehicle ownership may work in the interim, a shift to cleaner fuels through a similar policy may just be the right prescription for securing clean air and healthy lungs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ban-on-new-petrol-and-diesel-cars-in-uk-from-2030/story-5bPg0pjmaAynYlos5cJjiI.html

Trump has refused to acknowledge he lost to President-elect Joe Biden and has launched legal challenges against the outcome.“The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the 2020 election was highly inaccurate, in that there were massive improprieties and fraud - including dead people voting,” tweeted Trump. He added, “Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.”The CISA, as the agency is called, is part of the department of homeland security. Krebs was appointed by Trump.House Democrats nominated Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday as the speaker to lead them into Biden’s presidency, but she’d be guiding a smaller and ideologically divided majority as she tries shepherding his agenda towards enactment.Democrats used a voice vote to make Pelosi their choice to serve two more years in her post.

James Daunt, CEO of Barnes & Noble, said that the superstore chain easily sold more than 50,000 copies its first day and hoped to reach half a million within 10 days.“So far it has been neck and neck with Michelle Obama’s book,” he said.Also Read| ‘My fascination with India largely revolved around Mahatma Gandhi’: Barack Obama in his bookBy comparison, Bill Clinton’s “My Life” sold around 400,000 copies in North America its first day and George W.

Rowling’s seventh and final Harry Potter novel, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” which came out in 2007 and sold more than 8 million copies within 24 hours.Obama’s 768-page memoir, which came out Tuesday and has a list price of $45, had unusually risky timing for a book of such importance to the author, to readers and to the publishing industry. It came out just two weeks after Election Day and could have been overshadowed had the race still been in doubt or perhaps unwanted by distressed Obama fans if President Donald Trump had defeated Democratic nominee Joe Biden. But Biden won and his victory likely renews interest in an era when he was Obama’s trusted and popular vice president.Obama himself acknowledges that he didn’t intend for the book, the first of two planned volumes, to arrive so close to a presidential election or to take nearly four years after he left the White House — months longer than for “My Life” and two years longer than “Decision Points.” In the introduction to “A Promised Land,” dated August 2020, Obama writes that “the book kept growing in length and scope” as he found he needed more words than expected to capture a given moment — a bind many authors well understand. He was also working under conditions he “didn’t fully anticipate,” from the pandemic to the Black Lives Matters protests, to, “most troubling of all,” how the country’s “democracy seems to be teetering on the brink of crisis.”Because of the pandemic, Obama will not go on the all-star arena tour Michelle Obama had for “Becoming.” But he benefits from the attention of any memoir by a former president and by the special attention for Obama, who has the rare stature among politicians of writing his own books and for attracting as much or more attention for how he tells a story than for the story itself. Obama has already written two acclaimed, million-selling works, “Dreams from My Father” and “The Audacity of Hope, which came out in 2006. His new book covers some of the same time period as his previous ones, while continuing his story through the first 2 1/2 ears of his presidency and the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden by the Navy SEALS.Publishers Weekly praised the book as “shot through with memorable turns of phrase,” while other reviews were more qualified, calling the book all too reflective of Obama’s thoughtful, even-handed style. The New York Times’ Jennifer Szalai wrote that the “most audacious thing” about “A Promised Land” is “the beaming portrait” of Obama on the cover. The Washington Post’s Carlos Lozada noted that in “domestic policy and foreign affairs, in debates over culture and race, Obama splits differences, clings to the middle ground and trusts in process as much as principle.”Also Read| ‘Spent childhood years listening to Ramayana and Mahabharata’: Barack Obama“It turns out he is not a ‘revolutionary soul’ but a reformist one, ‘conservative in temperament if not in vision.’ Behind those dreams, the audacity and all that promise is a stubborn streak of moderation,” Lozada wrote.Obama’s book is the highlight of publishing’s holiday season and for some independent bookstores, the potential difference between remaining in business or closing. Publishing sales have been surprisingly stable during the pandemic, but much of the benefit has gone to Amazon.com as readers turned increasingly to online purchases. The American Booksellers Association, the independent sellers’ trade group, has warned that hundreds of stores could go out of business if holiday sales fall short.Kris Kleindienst, co-owner of Left Bank Books in St. Louis, anticipates selling around 1,000 copies by the end of the year, a number which makes “a HUGE difference” for annual revenues, she wrote in an email. Sarah McNally, owner of McNally Jackson Books in Manhattan, said she sold around 600 copies in the first 24 hours, a pace exceeded only by the final Harry Potter book.“It’s not hard to be a bright spot this year, a year when we would have gone out of business without federal aid,” McNally said. “But Obama does feel like a savior, as do our customers for buying this from us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/barack-obama-memoir-off-to-record-setting-start-in-sales/story-7lGLZeHVnRXzTpGIqRsIYL.html
19-11-2020||World||CEOs of Twitter, Facebook defend content moderation practices||Republican senators on Tuesday attacked the chief executives of Facebook and Twitter for what they called censorship of President Trump and his allies during the US election while Democrats bemoaned the spread of misinformation on social media. Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook defended their content moderation practices at a congressional hearing scheduled after the platforms decided to block stories from The New York Post that made claims about the son of then Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.Republican lawmakers have consistently accused the companies of anti-conservative bias.In his opening remarks, judiciary committee chairman Lindsey Graham asked, “What I want to try to find out is if you’re not a newspaper at Twitter or Facebook, then why do you have editorial control over The New York Post?” He said he did not think articles on Hunter Biden, refuted by the Biden campaign, needed to be flagged or excluded from distribution.Democrats focused on the spread of misinformation by Trump, a Republican, and his supporters. They pushed the companies to limit the spread of false and misleading content ahead of Georgia elections, where two Republican incumbent senators are facing run-offs against well-funded Democratic opponents - contests that will likely determine which party controls the US Senate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ceos-of-twitter-facebook-defend-content-moderation-practices/story-dUVmjcYHObNl8B8I3hATMI.html
19-11-2020||World||New York City schools to close again to stop renewed spread of Covid-19||New York City is shuttering schools to try to stop the renewed spread of the coronavirus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday in a painful about-face for one of the first big US school systems to bring students back to classrooms this fall.The nation’s largest public school system will halt in-person learning Thursday, sending more than 1 million children into all-online classes, the mayor said.The Democrat said at an afternoon news conference that plans were being made to bring in-person learning back as quickly as possible if the infection rate drops, though he cautioned that the bar to return would be higher than it was to close down. He added that schools would definitely remain closed through Thanksgiving.“We’re going to fight this back,” de Blasio said. “This is a setback, but it’s a setback we will overcome.”It can’t be overcome soon enough for Darneice Foster. She has four children, ranging in age from 4 to 13, now set to be learning from home.“I don’t know what I’m going to do, except pull my hair out,” she said.The city’s springtime stretch of all-online learning was “really awful” for the family, which shares a one-bedroom apartment in Upper Manhattan, said Foster, a former pharmaceutical advertising worker who left her job some years ago when one of her children had health problems.“Now, I really want my kids to catch up, and I’m one person,” she said. She said she would “look on the sunny side and just bear it for a few weeks,” hoping schools would reopen soon.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe city had said since summer that school buildings would close if 3% of all the coronavirus tests performed citywide over a seven-day period came back positive. As the rate neared that point last week, de Blasio advised parents to prepare for a possible shutdown.The mayor said the rate equaled that mark as of Tuesday.The city’s public school students will now be taught entirely online, as most already are. As of the end of October, only about 25% of students had gone to class in school this fall, far fewer than officials had expected.In-person school resumed Sept. 21 for pre-kindergarteners and some special education students. Elementary schools opened Sept. 29 and high schools Oct. 1.At the time, the seven-day positive test average rate was under 2%.Even as the school system stayed open, nearly 1,500 classrooms went through temporary closures after students or staffers tested positive, and officials began instituting local shutdowns in neighborhoods where coronavirus cases were rising rapidly.As of midweek, more than 2,300 students or staff at public schools had tested positive since the start of the school year.New York City’s school system, like others across the nation, initially halted in-person learning in mid-March as the virus spiked.While many big US school districts later decided to start the fall term with online learning, de Blasio pushed for opening schoolhouse doors. The Democrat argued that students needed services they got in school and that many parents were counting on it in order to get back to work.To keep students spread out, the city offered in-person learning only part-time, with youngsters logging on from home the rest of the time.The reopening date, originally set for Sept. 10, was postponed twice as teachers, principals and some parents said safety precautions and staffing were inadequate, with the teachers’ union at one point threatening to strike.The city agreed to changes, including hiring thousands more teachers and testing 10% to 20% of all students and staffers per month for the virus.When high schools finally opened their doors, de Blasio hailed it as “an absolutely amazing moment” in the city’s recovery.“This is an example of what makes New York City great,” he said at the time. “We did something that other cities around this country could only dream of because we have fought back this pandemic so well for so long.”Also Read: Covid-19 lockdowns test the economic endurance of desperate AmericansThe city’s announcement came just as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has frequently overruled the mayor on major decisions related to the pandemic, was finishing a news conference in which he said the city had the authority to shut things down if it wished to do so.Cuomo predicted a “tremendous spike” in Covid-19 cases after Thanksgiving as he pleaded with people not to be lulled into a false sense of safety over the holiday.“Your family sounds safe, doesn’t it? Your home sounds safe. Your dining room table at Thanksgiving sounds safe,” Cuomo said at a state Capitol briefing. “No, you won’t be safe. It’s an illusion.”Parts of western New York that have been under the least onerous “yellow zone” restrictions are now under more restrictive “orange zone” restrictions, in which schools go remote and “high-risk” businesses such as gyms are closed, Cuomo said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-schools-to-close-again-to-stop-renewed-spread-of-covid-19/story-L1iPDl2MBtp2Qe5HUXoK4H.html

The approval comes at a time when the country is fighting a fierce resurgence of infections.“This new testing option is an important diagnostic advancement to address the pandemic and reduce the public burden of disease transmission,” said FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn in the statement.It could also help take some strain off testing labs that are being overwhelmed by demand. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Tuesday that if communities could have carried out widespread testing, it could have helped slow transmission before it took off explosively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-okays-self-testing-kit-for-detecting-covid-19/story-ZkqOs2pALmaQuWazWdR4PO.html

The Chinese vaccine’s trial involved more than 700 volunteers recruited in China between April 16 and May 5.“The vaccine appeared to be safe and well tolerated at all tested doses... Within 14 days of the final dose, study detected robust antibody responses after two injections of the vaccine candidate were given 14 days apart,” the journal said.South Australia on Wednesday declared a six-day lockdown to stamp out what officials described as a highly contagious outbreak of the coronavirus disease that they linked to a returned traveller from the UK.German police unleashed water cannon on Wednesday in an effort to scatter thousands of protesters angry over plans to empower Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government to enforce more restrictions.Protesters near Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate threw bottles at police and set off smoke bombs. Riot police detained some protesters while firing volleys of water. Demonstrators were fuming about legislation due to be passed by parliament that could allow the government to impose curbs on social contact, rules on mask-wearing, and drinking alcohol in public.Meanwhile, the UK government has released a film based on research that shows ventilation and letting in fresh air into indoor spaces can reduce risk of infection by over 70%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-covid-vaccine-appears-safe-causes-immune-response/story-bj7j47X0oiIuj7ORmJKv4L.html

By January 15, five days before the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the US, the number of American forces in Afghanistan will come down from the current level of 4,500 to 2,500. The number of soldiers in Iraq will also be reduced, from the existing 3,000 to 2,500.The Trump administration’s decision comes as part of the Republican president’s much debated pledge to bring America’s “endless wars” to an end.Citing US casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq - 6,900 killed and 52,000 wounded - acting secretary of defence Christopher Miller told reporters, “I am formally announcing that we will implement President Trump’s orders to continue our repositioning of forces from those two countries.” Miller was not accompanied at the announcement by Mark Milley, the chairman of joint chiefs of staff, who had earlier dismissed reports about troop reductions as speculation. Robert O’Brien, the National Security Adviser, told reporters that Trump hoped “that they will all come home safely - and in their entirety” by May.That was an unusual projection to make as president-elect Biden would be in charge then and it would be his administration’s decision. There was no word from Biden or his team yet on the troop withdrawals.Criticism of the move came swiftly, and from both the parties. Even close Republican allies were outraged. “I think it’s extremely important here in the next couple of months not to have any earthshaking changes with regard to defence and foreign policy,” Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the US Senate, told reporters. “I think a precipitous drawdown in either Afghanistan or Iraq would be a mistake.”Tammy Duckworth, a Democratic senator who has served in Afghanistan and lost both her legs to combat wounds in Iraq, warned of adverse impact of the move on peace efforts. “We all want our troops to be brought home safely, but this announcement is a mistake. At a time when we are finally seeing serious peace negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban, Donald Trump is unilaterally taking one of our best bargaining chips off the table - and getting nothing in return.”Meanwhile, rockets struck Baghdad on Tuesday with four landing inside the Green Zone, killing a child and wounding five people, signalling an end to an informal truce announced by Iran-backed militias in October. One of the rockets struck close to Iraq’s National Security Service, 600m from the US embassy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-decision-to-reduce-troops-in-afghanistan-iraq-draws-ire/story-HLgfX36kIaSFSEjJMMsHYO.html
19-11-2020||World||Canada names major cyber-crime threats; sees risk to power supply||Canada on Wednesday identified state-sponsored programs in China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as major cyber crime threats for the first time, and said it feared foreign actors could try to disrupt power supplies.The Communications Security Establishment (CSE) signals intelligence agency, equivalent to the US National Security Agency, said the four nations’ programs posed the greatest strategic threat to Canada.“State-sponsored cyber activity is generally the most sophisticated threat,” CSE said in its second national cyber threat assessment.Canada’s relations with China have soured notably over the last two years, while Ottawa is a harsh critic of Moscow.CSE’s first assessment, released in 2018, also mentioned foreign-based actors but did not identify them. Canada did though join Britain and the United States in July to accuse Russian-backed hackers of trying to steal Covid-19 vaccine data.China and Russia have repeatedly denied trying to break into critical infrastructure of other nations.CSE said it was very unlikely hackers would intentionally try to disrupt important systems and cause major damage or kill people in the absence of war.But they “may target critical Canadian organizations to ... pre-position for future activities, or as a form of intimidation,” it added.“State-sponsored actors are very likely attempting to develop the additional cyber capabilities required to disrupt the supply of electricity.”In 2019, Russian-associated actors probed the networks of US and Canadian electricity utilities, it added.CSE said the threat of hacking was all the more serious given how many Canadians were relying on digital services amid the coronavirus pandemic.CSE is one of the Canadian agencies probing whether China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd can supply equipment for next-generation 5G networks.The United States and other close Canadian allies have moved to block Huawei on the grounds its 5G gear could contain backdoors allowing access for spies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-names-major-cyber-crime-threats-sees-risk-to-power-supply/story-VKGaEYxqQwIYIUMs2Ta5PK.html

19-11-2020||World||Boris Johnson’s green plan shows just how far UK is from net-zero||Boris Johnson on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping package of measures designed to zero out Britain’s greenhouse gas pollution by mid-century. The announcement shows just how long that road will be.The prime minister’s 10-point plan covers everything from diesel cars to hydrogen and offshore wind power. It’s one of the biggest package of climate measures set out by a British prime minister—and even won measured praise from Greenpeace as the UK seeks to position itself as a global leader on climate change before it co-hosts global talks next year.But experts said the government will have to more than double the 12 billion pounds ($16 billion) it proposed, and come up with a more detailed road map, if it wants to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050. Analysis by the independent UK Climate Change Committee, which monitors the nation’s progress toward its long-term climate goals, showed Britain isn’t even on track to reach its previous goal of cutting emissions by 80% in the next 30 years.“On the basis of details released so far, these measures will not be enough to reach net-zero emissions by 2050,” said Victoria Cuming, an analyst for Bloomberg NEF. In the coming weeks, the CCC will set out its advice on the volume of greenhouse gases the UK can emit from 2033 to 2037 if it wants to get on the pathway to net zero. The government’s response to that advice will be key, said John Gummer, the committee’s chairman. “This is a very big step indeed. But it’s not yet enough,” he said of today’s announcement.The UK’s plans will also be helped by growing global momentum to tackle climate change. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to set a target for the US to be net zero by 2050 which, combined with recent pledges from China and Japan, will mean eight of the 10 biggest economies have carbon-neutral commitments.Contentious policiesMany of the UK’s new targets are in line with what businesses and the CCC have been asking for to decarbonize transport and industry—two of the toughest areas to clean up. That includes a plan for 5 gigawatts of hydrogen capacity by 2030 and a commitment to developing small modular nuclear reactors.Others have been more contentious, including a decision to ban the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars from 2030. The government reached a compromise with the auto industry by delaying the ban on hybrids until 2035. It doesn’t detail how it would ramp up electric car usage over the next decade. Just 8.5% of cars sold in the three months to September in the UK were electric.“While the government has taken a big step for our climate by ruling out new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2030, behind the headline is a gaping hole in the funding needed to put us on track to net zero,’ Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, said in a statement. Johnson’s office also clashed with the Treasury over the plans, according to the Observer newspaper. The proposal was delayed at least twice, and negotiations on its contents were still ongoing just days before it was unveiled. The government also delayed an energy policy paper, hasn’t made a decision on the future of carbon pricing after Brexit, and doesn’t have a robust plan for de-carbonizing heat in people’s homes.“Achieving the government’s net-zero target demands that we move to de-carbonizing all buildings by 2050,” said Darren Jones, chair of parliament’s business and energy committee. “Heat pumps are only part of the solution.”New SpendingSome climate watchers also criticized the lack of new money behind the plans.A UK government spokeswoman said there would be at least 3 billion pounds of new funds, on top of about 9 billion pounds of existing commitments made this year.  The government expects businesses to contribute as much as three times what it’s spending, or 36 billion pounds, Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi told Bloomberg Television.The UK’s green stimulus support so far has been dwarfed by those of its neighbors. France’s package was $40 billion together with $13 billion of support with green conditions, according to BloombergNEF, while Germany’s was $33 billion. For example, Johnson’s pledge to spend as much as 500 million pounds on hydrogen is just a fraction of the 9 billion euros ($11 billion) envisaged by Germany’s Recovery Fund to build 15 gigawatts of clean hydrogen capacity.“This is not an oven-ready meal. The government plan recycles previous funding and spreads a thin veneer of ice cream across reheated mashed potato of already pledged money,” said Stuart Haszeldine, a professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh.He said the government’s pledge to capture and store 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030 “is a very welcome new milestone,” but the UK needs to treble that quantity of carbon stored in order to meet the 2050 goal.Green JobsJohnson’s self-styled plan for a green industrial revolution comes at a time when the UK economy has been wounded by the pandemic, and faces added uncertainty over the UK’s future outside the European Union from Jan. 1.On Wednesday, Johnson said the proposal would create 250,000 new jobs, many of them in parts of the former industrial heartlands in the north of England that voted for his Conservative Party for the first time in the December 2019 election.But his initiatives are too fragmented, said Nick Molho, executive director of the Aldersgate Group, which lobbies government for stronger action on climate change on behalf of businesses including Siemens AG, Sky Ltd. and Tesco Plc.“The Prime Minister must embed the net-zero target across all government departments and address the lack of long-term policy commitments that is still holding back progress in some parts of the economy,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-green-plan-shows-just-how-far-uk-is-from-net-zero/story-Lj3reVWB2tWG5BIfZ9FUhI.html

But those same developers contributed only 4.9% of the App Store’s 2019 revenue.However, Gene Munster of Loupe Ventures, a longtime Apple analyst, estimated the small developers covered under the program make up 20% of Apple’s App store revenue. He lowered his estimate for Apple’s store revenue in its next fiscal year to $14.2 billion, a $1.6 billion reduction from his estimate before the policy change and about 0.5% of Apple’s overall revenue.The App Association, a group sponsored by Apple, said in a statement that the “reduced commission for small businesses will allow them to put additional resources towards scaling up and innovating new products and services.”In a statement, Match Group said Apple’s rules still forced developers to use its payment system even when Apple competes against those developers. “And if you manage to grow your revenue over $1 million, they then double their cut – arbitrarily – making it even harder for the startup to continue to grow,” the company said.Spotify, which is pursuing an antitrust complaint against Apple in Europe, said in a statement that it hopes “regulators will ignore Apple’s ‘window dressing’ and act with urgency to protect consumer choice, ensure fair competition, and create a level playing field for all,”Apple said the new program will start on Jan. 1 and it will give more details on which developers qualify next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-lowers-app-store-fees-for-small-developers-critics-say-move-has-little-impact/story-NwTKyCbU0A55yJPM83i9sO.html

He learnt that Zhang Zhan had started a hunger strike on September 2 and detention centre authorities had begun to forcibly feed her. He reported that her health was very poor. Zhang Zhan received another visit from her lawyer Wen Yu on September 28. The lawyer reported afterwards that Zhang seemed very thin and weak,” CHRD said.“Zhang Zhan is being prosecuted purely for reporting on the pandemic in Wuhan. She faces 4-5 years in prison for sharing information from the ground. As we can see by the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Chinese government’s suppression of information affects everyone,” CHRD told HT in a statement.“It should be of global concern that Zhang Zhan faces prison for her reporting on Covid-19,” the statement added.Zhang is not the only Chinese citizen journalist detained for covering the outbreak in Wuhan.Chen Mei and Cai Wei are two other citizen journalists who are in detention for doing Covid-19-related news stories from Wuhan.Citizen journalist Li Zehua who went missing from the first outbreak epicentre Wuhan in February reappeared weeks later, saying that he had been quarantined by security forces in the city for two weeks, and then for more days in his hometown.Two more citizen journalists Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin are still missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/detained-citizen-journalist-in-china-faces-jail-for-reporting-on-covid-19-pandemic-in-wuhan/story-tkXEotMc81z2PBn41PORXN.html

As of Tuesday evening, 20,051 new cases and 598 deaths were recorded across the UK.The film produced with scientists at Leeds University illustrates how coronavirus lingers in the air in spaces with no fresh air, increasing the risk of people breathing in infected particles, and how the risk can be reduced significantly by regularly ventilating enclosed areas.Officials said research has shown that being in a room with fresh air can reduce risk of infection from particles by over 70%, as fresh air dilutes the particles. Experts recommend opening windows for short, sharp bursts of 10 to 15 minutes regularly throughout the day and to leave windows slightly open continuously to remove infected particles lingering in the room.They also advised that any household systems that use outdoor air, including kitchen or bathroom extractor fans, are used correctly and regularly as an additional method to remove infected particles.Catherine Noakes from Leeds University, who advised on the film, said, “When a room does not have any fresh air, and where people are generating large amounts of aerosol through activities such as singing and loud speech, that is when transmission of coronavirus is most likely.“Fresh air must come from outdoors – recirculating air just means the aerosols containing the virus move around the same room rather than being extracted outdoors. Ventilation units or any household systems that use outdoor air can be just as effective as opening windows or doors as long as they are limiting the recirculation of the same air.”The coronavirus is spread through the air by droplets and smaller particles - known as aerosols - that are exhaled from the nose and mouth of an infected person as they breathe, speak or cough. They behave in a similar way to smoke, but are invisible.The majority of virus transmissions happen indoors. Being indoors, with no fresh air, the particles can remain suspended in the air for hours and build up over time. The longer people spend time in the same room in the presence of these particles, the more likely they could become infected, the officials added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-ventilate-open-windows-to-cut-risk-advises-uk-government/story-f749yEGzTyxV7xytHgbfHK.html
19-11-2020||India||India, EU condemn the use of proxies for cross-border terror||New Delhi In an indirect reference to Pakistan, India and the European Union on Thursday called on all nations to take immediate and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under their control is used for terrorist attacks on other countries. The virtual counter-terrorism dialogue between the EU and India also strongly condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations, including the “use of terrorist proxies for cross-border terrorism”, according to a joint statement. Without naming Pakistan, the joint statement said the two sides “reviewed threats posed by UN-sanctioned terrorist entities and emphasised the need for concerted action against all terrorist networks”. The statement added: “They also underlined the urgent need for all countries to take immediate, sustained and irreversible action to ensure that no territory under their control is used for terrorist attacks on other countries.” India and EU are currently negotiating a working arrangement between Europol and the Central Bureau of Investigation to support law enforcement authorities on both sides in preventing and combating organised crime and terrorism. The two sides sought stronger international cooperation to combat terrorism in a comprehensive and sustained manner, and said it is crucial to bring perpetrators of violence and terrorism to justice. “India condemned the recent terror attacks in the member states of the European Union and expressed condolences to the families of the victims. The EU reiterated its condemnation of terrorist attacks in India, including 26/11 Mumbai, Pathankot and Pulwama, and reiterated its support for the people and government of India in the fight against terrorism,” the joint statement said. The two sides described counter-terrorism cooperation as an important element of the EU-India strategic partnership, and discussed the need to work together at multilateral forums such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Global Counterterrorism Forum and the UN, including the UN High-Level Counter-terrorism Week 2021 and the upcoming review of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. They also exchanged views on counter-terrorism challenges, including radicalisation and violent extremism, terror financing, and terrorist use of the internet. “The participants also discussed sanctions as a tool to combat terrorism, including designations of certain terrorist groups and individuals. They discussed ways to deepen cooperation between Indian Agencies and their European counterparts, including Europol, to enhance interaction in the sphere of counter-terrorism,” the joint statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-condemn-the-use-of-proxies-for-cross-border-terror/story-K5ipY18T2uid99eNUxo7GJ.html

19-11-2020||India||India, US natural partners, will advance Indo-Pacific’s security: Foreign secretary Shringla||India and the US have the shared objective of advancing the security and economic interests of all countries with a legitimate stake in the Indo-Pacific region, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said on Thursday. Shringla’s remarks, made during a virtual interaction with the US India Strategic Partnership Forum, set the stage for New Delhi’s engagement with the incoming Joe Biden administration. External affairs minister S Jaishankar has already said India will face no problems in taking forward ties with the US under the Biden administration because of strong bipartisan support for the relationship. The foreign secretary highlighted the shared values that make India and the US natural partners for forging a stable, peaceful and prosperous 21st century, including mutual trust, a shared commitment to democracy and converging strategic interests. “India and the US have collectively affirmed the importance of maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, with firm support for Asean centrality. Our objective remains advancing the security and economic interests of all countries having a legitimate stake in the Indo-Pacific region,” said Shringla, who served as envoy to the US before taking over as foreign secretary at the beginning of this year. “It is my firm conviction that India-US ties are only going to get stronger. I am sure all of you present here today share my optimism,” he added. Shringla pointed to steps being taken by members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad – which brings together India, Australia, Japan and the US – to combat Covid-19 and build resilient supply chains and said New Delhi sees Washington as a natural partner for building a resilient economy. “We are meeting today at an interesting time when the US is transitioning towards a new administration. One of the remarkable features of our bilateral ties is the strong bipartisan support in the US to strengthen its strategic partnership with India and work together on addressing global challenges,” he said. “We look forward to working with the new US administration for further strengthening and consolidating this multifaceted relationship for our mutual benefit and economic prosperity.” Shringla listed post-Covid-19 recovery and climate change as two key areas for future cooperation with the US. As a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council from next year, India will work with the US to seek collective solutions for the post-Covid world and reformed multilateralism, he said. The India-US 2+2 dialogue of foreign and defence ministers last month had focused on a coordinated Covid-19 response and economic recovery, and both sides had decided to promote access to an affordable Covid-19 vaccine, he said. Both sides also agreed to boost supply chain resilience and to expand bilateral trade, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-natural-partners-will-advance-indo-pacific-s-security-foreign-secretary-shringla/story-GmWAmonfIRj5gMjba4vTzJ.html
19-11-2020||India||EU seeks early meeting of mechanism to discuss trade agreement with India||The European Union (EU) has sought an early meeting for a new high-level mechanism with India to take forward discussions on a trade and investment agreement, Indian officials said on Thursday. The two sides had agreed to set up the high-level mechanism during the India-EU Summit in July. The EU’s trade commissioner raised the matter with the Indian side and discussions are underway to have a meeting of the mechanism soon, said joint secretary (Europe West) Sandeep Chakravorty of the external affairs ministry. “Today, the sub-commission on India-EU trade has met and there is forward movement. This high-level mechanism will take on the task of starting the negotiations on the India-EU trade and investment agreement,” he told reporters during a briefing after the India-Luxembourg Summit. External affairs minister S Jaishankar had said on Wednesday that India is interested in a fair and balanced free trade pact with EU. The virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Luxembourg counterpart Xavier Bettel – the first such interaction between the two sides in almost 20 years – focused on strengthening ties in the post-Covid-19 world, especially in financial technology, green financing, space applications and digital innovations. The two sides signed three agreements – a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the India International Exchange and Luxembourg Stock Exchange for cooperation in financial services and green finance, a MoU between the State Bank of India and Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and a MoU between Invest India and Luxinnovation to promote and facilitate FDI. Given Luxembourg’s role as a founding member of EU, Modi and Bettel also discussed the proposed trade and investment agreement with the European states. They also discussed cooperation on effective and reformed multilateralism, terrorism and climate change, Chakravorty said. Modi welcomed Luxembourg’s announcement to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and invited it to join the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). The two countries are also looking to sign an agreement between their space agencies. The two sides currently cooperate in satellite broadcasting and communications, and the launch of the PSLV-C49 on November 7 included four satellites from Luxembourg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eu-seeks-early-meeting-of-mechanism-to-discuss-trade-agreement-with-india/story-mm0zmCwLXAEIsbMTaYPLdP.html

This will be the third summit this month after the meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping where Modi and President Xi Jinping will share the same online platform amid the India-China border standoff. Saudi Arabia is the current chair of G20, and India is set to take over the presidency in 2022. India will enter the G20 troika with Saudi Arabia when Italy takes over the G20 presidency on December 1. The theme for this year’s summit is “Realising the opportunities of the 21st century for all”. “The focus of the upcoming G20 Summit, being held amid the Covid-19 pandemic, will be on an inclusive, resilient and sustainable recovery from Covid-19,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said on Thursday. “During the summit, the leaders will discuss pandemic preparedness and ways and means to restore jobs. The leaders will also share their vision for building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future.” This is the second meeting of the G20 leaders this year, after the extraordinary leaders’ summit held in March to discuss measures to contain the pandemic and to forge a coordinated global response. Saudi Arabia said in a statement on Thursday that the pandemic has revealed vulnerabilities in the capacity to prevent, detect and respond to pandemic threats worldwide. Vulnerable groups, including women, young people and low-income communities, have been disproportionately impacted, while the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative has benefited 46 low-income countries. G20 countries have injected more than $11 trillion to support the global economy and bridged the health funding gap with $21 billion to enhance pandemic preparedness and response, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-to-join-g20-summit-during-nov-21-22/story-eSsZhk3nGqUKVtPUAxOFbO.html

South Goa reported over 25 cases of jellyfish related accidents requiring immediate first aid,” Drishti Marine, said in a statement. Jellyfish stings while usually treatable with menial first aid can also on occasion produce allergic reactions or leave the stung portion swollen or itching for days. “In one particular incident which occurred in Baga, a male who went parasailing developed chest pain and experienced breathing difficulty after being stung by a jellyfish. As he was short of breath, oxygen was administered while an ambulance was called for and the victim was rushed to the hospital,” the agency said. Jellyfish are of two kinds - toxic and non-toxic. Most jellyfish stings are harmless to humans and cause only mild irritation but in very rare cases jellyfish species can cause harm on contact.Jellyfish stingings have been rare occurrences but off late are being reported with increasing frequency along the coast. Drishti lifesavers posted along the beach were inundated with first aid cases related to jellyfish stings.Goa’s beaches were thrown open for tourists after the lockdown ended and the monsoons receded making the waters safer for bathing. In the recent past, sightings of the Portuguese man-o-war more commonly known as the bluebottle jellyfish have been sighted but more common jellyfish often remain undetected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jellyfish-swarms-invade-goa-beaches-sting-over-90-bathers/story-sJu4qgNAS5Cm9gsVQEDnmO.html

19-11-2020||India||India, China to hold another round of talks soon on border standoff||India and China will soon hold another round of talks aimed at achieving complete disengagement and full restoration of peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the external affairs ministry said on Thursday. The border standoff along the LAC in Ladakh where both sides have deployed tens of thousands of troops backed by artillery and armoured vehicles, has entered its seventh month. Recent reports had suggested the two sides are considering several proposals for thinning troops at some friction points but are yet to make a breakthrough. The eighth round of talks between senior military commanders of the two sides, which was held in Chushul on November 6, was also joined by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry. “The objective of these discussions is to ensure complete disengagement and full restoration of peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the western sector,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing. “We will continue our dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels and have also agreed to have another round of talks soon with a view to achieve this objective,” he added. Srivastava described discussions during last round of talks between the military commanders as “candid, in-depth and constructive” and said both sides had exchanged views on “disengagement at all friction points along the LAC in the western sector”. There were expectations that the ninth round of talks between the military commanders would be held last week but the two sides are yet to finalise dates for the meeting. With no signs of an immediate breakthrough in efforts to pull back troops, both India and China have made preparations for their forces to remain in place along the LAC by building new accommodation to protect them from the harsh winter, when temperatures plummet as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius. The top Indian and Chinese leadership have participated in several virtual meetings this month, including the summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping, and the Indian side called for respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of states. The Indian leaders also emphasised the importance of a rules-based order at these meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-another-round-of-talks-soon-on-border-standoff/story-o7EeC4Ep2NsG4ePyoKtIZJ.html

19-11-2020||India||LeT founder Hafiz Saeed sentenced in two more cases of terror financing||A Pakistani court on Thursday handed down Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed, blamed by India for masterminding the 2008 Mumbai attacks, and two close aides prison sentences totalling ten-and-a-half years in two cases of terror financing. Besides Saeed, the others sentenced by the anti-terrorism court in Lahore are Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) leaders Zafar Iqbal and Yahya Mujahid, who served as JuD’s spokesman for many years. All three have been sanctioned by the UN Security Council. Hafiz is also the founder of the JuD.Saeed’s brother-in-law Abdul Rehman Makki, also a top leader of JuD, was given a six-month sentence in the same cases. Saeed, currently serving a prison term in connection with other terror financing cases, was produced for the sentencing by anti-terrorism court judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta. Saeed was given two separate five-year prison terms under provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act for using and providing funds for acts of terrorism. He was also given a six-month prison term for being a member of a banned group. The judge ordered the seizure of Saeed’s “movable and immovable property” and directed him to pay fines totalling Pakistani Rs 110,000. All three sentences will run concurrently. Since Saeed is already in jail serving two sentences of five-and-a-half-years given to him in February, he will not serve any extra jail time. “Since the convict has already been convicted...by this court vide judgment dated 12.02.2020, so the punishment awarded to him in this case shall also run concurrently with punishment in said cases,” the court’s order said. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the sentencing of Saeed was largely due to pressure on Pakistan from Western powers and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to crack down on terror groups and terror financing, including prosecution of those funnelling funds to terrorists. The people added Saeed’s conviction in four separate cases this year could be an indication the military establishment no longer considers him an asset. Virtually all of Saeed’s top aides have been arrested and put on trial, and there are indications that they are no longer playing a role in directing LeT’s operations. “It appears that LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, who was arrested for the Mumbai attacks and later released on bail in 2015, is the main person directing the operations,” said one of the people cited above. Lakhvi’s current whereabouts are not known. A total of 41 cases were registered against Saeed and his aides by Punjab Police after he was arrested in July 2019. Of these cases, two were decided on Thursday, bringing the tally of cases decided so far to 24. The rest are still being heard by anti-terrorism courts. Saeed and his aides are being held in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to Saeed’s sentencing. Asked about Pakistan-backed terror groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir at a weekly news briefing, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India had protested against Pakistan’s “continued support to cross-border terrorist infiltration into India” and reminded Islamabad of its bilateral commitment to now allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism. Srivastava also the “incessant infiltration of terrorists and induction of weapons to fuel terror activities continues unabated” and these activities weren’t possible without the support of Pakistani forces deployed along the Line of Control (LoC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/let-founder-hafiz-saeed-sentenced-in-two-more-cases-of-terror-financing/story-mqc8hqmIYfwT6KYgp4vwtL.html
19-11-2020||India||HTLS 2020: ‘Wanted to be prepared for a pandemic ever since heard Bill Gates’ TED talk,’ says Poonawalla||Adar Poonawalla, chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India, said that he wanted to be prepared for a “pandemic level event” ever since he heard Bill Gates in a TED talk. Poonawalla’s comments came during the second session of the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit; Day 1, ‘Covid-19: Where Do We Stand’.“I wanted to be prepared for a pandemic level event ever since I heard Bill Gates in a TED talk where he clearly said that we should be more worried and prepared for such situations,” Poonawalla told HT’s health and science editor, Sanchita Sharma, on Thursday. WATCH | How long to control Covid-19 pandemic? Top doctors respond on #HTLS2020 Poonawalla was referring to Gates’ moving TED Talk few years ago wherein he warned against the possible rise of an infectious disease, also pointing out the state of ill-preparedness against such an event. Also read: HTLS 2020 - Is India ready for another pandemic? AIIMS director Dr Guleria answers“If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles, but microbes. Now, part of the reason for this is that we’ve invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents. But we’ve actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic. We’re not ready for the next epidemic,” Gates had said. During the summit, Poonawalla shared that the Oxford vaccine will take about 3-4 months to be made available to the public and could cost between Rs 500-600. However, he said that it could take a few more years before every Indian is vaccinated and protected against the deadly virus. “It will be 2024, till everybody will get vaccinated and protected,” he noted. Speaking on the possible “side-effects” of the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, Poonawalla said, some of the mild symptoms that were noted across different age groups included, “fever, weakness, headache, normal cold”, which went away in a day or two after giving paracetamol, he said. The first session of Day 1 of the HT Leadership Summit saw Hindustan Times editor-in-chief Sukumar Ranganathan discuss the pandemic and its many aspects with Dr Randeep Guleria, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Dr Ashish K Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health. While Dr Guleria described India as a “resilient nation” in the face of the raging pandemic, he also called more investment in the public sector and involvement of healthcare professionals. Dr Jha, on the other hand, warned against the challenge of making the Covid-19 vaccine accessible to all. The experts also expressed delight and excitement over the breakthrough in Covid-19 vaccine recently reported by leading pharmaceutical giants Moderna and Pfizer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htls-2020-wanted-to-be-prepared-for-a-pandemic-ever-since-heard-bill-gates-ted-talk-says-poonawala/story-7oJa0RgnHZh1kDBn04mbrL.html
19-11-2020||India||Bihar grapples with rising cases of post-Covid complications||A majority of patients who recovered from Covid-19 are returning to the AIIMS-Patna, a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, with complaints of respiratory distress, a senior doctor at the facility said on Thursday. The AIIMS, which did an initial assessment of 92 patients since it initiated OPD service for post-Covid patients on September 25, found that 51% complained of shortness of breath, 38% of cough, 35.86% of weakness and 20% had fever till November 9. Some among them even had multiple complaints, said Dr Deependra Kumar Rai, head of the department of pulmonary medicine, AIIMS. Of those with respiratory distress, around 33% patients had post Covid interstitial lung disease (PC-ILD) and 13% had poor lung function, he said. “As many as 13% of the PC-ILD cases have post Covid pulmonary fibrosis, which is problematic for patients as it is believed to cause permanent damage to the lungs, affecting its expansion. Another 19.56% of patients are non-fibrotic, and their lung function is expected to recover over a period of time,” said Dr Rai. The AIIMS has advised PC-ILD patients to be on regular follow-up for the next six months to check for pulmonary fibrosis. “We will do their spirometry test to check the functioning of the lungs every two months and also run a CT scan of the chest to check for fibrosis, if it resolves with time,” he added. Dr Rai advocated breathing exercises and yoga for patients who had recovered from Covid-19. At least two-third of the patients, coming to the OPD of the pulmonary department at AIIMS-Patna, belonged to the 30-60 years age group, while 21% were less than 30 years old and 12% over 60 years of age. The average daily patient footfall had risen in the past fortnight. An average 12 to 13 patients were reporting every day to the OPD for consultation as compared to 2-4 initially, when the service was introduced, said Dr Rai. The Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), which was the other dedicated Covid-19 hospital in Patna, has seen lesser footfalls of post-Covid patients in its OPD. “We are in the process of collating post-Covid patient data. However, a negligible percentage has returned to our OPD clinic with post-Covid complications out of the nearly 2,000 Covid patients who survived after treatment at our hospital. This is a pointer to the fact that our patient recovery is good. Only about 5% to 6% severe pneumatic patients have come to us with complaints of shortness of breath after eight weeks of recovery from Covid,” said Dr Ajay Kumar Sinha, nodal officer for Covid-19 at NMCH. Out of its Covid-19 tally of 2,29,474, Bihar on Thursday reported 5,772 active cases while the death toll was at 1,209.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-grapples-with-rising-cases-of-post-covid-complications/story-8dy3QFSCQM5royuzKksleM.html

He was shifted to the Nanavati hospital for 15 days on the directions of the Bombay high court which noted that Rao was almost on his deathbed.“He is stable. At present, we are treating him for urinary tract infection. We are also running further diagnosis for his dementia. Until we get all the test reports, we cannot comment on his health. At present, he is admitted in the general ward without any oxygen support,” said the doctor from the hospital requesting anonymity since he is not authorised to talk to the media.The high court had instructed the state government on Wednesday to shift Rao from Taloja jail to Nanavati hospital. In July, Rao was treated at the state-run St George Hospital after he tested positive for Covid-19. During his treatment, he was diagnosed with neurological problems. Later when neurologists from the JJ Hospital examined him, he was diagnosed with delirium which is a state of mind characterized by restlessness, illusions, and incoherence.As the activist needed specialized neurological and urological treatment, he was shifted to Nanavati Hospital. Rao was arrested in 2018 and charged under the stringent anti-terror law Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Along with him, nine other activists were accused of plotting violence with Maoists and making provocative speeches at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/varavara-rao-being-treated-for-urinary-tract-infection-at-nanavati-hospital/story-c5i6t8hauafHG9hxduD6OI.html

In June of this year we did just that when my good friend Prime Minister Modi and I met virtually and signed a comprehensive strategic partnership it elevated our partnership,” Morrison said. In his video address to the the Bengaluru Tech Summit, 2020 (BTS2020), he said Australia and India have unlimited possibilities of working together in space research, critical minerals, 5G, AI, quantum computing and much more. “We have signed the landmark Australia India Technology Framework Agreement on cyber and cyber enabled technology. That means Australia and India are working together for an open, free, safe, and secure internet. That is the foundation for digital economies to work. We will be soon launching Australia-India Cyber and Critical Technologies Partnership grant program,” he added.Also Read | Time for tech solutions that are designed in India, but deployed for the world: PM Narendra Modi Organised by the Karnataka government along with Karnataka Innovation and Technology Society, the state government’s Vision Group on Information Technology, Biotechnology & Startup and Software Technology Parks of India, the summit that saw the inaugural address by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is scheduled to take place from November 19 to 21.

19-11-2020||India||Neither sacked by CM nor quit party, says rebel TMC minister after talks||Nine days after throwing a veiled challenge at the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leadership, West Bengal transport minister and heavyweight leader Suvendu Adhikari on Thursday sounded mellow at a rally and said neither has chief minister Mamata Banerjee sacked him from the cabinet nor has he left the party. “I am still an active primary member of the party. I am still a minister and part of the cabinet. Neither has the chief minister sacked me, nor have I quit on my own. I am here as long as the higher authorities don’t expel me or I leave,” Adhikari said at a big rally organised on the occasion of the 67th National Cooperative Week by various cooperative banks and organisations at Nandakumar in East Midnapore district. “Some people are expecting me to make a political statement today. I cannot do that. We hail from the land of Iswarchandra Vidyasagar,” said Adhikari, referring to the 19th century social reformer and educationist. “Political statements cannot be made while staying in the party and the cabinet. There can be differences and differences can lead to separation. But as long as I am in the party I cannot act irresponsibly,” said Adhikari. Senior TMC leaders told HT last week that Adhikari is particularly unhappy with organizational decisions taken by the chief minister’s nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor who was roped in after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. On November 10, Adhikari threw a veiled challenge at the party while addressing a public rally at Nandigram, his assembly constituency in East Midnapore. “Political observers are waiting for me to announce my political programme. They want to hear me talk about the roadblocks I am facing and the path I am going to take. I will not announce my political programme from this sacred platform. This is not the place. I will speak from a political platform,” said Adhikari. “I am not afraid of anyone. We will meet on the battlefield,” he added without naming anyone or even the TMC. Triggering speculations that he might join the BJP, Adhikari ended his short speech with the slogan “Bharat Mata Zindabad,” which appeared to be an improvisation on the Hindi slogan BJP leaders raise. The TMC hurriedly held a counter rally in Nandigram and urban development minister Firhad Hakim took pot shots at Adhikari without naming him. Two senior TMC Lok Sabha members, Saugata Roy and Sudip Bandopadhyay had been discreetly holding talks with the rebel minister since then. Even Kishor visited the minister’s father, Lok Sabha member Sisir Adhikari, last week and held a long discussion. Their efforts apparently had some effect. “I had a talk with Suvendu earlier this week. I have informed Mamata Banerjee about what transpired. She has given her initial reaction. I will have a word with Sudip and we will again talk to Suvendu next week. He told us that has not taken any decision on quitting the party,” Saugata Roy said on Thursday. Amid the TMC’s efforts to pacify Adhikari, the BJP made no bones of what it thinks about the situation. “What’s going on between the TMC and Adhikari and the language being used against him by some of the leaders cannot exactly be described as a honeymoon,” quipped state BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neither-sacked-by-cn-nor-quit-party-says-rebel-tmc-minister-after-talks/story-GgZT6YcGzReAVAkY1gF0qM.html

Armed forces and security personnel constitute 45% of the state’s Covid-19 tally.The official said that amid fears of new infections rising during the winter, the state’s health department along with the support of all the government agencies is preparing itself with all the available resources to face any surge in Covid-19 cases.Dr. Kikon said it was too early to say if the reason for the recent spike in cases was due to recent festivities. “We need credible evidence. We cannot simply attribute the rise in the number of cases to the festivals or weddings or any such events that took place recently,” he said.Earlier this week, the government sealed the secretariat for 48 hours for preventive measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in workplace settings.As of Thursday, Nagaland’s Covid-19 tally stands at 10,460 out of 1,07,276 samples that have been tested. The death toll in the pandemic is 48.According to the health and family welfare department data, 8,955 people have recovered so far and there are 1,251 active cases now.According to the health department’s data, traced contacts make up 29% of the total cases while returnees and travellers constitute 21% while 5% are frontline workers. Nagaland’s positivity rate of 9.3% continues to be higher than the national average although the state has maintained a good recovery rate, which has crossed almost 90%.Households (31%) and workplaces (24%) are stated to be the most common places of infection among traced contacts.“The state data of high household contacts clearly points toward living-room-spread and is a reason why Covid-19 cases are increasing. We should now pay attention to the peril of small gatherings among family and friends who may appear healthy, especially with the festive season around the corner,” the health department said in its last weekly bulletin.It also underscored the danger of community spread linked to super spreader events such as festivities and weddings. “The danger of undetected transmission which will surface weeks later with cases and deaths after such events need to be taken into account,” the bulletin pointed out. While some events like weddings are unavoidable, the department officials advised that the organizers should ensure all safety measures are enforced.They emphasized that the key is early and timely intervention of the limited treatments available.“The treatment available for Covid-19 is very limited but the timing of interventions like oxygen, steroids, antivirals etc is extremely crucial,” officials stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-surge-in-nagaland-due-to-increased-testing-say-health-authorities/story-6qzEuEzoa2eqHGlbAextnK.html
19-11-2020||India||HTLS 2020: ‘Thrilled with Covid-19 vaccine leap,’ says Brown University expert||This year’s Hindustan Times Leadership Summit started with a session on Covid-19 and saw Dr Randeep Guleria, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and Dr Ashish K Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, talk about the deadly contagion and raging pandemic that has gripped the planet for nearly a year now. The opening session of the summit, ‘Covid-19: Where Do We Stand’, saw both Guleria and Jha converge their learning from working amid the pandemic, the challenges and the road ahead for India. How long does Covid immunity last? Brown University’s Dr Jha explains #HTLS2020Jha was first to respond to Hindustan Times editor-in-chief, Sukumar Ranganathan’s query on the two big Covid-19 vaccine breakthroughs that came the past week and said he was, “thrilled, happy and delighted” by the developments. “I have been very pleasantly surprised with what we are seeing with vaccines. Two or three weeks ago, I would have been happy with vaccines around 60 per cent effective, I dared not hope for 70 per cent and yet we have two vaccines, one from Moderna, one from Pfizer, that have both shown to be 95 per cent effective. That is incredible,” Jha said. Also read: HTLS 2020 - Challenges and opportunities of new era in national securityJha, however, pointed out that getting billions around the world vaccinated will be a challenge to tackle. “We must not underestimate those challenges but we must still celebrate the scientific breakthrough and this good news,” Jha added. The theme of this year’s virtual edition is ‘Defining a New Era’ as the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. The live discussions with leaders across sectors will be spread over four weeks and will be held every Thursday and Friday.Started in the year 2003, the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit aims to raise the level of discourse on critical issues, encourage interaction among leaders in important areas and present quality thought. The last seventeen summits witnessed leaders from India and across the world participating, exchanging their views and ideas for a better world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/htls-2020-brown-university-s-dean-dr-ashish-k-jha-on-moderna-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-breakthrough/story-5fRyFjmeBrkBbJEcFK8oQJ.html

19-11-2020||India||Congress cracks whip on dissenters, Jharkhand leader issued show-cause notice for remarks against Rahul Gandhi, RPN Singh||Cracking the whip on dissenters, the Congress in Jharkhand on Thursday issued a show-cause notice to senior leader Furqan Ansari for criticising Rahul Gandhi and the party’s state in-charge RPN Singh, people aware of the matter said. Ansari, a former Lok Sabha member from Godda in Jharkhand, had questioned Rahul Gandhi’s campaigning in Bihar. He also claimed that the people working in Rahul Gandhi’s office and his advisors were mainly MBA graduates. “As a result, they are not able to give him the right advice or suggest key talking points for his campaign speeches. To strengthen the Congress, it is important for Rahul Gandhi to have a political advisor,” he said. Ansari’s son Irfan is currently a legislator from Jamtara. Also Read: Cong rumblings grow, PC seeks bypoll show reviewAnsari, 72, also said that he will write to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and seek major overhaul in the party organisation. Ansari also attacked Jharkhand in-charge RPN Singh. “If I were at the helm, I would have not appointed him (Singh) even a block president,” he said. There were demands from state leaders for strict action against Ansari to send a “stern message” to dissenters. Acting on requests from several leaders, the party’s Jharkhand working president Kamlesh Mahto Kamlesh issued the show-cause notice to Ansari on behalf of state unit chief Rameshwar Oraon who is undergoing treatment for Covid-19. In the notice, Ansari has been asked to explain his remarks within seven days. “Your statements to the media against Rahul Gandhi and RPN Singh have hurt the statements of party workers. There is an established norm in the party that no Congress leader will give press statements against the leadership. You have violated that norm,” the notice said. Differences in the Congress have surfaced again after the results of assembly elections in Bihar and bypolls in several states, including Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal spoke out publicly and insisted that the Congress needs efficient and senior leaders to manage elections. Sibal, a former union minister and one of the 23 signatories to a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in August this year seeking internal elections and organisational overhaul, questioned the leadership on the poll debacle and asked if it was “business as usual”. The remarks triggered a war of words within the Congress as Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot countered Sibal and claimed that his remarks have “hurt the sentiments” of workers and reminded him that the party had been through crises several times in the past. On Tuesday, senior Congress leader and former union minister Salman Khurshid, too, took a dig at Sibal. In a Facebook post, Khurshid said if the mood of the electorate is resistant to the liberal values the party has espoused and cherished, it should be prepared for a long struggle rather than look for shortcuts to get back in power. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also claimed that the party’s performance in the assembly elections in Bihar and bypolls in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka show that there is either “no organisational presence on the ground, or it has weakened considerably”. In an interview to Dainik Bhaskar, former union finance minister Chidambaram said that the Congress fought more seats in Bihar than its organisational strength, and called for a “comprehensive review” of the poll results. He added, however, that he was “more worried” about the by-election results. As part of the Mahagathbandhan, or Grand Alliance, the Congress contested 70 seats but managed to win just 19, impacting the Opposition’s chances of ousting the ruling coalition from power; it won just nine of the 28 seats in Madhya Pradesh, and failed to open its account in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Manipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-cracks-whip-on-dissenters-jharkhand-leader-issued-show-cause-notice-for-remarks-against-rahul-gandhi-rpn-singh/story-BRSFA5FfJ6DZT3iAyGUxyL.html

19-11-2020||India||Andhra govt claims over 2 lakh students opted out of pvt schools to join govt ones in last 1 year||The Andhra Pradesh government has claimed that more than two lakh students studying in various private schools across the state have moved to government schools in the last one year. According to the statistics released by the chief minister’s office, the total number of students enrolled with the state government and government-aided schools till now was 42.46 lakh, which is 2.68 lakh more than the enrolment figure from 2019, which stood at 39.78 lakh. “The most encouraging part of this enrolment in the last one year is that out of these 2.68 lakh students, as many as 2,01,833 students were from various private schools. They opted out of private schools and got enrolled in government schools,” the CMO release said. It pointed out that in the past, parents used to withdraw their children from government schools and admit them in private schools due to lack of proper infrastructure and academic standards. “The reforms undertaken by the present government in the education sector in the last one year were aimed at reversing this very trend by uplifting the standard of education imparted in government schools. Statistics reveal that the government’s efforts in this direction have yielded excellent results,” the CMO claimed. It said since June 2019, the government had introduced several student and parent-oriented schemes like Jagananna Ammavodi, Nadu-Nedu and Jaganna Vidya Kanuka, that helped government schools to develop at par with corporate schools. Under the Jagananna Ammavodi scheme, mothers sending her children to government schools are being paid Rs 15,000, till the student completes Class 12. “This incentive has encouraged parents to send their children to schools rather than engaging them in labour to earn extra income,” the CMO release said. Under the Nadu-Nedu scheme, the government has undertaken revamping over 45,000 schools in the state to provide students and teachers with the best possible atmosphere. Apart from major infrastructural renovations, each of the schools will also be equipped with a dedicated English lab in order to facilitate modern learning. In the first phase, 15,715 schools were spruced up and it will be completed by January, 2021, it said. Similarly, under the Jagananna Vidya Kanuka scheme, all students are supplied with uniforms, a school bag, books, socks, a belt and other necessities. This not only reduces the financial turmoil that poor families are put through at the beginning of each academic year but also helps the government control dropout rates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-govt-claims-over-2-lakh-students-opted-out-of-pvt-schools-to-join-govt-ones-in-last-1-year/story-D8x6O8Ye4FCjmilwLpR9RN.html

19-11-2020||India||Congress cold to Harish Rawat’s promise of free power, water in Uttarakhand||The Congress unit in Uttarakhand has distanced itself from the promise of former chief minister Harish Rawat that the government will provide 25 litres of drinking water and 100 to 200 units of electricity free every month to people in the state if the party comes to power in the 2022 assembly polls. The cold reception seemed to highlight the friction in the Uttarakhand unit of the Congress despite Rawat’s standing as a major leader.Harish Rawat, who is also a Congress national general secretary and party’s in-charge for Punjab, said he had made the announcement of free power and drinking water to people given the robust power generation network which has been developed in the state over the years and good availability of water resources in the Himalayan state. “I am firm on my stand as we have the capacity to provide free electricity in the range of 100 to 200 units. Our power distribution and generation capacity has developed over the years to the extent that we can provide it to people free to some extent. In case of drinking water supply, with the hill state having good water sources, we can provide 25 litres of pure water daily to each family free of charge. All this is possible”, he said. When questioned about the Congress leadership saying that it is not the party’s stand and the poll manifesto is yet to be prepared, Rawat said, “Ideas are first floated and then made part of the manifesto. In this case also, I will present it before the party, discuss it with them, so that these could be made part of the manifesto,” he said. The Congress unit in the state has distanced itself from Rawat’s stand, emphasising that the party has not yet discussed the issue.Pritam Singh, Congress state president said Rawat is a senior leader of the party who has come up with this idea. “But as a party president in the state, I can tell you it is not the party stand, nor has the party come up with a manifesto yet. As the idea has been floated, in the coming time we will discuss it in the party and take appropriate action,” he said. Suryakant Dhasmana, Congress vice president in Uttarakhand cautioned against unrealistic promises.“Our poll manifesto committee will decide what promises the party needs to make. The party will discuss this idea also, but we have to ensure making only such promises, which the party can fulfil in future. Otherwise, it will be very embarrassing for the party”, he said The ruling BJP was unsparing in criticising Rawat for the promising free power and water.Bansidhar Bhagat, state BJP president said Congress is expert at making empty slogans, aimed at misleading people, especially when the elections are near.“The state is not in a position to do such things at present. Congress is desperate and it is showing. I want to ask Harish Rawat what he has done for the state when he was in power. Now, he is making empty promises to the people. Congress needs to do some introspection first”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-cold-to-harish-rawat-s-promise-of-free-power-water-in-uttarakhand/story-kxMK5U7ffC56F6QZK4kk5O.html

Bhutan, meanwhile, secured 48th rank with a score of 37, the data showed.“China has potentially helped to reduce opportunities for bribe demands by public officials by continuing to streamline its bureaucracy,” TRACE Bribery Risk Matrix said in a statement.Apart from India, Peru, Jordan, North Macedonia, Colombia and Montenegro also have a score of 45 in the matrix.Somalia moved out of the bottom ranking, which it held from 2017 to 2019, and is now ranked 187th out of 194.The TRACE Bribery Risk Matrix said it measures the likelihood of bribe demands in 194 jurisdictions. It was originally published in 2014 to meet a need in the business community for more reliable, nuanced information about the risks of commercial bribery worldwide.The matrix aggregates relevant data obtained from leading public interest and international organisations, including the United Nations, World Bank, V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg and World Economic Forum.This data helps companies to assess the likely risk of bribe demands in each country and to design compliance and due diligence programs tailored to that risk, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-ranks-77-in-global-bribery-risk-matrix/story-DSkKY8L1Qy95gvusKXIpUO.html
19-11-2020||India||Kerala police begin probe into leaked voicemail of gold smuggling accused||The Kerala police on Thursday ordered a probe after Swapna Suresh, the main accused in Kerala gold smuggling case, in a purported voicemail claimed that the Enforcement Directorate was pressuring her to name chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the racket with inducement to make her an approver.The voicemail was released by a web portal Thursday morning and was soon shared widely. Suresh also alleged that the ED forced to sign her statement and did not allow her to read it. Shortly after the voicemail began trending and sparked a controversy, Director General of Police (Jail) Rishiraj Singh ordered a probe into the incident.Deputy inspector general of police Ajay Kumar who is investigating the new development said Swapna Suresh has agreed that it was her voice but he said it was not sent from the jail . During questioning, she reportedly told the official that she did not exactly remember when she said this. Booked under Cofeposa (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act) she is now lodged in the women’s jail in Thiruvananthapuram. Earlier another accused in the case, M Sivasankar, senior bureaucrat and the CM’s former secretary, also made a similar allegation in the court. The ED had denied it. A senior official who is part of the multi-agency probe said it was a tactic to pressurise central agencies. The CPI(M) state secretariat released a statement saying the central agencies were keen to implicate the CM’s office in the smuggling case and the party will oppose the move.Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedhran also waded into the latest row and called it a drama enacted by the CM’s office. “The CM lauded the central agencies all these day but turned against them when it started probing his office also,” he said.The opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the voicemail was a move to sabotage the ongoing investigation into the gold smuggling case and sought a high-level probe into it. Two days ago, BJP state president K Surendran had alleged that many people were meeting Suresh in the jail and sought the list of people who met Suresh in the jail since she was lodged there in the second week of October. “The CM’s office is behind the latest development,” said Congress unit’s chief Mullapally Ramachandran. He also said that Vijayan was scoring a self-goal as the investigation was about to reach him. Two weeks ago, C M Raveendran, another secretary of the chief minister was summoned by the ED but could not appear after he had tested positive for Covid-19. Raveendran is reported to be very close to the CM. The gold smuggling case surfaced on July 5 after 30 kg of yellow metal was seized by the Customs from a package camouflaged as diplomatic consignment addressed to the UAE consulate.Later P S Sarith Kumar, a former public relations officer of the consulate who came to receive the baggage, was arrested by the customs. Two other suspects, Swapna Suresh and her accomplice Sandip Nair, were arrested from their hideout in Bengaluru five days later by the National Investigation Agency. Senior bureaucrat Sivasankar was suspended after his alleged links with Suresh surfaced. Five central agencies are probing the case in which 36 people were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-police-begin-probe-into-leaked-voicemail-of-gold-smuggling-accused/story-M79RdVjJJomq9ayeDNjkKM.html

This new category will be called ‘Wards of Covid Warriors’, the minister said in a tweet. A press release by the ministry said that five central pools will be reserved for this new category. Vardhan said the move recognises the need to dignify and honour the contributions of all those who treated and managed coronavirus patients. The minister recounted definition of ‘Covid Warrior’ as laid down by Government of India while announcing the insurance package of Rs 50 lakhs for them. Covid warriors are all public healthcare providers including community health workers, who may have to be in direct contact and care of Covid-19 patients and who may be at risk of being impacted by this. Private hospital staff and retired/volunteer/ local urban bodies/ contracted/ daily wage/ ad-hoc/ outsourced staff requisitioned by States/ Central hospitals/ autonomous hospitals of Central/ States/UTs, AIIMS and Institutes of National Importance (INIs)/ hospitals of Central Ministries drafted for Covid-19 related responsibilities are all included, going by government definition.As for the states and union territories, Vardhan added that their respective governments will certify the eligibility for this category.The selection of candidates will be made by the Medical Council Committee (MCC) through online application on the basis of rank obtained in NEET-2020 conducted by National Testing Agency(NTA).India’s coronavirus caseload has risen to 89.58 lakh with fresh 45,576 infections, while the number of recoveries has surged to over 83.83 lakh pushing the national recovery rate to 93.58 per cent, according health ministry data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quota-for-covid-warriors-children-in-mbbs-bds-admission/story-8HxijHtQ24o8FKs5jmoEwI.html

You can protect yourself from this deadly virus with small precautions like wearing a good quality mask properly, maintaining social distance, respiratory etiquette, and taking care of hand-hygiene”“Only 10% is therapeutic” he addedWhile lauding the country’s efforts at tackling the coronavirus pandemic, which he said started on 8th of january, and is now in the 11th month he said that the “government has acted in a proactive manner, with a pre-emptive strategy and a graded response” Vardhan termed the country and the government’s efforts to tackle the ongoing menace as bold. Adding that whatever steps were needed at every critical juncture was taken fearlessly by the government. “We surveilled lakhs of people at airports, sea ports, and land borders.”Calling the junta curfew an “unique innovative experiment with voluntary participation of everyone in the country” he stated that both lockdowns and unlock both were equally bold decisions handled by the government. Talking about the contribution of the Indian scientific community Vradhan said “The scientific community also rose to the occasion. The scientists produced new types of ventilators. Initially we had problems with PPEs, N95 masks, and within a few months we were able to export them”“I confidently tell people that a couple of months from now we will be able to deliver the vaccination to the people of India” he added.Vardhan mentioned that the swabs of coronavirus tests used to earlier go to America’s Center for Disease Control and Pollution(CDC) because India had only one lab testing facility in pune, but as of 8 in the morning India has established 2116 labs established in every nook and corner of the country.Vardhan stated that all these just goes on to prove that when India decides to do something it can do it.India’s coronavirus caseload has risen to 89.58 lakh with fresh 45,576 infections, while the number of recoveries has surged to over 83.83 lakh pushing the national recovery rate to 93.58 per cent, according health ministry data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/90-99-of-covid-19-is-about-protection-and-motivating-others-harsh-vardhan/story-43qsygZW2hk6zN5g3JhxHK.html
19-11-2020||India||Rice procurement up 18%, as government seeks to calm farmer protests||The Union government has procured 28.6 million tonnes of paddy, the main summer staple, which is 18.6% higher than last year, with Punjab’s share being the highest at nearly 70%, according to the food ministry’s data as on November 17. The government has paid a minimum support price (MSP) value of Rs54,147 crore so far to nearly 2.7 million farmers in key rice-growing states, such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh. Punjab alone has contributed over 19.6 million tonnes, which is 69.7% of the total procurement. Last year, till November 17, the government had procured 24.1 million tonnes of paddy. Production of kharif or summer crops this year is likely to be a record 144.5 million tonnes, marginally higher than the 143.4 million tonnes produced during the kharif season of 2019-20, according to an official forecast. Higher output, buoyed by a robust monsoon, is one of the reasons behind higher procurement this year. Also Read: Delhi congress leaders take out tractor yatra against farm lawsThe Union government is on course to buy a record quantity of paddy this year to also blunt the politically sensitive farmers’ agitation against a set of laws enacted to liberalise the agriculture sector. Farmers protesting the laws fear the reforms will erode their bargaining power and lead to a collapse of the procurement system, referring to the government’s assured buying of farm produce at federally fixed prices. The food ministry’s official projections show that the government’s total procurement for summer paddy (2020-21) will touch 74.2 million tonnes, up from 62.7 million tonnes procured during 2019-20, an increase of 18%. The food ministry has expanded its procurement operations for summer-sown crops to cover an estimated 10.5 million paddy growers, against last year’s 10.2 million. The government has also raised the number of paddy-purchase centres by 27%, which now stands at 39,122, up from 30,709 last year. Managing the stock might become difficult owing to higher procurement unless the government offloads more as food grants to the poor, according to Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm. From April to November 2020, the government has made additional offerings of free food under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY), launched after the Covid-19 outbreak. This has freed up storage capacities of bulging state-held granaries and made way for higher paddy procurement. The total allocation under the PMGKY is 32.1 million tonnes. This included 21.4 million tonnes of rice and 10.6 million tonnes of wheat. Total federally held food stocks as on September 1, 2020, stood at 77.3 million tonnes, up from 71.2 million tonnes on the same date last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rice-procurement-up-18-as-government-seeks-to-calm-farmer-protests/story-fyNszFbDR3Yc2yCTDfO3TO.html

BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi and Congress MP Vivek Tankha interrogated Twitter’s policy head. Reacting to this questioning, Kamra tweeted, “Personal liberty is like Promotions in corporate India...”Twitter, meanwhile, said it can’t remove the post unless the court issues such orders, Meenakshi Lekhi said. “We’ve asked for an answer in 7 days. Since there are no laws in India regarding these, we have to talk to the top executives of such service providers,” Meenakshi Lekhi said.On November 12, Attorney General K K Venugopal granted consent for initiation of contempt proceedings against stand-up comic artist Kunal Kamra for his tweets.“The tweets which I am extracting below are not only in bad taste but clearly cross the line between humour and contempt of the court”, said Venugopal.A day after, on November 13, a petition was Friday filed in the Supreme Court seeking initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against Kamra. The petition, filed by five petitioners including law student Shrirang Katneshwarkar, has claimed that Kamra had started publishing tweets on November 11 when the top court was hearing the appeal of journalist Arnab Goswami against the Bombay High Court’s order rejecting his plea seeking interim bail in the 2018 abetment to suicide case.Kamra had refused to retract his tweets and apologise.“The tweets I recently put out have been found in contempt of court. All that I tweeted was from my view of the Supreme Court of India giving a partial decision in favour of a Prime Time Loudspeaker,” he said in a statement addressed to Venugopal and the judges on his Twitter page. “My view hasn’t changed because the silence of the Supreme Court of India on matters of other’s personal liberty cannot go uncriticized. I don’t intend to retract my tweets or apologise for them. I believe they speak for themselves,” he had added.(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-no-action-against-kunal-kamra-s-tweets-parliamentary-panel-asks-twitter/story-JnFiaw5LHmqvLa0l8EWKAP.html
19-11-2020||India||Shiv Sena, NCP trying to destroy Congress in Maharashtra, says BJP’s Pravin Darekar||Maharashtra BJP leader Pravin Darekar on Thursday accused the ruling Shiv Sena and NCP of trying to destroy their ally Congress in the state by ignoring its demands.The Leader of Opposition in the state Legislative Council was here to campaign for BJP’s candidate from Pune graduates constituency- Sangram Deshmukh.“The MVA government has given a package to the state transport department that is headed by a Shiv Sena minister, but refused to give any relief to the energy ministry held by Congress’s Nitin Raut. Therefore, it is clear that the Shiv Sena and the NCP are trying to destroy the Congress party in Maharashtra,” Darekar said in a press conference.Earlier this month, Nitin Raut had hinted at a major relief to electricity consumers facing the issue of inflated power bills, saying that a Diwali gift was in the offing.However, the minister reportedly announced recently that the government will not be able to provide any relaxation in the inflated electricity bills that consumers received.Also Read | Fadnavis hits out at MVA government, calls it anti-developmentSpeaking about the minister’s statement, Darekar said, “It is an unfair decision...The government must give relief to the people.” He also alleged that the government has ignored the issues of employment and education.A day after BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis exuded confidence that his party will win the 2022 election to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Darekar said the Shiv Sena does not have the patent of the saffron flag and Hindutva.“We have raised many questions regarding the development work in Mumbai...It is true that people will decide whose saffron flag will be hoisted on BMC in the elections,” he said.The BMC is currently being ruled by the Sena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-ncp-trying-to-destroy-congress-in-maharashtra-says-bjp-s-pravin-darekar/story-MkbJvlBkno7sSo2I9wkB4O.html

19-11-2020||India||Congress seeks CBI probe into ‘multi-crore scams’ in Meghalaya Power Dept||The opposition Congress has demanded a CBI inquiry into the alleged multi-crore scams in the Meghalaya Power Department.It alleged there have been many irregularities and anomalies in the implementation of various projects that include the Asian Development Bank (ADB) funded smart metering project, Saubhagya Scheme and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), among others.“There have been scam after scam in the Power Department. We demand an independent inquiry by no less than the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to ensure that those involved be punished under the law of the land,” Congress spokesperson Zenith Sangma told reporters here on Wednesday.He criticised the Conrad Sangma government in the state for its “adamant attitude” in addressing the issue, which if rectified on time, could have saved “hundreds of crores of rupees” in the interest of the state.“If those in power are accused of involvement in corrupt practices, it is their duty to order an independent inquiry to prove the opposition’s allegations wrong,” the Rangsakona MLA said.The conditions in the tendering process for the smart metering project have been made in such a way to ensure only one bidder of their choice qualifies, he said.“Only one bidder has qualified for the work initially estimated to cost around Rs 200 crore. Later, an additional 18 per cent of the estimated cost was added which amounts to Rs 36 crore.“This draining of money is taking place due to lack of competition in the tendering process, which was done with predetermined and mala fide intention to ensure only one bidder gets qualified. This is a scam,” the Congress leader said.Also Read |  No-confidence motion against Conrad Sangma govt in Meghalaya defeatedIf more firms were allowed to participate in the bidding process, the estimated cost would not have been hiked by Rs 36 crore, he said.“This is happening at a time when the state is facing a huge financial crunch. The administration is unable to pay salaries to employees of different departments including MeECL (Meghalaya Energy Corporation Ltd) but money is getting drained out due to greed of a few,” Sangma said.The letter of allotment (LOA) of phase I and II of the DDU-GKY was revised by increasing the scope of work by Rs 30 crore without approval from the funding agency -- the Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd, he said.“The Centre-state ratio in the expenditure of the project is 85:15. So, the Meghalaya government has to shell out an additional Rs 4.5 crore with the enhancement of the cost of the project by Rs 30 crore,” he said.The estimated cost of the Ganol Small Hydro Power Project has been enhanced by Rs 151 crore. When the matter was raised during the Assembly’s autumn session, the government replied that it was due to some “geological surprise”, the Congress leader said.“Did the MeECL not do soil testing before preparing the DPR? When this question was raised, the government said it was somehow missed. Is it possible? “All work needed to be done underground has been completed. Only the superstructure is left. How can there be ‘geological surprises’ now? They are making different excuses to loot public money,” he said.In the Saubhagya Scheme, two firms from Delhi and Mumbai have been awarded the major work at 51 per cent more than the schedule of rate (SOR), due to which an additional Rs 180 crore expenditure will have to be incurred, while 100 local companies have been given minor service connection work at SOR, Sangma said.He also opposed the one-time settlement (OTS) given to various industries with regard to outstanding bills till March 31 this year.“Around 50 per cent of the Rs 700 crore outstanding power bills in the state are of the industries. Why should they be excluded from paying the dues?” he said.The state government, however, is yet to issue a reaction to the Congress demand for a CBI probe into the alleged scams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-seeks-cbi-probe-into-multi-crore-scams-in-meghalaya-power-dept/story-IkIL3A0jUWb1Mypku8288K.html
19-11-2020||India||After a brief lull, dissent over ILP is simmering again in Meghalaya||Blaming the government over its alleged failure to contain influx of outsiders into the state, several groups in Meghalaya have on Wednesday evening announced a series of agitational programs starting November 27 with a black flag protest by all its members. This will be followed by a sit-in protest in all district headquarters of the state on December 4.Demanding immediate implementation of the contentious Inner Line Permit (ILP) in Meghalaya, the groups intend to also mount pressure on the Central Government.A detailed meeting of the Confederation of Meghalaya Social Organizations (CoMSO) comprising of 14 pressure groups was held at the North-Eastern Hill University (NEHU) campus following which the chairman of the confederation, Robertjune Kharjahrin said, “We demand the Centre to immediately implement the ILP in the whole of Meghalaya and for the state government to re-introduce the Meghalaya residents, safety and security (amendment) bill, 2020, which was recently returned by the governor.”In November 2019, the state Cabinet had passed an ordinance amending the Meghalaya Residents Safety and Security Act, 2016, which would require visitors to register, akin to an ILP regime. This had eased the tension a bit but now the same is simmering to the brim.Kharjahrin today stressed that New Delhi has to respect the resolution passed by the state legislative assembly with regards to introducing a strong and effective law like the ILP. “The delay in implementing the ILP is a clear indication that there is total lack of political will on the part of the Centre and not that it needs time to examine the proposal,” he asserted.Also Read: Shillong Times editor quits Editors Guild, cites ‘discrimination’Expressing amazement that though CM Conrad Sangma and his deputy Prestone Tynsong along with state PHE minister Renikton Tongkhar had called on Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi, yet no mention was made whether ILP was discussed or not, the CoMSO chief further demanded that the state government and all 60 legislators should aggressively pursue with the Centre for immediate implementation of the ILP.Notably, the cry for ILP grew louder after the introduction of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) with a series of agitations affecting normalcy in this predominantly tribal state, leading to prohibitory orders and even suspension of internet services, a rare occurrence in this hill station. Most of Meghalaya comes under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, hence, exempted from the CAA.The state government was virtually steamrolled into adopting a resolution in the state legislative assembly on December 20, 2019, urging the central government to bring Meghalaya under the colonial-era regime.The resolution introduced by chief minister Conrad K Sangma was voted in favour of by all 60 legislators cutting across party lines in a day-long special session of the house while pressure groups continued demonstrating outside demanding immediate implementation of ILP, a decision that now still awaits the Central nod.

Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The Minister was addressing the FICCI FLO webinar on ‘The Shifting Healthcare Paradigm During and Post-Covid’ today. “I am confident that Covid-19 vaccine will be ready in the next three-four months. Priority for the vaccine will be designed on the basis of scientific data. Health care workers and corona warriors will naturally be prioritised followed by elderly and disease-prone people. Very detailed planning is underway for vaccine dissemination. An e-vaccine intelligence platform has been created to discuss the blueprint for the same. Tracking and tracing of the vaccine would be neck-deep once it’s available for the public. Hopefully, 2021 should be a better year for all of us,” the Health Minister said.Praising the efforts of the Central government, the Minister said some ‘very bold steps’ were taken to fight the pandemic in the last few months.“Janta curfew was a very innovative and unique experiment by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It had nationwide participation from the citizens. The decision to impose a lockdown followed by unlocking were some bold decisions by the central government during the pandemic. We have handled it very well,” the Minister said.“The government has been very proactive in its response towards this fight. Airports, seaports and land borders were put under surveillance for Covid-19 well in time,” he added.Giving an account of the journey of the last 11 months, the Minister said India was amongst the top countries to control the impact of the pathogen in a short duration.Also Read | AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot candidate shows promise among elderly in trials“Initially we faced a shortage of PPE kits, ventilators and N-95 masks.

In a couple of months, we should be able to produce a vaccine for the Covid-19 infection. Our performance has been excellent on every parameter set by the World Health Organisation, we have the highest recovery rate and the least fatality rate. We have 2,115 laboratories in every look and corner of the country for Covid tests. Over 20 lakh dedicated Covid beds are in place.

But there is leniency as well. We need to tighten the screws. The fine which was Rs 500 so far has been increased to Rs 2,000,” Kejriwal said, addressing a press meet after an all-party meet held to address the Covid-19 situation of the Capital. The government will also urge the hospitals to stall non-emergency operations so that Covid-19 patients get the maximum care, Kejriwal said. “If you have a tonsils operation, you can schedule it next month too as it is not emergency. We will request the hospitals in this regard,” the CM said. All private hospitals have been asked to reserve 80 per cent of their ICU beds and 60 per cent of non-ICU beds for Covid-19 patientsAlso Read:  ‘You were shaken out of slumber’: High Court raps Delhi govt over Covid-19 surge After the BJP blamed the AAP government — centering around the restrictions on Chhath Puja — for the present Covid-19 situation which breached all past records of daily infections and daily toll, Kejriwal said it is not time to indulge in politics. “ Why would I not want Delhi people to celebrate Chhath? It is an auspicious occasion and people should celebrate it but inside their house. Don’t gather outside at ponds and other waterbodies as it may cause a massive spread. I told all parties in the meet that it’s a difficult time for the people of Delhi when Covid-19 cases are rising. It’s not the time for politics, there is an entire lifetime for it. We should set aside politics and allegations for a few days. This is the time to serve people.”After the all-party meeting, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the AAP government faltered in taking the right measures. “ If the Delhi government had taken the right measures people would not have had problems celebrating Chhath Puja together. Markets should remain open with Covid-19 guidelines. The need of the hour is ICU beds and ventilators,” Gupta said. On Thursday, the AAP government was rapped by the Delhi high court for relaxing the restrictions. “Why did you wait for 18 days to restrict the number of guests ar weddings? How many died of Covid-19 during this period?” the high court asked the government.Since October last week, Delhi has been witnessing an unprecedented surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, which is being seen as the third wave in the city. The first two took place in July and September, respectively. Meanwhile, the AAP government allowed 200 guests at weddings. The relaxation has been reviewed and now only 50 guests are allowed.Instead of a total lockdown, the government is mulling closing markets which have become Covid-19 hotspots in the last few weeks.

Two policemen of the Special Operations Group were also injured in the exchange of fire. They have been identified as Kuldeep Raj (32) of Akhnoor in Jammu district and Mohammad Ishaq Malik (40) of Neel Qasim Banihal in Ramban district. Both have been admitted in Government Medical College (GMC) Jammu with neck injuries. Their condition is said to be stable.The encounter between terrorists and security forces started around 4.50 am at Ban Toll Plaza on Jammu-Srinagar national highway.Watch | Four terrorists gunned down by security forces in Jammu’s Nagrota Inspector-General of Police, Jammu zone, Mukesh Singh said that the truck was ferrying the terrorists to Kashmir.“It was put to checking by the policemen at the toll plaza because we had intelligence inputs with us,” Singh said. He further said, “in the exchange of fire four terrorists were eliminated and two constables were injured. Terrorists lobbed grenades on security forces during checking. The truck also caught fire and few grenades also exploded inside it during the exchanges”.“The area is now being sanitised” he added. The IGP informed that in the run-up to the DDC elections, security forces were getting intelligence inputs of possible infiltration by Pakistan terrorists.“This morning when the truck was stopped for checking at the toll plaza, the driver fled from the spot and as soon as a joint team of police and the CRPF started checking the vehicle, a heavy volume of firing commenced,” he said. Security forces immediately started retaliating. The terrorists also lobbed grenades at the security personnel, he added. “Medicines with Pakistani markings show Pak origin of terrorists. The quantity of weapons and type of medicines also indicate fresh infiltration and them being suicide attackers,” said the IGP. An FIR under various sections of the Arms Act has been registered at Nagrota police station.In the three-hour-long operation, all four terrorists were eliminated, he said and added that 11 AK 47 rifles, three pistols, 29 live grenades, six UBGL grenades, mobile phones, compass, pithu bags and other ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists.Also read: China is biggest stumbling block in India’s UNSC permanent membershipThe slain ultras belonged to Jaish-e-Mohammad terror outfit. “It appeared that they were given a task to carry out a major terror strike,” Singh stated.It seemed they also adopted the similar modus-operandi of infiltrating from across the International Border (IB) in Jammu region before boarding a Kashmir-bound truck on Pathankot-Jammu national highway the preceding night, said a senior police officer. “However, forces eliminated them in a swift operation,” he added. He further said it appeared the terrorists entered through fresh infiltration from Samba sector.Earlier, Jammu district police chief SSP Shridhar Patil told HT that “around 5 am some terrorists opened fire at security forces near Ban Toll Plaza in Nagrota area. They were hiding in a vehicle.”CRPF spokesman Shivnandan Singh said, like January 31 this year, a group of terrorists had opened fire on a joint party of police and CRPF at Ban Toll plaza around 5 am on Thursday. “They probably came in a vehicle,” he added. Meanwhile, advisor to Lieutenant Governor, Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar, visited GMC Jammu and met the jawans who suffered injuries while fighting with the terrorists in Nagrota encounter this morning.Also read: Delhi policewoman promoted for tracing 76 missing kids in last 3 monthsDuring his visit, Bhatnagar asked the medical officers about the condition of both the jawans.

19-11-2020||India||China is biggest stumbling block in India’s UNSC permanent membership||PM Modi expressed India’s strong support for multilateralism, described the UNSC as a necessity but asserted that it was under stress. “The credibility and effectiveness of global institutions is being questioned. The reason for this is that there has been no change in these institutions despite the passage of time. These institutions reflect the mindset and realities of the world 75 years ago,” he said.The remarks come ahead of India assuming one of the 10 rotating non-permanent seats at the UN Security Council in January. India has declared that “reformed multilateralism” would be a key focus of its two-year term.PM Modi described terrorism as the biggest threat to the world, a pointer to Pakistan and also as an indirect swipe at China that has shielded Pakistan and Pakistan-based terrorists from sanctions by the UN. China did block sanctions against Pakistan-based terror group founder Jaish-e-Mohammed Masood Azhar for a decade before it had to step aside in 2019 under intense international pressure. China has been standing in the way of India’s entry to Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) by tagging it along with entry of Pakistan despite New Delhi’s impeccable non-proliferation record in contrast to Islamabad that has been a direct beneficiary of nuclear proliferation by North Korea and China.PM Modi isn’t the only one to press for reform of the UN Security Council. UN General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir recently spoke out against the existing structure, saying it was failing to respond to the world’s biggest challenges due to “competing interests”. French President Emmanuel Macron already has called for an overhaul of international cooperation mechanisms, going to the extent of underscoring that the UNSC “no longer produces useful solutions today”.The UN Security Council reform has been on the agenda for more than a decade. But member nations haven’t been able to agree on how big the council should become and whether other nations should have veto powers. As a result, the Security Council continues to reflect the global power structure of 1945, when the Second World War victors – the P-5 – the USA, UK, France, Russia and China – acquired their privileged status. Critics have long argued that the council in its present form, is both undemocratic and anachronistic and would stand to lose its effectiveness and legitimacy unless it is transformed to reflect today’s world.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador TS Tirumurti, speaking in the UN General Assembly this week, said ‘’Today’s Security Council is an impaired organ. It has been unable to act with credibility essentially due to its unrepresentative nature. But then, what is happening inside the Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) process, which we seem to be wedded to?’’Intergovernmental Negotiations framework is a group within the United Nations that is looking into UNSC reforms. But it has made no progress since 2009 when it was formed.There have been no serious attempts to come up with a consolidated text to begin formal negotiations due to resistance by certain countries such as China that are opposed to the expansion of UNSC membership.For years, India, Germany, Japan, and Brazil have been trying to get a permanent seat to the UN Security Council but the UN charter is such that it gives permanent members the veto power to any resolution, including the expansion of membership.While the first four have backed India’s permanent membership, China has time and again stalled it by laying down conditions impossible to meet. China says there are major differences among UN members over UNSC reforms and insists that a “package solution” should be found to accommodate the interests and concerns of all parties.The Chinese mission to the UN has questioned the need for reforms in “haste”. It doesn’t matter that the informal negotiations for reforms have been on for the last 10 years. “To start text-based negotiation in a haste or to impose a single document is not conducive to building a consensus and promoting unity,” the Chinese mission said in a statement.India along with Japan, Germany and Brazil, however, called out China’s delaying tactics in September this year. New Delhi told the UNGA president that the inter-government negotiation process had become a convenient smokescreen to hide behind for those who didn’t want to see any reforms in the security council, a reference to countries such as China, Turkey and Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-is-biggest-stumbling-block-in-india-s-unsc-permanent-membership/story-yTpTstOwjEY7vYz5t2NiNN.html
19-11-2020||India||State’s post-facto consent to CBI is valid: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court (SC) has held that a state government’s post-facto (afterwards) consent would be valid for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate corruption cases against government officials. A two-judge SC bench, comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar and BR Gavai, who was dealing with a case on the matter from Uttar Pradesh (UP), upheld a verdict of the Allahabad high court (HC). The HC had validated an investigation against two UP government officials after the accused had complained that the central probe agency started the investigation against them without obtaining consent of the state government under Section 5 and 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946. The CBI had initiated proceedings against Ramji Singh, general manager (GM), and Yogendra Nath Pandey, assistant manager, of the District Industries Centre, Chandauli, after the duo had allegedly prepared false status reports to enable a company obtain subsidised coal from Northern Coalfields Limited, which is located in Singrauli in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh (MP). Also Read: Delhi HC asks Centre to respond to plea seeking legal recognition of same-sex marriagesThe CBI did not name the accused officials in the first information report (FIR), which was lodged on April 13, 2011. Initially, the probe started after the then UP government had granted a general consent allowing the CBI’s jurisdiction within the state. Later, the consent under Section 19 of Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988, was obtained on May 31, 2012. The central probe agency found incriminating evidence against the two officials and they were charge sheeted in May 2012. The sanction from the state under Section 6 of the DSPE Act, 1946, was obtained on September 7, 2018. The CBI contended that this post-facto consent was valid to prosecute the errant officials.The UP government supported the CBI’s contention and argued in the HC that prior consent under Section 6 of DSPE Act, 1946, would not be mandatory. The HC upheld the state government’s contention and gave a verdict in the latter’s favour on August 14, 2019, following which the guilty officials moved the apex court.The SC bench endorsed the HC’s verdict. It said: “The single judge found that the post-facto consent was sufficient for investigation by the CBI for the offences against the two public servants, whose names though did not find place in the FIR, but were found in charge sheet....we find no reason to interfere with the finding of the HC with regard to not obtaining prior consent of the state government under Section 6 of the DSPE Act, 1946.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-s-post-facto-consent-to-cbi-is-valid-supreme-court/story-4bGV0AtPLq2CGgugEMdK8H.html

The effort came after more than 24 patients developed paralysis due to GBS. The study hopes to establish a correlation between Covid-19 and GBS and is slated to be finished in three weeks. The aim of the study is to develop an India-specific database regarding Covid-19 and GBS that will be sent for scientific publication.“There haven’t been many studies on Covid-19-associated GBS in India. Our study will be first-of-its-kind where the sample size will also be large. Along with hospitals, we are also collecting data from nursing homes,” Dr Megha Dhamne, the study’s principal investigator and neurologist at LH Hiranandani Hospital in Powai, said.What is Guillain Barre Syndrome?GBS is a rare autoimmune disorder, a prototype of post-infectious neuropathy that usually develops within two to four weeks after an acute infection, and is caused by a bacterial or viral infection. It is mainly observed in the last stage of Covid-19 recovery or among completely recovered patients. GBS is found in Covid-19 patients when the immune system attempts to kill Sars-CoV-2 and accidentally starts attacking the peripheral nervous system, thereby affecting limb functions. The syndrome’s first symptoms are a tingling or itching sensation in the skin, followed by muscle weakness, pain and numbness and these may emerge first in the feet and hands. More severe cases may have reflex loss and paralysis.Read more | Ray of hope? Study claims Hepatitis C drugs can be effective against Covid-19Could all Covid-19 patients have GBS?While Covid-19 is known to affect digestive, cardiac and kidney functions, the virus can have an indirect effect and trigger an immune response that can attack the body’s peripheral nervous system. Experts believe that it is still difficult to assess the nature of permanency of GBS but such cases have been identified within five to 10 days of the onset of symptoms of Covid-19. Doctors have recommended regular follow-ups by recovered patients.Is there a treatment for GBS?Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and sometimes plasma therapy helps patients with GBS recover. Patients who may develop severe complications could require intensive care treatment or ventilator support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-and-guillain-barre-syndrome-relation-causes-and-symptoms/story-5dyPPPFK7Ijqkva2yHM0OO.html

Addressing the Bengaluru Tech Summit, Modi said India’s local technology solutions have the potential to go global and it is time for them to be designed in India and deployed for the world. “The potential of our youth and possibilities of technology are endless. It is time we give our best and leverage them. I am confident that our IT sector will keep making us proud,” he said. On the government’s focus on leveraging the benefits of technology, he said that policy decisions are aimed at liberalising the technology and innovations industry and an example of that is the recent relaxations announced in the compliance burden on the IT industry. Also Read: PM Modi to inaugurate Bengaluru Tech Summit on November 19“The achievements of the industrial era are in the rear-view mirror, and now, we are in the middle of the information era. The future is coming sooner than anticipated. In the industrial era, change was linear. But in the information era, change is disruptive,” the Prime Minister said. He said from catering to local needs such as construction of houses for the poor to setting the pace for the defence sector, technology plays a key role. “Earlier, wars were determined by who had better elephants and horses. Now, technology is playing a very important role in global conflicts. From software to drones to UAVs, technology is redefining the defence sector… In the information era, the first mover doesn’t matter, the best mover does. Anyone can make a product anytime that disrupts all existing equations of the market,” he said. Referring to the Digital India mission that was launched by the government five years ago, the Prime Minister said the accomplishments in bridging the digital divide and opting for a human-centric approach have ensured that the mission has not remained a regular government initiative, but become a way of life, particularly for the marginalised and those in the government. “Through technology, we have enhanced human dignity. Millions of farmers receive monetary support in one click. During the peak of the lockdown, it was technology that ensured that India’s poor received proper and quick assistance. The scale of this relief has few parallels,” the Prime Minister pointed out. He went on to add, “As per a report, the Internet came to India around 25 years ago and the number of Internet connections recently crossed the 750 million-milestone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-uniquely-poised-to-leap-ahead-in-information-era-pm-narendra-modi-at-bengaluru-tech-summit/story-vaFQ1SnecIS9ttFUJmndwK.html

The matter has now escalated to blockage of Pottangi-Arku road by villagers on the Andhra Pradesh side,” the Union Minister said while requesting Patnaik to convene an all-party meeting with due participation and inputs from Odisha’s intelligentsia and civil society.Pradhan also suggested him to form a House Committee in the Odisha Legislative Assembly comprising members of these issues and presenting their learned findings along with their recommendation. “Keeping in mind the sensitivity of the issue, I would also urge you to seek the support of the Central government in mediating a resolution between Odisha and her neighbouring States for boundary disputes,” he stated. Pradhan highlighted that fourteen out of Odisha’s thirty districts share borders with Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. “Odisha has a long history of border and water disputes with all these neighbouring States owing to historical, cartographic and geographical reasons,” he said. “It would seem prudent to arrive at an effective and comprehensive resolution of Odisha’s ongoing and long standing border disputes with all its neighbouring States, i.e. Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, through bilateral discussions between States,” he stated. The Union Minister said that Odisha should take the lead in initiating discussions to resolve border disputes. “However, it must be ensured that socio-economic interest of the people of Odisha is not compromised in any way and if necessary, the State should also consider legal remedies for resolution of these disputes,” he concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dharmendra-pradhan-urges-odisha-cm-for-all-party-meeting-to-resolve-inter-state-border-disputes/story-hZoyWQdo1pEW2yW3rvpYkN.html

He blamed chief minister Uddhav Thackeray for mishandling the Covid-19 pandemic, excessive electricity bills, and cases against journalists-activists.Fadnavis said the Metro Line-3 car shed was shifted to Kanjurmarg just to satisfy the Shiv Sena leadership’s ego. He claimed the shifting will delay the project by five years and lead to the cost escalation by Rs4,000 crore.Also read | Mumbai court grants bail to man who tweeted against Thackerays“I had stayed the proposal of the car shed at Aarey for nine months after taking over as chief minister in 2014 just to check if there was an alternative to it to avoid environmental damage. After checking all other options, an expert committee of top officers said that Aarey was the only option as the Kanjumarg land was under litigation and it will lead to heavy losses and delay to the project,” he said at a meeting to chalk out the Bharatiya Janata Party’s strategy for the 2022 Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections.“Even the committee appointed by Thackeray government under [bureaucrat] Manoj Saunik has recommended keeping the depot at Aarey for the same reasons cited by earlier committee. But the recommendation by their own committee was overruled while shifting the depot to Kanjurmarg.”Fadnavis said that the car shed at Kanjurmarg will also lead to environmental destruction because of the construction. “When we proposed affordable housing scheme on the salt pan land for poor during our tenure, Thackeray had opposed the proposal citing the reason of environment. How can they allow a car shed that will need similar construction resulting in the environmental issues,” he said.Fadnavis said the Thackerays were misleading people by saying they have notified 800 acres as forest land in Aarey. “We had notified it as an eco-sensitive zone during our tenure and as such construction was banned. By changing parlance, the Thackerays have been misleading people,” he said.Fadnavis also attacked the government for opposing the Bullet Train project and said that investment of Rs50,000 crore in Maharashtra for the project would have given a push to the state’s GDP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fadnavis-hits-out-at-mva-government-calls-it-anti-development/story-QJ3ZeECGKvTPGQplS4AaEI.html
19-11-2020||India||Setback to UP’s Shiksha Mitras as SC allows state government to fill 69,000 assistant teacher posts||The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday removed the legal obstacles put up by around 100,000 aggrieved Shiksha Mitras, or para teachers, in Uttar Pradesh (UP) in the way of the Yogi Adityanath-led government to fill up around 69,000 vacant posts of assistant teachers.The Shiksha Mitras had challenged a state government order, which was issued on January 7, 2019. The order had raised the minimum qualifying marks for Assistant Teachers Recruitment Examination (ATRE), 2019, to 60-65% from 40-45% in ATRE, 2018. Around 30 petitions were filed in the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad high court (HC) a day after ATRE, 2019, was conducted, challenging the revised eligibility norms.Several Shiksha Mitras were inconvenienced due to higher qualifying cut-offs and failed to make the grade.However, the two-member apex court bench, comprising Justices UU Lalit and M Mohan Shantanagouder, found nothing wrong with the state government’s order. The SC said: “Any process, which applied equally to all the candidates and was designed to garner the best talent, cannot be called arbitrary or irrational.”The bench viewed the matter through the lens of Constitutional guarantee of right to free education under Article 21A. The bench said, “Article 21A of the Constitution would envisage quality education being imparted to the children, which, in turn, would signify that the teachers must be meritorious and the best of the lot.” The bench approved the enhanced qualifying marks set by the state government and allowed the latter to fill up the 69,000 posts for assistant teachers, as per the results of ATRE-2019, which were declared on May 12 amid the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. Altogether, 1,46,060 candidates were declared successful in the examination.The SC held out a sliver of hope for the Shiksha Mitras and recorded the submission of the state government, which was keen on offering one more opportunity to the aggrieved para teachers.However, the court left it to the discretion of the state government to consider the “manner and the modalities” in which the opportunity could be availed of.The appeals before the apex court arose out of an order passed by the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad HC on May 6 following which the Shiksha Mitras lost their challenge to the qualifying cut-offs fixed by the state government.The Shiksha Mitras have been serving in UP under a state government order that was issued on May 26, 1999. The objective of recruiting Shiksha Mitras was to maintain teacher and student ratio in primary schools by hiring para teachers at a lesser monthly salary. Earlier, Shiksha Mitras were paid a monthly honorarium of Rs 1,450, which was later increased to Rs 10,000.The Shiksha Mitras had claimed that those who had appeared for ATRE, 2018, and ATRE, 2019, formed a homogeneous class, but the SC did not accept this contention. The apex court maintained that the difficulty level of both the examinations was different.The bench found out that 37.62% of candidates had qualified in ATRE, 2019, when the eligibility cut-off was 60-65%. While 38.83% of candidates had qualified in ATRE, 2018, when the eligibility cut-off was 40-45%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/setback-to-up-s-shiksha-mitras-as-sc-allows-state-government-to-fill-69-000-assistant-teacher-posts/story-ewFWxQSb5ULy0mw25k3kCI.html
19-11-2020||India||MoEFCC okays Maharashtra’s proposal to study distribution, population of Arabian Sea humpback whales||Maharashtra is the third state along the country’s west coast, which will join the studies on the distribution and population of Arabian Sea humpback whales. The initiative has already been undertaken by Karnataka and Goa, as part of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change’s (MoEFCC) endangered species recovery programme.The MoEFCC said they had approved a proposal to support Maharashtra’s plans to use a combination of acoustic and visual monitoring methods to bridge the information gap for the whale species in the Indian waters. Maharashtra seeks to implement a community-based monitoring network to report sightings and strandings of such marine species.“Maharashtra is the third state to have submitted its plan after Karnataka and Goa. Understanding more about this species is extremely important. We will be supporting the Maharashtra government in this project,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director-general of forests (wildlife), MoEFCC. “Arabian Sea humpback whale is a signature species, whose conservation is also being pursued by the International Whaling Commission (IWC),” he added.IWC is a global body that looks into whale conservation. “The commission is appreciative of India’s efforts towards conservation of this particular species,” the IWC had said.Earlier on August 7, the Maharashtra state board of wildlife (SBWL) had approved the proposal on Arabian Sea humpback whales following a report compiled by the Mangrove Cell. The Maharashtra government had submitted its final proposal to MoEFCC on November 12.“It is a good development, as emphasis is being laid on conservation of marine species. We are trying to protect those species that have not been in focus. We will be looking at many more such studies in a phase-wise manner,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) (wildlife), Maharashtra.The state’s research programme has been proposed from December 2020 to October 2025, which is divided into five annual phases. The first phase consists of determining seasonal occurrence patterns and habitat use of the species through passive acoustic monitoring (sound recorders). A visual survey along Angria bank -- off the Malvan coast -- will be undertaken along with genetic sample collection from stranded baleen whales for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing over the next year. The next phases will include long-term monitoring, vessel-based line transect survey with photo-identification exercises, and developing a network (stranding) of stakeholders, local community members, researchers and veterinarians. Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) (Mangrove Cell), said, “Our attempt is to understand the seasonal occurrence pattern of these whales based on the audio recordings. It will help determine critical hotspots for their breeding or feeding grounds along the Maharashtra coast. Continuous acoustic monitoring will help understand their communication behaviour and how they are affected by the noise of ships and seismic (oil) exploration in offshore areas.”The total budget for the five-year project is around Rs6.12 crore, which will be shared by the Centre and the state government in a ratio of 60:40.“Most of the research on this species has been carried out in Oman. This species has not been studied much in the Indian coastal waters and there have been sporadic records of their presence. There have also been some stranding incidents of this species on the western Indian coastline,” said Manas Manjrekar, deputy director, Mangrove Foundation.In June 2018, Arabian Sea humpback whales were one of four species to be added to the recovery programme during the 49th meeting of the standing committee of national board of wildlife (NBWL), under the MoEFCC.The ministry had requested all states to develop five-year action plans. Arabian Sea humpback whale was the 21st species, which was included in the plan, said Dasgupta.The state government has proposed that this species of the whale’s population is likely to be less than 250 mature individuals. The International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Species Survival Commission cetacean specialist group identified that a population estimation study -- through identification by photograph – showed between 60 and 111 humpback whales along the Oman coast, which make their way during the winter towards warmer waters of India’s west coast. According to the Arabian Sea Whale Network, the most recent sighting of the species was by scuba divers near Netrani Island off the Karnataka coast last December. However, telemetry studies by the Environment Society of Oman have been regularly reporting Arabian Sea humpback whales crossing into Indian waters.“Maharashtra’s bid to begin its studies on the whale species is heartening news. However, there has been a delay in the fieldwork because of the prevailing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. This has put a spanner in our works to compare whale songs between India and Oman,” said Dr Dipani Sutaria, a senior research fellow, who has undertaken extensive research into Arabian Sea humpback whales.THREATS TO THE SPECIESHumpback whales spotted along India’s west coast are part of the distinct Arabian Sea population. The species is considered to be the most isolated whale population in the world and recognised as non-migratory.As per the IUCN Red List, the species is endangered and it is protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. An adult whale ranges between 40 and 50 feet (ft) in length and weighs up to metric 30 tonnes. These whales can be found in the coastal waters along Yemen, Oman, Iran, India, the Maldives and Sri Lanka. The species is recognised as a genetically isolated stock that is separated from other populations approximately 70,000 years ago. Historical records show that this small isolated population was also subjected to whaling. In 1966, Russian whaling ships in the Arabian Sea had caught 238 humpback whales within 10 days, out of these 164 (69%) were killed off the Gulf of Kutch, Gujarat, and another 12 (5%) were killed close to the Gulf of Khambhat. Other threats to these species include: entanglement in fishing gears, strikes by ships, disturbance from vessel noise, and seismic surveys related to oil and natural gas exploration in offshore areas.(Source: Maharashtra’s proposal to the Centre, IUCN)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moefcc-okays-maharashtra-s-proposal-to-study-distribution-population-of-arabian-sea-humpback-whales/story-mqgmtiEsYq97UsPunT3F6M.html

19-11-2020||India||‘Digital India has become a way of life’, says PM Modi at Bengaluru Tech Summit||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said the ‘Digital India’ mission launched by the Centre five years ago is no longer being seen as a regular government initiative and it has instead become a way of life.“Thanks to Digital India, our nation has witnessed a more human-centric approach to development. Using technology at such a large scale has brought about several life changes for our citizens. The benefits are for everyone to see,” the Prime Minister said while inaugurating the Bengaluru Tech Summit 2020.Modi said the government has successfully created a market for digital and tech solutions. It has made technology a key part of all schemes. “Our governance model is ‘Technology First’,” he said.Bringing to spotlight the significance of technology amid the coronavirus pandemic, Modi said, “At the peak of the lockdown, it was technology that ensured that India’s poor received proper and quick assistance. The scale of this relief has few parallels.”The Prime Minister said that when it comes to technology, the way ahead lies in learning and growing together and following the approach, several incubation centres are opening in India. He also pointed to the culture of hackathons which have been organised in India over the past few years.Talking about the transition from industrial to the information era, Modi said, “Achievements of the industrial era are in the rear-view mirror, and now, we are in the middle of the information era. Future is coming sooner than anticipated. In the industrial era, change was linear. But in the information era, change is disruptive.” He said that in the industrial era first-movers had an advantage over others. However, in the information era the best-mover races ahead, Modi said.Hailing India’s IT sector, the Prime Minister said, “Our local tech solutions have the potential to go global. It is time for tech-solutions that are Designed in India but Deployed for the World.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/digital-india-has-become-a-way-of-life-says-pm-modi-at-bengaluru-tech-summit/story-mxfvbohBhvDGF41AP74KSN.html

Four persons—two Africans and two Indian women—have been arrested, and cocaine weighing 504 grams worth Rs3 crore to Rs4 crore in international market, has been recovered, they said. Investigations have also revealed that this syndicate smuggled multiple consignments of cocaine in the past; the total quantity of cocaine smuggled via the same modus operandi is over 3.3kg since August 2020, valued at over Rs20 crore. DRI, Mumbai, had received an intelligence input from a reliable source about cocaine being smuggled to Mumbai from Trinidad and Tobago. Also Read: Kerala gold smuggling: ED denies Sivasankar’s allegations of pressure to name political targets“We immediately swung into action and as expected, during prior verification, the address declared on the courier packet appeared suspicious, thereby suggesting it would be challenging to intercept the Indian recipients of the contraband. We first intercepted the consignment and ascertained the presence of cocaine. Thereafter, we kept discreet watch and when a woman came to pick up the consignment on November 17, she was apprehended by the team,” said an officer. The woman disclosed during interrogation that the package containing the contraband was to be delivered to an African national in Navi Mumbai. “Teams were quickly formed and dispatched to Navi Mumbai. To make the delivery appear more realistic, the services of an app-based taxi were also availed. The teams lay in wait for nearly an hour, after which one African national approached the taxi in which the lady was waiting with the consignment. When he attempted to take the parcel, he was immediately overpowered by DRI officers hanging around incognito. An accomplice of the African national was waiting nearby in an auto. On seeing his accomplice nabbed, the other African national immediately fled,” said a second officer. “We set off in hot pursuit and when his auto was about to be intercepted, the African national jumped off the moving auto and began running. However, after a chase of almost a kilometre on foot, auto and car, the accomplice was also nabbed,” said the second officer. The DRI officials cited above said that role of another Mumbai-based woman was also uncovered during the operation. “Sources confirmed that this woman was currently holidaying in Udaipur. Another DRI team from the Ahmedabad unit was swiftly assembled and it reached Udaipur in the dead of the night. The DRI team was able to zero in on the exact location of the woman in Udaipur. They kept watch over the hotel and in the morning of November 18, with the assistance of Udaipur Police, the woman was apprehended. She was then arrested by DRI and, with magisterial permission, she was brought to Mumbai on transit remand on Wednesday night,” said the first officer. “It then also came to light that this woman was a history-sheeter who was arrested by Mumbai Police only last year. The woman who had come to collect the parcel from the courier company also has a criminal background and both ladies had met while they were in jail last year,” he said. In all, four persons have been arrested. “The operation being carried out by DRI has thrown up a sophisticated cartel of international drug smugglers. The immaculately executed ‘Operation Calypso’ has once again shown DRI’s commitment to fighting international drug cartels and ability to plan and execute complex operations, all while strictly adhering to the letter and spirit of the law,” said a third officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dri-busts-an-international-cocaine-smuggling-racket-in-3-day-long-operation-calypso/story-WIBvq8kptyYwEWOZXoT6TI.html

19-11-2020||India||India’s first child to have undergone liver transplant set to become doctor||Life has come a full circle for Sanjay Kandasamy (23) as “the miracle baby of medicine is all set to join the profession”. Doctors at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in the national capital are eagerly waiting for the coming April, as Kandasamy, who had made history to undergo the country’s first paediatric liver transplant as a 20-month child in 1998, will take the Hippocratic oath.Kandasamy, who belongs to Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, is full of beans about his feat.“This has been my ambition since childhood. I’m alive today because of the efforts of my doctors. I want to take up this noble profession to save lives. Initially, I wanted to be a surgeon, but later I realised that my interest lies in paediatrics. I am likely to specialise in paediatrics and focus on neonatology (newborns),” he said.Kandasamy was born with a rare condition called Biliary Atresia – the congenital disorder that leads to liver failure among newborns. The liver failure occurs due to blockage in ducts that carry bile from liver to gallbladder. His father had donated 20% of his liver for the transplant surgery. “He was the first child in India to have successfully undergone a liver transplant. It has been 22 years since he underwent the surgical procedure. He is a classic example of long-term smooth survival after undergoing a liver transplant surgery,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, the group medical director and a senior liver specialist at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. Dr Sibal was one of the key members of the team of doctors, who had treated Kandasamy in 1998.Doctors, who were involved in the surgical procedure, had to face multiple challenges to ensure Kandasamy’s recovery. “I remember he was in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for about two months. We practically lived in the hospital for those two months to get him out of ICU. He was less than two years old, when he was operated on. His condition was rather critical,” reminisced Dr AS Soin, chairman, institute of liver transplantation and regenerative medicine, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram.Dr Soin had performed the critical surgery along with Dr MR Rajasekhar at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital. “It is one of the proudest moments in my 28-year career as a transplant surgeon. My baby patient is all set to become a doctor,” he added. The surgical procedure has underscored that long-term smooth survival of children, who underwent liver transplant, is a reality.“We know of around 40 children, who are leading a normal life even after 12 years of liver transplant. Globally, children have lived beyond 40 years after their transplant,” Dr Soin said. Dr Sibal said there were a few common concerns of parents that would keep recurring during counselling sessions that are conducted before a liver transplant surgery. “Will my child be able to go to school without any difficulty? Will my child have a normal growth and development? The latter question is more common for a girl child, where parents are eager to know whether she can start a family when she grows up. Though these are legitimate concerns, they have proven to be ill-founded,” Dr Sibal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-first-child-to-have-undergone-liver-transplant-set-to-become-doctor/story-kVWUCPUApPSH4NmR8lSELO.html

This began after the governments in several states imposed a ban on bursting crackers during Diwali. In a tweet on November 14, the Bengaluru police officer shared her Facebook post stating bursting firecrackers was not part of the Hindu tradition as there was no mention of it in religious scriptures and epics. The statement was contested by True Indology, who in turn “accepted the challenge” and cited texts to prove the point but failed to convince Moudgil. Also, read: Here are 5 times the queen of Bollywood Kangana inspired us to get fit Also Watch | ‘How many voices will you suppress Sonia Sena?’: Kangana on Arnab’s arrestAs the arguments between the two went on, Twitter suspended the True Indology handle. The reason for the account’s suspension was not stated.“She should be suspended, such cops are a shame in the name of police force #ShameOnYouIPSRoopa we can’t let her get her evil ways #BringBackTrueIndology,” Ranaut said in her tweet. “Side effects of reservations, when unworthy and undeserving gets the power they don’t heal they only hurt, I don’t know anything about her personal life but I guarantee that her frustration is stemming out of her incompetence,” she also tweeted. Living off on tax money, these cops are answerable for arm twisting commoners, it’s a valid question rather than taking people’s complaints and assisting them, why is @D_Roopa_IPS indulging in time pass trolling that too in working hours threatening and intimidating youngsters. https://t.co/b9O7clFzTe Side effects of reservations, when unworthy and undeserving gets the power they don’t heal they only hurt, I don’t know anything about her personal life but I guarantee that her frustration is stemming out of her incompetence #BringBackTrueIndology https://t.co/BUrVm1Fjz3Ranaut also came out in the support of True Ideology with the hashtag #BringBackTrueIndology. In a series of tweets, the actor slammed the police officer for being “vengeful” and indulging in the spat during her working hours. “Government appoints people like @D_Roopa_IPS to protect fundamental rights of commoners, but look at her obnoxious ignorance like a sore looser she became so vengeful that if she couldn’t win the arguments with facts she simply got @TIinExile eliminated.Shame on you @D_Roopa_IPS,” the Bollywood actor tweeted.  You are a hero @TIinExile , at times the fight for civilisation feels like a lonely and thankless battle, to see the organised power of the other side can make one disheartened but keep at it, one day you will be a leading voice, my love and blessings #BringBackTrueIndology https://t.co/Fh3yqbC9BqShe also questioned Twitter and its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, over the account’s suspension and sought action against the social media site tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office. “@jack @Twitter @TwitterIndia your bias and Islamist’s propaganda is embarrassing, why did you suspend @TIinExile ? Because he busted fake narratives of our history? Shame on you, waiting for the day when you will be banned in India, hope @PMOIndia takes action against twitter,” she tweeted. Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi too called out Moudgil. “Doesn’t befit IPS officers of the country to be arguing with anonymous Twitter Handles that too during working hours. Make a point, let it go, you aren’t winning anything by arguing on SM!” Singhvi tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kangana-ranaut-wants-ips-officer-d-roopa-suspended-calls-her-unworthy-undeserving/story-yVaVfmjL2obVd5fW1sSZ0O.html

Chhath puja will end on Saturday morning after prayers to the rising sun.In view of the pandemic, several states have put a curb on the festival in view of the rising Covid-19 infection prompting protests and criticism from the political parties. Here is a list of states that have put restrictions on Chhath celebrations.DelhiThe Delhi government has imposed a blanket ban on Chhath puja festivities after Covid-19 cases jumped to record high numbers in the national capital. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) instructed officials to ensure that Chhath puja is not performed at public places, river banks and temples in the city this year in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.MumbaiIn Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has put restrictions on the mass celebration of Chhath puja at beaches, river banks and other natural water bodies in the city and asked devotees to avoid crowding.OdishaIn Odisha, the government has also prohibited the mass celebration of Chhath puja including bathing at river banks.

19-11-2020||India||Odisha cops arrest 7 for gruesome murder of 6 from a family||A week after six members of a family including four children were found murdered at their home in western Odisha district of Bolangir, police on Wednesday claimed to have solved the case by arresting 7 persons.The accused were identified as Babulal Jani, Chhaya Gond, Baldev Gond, Manish Gond, Bhola Jani, Shiva Jani and Bikal Kairi, while two other main accused Gangua Majhi and his son Baldev Majhi were absconding.On Wednesday last, Bulu Jani (50), his wife Jyoti (48), daughters, Sarita (12) and Shreya (3) and two sons, Bhishma (5) and Sanjeev (2), were found murdered and wrapped in blankets at their house in Sanrapada village in Patnagarh block of Bolangir. Jani used to hawk honey as well as sell stationery items and trinkets in the area since the last 10 years. Neighbours found the bodies after they peeked through the window when they got suspicious after noticing Jani and his family members had not come out of the house. An axe was found at the spot of the incident.Bolangir SP Madkar Sandeep Sampat, who led the investigation, said Jani and his family were killed by members of three of the neighbouring families over past enmity. “Though the deceased are originally from Bihar, they had been living in Patnagarh for more than 10 years. The family of Gangua Majhi, Babulal Jani and Baldev Gond used to quarrel with Bulu Jani on some pretext or the other every other day. Bulu Jani apparently used to harass and humiliate the three families over several issues. They were looking for an opportunity to take revenge,” said the SP.Also Read: Senior citizens, pregnant women and healthcare workers will be 1st in line for Covid vaccine: OdishaLast month, Bulu Jani had a fight with Gangua Majhi over the former trying to break the lock of Majhi’s house in the latter’s absence. The incident angered Majhi as well as two other families and they planned to wipe out the family including the children.“The accused families did not want to take chances as they thought the children may take revenge when they grow up,” said the SP.Also Read: Jagannath temple administration pitches for mid-December reopeningOn Nov 10 evening, six of the accused lay in wait outside Jani’s family. At 11 pm, they tried to fire at Jani when he came out to relieve himself. However, the bullet missed its target. The accused, armed with an axe, sword and petrol, broke through the house and hacked six family members to death. All the bodies bore injury marks on the neck or back of their heads.After the murder, deceased Bulu Jani’s sons had lodged a complaint with police alleging that five persons in the locality were threatening their father. About a year ago, one of the sons of Jani was found murdered in Rourkela.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-cops-arrest-7-for-gruesome-murder-of-6-from-a-family/story-0rVU8LEPMG1PStSRLiufaK.html

Police on Wednesday recovered the partially decomposed bodies of the two victims after being informed by their neighbours of a stench emanating from the flat. The man, who was found sitting next to his parents’ bodies, was admitted to a hospital for treatment. “We have sent the bodies for an autopsy. The man was admitted to a hospital, as he tried to die by suicide. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the man had killed his parents at least three to four days ago,” said an official of a local police station. Also read | Old rivalry leads to double murder in Odisha’s Sambalpur districtThe victims have been identified as Pradyut Bose (70), his wife Gopa Bose (65) and their son, Subhojit Bose. Police said that Pradyut was a retired employee of a private company. Subhojit holds a master’s degree in computer applications (MCA), but he is unemployed. He is suffering from an acute depression and purportedly confessed to the police about killing his parents. The family’s financial condition had worsened during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic and they did not mingle with their neighbours, the police said.“Their neighbours were getting a foul smell over the past two days. On Wednesday, they found that the smell was coming from a flat on the third floor of the building. They knocked on the doors but when they didn’t get any response, they informed the police,” said the officer. The police broke open the entrance door of the apartment and found Gopa’s and Pradyut’s bodies lying on a sofa and on a bed in an adjacent room, respectively. A blood-splattered Subhojit was found sitting in another room of the apartment. (If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

ASCI said it was not a competent authority to decide if entities are conducting gambling and suggested that the I&B ministry should look into the matter as the regulator. The ministry held its first consultative meeting – a virtual exercise because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak --- on the matter, which was attended by Vikram Sahay, joint secretary, I&B, representatives of ASCI, gaming federation and broadcasters.The ministry felt that the matter should be examined afresh because of the nebulous nature of the existing online gaming norms, said a person, who is aware of the developments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-b-ministry-to-decide-if-online-gambling-platforms-can-advertise-on-tv/story-UFEtmL5GkLVnJrCyBse67J.html

The arrival of a Covid-19 vaccine, however, might still take some time. This is because while the majority of these vaccine candidates are yet to complete the trial phase, those that have completed trials are yet to be approved for use by health regulators.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn the latest update on the Covid-19 vaccine development front, American drugmaker Pfizer Inc on Wednesday announced its candidate was found to be 95% effective. The announcement came on a day the United States became the first country to cross the 250,000 Covid-19 death mark.Here are the latest updates on the development of a vaccine for Covid-19:1. Pfizer, which is developing a vaccine in partnership with Germany’s BioNTech SE, said the -candidate- BNT162b2-was found to be 95% effective in the final analysis of its phase 3 trial. Pfizer said there had been 170 cases of Covid-19 in its trial on more than 43,000 volunteers, adding that it would apply for emergency use authorisation (EUA) within days. Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), pointed out last week that storing the Pfizer vaccine will be a huge challenge for India as it needs to be stored and transported at minus 70 degree Celsius.Also Read | Keeping Pfizer vaccine at minus 70 degree Celsius tough, says AIIMS chief2. Spain has authorised phase 3 trials of the vaccine being developed by Johnson and Johnson-owned Janssen Pharmaceutica. This is the first vaccine candidate which will enter phase 3 trials in the country. The trials will be conducted in nine hospitals; 20% of the participants will be under 40 years old and 30% above 60 years old. Janssen, whose vaccine candidate is called Ad26.COV2-S, announced late September the start of phase 3 trials of its candidate.Also Read | Senior citizens, pregnant women and healthcare workers will be 1st in line for Covid vaccine: Odisha3.

It is speculated that convalescent plasma having low concentration of specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 may be less beneficial for treating Covid-19 patients as compared to plasma with high concentration of such antibodies,” said the ICMR advisory. “This advisory therefore embraces the principle that a potential donor for convalescent plasma should have sufficient concentration of antibody working against Covid-19... It also highlights that presence of antibody against Covid-19 in a potential recipient makes transfusing convalescent plasma a futile intervention,” it further said.As per ICMR advisory, the potential recipients include patients in early stages of the viral disease, 3-7 days from the onset of symptoms, but not later than 10 days; and having no IgG antibody (which is the longer lasting antibody against Sars-Cov-2) against Covid-19 using appropriate confirmatory test. An informed consent has to be taken from the recipient or their family before transfusing convalescent plasma. To donate, ICMR says only men, and women who have never conceived, and are between 18 and 65 years , are eligible.“There were reports of misuse of this experimental therapy, and that was being given randomly, which is why the advisory had to be put out,” said a senior ICMR official who did not wish to be identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-warns-against-indiscriminate-use-of-plasma-therapy/story-3tHwnt38bIUD1dlYqTXIXP.html

During the Brics Summit on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called on the grouping to back the move by India and South Africa to secure exemption from intellectual property agreements for vaccines. The proposal is already facing opposition from developed countries, including the US and European Union member states. The Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Council of the WTO is expected to the take up the proposal for patent protection waivers on Friday, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. Also Read| Covid-19 immunity may last longer: StudyThe Moscow Declaration adopted at the conclusion of the Brics Summit said the members of the grouping “will work to ensure that, when [the vaccine is] available, it is disseminated in a fair, equitable and affordable basis”. The declaration didn’t make any direct reference to the proposal by India and South Africa. The declaration recognised the importance of “extensive immunisation” in preventing, containing and stopping the transmission of the Coronavirus, and supported cooperative approaches to expedite research, development and production of vaccine and therapeutics. Participating in an online discussion on Tuesday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said India will do everything possible to make vaccines affordable and accessible to everyone. Despite the currently strained India-China ties, Chinese President Xi Jinping too offered to work with India on vaccines during the Brics Summit. “Chinese companies are working with their Russian and Brazilian partners on phase-III clinical trials ... we are prepared to cooperate with South Africa and India as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/brics-calls-for-equitable-distribution-of-coronavirus-vaccine/story-1ox0MKLaz74i4LFb5qO2sL.html

Chairing a high-level meeting on Wednesday, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said once the vaccine is available in Odisha, pregnant mothers and health workers will be on the priority list for vaccination.According to the 2011 census, elderly people constitute 9.5% of Odisha’s population of 4.2 crore. In terms of numbers, there are four million people aged 60 years and above, two million each of men and women, with the majority of them living in rural areas.The Odisha government had already started the process for preparation of a comprehensive database of frontline Covid workers including the healthcare workers, Anganwadi and ASHA workers for seamless initiation of the vaccination programme.Indian medical association, AYUSH association, Nursing association, Paramedic workers’ association and Private hospital owners’ association have been asked to submit details of their members to their respective district collector, municipal commissioner or chief district medical officer for enrolment in the database.The Odisha government had earlier announced the establishment of an advanced vaccine manufacturing unit on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar that will produce 10 types of vaccines including that of Covid-19 and malaria. The government will spend Rs 300 crore for the unit.Also Read: Jagannath temple administration pitches for mid-December reopening Experts said vaccinating the elderly will be a challenge as most of them lived in rural areas where maintaining cold chain facilities would be a big hurdle. “Even by most optimistic assessment, I don’t think we would see a vaccine before April next year in India. Once the vaccines are available, they have to be transported to the CHC and PHC level to ensure vaccination of the elderly.

19-11-2020||India||China is fortifying defences across Ladakh border, not prepping to disengage||Reinforcements of People’s Liberation Army (PLA) posts, relocation of troops, and rapid strengthening of road infrastructure across the friction points in occupied Aksai Chin over the past 30 days – all clearly indicate that China is preparing for a long haul along the 3,488km Line of Actual Control (LAC), keeping up the pressure on India even as the two countries talk disengagement and de-escalataion.The ninth round of the India-China military dialogue on disengagement and de-escalation is expected to take place soon.According to senior military commanders, PLA is constructing more than 10 dugouts each at Samar Lungpa, 30km east of Karakoram Pass; and at Mount Sajum, south of Rechin La. It is also increasing troop deployment at Qizil Jilga, 70km east of Daulet Beg Oldi (DBO).  Also Watch | Indian Army sets up modern habitats for troops deployed in LadakhAlso Read| ‘Stressful relations’: Jaishankar analyses China ties, then some adviceIndia and China have major differences on their respective perceptions of the LAC at these points, as noted during the failed exchange of maps on June 17, 2002. This difference is as significant as 176 sq-km at Samar Lungpa, and 129 sq-km at Mount Sajum. Qizil Jilga is a major PLA outpost. Although a section of South Block believes that PLA wants to disengage and de-escalate soon, available intelligence, such as this, point to the contrary, and means that the Indian Army may well have to spend the entire winter in subpolar Ladakh.  For instance, the movement of over 60 heavy-equipment transport vehicles has been noticed on the road from Shendong to Spanggur Gap, just south of Chushul, and surveillance equipment is being installed by the Chinese all along the LAC in Ladakh. Chinese tank transporters have also been noticed at Gobak, 60km east of LAC indicating that PLA has not let their guard down. Finally, there has been redeployment of troops in Aksai Chin at Rudog, Mapotheng, Sumxi, and west of Chang La, north-east of Demchok.Roads and infrastructureAccording to Indian national security planners, the Chinese army is undertaking strategic road construction for faster deployment on LAC with focus on the Depsang Bulge area and the DBO sector. It is understood that PLA is constructing a road north of Karakoram Pass to Chip Chap Valley for faster deployment across the DBO post. Road construction is also ongoing near Chuti Chang La, across the Depsang Bulge, a mere 8km from LAC. Depsang Bulge has been a friction point between the two armies since early 2013 transgressions by PLA. While there have been news reports about PLA deciding to move back to Finger 8 on the north bank of Pangong Tso from its present position of Finger 4, it is, in reality, undertaking an exercise to widen and black tar a road from Finger 6 to Finger 8. Again the motive is faster deployment of PLA in case of a flare-up on the north banks of the frozen salt water lake.Also Read: PM Modi rides on Arjun’s ‘aatmanirbhar’ fire power to send message to Pakistan, ChinaWith PLA fully deployed across LAC, China has stationed container housing modules across all the friction points including Jeevan Nullah in Depsang Plains and Dehra La across the Bulge area.

He had said that the Kerala government will not allow the CAG to destroy KIIFB.The CAG had earlier this week clarified that an audit report on state finances for the year ended March 2019 was submitted on November 6 to be tabled in the Kerala Assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-assembly-speaker-seeks-minister-s-clarification-on-allegations-of-leaking-cag-report/story-EgrH8o8z0nCgD9zDRIOitJ.html
19-11-2020||India||Bhima Koregaon case: Poet Varavara Rao to be moved to hospital for 15 days||The Bombay high court on Wednesday ordered Maharashtra to shift octogenarian Telugu poet P Varavara Rao from Mumbai’s Taloja prison to Nanavati Hospital for 15 days to undergo medical treatment, with the state underlining that this was a special case that could not be treated as a precedent. The order by a two-judge bench, comprising justices SS Shinde and Madhav Jamdar, came on a petition by Rao’s wife Hemlata who alleged that the poet’s health had drastically deteriorated and that his continued detention -- for two years now -- was a breach of his fundamental rights.The state and the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the case, first opposed any transfer, then said the poet -- who is facing charges under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for his alleged role in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon riots -- could be moved to a government facility and finally that he should pay for his treatment.But the court rejected all contentions, and asked that Rao not be discharged from hospital without its assent. “Ultimately, there is a man on death bed. He is 80 years old and has serious disease. He will come to court. Can the state say, no we will treat him in Taloja?” the court said.Rao’s lawyer Indira Jaising told the court that his family feared he could die if he was not shifted to a hospital and also sought bail. The court said it will hear the bail plea on December 3 and sought Rao’s medical report after treatment at Nanavati Hospital. Jaising told the court that Rao was bedridden, was frequently delirious and had lost comprehension of reality. She also submitted that Rao earlier tested positive for Covid-19 and that his family was worried that he may suffer complications in the form of organ failure given his age.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for the NIA, opposed the plea and said that Rao could be shifted to JJ Hospital as all the tests could be conducted there.The court observed that government hospitals were overburdened due to Covid-19 and asked Singh whether he will admit his relatives to JJ or St George’s hospitals. He said it was not as if people were not being admitted and treated in these places. He also said that shifting Rao to Nanavati Hospital would set a wrong precedent.Jaising objected and said Rao’s family found him lying in a pool of urine in JJ hospital and that if Rao died for the want of proper medical treatment, it would amount to custodial death. “Death is inevitable but there should be some dignity,” she said. The court directed that the cost of Rao’s treatment at Nanavati Hospital, a private facility, will be borne by the state government. Public prosecutor Deepak Thakre, representing the state government, initially suggested Rao should bear the cost of treatment at Nanavati Hospital.But Jaising argued that the Supreme Court held a state could not cite lack of money as a reason to not look after a citizen’s fundamental rights. The bench accepted the submission and reminded the state that even at the Nanavati Hospital, Rao would continue to remain in judicial custody. “He (Rao) is in your (state) custody. Even in the hospital he will remain in your custody, so you pay for the treatment,” the bench said.Thakre then spoke to Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh and told the court that the state had no objection to the plea. He said Rao being shifted to a private multispeciality hospital would be treated as a “special case” and not a precedent for other cases.Rao is among over a dozen scholars and activists arrested for their alleged links to Maoists and for allegedly instigating violence at Bhima Koregaon near Pune on January 1, 2018. The activists are accused of making provocative speeches at an event called the Elgar Parishad in Pune on December 31, 2017, and conspiring to foment the riots that killed one person and left many injured.Hemlatha moved the court last week after learning about Rao’s deteriorating health at the prison hospital.Jaising submitted that when Rao was arrested two years ago, he was healthy. She said his condition deteriorated inside jail and added that co-accused Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira took care of Rao but they were not medically trained. Jaising blamed the state’s negligence for a head injury Rao suffered while arguing for the need to shift her client to the Nanavati Hospital. Jaising said Rao’s mental health was failing and his ability to eat was also compromised. Rao was arrested in August 2018. He was first taken to JJ Hospital on May 28 after he fell unconscious, but was discharged on June 1. The family alleged that Rao was discharged in a hurried manner to obstruct his bail plea. His bail was denied by an NIA court on June 26.Rao continued to show signs of delirium and was admitted to JJ Hospital again on July 13. Later, he was shifted to St George’s Hospital after he tested positive for Covid-19.On July 13, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued notice to Maharashtra government, asking it to ensure Rao was taken care of. Maharashtra chief secretary responded on July 22, saying adequate care was provided.In October, Hemlatha moved the Supreme Court seeking bail but a three-judge bench on October 29 asked the Bombay high court to hear his plea at the earliest. Last week, a division bench of the Bombay high court directed the state government and NIA to arrange for an immediate video medical consultation for Rao with doctors at Nanavati Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhima-koregaon-case-poet-varavara-rao-to-be-moved-to-hospital-for-15-days/story-0K0XkqryENMwlE0rfp3GXN.html

China is willing to promoting sustained cooperation with other countries on vaccine development and international fight against Covid-19 to defeat the virus at an early date,” he added.There are several vaccines being developed by China. Some of them are already being administered to people on an emergency basis.Speaking at 12th BRICS summit, Xi Jinping said that China is prepared to cooperate with India and other BRICS nations in the development of vaccines against Covid-19.Xi said: “It is important that we support WHO’s a crucial leadership role in this endeavour. As we speak, Chinese companies are working with their Russian and Brazilian partners on phase-III clinical trials of vaccines, and we are prepared to have cooperation with South Africa and India as well. China has joined the COVAX facility, a platform on which we will share vaccines with other countries, developing countries in particular.”More than 55.94 million people are known to have been infected by Covid-19 worldwide.

According the police, some local villagers first noticed the bodies of the monkeys after a strong stench emitted from the spot located on a hillock, and immediately informed the police and forest authorities.Mahabubabad (rural) sub-inspector of police Ch Ramesh Babu told HT that the incident might have taken place around five to six days ago. “We have registered a case under section 429 (killing and poisoning of animals) of Indian Penal Code (IPC), apart from section 11(l) of the Prevention of Cruelty towards Animals Act, 1960,” Babu said. District forest officer (DFO) Poloju Krishnamachary said the decomposed bodies of the monkeys were cremated in the afternoon.Forest officials suspect some locals, who could not tolerate the menace created by monkeys, could be behind the killings. The DFO said inquiries by the police revealed that some animal catchers from Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh had come to Mahabubabad some time ago and their involvement also could not be ruled out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bodies-of-40-monkeys-found-in-jute-bags-in-telengana-village/story-JFo0Y13GD21wXN4AOvp2RO.html
19-11-2020||India||4 terrorists killed, policeman injured in gun battle in Jammu’s Nagrota||Security forces gunned down four terrorists of Jaish-e-Mohammad in a gunfight near Nagrota town in the Jammu district of Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday, officials said. A policeman was also injured in the gun battle, which started around 4.50am near the toll plaza in the Ban area of Nagrota on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway.Officer of the Special Operations Group--Kuldeep Raj, 32, of Akhnoor in Jammu district was injured in the exchange of fire. He was taken to Government Medical College and Hospital in Jammu with injuries on the neck. His condition has been stated to be stable.“In the exchange of fire four terrorists were eliminated. Terrorists lobbed grenades on security forces during checking. The truck also caught fire and a few grenades also exploded inside it during the exchanges,” Mukesh Singh, inspector general of police of Jammu zone, said.According to officials familiar with the development, the terrorists came in the truck and were on their way to Kashmir. “It was put to check by the policemen at the toll plaza because we had intelligence inputs with us,” one of the officers said.Watch | Four terrorists gunned down by security forces in Jammu’s Nagrota A senior officer said that it seemed the JeM terrorists adopted the similar modus-operandi of infiltrating from across the international border in Jammu region before boarding a Kashmir-bound truck on Pathankot-Jammu national highway the preceding night. “However, forces eliminated them in a swift operation,” he said. He also said that the terrorists are likely to have entered through fresh infiltration from the Samba sector.Shivnandan Singh, a spokesperson of the Central Reserve Police Force, said Thursday’s gunfight was similar to the encounter on January this year as a group of terrorists opened fire at a joint party of police and CRPF at the Ban toll plaza. Singh was referring to an encounter on January 31 when a group of terrorists had similarly opened fire at a police team near the toll plaza, triggering a gunfight in which three terrorists were killed and a policeman was injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/encounter-between-terrorists-and-security-forces-underway-in-jammu-s-nagrota/story-Ag2WvdZIbcCtrM5bVAPmiM.html
19-11-2020||India||India, US are committed to rule of law unlike China, say US Senators||Senator John Cornyn on Wednesday said that the United States and India relationship will grow as both countries, unlike China, are committed to the rule of law which gives confidence to business and investors.Speaking in a virtual interaction on the theme “U.S. and India: Post Election Perspectives”, US Senator Mark Warner said that China follows the policy of authoritarian capitalism as it allows “ferocious domestic competition until the national champion arises” and then the champion is backed by the government in the world market.“I think what we have seen is that China has this model where they allow ferocious domestic competition until the national champion arises on Huawei. That national champion then gets 75 per cent of the Chinese domestic market, and that translates into 20 per cent of the global market. And then the Chinese government would back that national champion with, in the case of Huawei 100 billion dollars,” Warner said.He further said, “There is no American or Indian company, alone, that can compete with that. I think what I have seen is a growing consensus, both from Indian government representatives and particularly from Indian Americans that maybe a decade ago India wanted to kind of skirt, not being on the China side or on the American side. But I think echoing what Senator Cornyn said we both are nations that operate under the rule of law.”Reiterating the strong India-US relations, Senator Cornyn said, “We have a large diaspora of Indian Americans in Texas. This is really how I got involved and, of course, through the Indo-American chambers in places like Dallas... We have earned a lot, and also learned about the incredible potential of the enhanced relationship between our two countries.”He further said that China doesn’t play by the rules as India does. “Both the US and India are committed to rule of law, which gives confidence to business and investors. To me, that’s one of the greatest strengths of the US-India relationship. The Anglo jurisprudential heritage of both of our countries, and observing the rule of law and playing by the rules --in my opinion give greater predictability and competence to job creators and investors, and, I think, this is one reason why we are continuing to grow closer and closer together,” he added.Another speaker in the discussion, former US Ambassador to India Richard Verma recalled the talks held between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President-elect Joe Biden.“You may have seen that Prime Minister Modi had a good call with President-Elect Biden. They talked about building out the strategic partnership, vaccine development, Covid-19 and climate change,” he said.To this, Warner said, “I think both India and the United States need to rethink the supply chain. I think the US should rejoin some of these international efforts. I think we need to be like the trillion-dollar effort led by the European Union on vaccine distribution. The recent news on vaccination is very positive. But we need to have an international distribution system.”On the US-India defense relationship, Cornyn said amid China’s continuous threat in the international waters the countries (QUAD) need to support each other.“Yesterday (on Tuesday), I was talking to Indian Ambassador to USA Taranjit Singh Sandhu about this. While America has friends like India, China does not have many friends. I think we need to recognise the strength of friendship among ourselves like through the recent military exercises that were never undertaken,” he said.He further said, “It’s obvious that China is not going to stop to threaten freedom of navigation and international sea lanes and jeopardise trade the economy of countries like India and the world. Hence, we have to continue to support one another.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-us-are-committed-to-rule-of-law-unlike-china-say-us-senators/story-yT7AACyliDhTfn8lDmi3QI.html
19-11-2020||India||US Navy plans to revive tactical formation focused on Indian, Pacific oceans||The US Navy plans to revive a tactical formation that will focus on the Indian and Pacific Oceans and work with partners such as India and Singapore to cope with potential contingencies, a top American naval defence official has said. Kenneth Braithwaite, secretary of the US Navy, made the announcement about establishing the First Fleet while addressing the Naval Submarine League’s annual symposium on Tuesday. The First Fleet, which will be one of the US Navy’s “numbered fleets” or major tactical units, could be based out of Singapore in the long run, said Braithwaite, according to a report by USNI News, the journal of the US Naval Institute. “We want to stand up a new numbered fleet. And we want to put that numbered fleet in the crossroads between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and we’re really going to have an Indo-PACOM footprint,” Braithwaite said. “We can’t just rely on the 7th Fleet in Japan. We have to look to our other allies and partners like Singapore, like India, and actually put a numbered fleet where it would be extremely relevant if, God forbid, we were to ever to get in any kind of a dust-up,” he said. Braithwaite’s remarks come against the backdrop of the navies of India, Australia, Japan and the US kicking off second phase of the Malabar exercise in the Arabian Sea. The move assumes significance because of the current focus on China’s assertive actions across the Indo-Pacific, especially the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-navy-plans-to-revive-tactical-formation-focused-on-indian-pacific-oceans/story-5YajDiC5AtVU97oJhM262O.html

19-11-2020||India||Sudarshan News show may fan communal issues: Centre||The Centre found the controversial television series “Bindas Bol– UPSC Jihad” telecast by Sudarshan News to be in bad taste, offensive and likely to promote communal issues according to a November 4 order issued to the channel by the ministry of information and broadcasting, which has been reproduced in an affidavit filed by the ministry before the Supreme Court on Wednesday.The Centre issued a show cause notice on September 23 to the channel for an alleged violation of the programme code on September 23, eight days after the Supreme Court stayed the telecast of the remaining episodes of the controversial TV series while dealing with a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Firoz iqbal Khan.The Centre constituted an Inter Ministerial Committee (IMC) that examined all the material submitted by the channel . The Committee submitted its conclusions to the ministry of information and broadcasting on October 1, following which the latter held another round of hearings with the channel executives.Finally the ministry decided that, “the manner in which the channel has gone about its exposition, including its comments on the selection process, examination system of the Civil Services, portrays one community and Union Public Services Commission (UPSC) in bad light, and the channel could well have avoided utterances and videos which were not in good taste or decency.”The channel argued that the programme was not intended to target the Muslim community but focused on the activities of one Zakat Foundation of India that was financing the coaching of Muslim students with an intention to capture the Indian bureaucracy and the country.The ministry concurred with the finding of the IMC that the issue of alleged terror links of Zakat Foundation of India and its source of funding were disputed facts, requiring a full investigation to adjudicate the veracity, truthfulness or falsity of the claim made in the programme.The ministry’s order said, “While freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right, the tone and tenor of episodes telecast do indicate that the channel has through the various utterances and audio-visual content breached the Programme Code. The Ministry finds that they are not in good taste, offensive and has likelihood of promoting communal attitudes. ”The Ministry cautioned Sudarshan to be careful in future and asked the channel to review, modify and moderate the content of the future episodes to ensure there is no violation of the programme code.The apex court is expected to take up this affidavit on Thursday and the order of November 4 will remain subject to final orders to be passed by the Supreme Court in the PIL proceeding. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta will be appearing for the Centre to explain the findings arrived at by the ministry.The apex court on September 15, stayed the telecast of the remaining episodes of the Bindas Bol show . The PIL petitioner informed the Court that the Centre had previously found no violation of the programme code and allowed four episodes of the controversial series to be aired. When the court started examining the issue of whether the channel could be permitted to air content that portrayed a certain religious community in bad light, the Centre issued a show cause notice to the channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sudarshan-news-show-may-fan-communal-issues-centre/story-xowDmD7Um9rijx1N3UcfEN.html

A bench of justices Pritinker Diwaker and SC Sharma has sought responses from the Central government, state government, the superintendent of Mathura district jail and sub-inspector of Maant police station in Mathura, Prabal Pratap Singh, on the habeas corpus pleas filed on behalf of the accused -- Atiq-ur- Rehman from Muzaffar Nagar, Masood from Bahraich and Alam from Rampur.Seeking release from jail, the petition has challenged the order of the magistrate by which the three were sent to judicial remand calling it unlawful. The petition said that the Mathura chief judicial magistrate did not have the jurisdiction to try the matter or remand the petitioners to custody. It added that Rehman and Masood were going to meet the bereaved family while Alam was ferrying them to the destination. Representing the petitioners, senior advocate SFA Naqvi argued, “The petitioners are unfortunate victims and scapegoats of the high-handedness of the police authorities. None of them are PFI members. They have committed no offence, which is clear from a bare perusal of the sections slapped on them and the allegations in the FIR, which are completely false and bogus, and no case against them is made out.”The three men were arrested by Mathura police on October 5 and charged under various sections of the IPC, along with sections 17 and 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and relevant sections of the IT Act. Police had alleged that the three had links PFI student wing Campus Front of India (CFI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-notice-to-centre-up-on-plea-for-release-of-men-held-for-alleged-pfi-membership/story-Vt7FI1zPIDjV1z3nv2mSQI.html
19-11-2020||India||Army sets up winter habitat for troops in Ladakh amid border row with China||With the temperature set to dip substantially in the Ladakh sector in the coming months, and no solution to the border row with China in sight, the Indian Army has completed the setting up of modern habitat for thousands of soldiers deployed in forward areas to deal with any misadventure by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), officials familiar with developments said on Wednesday. Temperatures in some pockets where the Indian Army is holding posts can dip to minus-40 degrees Celsius, with remote high-altitude areas also likely to receive up to 40 feet of snow during peak winter. “Apart from smart camps with integrated facilities, which have been built over the years, additional state-of-the-art habitat with arrangements for electricity, water, heating facilities, health and hygiene, has been created to accommodate front-line troops,” said one of the officials cited above, asking not to be named. Fresh images from Ladakh on Wednesday provided glimpses of the infrastructure the army has created to support its forward deployed troops at a time when talks to resolve the border situation remain deadlocked and both armies are prepared for a long haul in the Ladakh theatre. “Troops on the front-line have been accommodated in heated tents... Adequate civil infrastructure has also been identified to cater for any emergency,” said a second official. Also Read: PM Modi spells out India’s war strategyAt the Siachen base camp and lower heights of the glacier, soldiers live in habitats similar to the ones that have come up in the Ladakh sector, with arrangements for electricity, water and heating, the officials said. Troops deployed at extreme altitudes in Siachen live in heated tents (just like front-line troops along the contested Line of Actual Control) -- almost 80 per cent of the posts on the glacier are located above 16,000 feet, with Bana post towering above the rest at 21,753 feet. “Frontline troops have to live in tents. You can’t have prefab units on the border. These units are basically to house reserve troops,” the officials said. The Indian soldiers are holding positions at heights of almost 20,000 feet in the Finger Area on the northern bank of Pangong Tso. India has made vigorous attempts to support its high-altitude deployments in the sector, including the supply of specialised winter clothing from the US. The country has imported more than 15,000 sets of extended cold weather clothing system (ECWCS) from the US, with the emergency supply made by activating the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Association (Lemoa). India signed Lemoa, the first of the three foundational agreements proposed by Washington to deepen bilateral military cooperation, with the US in August 2016. In a statement made in the Lok Sabha in September, defence minister Rajnath Singh said the morale and motivation of Indian soldiers was very high and they were being provisioned with suitable clothing, habitat and the required defence wherewithal. Also Read: India concerned over situation in South China Sea that ‘erode trust’“It’s a question of force preservation and sustainability during winters and the modern habitat created for soldiers will ensure operational readiness and high morale,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations. The Indian Army and PLA have held eight rounds of talks to reduce friction along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) without any breakthrough. At the last round of talks on November 6, the two sides said they would ensure that their front-line soldiers “exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation” along the LAC. They also agreed to hold the ninth round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers soon “but no date has been fixed for that dialogue yet,” the officials said. India is pushing for comprehensive disengagement at all flashpoints and restoration of status quo ante of early April during the talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-sets-up-winter-habitat-for-troops-in-ladakh-amid-border-row-with-china/story-jdAkC13Aj9MZJWuLDvX3ZK.html
19-11-2020||India||UP child molester used new gadgets to lure victims: CBI||An Uttar Pradesh government employee, who is facing charges of sexually abusing 50 children for a decade, used to allegedly target poor families because the victims could be lured with gadgets and electronics, said senior Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials on Wednesday.Ram Bhavan Singh, a suspended junior engineer in the state irrigation department posted in Chitrakoot , was arrested by CBI from Banda district on Monday. If found guilty, he faces life imprisonment. He is facing charges under the Information Technology Act, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly sexually exploiting children between 5 and 16, for a decade and selling videos and photographs of sexual abuse on the dark web to paedophiles across the world.The CBI recovered eight mobile phones, around eight lakh rupees in cash, sex toys, laptop, and other digital evidence carrying huge amount of child sexual abuse materials (CSAM), officials said. During examination of the phones and laptop, investigators gathered 66 videos and 610 photographs of children, said a CBI official on condition of anonymity. A second CBI official said Singh targeted children of street vendors, daily wagers, pavement dwellers and domestic helps who worked at his two-room rented house in Chitrakoot, where he lived for 10 years. The children hailed from Banda, Chitrakoot and Hamirpur districts, the official added. “During interrogation, the accused revealed that he targeted children who could easily be lured with money, electronic gadgets, eatables or any other thing they were deprived of. Ram Bhawan believed that he could easily handle the families,” the second official stated. The official said on two occasions in the past 10 years, the children complained about him to their parents, but Singh allegedly hushed up the matter by paying money to the poor parents. The official also explained that Singh hailed from Banda, was posted in neighbouring Chitrakoot district for 11 years and had several relatives from Hamirpur -- three districts where the majority of his alleged victims were from.Singh was produced in a Pocso court in Banda on Wednesday and the court decided to hear the CBI’s plea seeking five-day custody on Thursday. The CBI needs his custody remand in connection with the ongoing physical verification of his alleged victims in three districts of the Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh.The remand application was filed in the court of additional district judge (five) Rizwan Ahmad on Wednesday.CBI counsel Manoj Kumar, Ram Sufal Singh and Jai Prakash Sahu said the agency needed the remand to complete the probe. Singh's counsel Arvind Singh Chandel opposed the plea and said he was not aware of the case fully, nor was he given any documents. The court granted him a day to study the documents. Outside the court, a large crowd gathered to catch a glimpse of the accused. Married for 18 years, Singh allegedly trapped the children by showering affection on them, said a third CBI official. “His relatives could not assess his ulterior motive, thinking he was making up for being childless. Apart from the videos and pictures, the CBI found a number of compact discs and video-making equipment,” added the official. Singh came on the radar of the CBI’s Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Prevention/Investigation (OCSAE) unit after the agency busted the location of uploading child pornography recently. “A scrutiny of emails of the accused revealed that he was allegedly in constant touch with several individuals (Indian and foreign nationals) for the purpose of sharing CSAM,” said a fourth agency official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-child-molester-used-new-gadgets-to-lure-victims-cbi/story-TA7Yi8gYHd6St71zOozBPI.html
19-11-2020||India||Amit Shah, JP Nadda to visit Bengal almost every month||Union home minister Amit Shah and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda will visit West Bengal separately every month until the assembly election, due in the state next year, to boost the morale of workers, BJP leaders said on Wednesday as the party ramps up its strategy in the poll-bound state. “Amit Shah and JP Nadda are expected to visit the state separately every month for at least two days till the assembly elections are over. The dates are yet to be finalised. Their regular visits will boost the morale of workers,” West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh told media persons in Kolkata. Fine-tuning its strategy, the BJP also appointed central leaders to oversee poll preparedness in five organisational zones in to which the party has carved up the state. Senior party leaders said that based on their reports, the party’s central leaders in Delhi will prepare a final battle plan for the state. Senior leaders Sunil Deodhar, Dushyant Gautam, Harish Dwivedi, Vinod Sonkar and Vinod Tawde, who have been made observers for each of the five organisational zones will camp in their respective zones -- North Bengal, Rarh Banga (south-western districts), Nabadwip, Midnapore and Kolkata -- till Friday to draft the reports. Also Read: TMC to keep tabs on 5 BJP central leaders deputed to Bengal ahead of polls“It will basically be a SWOT [strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats] analysis. This is for the first time that central observers are being sent to take stock of poll preparedness in the zones. Earlier, central leaders used to be appointed as observers for an entire state,” said a senior BJP leader familiar with the plan. Senior leaders said that an analysis of the party’s strengths and weaknesses, at the booth level, becomes all the more important because amidst a pandemic, the Election Commission of India is likely increase the number of auxiliary booths to maintain Covid-19 protocols. The West Bengal assembly elections are likely to be held in April-May 2021. Kailash Vijayvargiya is the BJP’s state in-charge while the party’s national secretary Arvind Menon and Amit Malviya, the party’s IT cell chief, are co-incharges. The ruling Trinamool Congress in the state on Wednesday took a jibe at the BJP, saying that the party has lost faith in its state leaders and is asking central leaders to intervene. “BJP’s central leaders are stepping in. This clearly indicates that the party has lost faith in the state leadership. The party is however still dreaming of winning the elections. It is not bad to dream,” said TMC MP Saugata Roy. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 constituencies in its best-ever performance in a contest that was marred by political killings and violence. It also won 40.2% of the votes cast. The TMC won 22 seats and 43.3% of the votes.Also Read| ‘BJP working on ground to defeat Mamata Banerjee, over 83% polling booths already covered’: Dilip GhoshDuring his two day-visit to the state on November 5 and 6, home minister Shah held a meeting with party workers and reviewed poll preparedness.

The scenario will get clearer within the next two to three months as situations unfold. But it is a fact that the BJP, over the years, has become the principal opposition party and this time they are eyeing for the Bengal polls,” said Amal Mukherjee, a political commentator and a former principal of Presidency College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-jp-nadda-to-visit-bengal-almost-every-month/story-TVoCDxG89kfwfdb429wpSI.html
19-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The world’s first at-home Covid-19 test was approved (for emergency use) by the US Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday. Made by Lucira Health, this is a molecular test which is relatively inexpensive — according to the company’s website, it will cost under $50 — and quick (30 minutes). The company also claims that the product was 94% as accurate as the gold-standard RT-PCR test in identifying positive cases and 98% as accurate in identifying negative ones, which makes the home test fast, relatively cheap, and accurate.On Wednesday, news reports said the Feluda test, developed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research’s Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, would be launched in Delhi, but only for use in laboratories. The test, which uses CRISPR , can also be done at home, but it looks like a home version could take some time. Also Read: Feluda test kit set to hit the market on ThursdayThe Lucira test uses a technology called RT-LAMP or Reverse Transcription Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification. Molecular tests respond to the genetic material of the virus, ribonucleic acid, or RNA. But before they do this, RNA has to be converted into complementary DNA, or cDNA, which is achieved using an enzyme called Reverse Transcriptase and a process called Reverse Transcription (it’s the reason many people use the terms interchangeably). LAMP then amplifies the cDNA, which is what shows up in the final result. In the case of the Lucira test, this is through a unit whose LED indicators change colour.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicAccurate, inexpensive, rapid tests hold the key to getting the pandemic under control. Accurate, inexpensive, rapid, home tests are even better. RT-LAMP tests aren’t based on some new breakthrough technology, though. They have been around for years. Back in May, India’s health minister, Harsh Vardhan, announced that a CSIR lab would work with an arm of India’s largest industrial conglomerate Reliance to commercialise its own rapid and inexpensive RT-LAMP tests for Covid. That hasn’t happened yet, though, in October, a Kochi-based company, Agappe Diagnostics, launched its own LAMP test for Covid-19, albeit for use in laboratories. Agappe’s test has been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research.It’s possible that the announcement of an approval for Lucira’s home test could open the floodgates; reliable home tests will remove a critical bottleneck in the current testing and diagnosis process, helping break the chain of infections. India’s health ministry and ICMR should work towards making accurate home tests available for those who need them (read that as those with symptoms, or those who have been exposed to an infected person; the FDA has said that Lucira’s home test will require a doctor’s prescription).Also Read: Covid-19 lockdowns test the economic endurance of desperate AmericansPS: I usually avoid post scripts, but a recent paper (based on research) sheds more light on the immunity of those already infected by Covid-19 to reinfection, something Dispatch 204 on November 13 dealt with in the context of the findings of the latest round of Delhi’s sero survey. In the paper, uploaded on November 16 on pre-print server bioRXiv, researchers at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, California, and others, claim (on the basis of a study of 185 Covid-19 patients) that many patients retain immune cells capable of recognising and fighting the disease even six months after infection. This adds to a growing volume of evidence that while infected people may show no trace of specific antibodies that fight the Sars-CoV-2 virus after some time, this does not mean a loss of immunity, with many possessing B-cells and T-cells that can remember and fight the virus. Theoretically, this means that vaccines should provide the same length of protection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-3LYq75AZGsoSocwQXQdMLN.html
19-11-2020||India||TMC to keep tabs on 5 BJP central leaders deputed to Bengal ahead of polls||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) is keeping a close watch on the movements and activities of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) five central leaders who are in the state to evaluate organizational strengths and weaknesses of the district units in south and north Bengal ahead of the assembly polls due in about five months. TMC’s district leaders said that every movement of Sunil Deodhar, Dushyant Gautam, Vinod Tawde, Harish Dwivedi and Vinod Sonkar are being watched by party workers and feedback is being sent to leaders in Kolkata. The five BJP leaders have been put in charge of different organizational zones in Bengal. They started holding internal meetings from Wednesday morning. “This brigade of outsiders that is coming to Bengal to capture power will be fought back by people of the state. We are confident about that. These people have no idea about the culture, history and heritage of Bengal,” TMC Rajya Sabha chief whip Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said at a press conference on Wednesday. “We have to keep a close watch on these outsiders. We have to find out if they are here to create communal trouble, divide people or, indulge in horse trading. Our workers have been asked to be on the alert,” said Roy. “Our workers have been told to put up resistance if any effort is made to create trouble,” he added. “These people are living in a fool’s paradise. They think winning 18 Lok Sabha seats (in 2019) is equal to winning the assembly polls. Voting patterns in Lok Sabha and assembly polls are quite different,” said Roy. To stop divisions in its ranks prior to the polls, the TMC is also making efforts to pacify rebel transport minister Suvendu Adhikari who will address a big rally at Ramnagar in East Midnapore on Thursday where he is likely to announce his next course of action. He has kept the party guessing by avoiding all political programmes, government events and cabinet meetings in the last two months. This led to speculations that he might join the BJP.Two senior TMC Lok Sabha members, Saugata Roy and Sudip Bandopadhyay, are in touch with Adhikari. Roy even held a meeting with him on Monday night. To maintain secrecy, Adhikari reached the venue in a different car and without his security personnel. Both the MPs refused to comment on the issue. On Wednesday, Adhikari addressed a rally organised by people associated with the co-operative movement. To the relief of TMC leaders, he did not make any controversial statement and did not even refer to the party. Senior TMC leaders told HT last week that Adhikari is unhappy with the chief minister’s nephew and Lok Sabha MP Abhishek Banerjee and election strategist Prashant Kishor for making the recent organizational changes and wants the party to field candidates of his choice at 65 assembly seats spread across several districts. TMC leaders said that various programmes are being undertaken by the party to reach out to voters physically and through the social media. The TMC’s information technology cell recently started an interactive campaign where people can mark themselves “safe from the BJP.” The campaign has crossed the one million mark, the party has claimed. Later this month, another campaign will start to showcase performances of the TMC government. It will be named Bangadhwani (the call of Bengal).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-to-keep-tabs-on-5-bjp-central-leaders-deputed-to-bengal-ahead-of-polls/story-Plm1kwWEz20OipY54VLCUO.html

In an interview to Dainik Bhaskar, former Union finance minister Chidambaram said that the Congress fought more seats in Bihar than its organisational strength, and called for a “comprehensive review” of the poll results. He added, however, that he was “more worried” about the by-election results. In by-elections to 59 assembly seats across 11 states, the Congress contested 55 but won only 12. Chidambaram’s comments raising concerns and seeking a review come at a time when differences in the Congress have resurfaced after the election results over similar post-election worries aired by former Union minister Kapil Sibal. As part of the Mahagathbandhan, or Grand Alliance, the Congress contested 70 seats but managed to win just 19, impacting the Opposition’s chances of ousting the ruling coalition from power; it won just nine of the 28 seats in Madhya Pradesh, and failed to open its account in Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Manipur. “I feel the Congress contested more seats than its organisational strength in Bihar. The Congress was given 25 seats where the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) or its allies had been winning for 20 years. It should have refused to contest from these seats, and fielded only 45 candidates,” Chidambaram said.“I am more worried about by-poll results that show the Congress has no organisational presence on the ground or it has weakened considerably,” Chidambaram added. “...Remember, not long ago we had won [assembly elections] Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.” Earlier this week, Sibal insisted that the Congress needs efficient and senior leaders to manage elections. “We are yet to hear from the Congress party their views on our recent performance in Bihar and in the by-elections. Maybe they think all is well and that it should be business as usual,” he told The Indian Express.Sibal was one of the 23 signatories to a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in August seeking internal elections and organisational overhaul.Also Read: In the Congress, the lack of ideological clarity | HT EditorialSibal’s latest remarks have triggered a war of words within the party, with Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury the latest senior leader to attack the former Union minister. “Instead of giving sermons sitting in AC rooms, he (Sibal) should work on the ground. Lecturing others without doing anything won’t help. Only calling for introspection without doing anything on our own is of no use,” Chowdhury said, adding that those unhappy with the party’s functioning are “free to leave instead of embarrassing it”.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said this week that Sibal’s remarks have “hurt the sentiments” of Congress workers and reminded him that the party had been through several crises in the past. Former Union minister Salman Khurshid, too, seemed at odds with Sibal. In a Facebook post, Khurshid said that if the mood of the electorate is resistant to the liberal values the party has espoused and cherished, it should be prepared for a long struggle rather than look for short cuts to get back into power. Hyderabad-based political analyst C Narasimha Rao said the Congress party has weakened on the ground whenever it has been out of power, and added that the party’s choice of regional leadership is partly to blame for this. Meanwhile, some members of the group of 23 dissenters who signed the August letter have held meetings over the past few days after the Bihar elections to discuss their next move. One member of this group said on condition of anonymity that the group has moved beyond writing letters and will soon come out with its future strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-rumblings-grow-pc-seeks-bypoll-show-review/story-pkAhxpiO6RGR0KyNIQAeOK.html
19-11-2020||India||US Navy plans to revive formation focused on Indian and Pacific oceans||The US Navy plans to revive a tactical formation that will focus on the Indian and Pacific Oceans and work with partners such as India and Singapore to cope with potential contingencies, a top American naval defence official has said. Kenneth Braithwaite, secretary of the US Navy or the top civilian official in the department of the navy, made the announcement about establishing the First Fleet while addressing the Naval Submarine League’s annual symposium on Tuesday. The First Fleet, which will be one of the US Navy’s “numbered fleets” or major tactical units, could be based out of Singapore in the long run, said Braithwaite, according to a report by USNI News, the journal of the US Naval Institute. “We want to stand up a new numbered fleet. And we want to put that numbered fleet in the crossroads between the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and we’re really going to have an Indo-PACOM footprint,” Braithwaite said. “We can’t just rely on the 7th Fleet in Japan. We have to look to our other allies and partners like Singapore, like India, and actually put a numbered fleet where it would be extremely relevant if, God forbid, we were to ever to get in any kind of a dust-up,” he said. “More importantly, it can provide a much more formidable deterrence. So we’re going to create the First Fleet, and we’re going to put it, if not Singapore right out of the chocks, we’re going to look to make it more expeditionary-oriented and move it across the Pacific until it is where our allies and partners see that it could best assist them as well as to assist us.” Braithwaite’s remarks came against the backdrop of the navies of India, Australia, Japan and the US kicking off the second phase of the Malabar exercise in the Arabian Sea. The move assumes significance because of the current focus on China’s assertive actions across the Indo-Pacific, especially the South China Sea. The US and the other members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue – India, Australia and Japan – have said they are committed to ensuring freedom of navigation and a rules-based order in this region. The First Fleet existed from January 1947 to February 1973, when it was redesignated as the Third Fleet. The US Navy currently has seven active numbered fleets. Each numbered fleet has task forces and other units for specific operations. Braithwaite, who is expected to visit India soon, said he had not spoken to acting defense secretary Christopher Miller about the plan for the First Fleet but had “crossed all the other t’s and dotted all the other i’s”. An unnamed US defence official told USNI News Braithwaite had discussed the proposal with former defense secretary Mark Esper, who was onboard with it. During his address at the symposium, Braithwaite also referred to the Chinese showing “their aggressiveness around the globe”. “Every single one of our allies and partners are concerned about how aggressive the Chinese have been. I would argue with anybody that not since the War of 1812 has the US and our sovereignty been under the kind of pressures that we see today,” he added. The US alone cannot stand up to China and nations around the Pacific and the globe need to assist in “pushing back militarily and economically if there was a chance for deterrence to work”, he was quoted as saying. Braithwaite said he would travel to India in the coming weeks to discuss security challenges and how the two sides can help each other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-navy-plans-to-revive-formation-focused-on-indian-and-pacific-oceans/story-rdLbRBbVy02UMVXjrodTOJ.html
19-11-2020||Today's||Why Punjab should not go the Bihar way on agriculture reforms||The Centre claims the recent farm reforms are historic as they have the potential to bring a revolutionary improvement in the economic condition of farmers. Before analysing the prospective impact of the three new laws, particularly the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, which affects regulated markets, it is important to study the post-reform agriculture scenario in Bihar, where the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act was abolished in 2006. At that time, it was believed that the introduction of the Bihar Agriculture Produce Market (Repealing) Act would enable massive investment to set up and run agri-markets, leading to the state becoming an agricultural hub. It was claimed that Bihar would be equipped with premier market infrastructure for enabling farmers to compete in the global market. But did these claims come true? What happened to Bihar’s economy after 14 years of agri-reforms? This testimony would guide us to know the future of Indian agriculture as a prospective impact of new farm laws. Let’s take the case of new investment and farm infrastructure. In Bihar, the abolition of the APMC Act was unable to bring in new investment, consequently marketing efficiency deteriorated. The Bihar State Agricultural Marketing Board lost revenue due to the dismantling of regulated markets that led to the closure of the prevailing developmental activities in the state. Forget the setting up of a world-class marketing system, the state lost even pre-reform marketing infrastructure. INFRASTRUCTURE, EARNINGS DOWN The number of procurement centres in Bihar has declined by over 82%, from 9,035 in 2015-16 to 1,619 in 2019-20. However, during this time, the number of these centres increased in Punjab (4.73%), Haryana (48.27%), Uttar Pradesh (29.48%) and Madhya Pradesh (19.48%). Similarly, there was lack of cold storage facilities in Bihar as a substantial number of these storages shut down in the recent past. Better price realisation was the most impassioned issue publicised by the government while carrying out agri-reforms in Bihar. In reality, the farm harvest prices of all major crops such as wheat, paddy and maize remained lower than the minimum support price (MSP). During 2016-17, the MSP for wheat, paddy and maize was fixed as Rs 1,625, Rs 1,410 and Rs 1,365 but the farmers could get Rs 1,299, Rs 1,113, and Rs 1,140 a quintal, respectively. During 2019-20, the farmers got Rs 350-450/qtl lower than the MSP for all major crops. This shows that the price mechanism under unregulated markets remained a harmful proposition for the farmers. After the de-regulation of agri-markets, the market density, participation of government agencies in procurement, and the scale of procurement of grains also declined. Though marketing yards still exist, the bodies managing them were abolished and the staff employed there was deployed elsewhere. Unscrupulous traders illegally transport a sizeable quantity of farm produce to other states, which provide assured MSP. Under these situations, producer surplus and consumer surplus declined. MISPLACED GROWTH PERFORMANCE Unlike claims of becoming a farm hub, the agricultural sector of Bihar has seen misplaced growth performance. The average annual growth in agriculture and allied activities of Bihar from 2001-02 to 2007-08 was 1.98%, which improved shortly after that only to registered a decline at just 1.28% from 2012-13 to 2016-17. Owing to the present scenario of the farm sector, the trend of land concentration seen after the number of large farmers increased in the state may have a negative impact on the livelihood of smaller farmers. It was claimed that agri-market reforms would enhance competitiveness and improve the economic condition of the farmers. But this did not prove to be true. The income level of farm households declined in the post-reform period in Bihar as the real monthly income of these households fell from Rs 1,810 from 2002-03 to Rs 1,686 (6.85%) in 2012-13. Even at the all-India level, the real income level of farm households increased by 39.43% during the period. Bihar remained one of the poorest states of India. HARMFUL FOR FARMERS, STATE AND ECONOMY The prevailing worrisome scenario of Bihar’s agricultural sector offers a lesson in the aftermath of the market reforms in the country. Bihar’s reforms have only enhanced market inefficiency that has led to lower and unstable prices of agricultural produce. Without regulated markets, agriculture markets are deprived of the required marketing infrastructure and fair prices to farmers and all other stakeholders in the economy. In such a scenario, it is apparent that the repealing of the APMC Act under the so-called agri-market reforms would be harmful for the peasantry, state exchequer and agrarian economy of our country. sukhpaleco@pau.ed The writer is principal economist at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.

19-11-2020||Editorials||Balance self-reliance with engagement||In a significant policy speech earlier this week — in the backdrop of India staying out of the just-signed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership — external affairs minister S Jaish-ankar laid out the government’s outlook towards globalisation. He acknowledged that India had benefited from opening up in the last three decades. But Mr Jaishankar had reservations about the terms of this engagement, and argued that in the absence of a strong industrial base, and lack of adequate attention to domestic reforms and manufacturing, India had also lost out. It is somewhat paradoxical that a minister in what can be termed a government that leans towards the Right has articulated a position that resembles that of the Left. Ever since India opened up, it was the economists on the Left who warned against its implications on domestic capital and labour. But Mr Jaishankar is not arguing for a return to autarkic ways. He is, instead, borrowing from market economists to suggest a next generation of reforms. He is guided by the strategic environment — where the West is turning inwards and China’s predatory trading practices have devastated local markets — and the need to strengthen India’s economic defences, both in manufacturing and new digital technologies. This is a balanced approach – but it is tough to execute. India cannot expect to be an export powerhouse if it closes itself to imports. It cannot expect the world to rely on it if it chooses to rely only on itself. And to build domestic strengths, it has to deepen external economic engagement too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/balance-self-reliance-with-engagement/story-SeDEFxZptcIXJHcuHMgE9H.html
19-11-2020||Editorials||Modi-Biden lay out a road map | HT Editorial||Great powers have too many interests to ever agree with each other on all policy fronts. This is doubly true when one of the powers is the United States (US). The goal is to ensure a Venn diagram where the area of convergence is large and growing and the other parts are marginal and shrinking. The one reason India and the US have seen a steady improvement in relations over four administrations is that the list of common interests has kept increasing. Given the chalk and cheese differences between presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden, this formula will be tested in the coming months.It is reassuring that Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi’s tweet about his phone conversation with Mr Biden immediately laid out three areas with the greatest potential for bilateral cooperation. The first is the Covid-19 pandemic. Much of this already exists at the commercial and scientific level but can be infused with governmental support. The second, and one with considerable long-term potential, is climate. PM Modi is committed to move India to a green energy trajectory but needs international support in terms of finance and technology. Mr Biden has to not only reverse Mr Trump’s damage to global climate efforts but also move the US to the vanguard of the battle against carbon. On the multilateral track, there is a smorgasbord of climate policies that the two can work on, including looking beyond the Paris Accord and strengthening Indian initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance. Finally, India and the US need to share notes on their visions of the Indo-Pacific — shorthand for how to handle an openly aggressive China. It is in this policy area where Mr Biden’s views are haziest. He and his advisers accept China is a strategic competitor. The devil, however, is in the tactical details and Mr Biden’s seeming preference for non-military responses to China is questionable.The flip side is that areas of differences are almost certain to arise. Mr Biden’s trade policy will differ from Mr Trump’s only in terms of tone rather than substance. Delhi is braced for lectures on inclusivity and Kashmir from the other side. The best way to keep these problem areas on the margins of the relationship is for both governments to work hard to ensure the areas of cooperation generate tangible results. Strategic partnerships work best if they generate a return on investment in the policy space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/modi-biden-lay-out-a-road-map-ht-editorial/story-fVwylsc1MQwG0VyfaEJOKN.html
19-11-2020||Editorials||In the Congress, the lack of ideological clarity | HT Editorial||With the defeat in the Bihar assembly elections, dissenters in the Congress have once again spoken of the need to introspect, expedite internal organisational reforms, and settle the question of leadership — where Rahul Gandhi is in charge in practice but not in theory (because he does not want to assume formal charge of the presidency), and other aspirants are not quite sure whether the Nehru-Gandhi family is in or out. But while settling the question of leadership through organisational elections is imperative, there is another area that should worry the party— its ideological confusion.Two recent incidents have highlighted this gulf within the party. On the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a section of the Congress leadership appears to believe that India has made a mistake by staying out, while others claim this is a vindication of the Congress’s stand. On Kashmir, while the party opposed the effective nullification of Article 370 in Parliament, it is reluctant to demand its restoration (as the Gupkar alliance has done) for the fear of losing votes in the rest of the country — but the fear of being seen as B-team of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Mr Gandhi’s ideological opposition to the Centre’s measure also means that the party cannot quite support the move either.Having a diversity of views within a political formation has its strengths. But it is clear that on key questions of national security, economic policy, and occasionally even domestic political issues, the Congress is hesitant to either articulate or own a position consistently. This is often because it is torn between its own ideological moorings and tactical considerations — in the process, it may neither remain true to itself nor be able to win over voters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-the-congress-the-lack-of-ideological-clarity-ht-editorial/story-NixJrcbSoObnm0oucs8mOO.html
