Two housing proposals — a seven-storey project and a mix of seven- and eleven-storey project — were discussed in a meeting chaired by UT adviser Manoj Parida with employees’ representatives Dr Dharmender Shastri, Balwinder Singh and Dr Brahmprakash Yadav.While in the first option, the prices were slashed by 13-31% in the four categories of flats, in the second option, the drop was 3-24% (see box), with the maximum difference in the case of 1BHK (bedroom, hall and kitchen) flats that form the bulk of the project.“We have rejected the administration’s proposals, as the flats are still way too expensive as compared to the original brochure prices (of 2008), and are only marginally lower than the 2019 prices. We will submit our decision to the Punjab and Haryana high court. We have already communicated our decision to the administration. We will take flats only on brochure prices,” said Shastri.Parida said: “We will wait for their (employees’) formal response. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) will take a final call. The matter is subjudice.”The much-delayed schemeAround 4,000 flats were to be built in Sectors 52, 53 and 56 by the Chandigarh Housing Board for government employees as part of a scheme launched in 2008.The project comprised 252 3BHK flats with servant quarters, 168 2BHK with servant quarters, 3,066 1BHK and 444 single-room flats.A draw of lots was held in 2010, in which 3,930 employees among 7,827 applicants were selected. They had then deposited around ₹57 crore with the CHB under the scheme.Later, the scheme was shelved, and then revived after the employees took up the matter with MP Kirron Kher. But the MHA allowed the administration to transfer the land to the CHB at the current collector rates, which shot up the apartment costs manifold (see box).The employees even moved the high court, demanding that flats be allotted at the same rates as asked for in 2008, following which the MHA and administration were directed to resolve the pricing issue. Tuesday’s meeting was also held following fresh HC directions this month.However, even after the revised prices offered now, a 3BHK flat will cost employees more than ₹1.5 crore in both the options, around five times the original offer. The twin proposalsUnder the 2019 proposal, the administration was charging for the whole piece of land (73 acre), which was to cost around ₹2,629 crore.Under the first option (Concept 1) submitted on Tuesday, the land cost will be charged on plotted area basis. Though total 65.96 acre will be utilised, but only 38 acre will be charged at ₹35.88 crore per acre, ie a total of ₹1,304 crore. This will require the approval of the Union Cabinet before it can be implemented.Under the second option (Concept 2), the administration will charge for the whole chunk of land (48 acre), on which a mix of seven- and eleven-storey project will be constructed at a total cost of ₹1,734 crore. This option requires approval of the Union Home Ministry as it needs amendments in the Chandigarh Master Plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-slashes-cost-of-employee-housing-scheme-but-allottees-reject-proposals/story-H93cAiR5XoE8sqab3LTarL.html
17-11-2020||City||Two snatchers held in Rohini after shoot-out||New Delhi: Two men wanted by police in Delhi and Haryana in at least 120 criminal cases such as snatching and robbery were arrested after a shootout in KN Katju Marg area on Monday afternoon.Police said the two men Sunil, 32, and Amit, 22 -- referred to only by their first names in police records -- had shot at the police team from their country-made pistols when they were asked to stop before their arrest. Police said no one was injured in their team but the two men received bullet injuries in their legs during the shootout and were to BSA hospital. Police recovered two countrymade pistols, including the one used to fire at the police team, along with a stolen Black Pulsar motorcycle. Deputy commissioner of police(Rohini) PK Mishra said Sunil has 109 criminal cases against him while Amit has 20. Mishra said Sunil was a peon at a school at Sonepat in Haryana while Amit was unemployed. The two are residents of Bankner village in outer Delhi’s Narela.DCP Mishra said police were analysing the pattern of snatching cases in the KN Katju Marg area when they deduced that two persons were using a black motorcycle to commit the crimes. KN Katju Marg and its nearby areas such as Prashant Vihar and parts of Rohini report a high number of snatching cases every year. “At about 4 pm, head constable Sunil and constable Vicky were patrolling in the area when they met constables Kuldeep and Rakesh. A snatching incident had already taken place early Monday. The four police personnel then started looking for suspicious motorcycle riders. At 4.25 pm, they saw two persons on a black motorcycle coming towards them from A-2 Block, Sector-16 Rohini. On seeing the police staff, the men immediately turned back and sped away,” DCP Mishra said.Mishra said the four police personnel chased the bikers and asked them to stop, “But the pillion driver took out his pistol and fired at the police. Our staff managed to escape unhurt and continued to chase. The bikers stopped, pulled out their gun again and aimed at the police. Our officers fired in self-defence and shot them on the lower part of their body. They tried to escape but were overpowered and admitted to BSA hospital,” DCP Mishra added.Snatching of mobile phones, necklaces and hand bags by riders on motorcycles and scooters is one of the most common crimes in Delhi. Every year, police stations across the city register at least 6,000 cases of snatching.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-snatchers-held-in-rohini-after-shoot-out/story-3Tqh3hv33l55jpg57rp0yL.html
17-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress collects 58.77 lakh signatures to protest against farm, labour laws||As part of its nation-wide protest against the newly enacted farm and labour laws, Maharashtra Congress collected signatures of 58,76,881 farmers, labourers and workers over the last two months. The signatures collected from across the county will be submitted to the President of India Ram Nath Kovind by Congress’s interim president Sonia Gandhi on November 19 to register protest against the laws and press the demand of their revocation.Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat handed over the set of signatures to senior leader and Maharashtra in-charge HK Patil at party’s Dadar office, on Tuesday. Senior party leaders including minister Nitin Raut, Aslam Shaikh, Amit Deshmukh, Mumbai Congress chief Eknath Gaikwad, leaders Arif Naseem Khan, Amin Patel, Hussain Dalwai were present on the occasion.Patil said that the response to the signature campaign shows the opposition to the laws, and the drive in Maharasthra has become a role model for the country. “This is a historic campaign and will help to push our demand for repealing the newly enacted farm and labour laws. Maharashtra has always shown the path to the rest of the country. It should also enact a law which could protect the interest of the farmers and would be better than Punjab. We are committed to the welfare of the party,” he said.Thorat said that the state government was appointing a cabinet sub-committee to promulgate a separate farm law to safeguard the interest of the farmers. “All the three ruling parties in Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) are on the same page as far as the opposition to the farm laws is concerned. We are planning a separate law with strict provisions like the criminal case against the trader not paying minimum support price for the procurement of the farm produce. The Modi government’s policies have crushed the farmers in the last six years. The massive campaign launched by the Congress has received an overwhelming response from the farmers despite Covid-19 pandemic, unseasonal rainfall which shows the anger among them over these policies,” he said.The state unit collected 58,76,881 signatures from farmers, labourers, workers from across the state with districts like Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Nanded, Chandrapur collecting a huge number of signatures. The signatures thus collected from across the country will be handed over to President Ram Nath Kovind on November 19 by a delegation headed by party president Sonia Gandhi. The Maharashtra unit of the party conducted virtual farmer rally, tractor rallies, agitations at tehsil levels and implemented signature campaign over the last two months after the laws were passed in the Parliament. Mumbai Congress to get its new chief soon?HK Patil, Maharashtra in charge for the party held series of meetings with the party leaders including former and incumbent ministers, MLAs, corporators, head of the frontal organisation to take their opinion on the changes need to be done. Most of the leaders reportedly expressed the need for the change in leadership and party to go solo in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation elections to be held in 2021.“Patil and other observers met these leaders in the second round of such meetings at party’s Dadar officer and at Sahyadri guest house on Tuesday. The first round with the Mumbai leaders was held last month. We expect the appointment of the new chief of the Mumbai unit to be announced in next couple of weeks,” said a senior party leader.Mumbai Congress is currently headed by senior party leader Eknath Gaikwad. Former MLA Bhai Jagtap, former ministers Suresh Shetty, Arif Naseem Khan and leader Amarjeet Singh Manhas are believed to be the frontrunner for the post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-congress-collects-58-77-lakh-signatures-to-protest-against-farm-labour-laws/story-zpFCnxL3d442Br1c6VEqhP.html
17-11-2020||Mumbai||3 cases of sexual assaults on minors reported in two days in Mumbai||Two cases of sexual assault and one gang rape, all involving minor survivors, were reported in the city. While Mumbai had recorded the second-highest number of cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act in 2019, far fewer incidents have been reported this year. On November 12, a three-year-old girl had been left with her grandmother when her parents left for work. “The minor child was playing outside the home when two boys who live in the neighbourhood took her to a deserted place in Sanjay Gandhi National Park,” said senior police inspector at Kasturba Marg police station, Namdeo Shinde. The police suspect the three-year-old was sexually assaulted and gang-raped by the two boys who are 11 and 12 years old.Days later, the girl complained of stomach pain to her mother, following which her mother questioned her and discovered what had happened. The girl’s mother confronted the boys and filed a complaint at Kasturba Marg police station on Monday. The police have registered a case under sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 354 (molestation), 376 D (gangrape), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Pocso Act. “We seized the clothes of the two boys and are also waiting for the medical examination report of the girl,” said Shinde, adding that the case would heavily rely on the medical and forensic evidence as the three-year-old may not be able to describe her ordeal before the magistrate. Two other cases of sexual assault on minors were also reported from Kanjurmarg and Trombay.In Kanjurmarg, a 16-year-old girl lodged a police complaint on Sunday, alleging she had been stalked and molested by a person since September. The accused, who is known to the girl’s family, has been arrested, confirmed Prashant Kadam, deputy commissioner of police, zone 7.“On Sunday, the accused, who is 20 years old, again stalked the girl and forcefully kissed her on the road. When she resisted, he threatened to upload morphed nude photos of her on the internet,” said Sandip Patil, sub-inspector from Kanjurmarg police station. The girl told her mother of the incident and her mother confronted the accused, who admitted to having molested the 16-year-old. The girl’s family then approached the police. “We have arrested the accused and charged him under relevant sections of the IPC and POCSO Act. He has been remanded in police custody for two days by the court,” said Patil. In Trombay, a nine-year-old girl was molested by a 24-year-old man on Monday in the Maharashtra Nagar area. The girl had gone to the public toilet in the morning and when she was coming out, she was allegedly molested by the accused.“When the girl screamed for help, locals rushed to help her and nabbed the man. The accused was arrested and charged with relevant sections of IPC and Pocso,” said Siddheshwar Gove, senior inspector, Trombay police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-cases-of-sexual-assaults-on-minors-reported-in-two-days-in-mumbai/story-duXhYvGGhVzfvPov44JUrN.html
17-11-2020||City||2 Thane kids suffer major burn injuries in septic tank explosion||Two children, aged eight and 12, have suffered major injuries after an explosion occurred in a septic tank at a housing society in Thane’s Pokhran Road on Tuesday evening. The children were bursting a firecracker near the tank’s lid when the blast occurred. The duo are undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Thane. The boys were bursting crackers around 7.45 pm within the premises of Shivshakti Society. “The heat from the fire crackers and the gases that are usually present within a tank reacted and led to the explosion. The boys have burn injuries and are recuperating at the hospital,” said Santosh Kadam, chief, regional disaster management cell, Thane. Chitalsar Police officers are probing the incident. “Our officers will visit the site and the hospital to know more about the incident,” said an officer from Chitalsar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-thane-kids-suffer-major-burn-injuries-in-septic-tank-explosion/story-TjKmjIco44ZM9krPeIq1gP.html
17-11-2020||City||Panjab University zonal youth and heritage fest to be held after final exams||The authorities are planning to conduct the youth and heritage festival after final exams in February 2021. Only solo events will be organised during the fest to ensure social distancing. This decision was taken up in a meeting held between the PU youth welfare director Nirmal Jaura and principals of Zone B at Ramgarhia Girls College on Tuesday. Keeping in view the Covid pandemic, the fest will be held only for the participants.In the meeting, the principals of girls’ colleges suggested that instead of four days, the fest can be organised for a week so that the Covid-19 protocol is followed.Earlier, there was only one venue for the PU youth festival but this time it has been decided to conduct the fest at two colleges. Jaura said, “Both the colleges are centrally located and have auditoriums and open spaces to conduct the events. For Zone A, the competitions will be conducted at Satish Chander Dhawan (SCD) Government College. The dates of the event will be finalized later on, keeping in mind the coronavirus situation.” For Zone B colleges, the event will be held in Khalsa College for Women, Civil Lines, which will be the nodal college. Few competitions will be organized at Government College for Girls. In 2014, the varsity had introduced a reservation of one additional seat for a zonal, inter-zonal, or national-level youth fest winner and a weightage of 1-3% for participants taking admission in PU-affiliated colleges.Amrita Singla, a student of Government College for Girls, said, “This is my last year in the college and I was very excited to participate in the youth fest. But due to Covid-19, colleges got closed and we switched to online classes. The authorities had earlier decided not to conduct the festival. This move will help me give my last performance here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/panjab-university-zonal-youth-and-heritage-fest-to-be-held-after-final-exams/story-JS9LKJO84KBJAq7jg127FN.html
17-11-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19: Ensure necessary arrangements are made before schools reopen, Maharashtra education department tells local bodies||The state education department has asked the civic bodies and zilla parishads across the state to prepare themselves for the reopening of schools for Class 9 to 12 from November 23. In a letter issued to the authorities on November 17, the department has asked them to ensure that necessary arrangements are made, before schools in the state reopen. This includes providing sanitisers, thermal guns, pulse oximeters etc to schools. Similarly, necessary arrangements are to be made for free Covid-19 testing of school teachers in government-run testing centres, as per the letter.“In the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for reopening of schools, the responsibilities of local administration are enlisted. All these guidelines with respect to school reopening thus have to be followed,” states the letter. Officials from the education department said that the civic bodies and zilla parishads would have to provide essentials such as sanitisers to both, private and government schools across the state. There are over 16,000 schools in the Mumbai region alone. After the education department released SOPs on school reopening, schools had asked the government to provide basic support. “We are happy the government has decided to take up the responsibility of providing things essential to ensure the safety of students and teachers. We now hope that these things reach all schools,” said Prashant Redij, spokesperson of the Mumbai Principals’ Association. Mandatory Covid-19 tests for staff, one student per bench in a class and avoiding extracurricular activities like sports, gatherings are a part of the revised SOPs for schools released by the state education department on November 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-ensure-necessary-arrangements-are-made-before-schools-reopen-maharashtra-education-department-tells-local-bodies/story-f1yvvyFJ1lnCoBSElgTCEN.html
17-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai garment trader booked for raping, cheating house help||A 64-year-old Andheri-based garment trader has been booked for allegedly raping and cheating his 40-year-old house help. A case was registered on November 12 at Amboli police station after police received a written application from the complainant. The woman told police that she used to work as a house help for the accused since the last eight years. The accused allegedly told the woman that he had a sexual relationship with his previous house help and had gifted a flat in Andheri. He offered the complainant the same on multiple occasions. In 2018, the woman booked a flat in a slum rehabilitation authority (SRA) building for ₹21 lakh. She had ₹17 lakh with her and needed another ₹4 lakh to purchase the flat. The woman asked the accused for help and he loaned her ₹4 lakh and kept the house documents collateral. The woman allegedly returned the money in two years and demanded her house documents back. An officer from Amboli police station said, “The accused allegedly used to sexually assault the woman and feared that if he returned her documents, she would stop working for him.” The complainant then approached Amboli police station and registered a complaint. “We have filed a first information report (FIR) and are investigating the case,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-garment-trader-booked-for-raping-cheating-house-help/story-rhs9J4io6yBaSfSlLJzGjI.html

The Colaba weather station, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 34.7 degree Celsius on Tuesday, which was 1.4 degree Celsius above normal.The minimum temperature in the suburbs was 3 degree Celsius above normal at 23.8 degrees while south Mumbai recorded 24.8 degree Celsius, 2 degree Celsius above normal.“Hot weather is likely to continue as the wind pattern continues to be warm southeasterly to easterly along with a clear sky. However, later this week there is a possibility of a marginal drop in temperatures due to partly cloudy conditions as a weather system develops towards the southeast Arabian Sea,” said an official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Meanwhile, Mumbai’s air quality index (AQI) was 142 (moderate) on Tuesday. Researchers said it was mostly due to higher temperatures and moderate wind speed. Mazgaon had the worst AQI of 310 (very poor). An AQI of 132 (moderate) has been predicted for Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sizzles-at-36-degree-celsius-air-quality-in-moderate-category/story-FWwLSRLdCF3C53yp1IuwmK.html
17-11-2020||Gurugram||Health department asks for additional workforce to meet testing target||To break the chain of transmission of Covid-19 infection, the health department has decided to opt for targeted testing in the district. For this, the department is finalising a list of places, where people gather in large numbers, such as wholesale markets and bus depots, where mass testing can be carried out through rapid antigen tests, said officials, adding that the department has also asked for additional workforce from the state for this purpose. After a meeting with the Niti Aayog earlier this week, the district health department was directed to further increase testing capacity in the district. Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, district surveillance officer for Covid-19, said, “New clusters are being identified, especially in high-risk areas like Khandsa Mandi and local markets with high footfalls, where testing will be increased. Mass testing through rapid antigen test kits will be conducted, while for the symptomatic negative patients, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests would be administered.”As reported by HT on Tuesday, the state health department is planning to take the everyday testing in Gurugram to 6,000. Presently, 4,000 tests are being administered every day on an average. For further testing, the health department is seeking deputation of additional workforce. “A letter has been forwarded to the state for additional lab technicians and auxiliary nurse midwifes (ANMs) for administering tests during contact tracing,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Due to a rapid surge in cases, fluctuating between 500 to 800 cases daily, it has become challenging for rapid response teams (RRTs) to finish contact tracing in three days. Presently, there are 143 RRTs in urban areas and 163 in rural areas, along with 30 lab technicians.“For proper and timely contact tracing, additional workforce is needed. Since the focus is on quarantine of high-risk contacts and home-isolated patients, extra manpower is necessary,” said Yadav, adding that the deputation of the workforce will depend upon the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-asks-for-additional-workforce-to-meet-testing-target/story-DZsgcka9ZFdONX0e4JGyjK.html
17-11-2020||Gurugram||City colleges see an uptick in attendance on day two of reopening||The attendance in all four government colleges in the city saw an uptick on Tuesday — a day after colleges in the state reopened for physical classroom sessions for the first time since March. Anticipating a further increase in footfall in the coming days, college authorities said they are working on implementing different arrangements for students, keeping in mind the protocols for physical distancing. While some colleges plan to adopt a hybrid model comprising online and offline classes, others will be conducting classes in multiple shifts while adopting an even-odd formula. Further changes in the mode of imparting lessons are expected this week depending on the daily turnout of students, said college administrators. Around 150 students visited Dronacharya Government College for classes on Tuesday. The college will be adopting a blended model of both online-offline classes, where students from different courses will be allowed to visit colleges twice a week with parental consent. “The number of students visiting the college is picking up now. Depending on the turnout, teachers can form batches and take classes. We have capped the number of students in one class to 20 in view of social distancing norms,” said Khullar, adding that physical distancing was an important concern since exams, admissions, and classes were all taking place simultaneously at the college. “We fear overcrowding since students from different courses and those seeking admission converge together at times. This week, our focus will be on familiarising students with the roster of their respective courses so that online-offline lessons can take place in a structured manner without overcrowding,” said Khullar. At Government College for Girls, Sector 52, around 80 students in different courses turned up for classes on Tuesday. The college is currently operating from a temporary campus where the space is limited. As such, the college will be adopting a new mechanism for conducting classes from tomorrow. “Around 25-30% of students came to the college for classes today. Since we have limited space, we will be holding classes in two shifts from tomorrow. Two classes will take place in the morning from 9am to 12 noon and another set of two classes will take place from 12 noon to 3 pm so that we are able to avoid crowding,” said Mohd Rafique, college principal. Besides holding classes in two shifts, the college is also considering the possibility of recording some sessions for students who are attending online classes from home. “It will take at least a week for us to try out online-offline classes and put in a robust mechanism that works for all. We are also looking at recording some sessions for online classes once students settle down,” said Rafique. Ramesh Garg, principal of Government Girls College, Sector 14, said that the college will be adopting an even-odd formula for physical classroom sessions, which will be live-streamed for those students who have opted for online classes. “We sought preference from students and around 50% of them are in favour of online classes. For offline classes, students with even roll numbers will visit the college on the first three days of the week while those with odd roll numbers will attend on the remaining three days. The strength of each session will be capped at 20 students. The physical classroom session will be live-streamed for students at home,” said Garg||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-colleges-see-an-uptick-in-attendance-on-day-two-of-reopening/story-ZO7nnvn95S9uCx3ZZUlRaL.html
17-11-2020||Gurugram||Covid-19 tally in Gurugram crosses 40,000 mark||The total tally of Covid-19 infections crossed the 40,000-mark on Tuesday, with 588 new infections being reported in the last 24 hours. With Covid-19 spreading at an unprecedented rate since the first week of November, amid the festive season and the increasing air pollution, the Covid-19 tally on Tuesday reached 40,521. Of these, 5,445 are currently active, while 34,829 patients have recovered from the infection.On Tuesday, as per the district health bulletin, a record number of 889 people recovered from the infection, bringing down the overall active cases. However, the test positivity rate(TPR) – total number of positives out of the samples collected – remains high at 18%. This is higher than the TPR of the previous week, when it stood at 15% and almost similar to that of July, when the infection was at its peak. In the first week of November, the state health department made a projection based on the real and the worst case scenarios with cases likely to go as high as 43,000 by the end of the month. Experts, however, had warned that considering the rising positivity rate, tally would go well beyond the projected figures.In November, more than 10,000 new infections have been reported so far due to the increasing positivity rate. It is the highest rate at which new cases have been confirmed till now since the outbreak of the pandemic. It took more than a month-and-a-half for the numbers to reach 20,000 in September. It then took a month to reach 30,000 by the end of October. To tackle the upsurge, in the last 10 days, daily testing has been increased to 4,000, except on the Diwali weekend when it came down to about 2,500. The rise in positivity rate comes at a time when the district health department is conducting the maximum number of Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered to the gold standard of front-line testing. RT-PCR is significantly better than rapid antigen test in detecting cases and producing accurate results. At least 4,004 tests, including 3,647 RT-PCR tests ( the highest since September) and 357 rapid antigen test, were administered on Tuesday. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “Testing will be ramped up as new clusters have been identified where testing camps will be held. This week, the department will receive more rapid antigen kits to conduct testing in market areas with high footfall. Time and again, teams are administering tests in widely affected areas, such as Tigra, Wazirabad, Chanderlok and areas under the 19 urban primary health centres of the district. It is likely that with increased targeted testing, positivity rate will come down.”With increased testing, new infections also increased to 726 on an average every day, compared to 701 in the previous week. Worried about the consistent upward spike in cases, Niti Aayog earlier this week directed Delhi-NCR cities to increase testing, and modify strategies on surveillance of home-isolated patients and quarantine of high-risk contacts. Since, Delhi-NCR is treated as one unit to tackle Covid-19 spike, Gurugram has followed the footsteps of Delhi in reserving 75% ICU beds and 50% general beds across 42 private and public hospitals of the city on Monday. Officials said the decision was taken as the number of hospitalisation has gone up in the last few days. Hospitalisation has consistently increased from 191 on November 2 to 293 on November 7 and further to 408 on November 13. On Monday, it reached 417 and 427 on Tuesday. Out of the 2,114 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 in hospitals across the city, 963 beds are currently occupied. However, it is the proportional uptick in ICU patients that has the government worried. On Tuesday, nearly 59% of 159 ventilators and 65% of 312 ICU beds were occupied. The Covid-19 toll also reached 247, with three new deaths. Even at the state level, the tally has reached 2,04,477, of which 19,153 are active. At least 2,063 people across the state have succumbed to the illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-19-tally-in-gurugram-crosses-40-000-mark/story-jBQQGYAFbeUrHnQAqzSlKK.html
17-11-2020||Gurugram||District-level committee to probe construction on Ghamroj bundh||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has constituted a district-level committee to look into the “alleged illegal and unauthorised excavation” of the Ghamroj bundh, a traditional water harvesting structure which runs for about two kilometres along the Sohna Road in Ghamroj village. Hindustan Times had reported on October 12 that a portion of the bundh had been excavated to make room for a rest area that is being built as part of the National Highways Authority of India’s (NHAI) upcoming toll complex on NH-248A.Through an order dated November 9, the NGT has constituted a three-member committee including the Haryana State Pollution Control Board’s (HSPCB) regional officer for Gurugram, the district forest officer (DFO) and the deputy commissioner, to “look into the grievance” and submit a compliance report by early next month. The NGT took cognizance of the matter following a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by Prem Mohan Gaur, a resident of Hajjipur village on Sohna-Palwal road, who frequents Ghamroj and noticed the bundh being excavated in August. Gaur’s petition alleges that excavation of the Ghamroj bundh is in contradiction of Sohna’s Master Plan 2031, which states that the bundh would be retained in its current state. An explanatory note issued in this regard by the town and country planning department on November 15, 2012, mentions, “Sohna Town is surrounded by Aravalli Ranges on eastern & western side. In the rainy season, run-off from these ranges passes through proposed urbanization through barsati Nallahs namely Mehandwara Nadi. Three bundhs namely Sohna bundh, Mohmmadpur bundh and Ghamroj bundh exist on the western side of the town to check the run-off and for recharging the underground water table. All the three existing bundhs and alignment of the tributaries of Mehandwara Nadi / Nallah have been retained as such in the Development Plan on the request of the Irrigation Department (sic).”Gaur also alleged that work to excavate the bundh had commenced without written permission of the irrigation department, which, NHAI officials confirmed, was the case. Vikas Mittal, technical manager, NHAI, said on Tuesday, “We started excavating the bundh only after conducting site inspections along with the irrigation department, who gave us approval to go ahead and make alterations to the structure. We have not yet received any written confirmation from them, but they had, in principle, approved the structural changes to the bundh.”Tampering with the structural integrity of the bundh — which arrests water run-off from Aravalli hills that skirt around the village — may pose adverse consequences, such as flooding, and may negatively affect groundwater recharge in the area, environmentalists have warned. On October 20, Gaur submitted a representation to the deputy commissioner, the pollution control board and the forest department, but did not receive a response in the matter. The NGT’s principal bench, headed by chairman Adarsh Kumar Goel, took cognizance of this and directed the district administration to “look into the grievance and take appropriate action in accordance with the law.” The NGT order states, “According to the applicant, the construction of road will result in the demolition of bundh affecting a water body in violations of law laid down in Hinch Lal Tiwari vs Kamla Devi (2001). There will be further violation of the Sohna Master Plan , 2031. This will also affect forest area in violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.” Shakti Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, which is the nodal agency for compliance in the matter, said, “We will follow the NGT’s instructions. The committee has not yet decided the merits of the case, so it is too soon to comment on that. We will submit our report to the NGT as instructed and make sure that any violations are dealt with appropriately.”The deputy commissioner and forest officer were unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-level-committee-to-probe-construction-on-ghamroj-bundh/story-50cYuVFuBZ9t4KvqZQNLbP.html
17-11-2020||Noida||Women’s group cycles to promote fitness in Greater Noida west||Greater Noida: A group of 30 women cyclists of Greater Noida have formed a ‘Women on Wheels (WOW)’ initiative to highlight the importance of fitness. For the last six months, they would gather in Greater Noida west in the morning and go for a 10 to 15 km ride in the city. The group was founded by a banker and fitness enthusiast Vijeta Pandey, 30, a Greater Noida west resident in June. Pandey said that cycling is the best exercise to remain fit. “Cycling increases strength and flexibility in the body. People feel afresh after cycling and it also helps in managing stress and anxiety,” Pandey said. When asked how the initiative started, she said, “During the lockdown period we were mostly packed in the house that gave rise to anxiety and stress. I started riding the bicycle alone in the society and outside,” Pandey said. “In June, I posted a message in my society group and invited women to join. A few responded and then we formed WOW and added more people.”Kanchan Grover, 33, a software engineer and a resident of Gaur City – 2, said that she was inspired by Pandey to join the group. “I used to see her cycle in the society and neighbourhood. I talked to her, bought a bicycle and joined the group. Around 20-25 women gather every day in Gaur City and cycle in the neighbourhood.”The group rides together and help each other in case a cycle breaks down. Helmet and water bottle is mandatory for all the participants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/women-s-group-cycles-to-promote-fitness-in-greater-noida-west/story-VCg4DSv6wJsujqWuAT5eNM.html
17-11-2020||Noida||Covid crisis: Ghaziabad testing takes a hit in past three days||Ghaziabad: Amid the rising Covid-19 cases, the number of testing in the district has declined considerably in the past three days since Diwali. The district health department data shows that a daily average of only about 2,015 samples were tested during the period from November 14 to 16.Also, unlike Noida where the officials have come up with a strategy to randomly test incoming commuters from Delhi starting Wednesday, the Ghaziabad administration at present does not have a strategy in place to deal with any cross-border infection. On November 12, the state government in its directions had revised the rapid antigen test target for Ghaziabad from 2,000 samples per day to 3,500 samples, besides the regular RT-PCR tests. According to the records of the health department, the district on November 14 took up 2,073 tests, 1,791 on November 15 and 2,180 on November 16. However, during the first 12 days in November, the district was conducting on average about 4,000 tests per day. The overall positivity in the district is about 4.23% with 489,533 tests done which yielded 20,723 positive cases so far. The testing data for November 13 was not available with the health department.“The reduction in testing is due to absence of staff who have gone on leaves during Diwali and also for Chhath Puja. However, we are expecting that testing will increase, and we will be able to achieve the target as well in coming days,” said an officer from the district health department who wished not to be quoted. On Tuesday, the district had a total of 1,233 active cases, while it reported 44 new cases.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey on Tuesday did not respond to repeated calls made to him for his response about the low testing and any plan in the city to deal with cross-border infection. He, however, shared inputs through a message that the district has planned focussed testing of different high-risk groups in urban slums, government and private offices, schools and markets during a drive which has been planned from November 19 to November 30. The district had also been suffering from shortage of rapid antigen kits which were later arranged from neighbouring districts and from Lucknow. On November 12, the district had exhausted its entire stock of rapid antigen kits. The overall monthly testing has also reduced in November. In 16 days of November, the district has conducted about 3,401 tests per day, while the per day testing was about 4,066 in October. In September, per day testing was about 3,928 while it was around 2,967 tests per day in August, the official records showed. Experts said during the present times it is vital that the testing should be increased. “Since people have already mixed up in markets and public places during the festival season, it is time that testing should be increased further. The rise in cases in Delhi indicates that there is every likelihood that cases in neighbouring areas will also increase. The health department has limited resources, but the strategy should have been planned beforehand when the cases spiked in Delhi,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association – Ghaziabad. Shailendra Singh, additional district magistrate (city), said that he held a meeting with members of Chhath Puja association and has asked them to avoid large gatherings at the banks of river Hindon during the festival on November 20. “We have made elaborate arrangements at 53 places in Ghaziabad where sanitization will also be taken up. We have also asked the families to allow only one member to come for performing Puja at the river banks. So, this will prevent any large gatherings,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/covid-crisis-ghaziabad-testing-takes-a-hit-in-past-three-days/story-56Ym0mry4MeEphbI68wTPM.html

The trio was produced before a local court and remanded in police custody till November 18. AEC officers said that Khan was in touch with Machmach, a member of gangster Dawood Ibrahim’s gang, and had planned to murder the businessman at the behest of the fugitive gangster who is believed to be in Pakistan.AEC officers received specific information of the murder being planned and an inquiry was made. During the inquiry, it came to light that Gaikwad had left his house in Nalasopara and had started staying at his friend’s place in Kanjurmarg, while Khan was on his way to Mumbai from Uttar Pradesh.Based on the information, a team of AEC officers arrested Khan from Kalyan railway station and Gaikwad from Kanjurmarg. The accused were questioned, and they named Shaikh as their accomplice. He was then arrested from Kurla. During the interrogation, Khan told police that he knew Machmach from his youth and that he was in touch with him. He told AEC officers that as per Machmach’s directions, he had arranged for the pistol and live cartridges. He had given them to Gaikwad and was waiting for orders from Machmach to eliminate a businessman in south Mumbai. Gaikwad said that he was involved in two murder cases and police are now trying to gather information about his past cases.“Machmach, a loyalist of Dawood Ibrahim gang and close associate of Dawood’s younger brother Anees Ibrahim, wanted to keep his hold over the extortion business in Mumbai. This is even though other gangs run by Chhota Rajan, Ravi Pujari and Ejaz Lakdawala have been permanently dismantled after Central agencies as well Mumbai Police put them and their associates behind bars,” said an AEC officer, requesting anonymity||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/three-men-linked-to-dawood-ibrahim-s-gang-arrested-for-planning-to-murder-south-mumbai-businessman/story-zbVsXRcwhPk8yeSjbX28DK.html
17-11-2020||Chandigarh||Ambala Christian cemetery in ruins amid battle for possession||Ambala’s Christian Cemetery on Jagadhari Road is in a state of ruin as two parties remain locked in battle over its possession.Built in 1844, the 20.54 acre burial ground in the Cantonment assumes historic importance as it has an estimated two lakh graves, including those of around 66 World War I (1914-1918) soldiers, 20 Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) prisoners who fought in South Africa and those of a number of Britons from the pre-independence era. Monuments of different regiments of the British Indian Army and cemetery angels, some damaged and others fallen, can be seen here.Everything is in a sad state of disrepair, overtaken by long wild grass and weeds, some spots inundated by sewer water.Father Patras Mundu, secretary and treasurer of the Ambala Cemetery Committee, insists this is common property belonging to the Christian community and does not belong to any church or individual.Mundu alleges that Shaukatt Masih Bhatti of Alexandra Road, allegedly a self-declared Anglican bishop, has claimed the property saying it belongs to the Church of England.Claiming that he has the documents to prove that the government of India is the landlord and the British High Commissioner holds the occupancy rights, Mundu says the cemetery is a state protected site, but illegal encroachments have come up along the boundary wall.Father Anthony, priest at the Holy Redeemer Catholic Church, alleges some graves had been damaged by a demolition machine “while he (Bhatti) was cleaning the land to sell it.”“In July, he brought in the machine and (damaged) many graves, including war graves. We complained to the police and have shown them the damaged graves too. Teams from Commonwealth War Graves (CWGC), British High Commission and Haryana Archaeology Department have visited the site and have expressed sadness at its unfortunate situation,” says Anthony.Responding to the charges, however, Bhatti refutes the claims, saying “I am the chairman of the Cemetery Committee from the last 15 years and Patras Mundu is not my secretary. I have a registry from 1864 to prove that the cemetery belongs to the Church of England along with some documents by the ministry of defence and other papers to prove my case.”On the allegations of the graves being damaged by machinery brought by him, he adds that the claim is baseless and that the police have investigated the case and found nothing amiss.Commenting on the matter, Rajesh Kumar, secretary of the Ambala Sadar Municipal Council says the land is disputed between two parties that have their own set of documents to prove they own it.Police, meanwhile, say they are investigating the allegation of damage to the graves. “We have received two complaints related to the cemetery. The other party says that the JCB (demolition machine) was brought in to clean the area. We are investigating the claim. Any FIR on the matter is yet to be lodged,” says Vikas Kumar, station in-charge, Ambala Cantonment police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ambala-christian-cemetery-in-ruins-amid-battle-for-possession/story-ImeFX0kYC58twk8Nsh3S0K.html
17-11-2020||Noida||Greater Noida: Underpass proposed at Kisan Chowk||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida authority has decided to build an underpass at Kisan Chowk to make the busy intersection in Greater Noida West free of traffic congestion. The authority has asked RITES, an engineering consultancy company of the central government, to submit a report about this project.The authority has decided to build an underpass after thousands of commuters demanded for a solution to the issue of traffic jam that troubles people daily.“RITES has prepared a presentation about ways to decongest the traffic intersection. It will give its presentation next week. The presentation has details about the volume of vehicular pressure at this intersection and how an underpass will ease out the traffic pangs. Then we will prepare a detailed project report to take the project to the next stage,” said Samakant Srivastava, general manager of Greater Noida authority.According to a preliminary survey done by the Greater Noida authority during peak hours, at least 25,000 motorists witness huge traffic congestion. The survey said that around 1.50 lakh commuters use this stretch daily facing traffic congestion at Kisan Chowk, where Noida’s Master Plan-III road meets 130-metre wide road of Greater Noida. This intersection witnesses commuters who travel from Noida and Greater Noida to Ghaziabad and other areas, said the officials.The underpass will be made on the road that connects Greater Noida West with Ghaziabad.“The proposed underpass will be built on the Greater Noida West-Ghaziabad stretch so that the 130-metre wide road that connects Noida with Greater Noida West going towards Dadri becomes signal free. Once the underpass becomes operational, the commuters will travel seamlessly without facing any congestion at this junction,” said Srivastava.Greater Noida West, earlier known as Noida Extension, is home to dozens of newly built group housing complexes. The region spread over around 4,000 hectares is going to house at least 4 lakh flats once all group housing complexes will be occupied. The authority survey states that in future the traffic pressure will further rise. The underpass project will help in easing out the traffic congestion, said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/greater-noida-underpass-proposed-at-kisan-chowk/story-fV4mnP5c6Bt3tjUGzm0CiK.html
17-11-2020||Noida||Noida: Man booked for killing wife||Noida: A person was booked on Monday for allegedly killing his wife over dowry at their rented accommodation in Sector 44. The woman, 22, was killed on November 11, the police said.The woman’s brother had filed a complaint at Sector 39 police station on November 15. The complainant, a resident of Challera village, said that his sister had married the suspect, Gopal Haldar, two years ago. The couple had a love marriage, he said, adding that both the families are from Malda in West Bengal and had shifted to Noida a few years ago. “We were not aware of my brother-in-law’s nature. He was demanding Rs 4 lakh as dowry from my sister since the marriage. He used to harass my sister over the issue. My sister had informed me about the dowry harassment in the past,” the brother said. The complainant said that on November 11, his sister called him and informed that her husband was beating her. “I visited my sister’s house to enquire about the matter. My brother-in-law was furious and he did not allow me to enter the house. He had locked the door from inside and harassed my sister,” he said. He said that in the afternoon his younger brother visited the sister’s house and found her dead. “She had a rope around her neck. It appeared her husband killed her and fled the spot,” he said.According to the police, the suspect lived with his wife and mother in a rented accommodation in Sector 44. His mother had gone for work when the incident took place, the police said. Azad Singh Tomar, SHO of Sector 39 police station, said that based on the complaint, a case has been registered against the suspect under sections 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 304-B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act 1961. “We have registered a case and launched an investigation into the matter,” Tomar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-man-booked-for-killing-wife/story-VKEqmnp8TFg1FBNwcZObLL.html
17-11-2020||Noida||Three of a family injured as car hits stationary truck on Yamuna Expressway||Greater Noida: Three persons, including a six-year-old boy, were injured when their car hit a stationary truck in the Ecotech 1 area on the Yamuna Expressway on Monday night. The incident took place around 8pm near Gautam Buddha University, the police said, adding that the victims were coming from Agra to Noida. The victims, identified as Satyendra Kumar, 40, his wife Shalini, 35 and their son Surya, have been admitted in a private hospital for treatment, the police said.

When they reached near Gharbhra underpass around five kilometres from Zero Point, their car collided with a stationary truck,” SHO said. The police said that the car’s airbag opened after the accident and the three occupants were saved. However, they were injured and the vehicle was damaged in the accident, they said. Some passersby rescued the three occupants of the car from the damaged vehicle and alerted the police. A team from Ecotech 1 police station soon reached the spot and admitted them to a private hospital in Greater Noida for medical treatment. It appears that the car driver could not spot the truck due to poor visibility on the expressway, the police said, adding that the victims have not filed any complaint in this regard. The truck driver managed to escape with the vehicle after the accident. Meanwhile, in a separate accident in Noida, a 45-year-old man died after he was hit by a speeding vehicle while crossing the road in Chotpur colony in Sector 63 on Monday evening.

Since the call by farm unions to stop rail movements in the state, the manufacturers have been suffering a lot. The containers of raw material are either stuck at the inland container depots (ICDs) or gateway ports, resulting in a huge shortage of raw materials. Cost of raw materials has skyrocketed as well,” said CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja. He also added that the industry hasn’t even recovered from the Covid pandemic yet and, now it has to face this unprecedented situation. JS Bhogal, publicity secretary, and Honey Sethi, organising secretary, CICU, said that if this situation continues, the factories will be forced to shut their operations. There are nearly two lakh MSME units currently operating in the state that employ one crore people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-industry-on-verge-of-collapse-cicu-urges-farmers-to-end-stir/story-NO8cAmZmapmQHPoeFJu8CN.html
17-11-2020||Noida||Noida traffic police issue over 100 fines to violators at Jalvayu Vihar||Noida: The traffic police on Tuesday issued fines to 110 people outside Jalvayu Vihar, a residential society in Noida Sector 21, for violation of traffic rules. The traffic police, along with a traffic volunteer, conducted a special drive in the morning to make residents and visitors of the society follow the traffic rules. Ashutosh Singh, traffic inspector, said that around 2,000 people live in the society. “We had received complaints that some residents ride motorcycles without helmet and drive car without seat belts. They also visit the local market outside the society and sometimes violate traffic rules. Besides, a number of people and delivery boys also visit the society every day. We conducted an enforcement drive from 10.30am-12.30pm at the society’s main gate and fined 110 violators,” he said. The traffic police also inducted 80-year-old retired wing commander BS Bakshi as traffic volunteer on Tuesday. Bakshi joined the police in the enforcement drive outside his society. He was seen sensitising motorcycle users, who were riding without helmet, to follow the rules. Bakshi said that it was a nice experiment. “We issued challans to several violators and also sensitized them. We will conduct an enforcement drive next week. I feel that to improve the traffic situation in the city, the traffic police and the Noida authority should make a better coordination, as road marking, traffic lights and U-turns, among others, are taken care of by the authority while the police are mainly involved in enforcement,” he said.Later in the evening, the traffic police also conducted a similar enforcement drive in Noida Sector 25. The traffic inspector said that last week the Noida police had conducted a study of three black spots at DND Flyway, Rajnigandha Chowk and Mahamaya Flyover and noted some corrective measures for road safety. “There are 32 lanes on both sides of the DND Flyway. The vehicles used to cross the toll plaza in good speed which sometimes led to accidents. We conducted a study at the flyway and put some restrictions of traffic movement there. Now, only three lanes are open for four wheelers and two lanes for two-wheelers on one side of the carriageway. The restrictions automatically slow down traffic that helps prevent unwanted incident,” he said. The police said that due to festivals the study of other black spots was put on hold. “We will again resume the study of rest of the black spots and take necessary corrections to make them accident-free spot,” Singh said. The traffic police and the transport department had identified 35 black spots in February last year. Any stretch of about 500m, where either five crashes or 10 fatalities took place in the past three years, is considered a black spot. Some of these black spots include DND Flyway near Sector 15-A loop, Rajnigandha Chowk, Mahamaya Flyover, zero point of Noida-Greater Noida expressway, zero point of Yamuna Expressway, Gijhore intersection, Sector 137, NSEZ, Yamaha Chowk in Greater Noida, and Jewar Toll Plaza. According to the data from the Gautam Budh Nagar transport department, between March 1 and September 15 this year, the Nagar district recorded 162 deaths in 317 accidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-traffic-police-issue-over-100-fines-to-violators-at-jalvayu-vihar/story-1KoePIpZCpuezjwIzihX9I.html
17-11-2020||Noida||Three dead as speeding truck hits car on Upper Ganga Canal||Three persons, including a couple, were killed and three minors were injured after the vehicle they were travelling in collided with a truch head-on late Monday night on the two-lane road of the Upper Ganga Canal (UGC) near Muradnagar.The truck driver and co-driver were also severely injured in the accident.The dead persons were identified as 28-year-old Mohammad Naseem, who was the driver, and his neighbours 32-year-old Mohammad Altaaf, wife 30-year-old Zeenat Parveen. The couple’s children, aged six to 11 years, and another relative were injured. They were residents of Tekchand Nagar in sector 104, Gurugram.Police said the incident happened close to midnight. Naseem was to attend a wedding at Najibabbad in Uttar Pradesh’s Bijnor district and had offered to drop the family who were headed to their home there.They took the UGC Road near Niwari, when the truck coming from the opposite side hit the car. “As a result of the impact, the front portion of the car was completely damaged and three persons died on the spot. The truck was travelling at high-speed and fell into the empty canal after the crash. The three children were rushed to a nearby hospital and are under treatment. They are stated to be stable. We have received a complaint and FIR will be registered,” said Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). The canal road is generally safe for plying of vehicles like two-wheelers and cars. It is used as a bypass by thousands of commuters who wish to skip travelling on the Delhi-Meerut Road to reach the UP-Uttarakhand border. The canal is dry as water flow had been stopped for annual maintenance. Altaaf’s brother Mohaamad Faheem said, “Naseem drove an Ertiga while the rest of his family who were heading to Bijnor too were travelling in another vehicle but was quite some distance behind. My cousin 21-year-old Mohammad Shahban too was in the Ertiga and suffered major injuries to his hand. It seems that the truck from the opposite was driven rashly and hit the car. Naseem’s mother who was at the accident site once their vehicle caught up said that someone had taken the mobile phone and ₹15000 that was in Naseem’s pocket during the rescue. We have given a complaint to the police.” The police said that they will probe about the missing mobile and cash and have also admitted the truck driver, Mohammad Saddam and co-driver, Shahrukh, to hospital as they also suffered severe injuries during the accident. The police said that there was no fog or low-visibility during the incident and it is likely that the truck driver was driving rash which finally led to the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/three-dead-as-speeding-truck-hits-car-on-upper-ganga-canal/story-LxATb0k7bIx4UeWKr9PliL.html

17-11-2020||Noida||Rain and reduced stubble-burning count helps Noida, Ghaziabad air enter ‘moderate’ zone after 42 days||After 42 days, the air quality in Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad improved to “moderate” on Tuesday on the back of widespread rain and fewer farm fires in north-west India helping to bring down pollution.The forecast for the next few days, however, doesn’t expect more rain, but with farm fires too not expected to spike, the focus would now likely shift to controlling local pollution.Since October 6, the three cities, and the national capital region (NCR) in general, saw mostly “very poor” air deteriorating several times to the “severe” category, including on the day of Diwali. Relief came in the form of moisture laden winds from the Mediterranean Sea -- called the Western Disutrbance -- and strong winds that helped to disperse pollutants.The air quality index (AQI) of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Tuesday read below 200 for Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Noida at 166, 186 and 178, respectively. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe.” “The present reduction in pollution levels is due to recent spell of rain and also due to fewer instances of stubble burning that impacted the Delhi-NCR region. With the rain on Sunday, the pollution cover has been dispersed. At local level, we are taking up measures to lower down the pollutants,” said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the UP pollution control board. According to the records of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the share of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels was 3% on Tuesday while it was 1% on Monday. The official statistics of the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space (CREAMS) Laboratory, stated that instances of crop residue burning from October 1 to November 15 have been highest this year since 2017 from the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. There were total of 83,756 instances (75,904 Punjab, 5,000 Haryana, 2,852 UP including 15 Ghaziabad, 11 GB Nagar) during the period this year while the figure stood at in 2019 it was 55,031, 65,377 in 2018 and 71,444 in 2017. “The wind direction presently is north-westerly and if stubble burning counts increase, these winds will bring in the pollutants. But for now, whatever bad air we are seeing is more due to local pollutants. In the coming 3-4 days we have no indication of any rain,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of Indian Meteorological Department’s Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, New Delhi. Ever since October 6, the pollution levels had risen in the three cities and spiked to “very poor” and further to “severe” categories. During the pre-Diwali period from November 5 to November 10, the three cities suffered “severe” pollution levels. The pollution levels started to drop after November 15 and plunged to “poor” category on November 16. A day later it dropped to “moderate” category.

17-11-2020||Chandigarh||Chicken, egg prices up as supply runs short in Chandigarh||Chicken and egg prices are up in the city with the advent of the festive season and the winter even as supplies being affected after the lockdown due to Covid-19. Broilers, which were priced at Rs 180 to Rs 190 per kg, are now selling for Rs 240 per kg; and the cost of an egg has gone up from Rs 5 to Rs 7 in the past few weeks.“Demand for poultry items has started picking up with winter almost here, a time when people consume more eggs to boost their immunity. However, not enough supply is coming in and prices in the wholesale market are going up. We have no option but to increase our prices,” says Tejinder Singh Chawla, proprietor of the Sector 46 Chawla’s Chicken outlet.Demand, however, has still not gone up to pre-Covid levels. The lockdown period saw very low sales with broiler prices down to Rs 120 per kg in March.Interestingly, fish and mutton prices are not fluctuating much. “Fish and mutton are associated with the wedding season that normally picks up around this time. However, demand is low this year. More people prefer chicken as it can be cooked easily at home,” Chawla explained. Singhara fish is selling for Rs 650 per kg and mutton for Rs 600 per kg.Bird feed expensive tooWholesalers have also been affected by the rising prices. Ashok Kumar, a wholesaler at the Sector 21 Meat Market, says, “It has become more expensive to rear chickens. Prices of bird feed are going up too.”As the rising prices are putting off customers, shopkeepers are being forced to reduce their own margins to make sure their businesses don’t suffer.Most of the poultry products come to the city from Barwala in Haryana. “There is a supply shortage because during the lockdown many small time wholesalers, most of them suppliers of chicken to Chandigarh, shut shop. They had no funds during the lockdown,” says Harish Mittal, CEO of SS Poultry Farm in Barwala.“Many suppliers had to destroy the poultry (during the lockdown) as they didn’t have enough money to buy feed. This shortage is likely to continue during the winter,” Mittal added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chicken-egg-prices-up-as-supply-runs-short-in-chandigarh/story-xQmdU8UhzSuJkk59runJIJ.html

17-11-2020||Chandigarh||Six years on, Ludhiana MC yet to establish vending zones||The municipal corporation is planning to start an extensive anti-encroachment drive in the city to bring relief from the traffic jams. However, the project to establish vending zones in the city has been hanging fire for over six years. Even after a year since the proposal for establishment of over 150 vending and non-vending zones in the city was forwarded to the local bodies department, authorities are still waiting for the final notification.  Vendors have been at loggerheads with the MC over the issue. An agitation was also raised when the civic body had conducted an anti-encroachment drive before the pandemic. The vendors are opposing the MC’s decision to start an anti-encroachment drive without establishing the vending zones. Last week, mayor Balkar Sandhu had said that the MC will soon restart the anti-encroachment drive in the city to free the city roads from traffic jams. The police department will also be involved in the drive and strict legal action will also be taken against encroachers.Harman Singh, a roadside vendors at Model Town Extension, said: “As per a ruling of the Supreme Court, the MC cannot conduct anti-encroachments drives without establishing vending zones. But, the civic body is still planning to take action against roadside vendors even during the pandemic, when everyone is struggling financially. ”President of Rehri Phari Federation, Tiger Singh, said, “Numerous meetings have been held for establishing vending zones, but the MC has done nothing so far. The vendors are forced to pay hefty composition fees to MC to install/station their carts on roadsides. The vendors also face harassment at the hands of some MC staffers. We demand that the MC should establish the vending zones before starting anti-encroachments drives in the city.”As many as 21,000 street vendors were identified in the city during a survey that was conducted by MC around three years back. Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “MC had not taken any strict action against roadside encroachments till Diwali as we understand that everyone is facing financial crises amid the pandemic. But, the traffic jams on city roads due to the encroachments are taking a toll on the commuters. MC is working to establish vending zones. In the meantime, vendors can set-up their stalls at over 100 proposed vending zone sites which have already been identified. Strict action will be taken against the shopkeepers and vendors for encroaching on roadsides and FIRs will also be registered.”In the last week of February, police had announced the third phase of the anti-encroachment drive under which 60 roads of the city were to be covered. In the first two phases, 40 roads had been covered and FIRs were lodged against around 100 shopkeepers and vendors.The drives came to a halt amid the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/six-years-on-ludhiana-mc-yet-to-establish-vending-zones/story-tWitktlpLoOaYiS2cinW3H.html
17-11-2020||Chandigarh||Cow shooting shows who Nirmal Singh truly is: BJP MLA Aseem Goel||A day after Haryana Democratic Front (HDF) leader Chitra Sarwara came out in support of her father and former minister Nirmal Singh, in an alleged case of firing at a cow in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur, Ambala city MLA Aseem Goel on Tuesday said the incident exposed Singh’s true colours.“The society knows his (Nirmal’s) background well. In Indian society, the murderers of cows are not accepted. He has been involved in attacks on humans in the past and now on cows. This shows who he truly is,” Goel said.The BJP legislator also mentioned Sarwara’s statement supporting Singh, adding, “They are giving justifications that are not valid, taking his history on record. Let the law take its course.”Goel was speaking at an event organised by the Saini Sabha after which he appealed to the residents to vote for his party.Sarwara, in a video message on Monday, had said that her father, who was booked under the Cow Slaughter Act, was “a kisan putra (son of farmer), an animal lover and a gau rakshak (protector of cows).” He had not visited the area where the incident took place, she claimed.“The area on the border near Saharanpur has many slaughterhouses and our personal fight has been about how to save our animals. About 24 of our cows were once stolen, and five more were stolen in the second incident. Another theft attempt was made later that led to a scuffle and a goat was lost,” she said.A few Hindu outfits also launched a protest against four-time MLA Singh in the evening. Later, the members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal burnt his effigy at the Jagadhri gate.“It’s really unfortunate that our holy cows have to bear such torture. All the members who took part today in the protest have demanded a special law on this,” a religious leader said.The controversy comes at a time when Ambala city is gearing up for the municipal corporation polls. Singh’s HDF has recently declared its mayoral candidate for the polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cow-shooting-shows-who-nirmal-singh-truly-is-bjp-mla-aseem-goel/story-rBYdSunQaOO90AN0v3BjYK.html

The civic body was directed to implement door-to-door collection of waste, waste segregation at source, establish compost pits in 922 parks of the city, construct a boundary wall and dispose off legacy waste at main dump site among other works by November 30, failing which the bank guarantee will be encashed by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB).Recently, the monitoring committee had issued a letter to MC directing officials to conduct joint meetings with PPCB for compliance of the NGT orders. During the meeting, health officials were directed to complete the projects within the set deadline to avoid action.Also, a committee of MC and PPCB officials was formed that will look into the working of A2Z company, which has been awarded the contract to lift and process waste in the city. The officials said that a project to deal with legacy waste has already been approved by the city-level technical committee under the Smart City Project. An official, requesting anonymity, said that Sabharwal had earlier directed MC officials to complete the projects within the set deadline, otherwise the amount of the bank guarantees will be deducted from their salaries.“There is an improvement in door-to-door collection and source segregation of waste. However, the work is still not complete. Importance is also being given to other projects. Strict directions have been issued to the officials to complete the projects in time to avoid action,” Sabharwal said. Mayor, MC chief inspect dumping sitesWith residents and councillors raising hue and cry over accumulated waste at the secondary garbage collection points, mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal conducted an inspection at dumping sites in the city on Tuesday evening.  Councillors of the areas that were being inspected also accompanied the officials. Officials of A2Z company have been directed to clear the dumping sites by Wednesday, to avoid action. Heaps of garbage can be seen at the dumping points post Diwali. Lifting of waste was not done properly the next day as MC staffers were celebrating Vishwakarma Day. As per information, around 1,100 metric tonnes of garbage is generated in the city everyday, which increases to 1,300 metric tonnes on Diwali.There are over 50 secondary points in the city where the garbage collectors dump waste collected from houses/properties.

The accused created a company and asked people to invest in various lucrative schemes and later closed it without returning people’s money on the pretext of having suffered losses amid the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the police, the fraud came to light after 58-year-old Rajaram Gholap registered a complaint against the accused firm, Smart Vision product Pvt Ltd, for not returning his money, which he has invested in their chit fund schemes. APMC police officers then registered a case under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act, 1978. “The accused had taken money from several residents in Thane, Navi Mumbai and Bhandup to invest in chit fund schemes. During the lockdown, they told the investors that they had suffered losses and closed the company. However, we discovered that they had invested all the money in their newly created illegal firm, Reachhood Club. Through the new company, the accused again started attracting people towards their schemes. We laid a trap and arrested nine people involved in the case, but are yet to arrest the owners of the company. We are trying to ascertain the exact number of people who have been cheated by the accused as well as the total amount that has been duped from the investors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/navi-mumbai-police-arrest-nine-for-duping-investors-in-chit-fund-schemes/story-ZysaY93yrglnTYJm01f1PP.html
17-11-2020||Kolkata||Leave no booth unattended: BJP’s Bengal polls strategy aims to replicate 2019 formula||With less than six months left for the crucial assembly polls in West Bengal, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday prepared a draft blueprint of the campaign strategy the party would adopt in the run up to the 2021 elections. Top BJP leaders said that plans have been drawn up to the booth level, so that each and every ground level worker could be involved during the campaign period and the party could cover the maximum area before the elections are held in April-May, 2021. “While responsibilities have been fixed for the observers of all five organisational zones and district presidents, plans have been so prepared to engage each and every booth level worker. At least one program would be held every week in each and every booth. Instructions have also been given to involve those workers who might have felt disgruntled for some reason and bring them to the forefront during the campaign,” said a senior BJP leader, adding that there shouldn’t be any area left where the party fails to reach ahead of the polls. The BJP, after winning a close electoral race in Bihar, is now eyeing the Bengal assembly where it hopes to clinch at least 200 of the 294 seats. The party had made impressive gains in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Bengal, winning 18 of the 42 seats on offer. On Tuesday, some of the party bigwigs including Amit Malviya, the IT cell head and BL Santosh, national general secretary (organisation) came down to Bengal and held a meeting with the state leaders to prepare the battle plan and take stock of the party’s organisational preparedness. Malviya’s appointment as the co-incharge of West Bengal is also being seen as a thrust on social media campaign ahead of the polls. The entire process would be monitored by the central leadership, who would be coming down to Bengal from time to time. Senior BJP leaders hinted that the party would adopt a similar approach to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The central observers appointed by the BJP in the five organizational zones in Bengal are Sunil Deodhar, Dushyant Gautam, Harish Dwivedi, Vinod Sonkar and Vinod Tawde. Also Read: TMC MLAs question Prashant Kishor; rebel says Mamata Banerjee no more in controlParty leaders who attended the meeting said in the coming days more central leaders, ministers and MPs would be coming down to Bengal. Earlier in November, Amit Shah, the Union home minister, had also come down to Bengal on a two day visit.“Just like 2019, in which central leaders had been given responsibilities for various zones and districts, this time too, they would be coming down to Bengal. This time, however, they would be given more responsibilities up to the booth level,” said a senior leader. Also Read: BSF officer arrested by CBI in Kolkata in cattle smuggling case While central leaders were preparing the draft plan, the state leaders continued their assault on the ruling Trinamool Congress. “This time elections would be held totally under the vigilance of central security forces. We will not allow the state police to come near the booths. Also a lot of people have purchased land and flats. The enforcement directorate would soon be after them. They might land up in jail in the coming days,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of the BJP’s Bengal unit. The ruling TMC, however, said that it was nothing more than a move intended to boost the morale of party workers. “Ghosh has once again spoken in an irresponsible manner. In every election, be it 2011 or 2016, central forces were deployed. He hasn’t said anything new. He just wants to motivate the workers. It is good to dream of winning an election,” said Saugata Roy, TMC MP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/leave-no-booth-unattended-bjp-s-bengal-polls-strategy-aims-to-replicate-2019-formula/story-H1QH3BSWlQoF4dATbFTzbM.html
17-11-2020||Kolkata||TMC MLAs question Prashant Kishor; rebel says Mamata Banerjee no more in control||Causing embarrassment for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leadership, two more senior legislators of the party have spoken out against election strategist Prashant Kishor, while a third, who was branded a rebel last month, has said that Mamata Banerjee is no more in control of the party. Like heavyweight transport minister Suvendu Adhikari, these legislators too are agitated because organisational matters are being decided at the recommendation of Kishor, who was roped in by Banerjee after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019. Kishor works as a team with the chief minister’s nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee. While two of these MLAs are from north Bengal region where the BJP won seven out of the eight Lok Sabha seats, one is a Muslim leader from Murshidabad where the community comprises 66.28 % of the population and its votes are crucial for the TMC in the coming assembly polls. Mihir Goswami, the senior legislator from Cooch Behar South constituency who relinquished all organizational responsibilities in October and said he was ready to resign from the assembly as well, on Tuesday wrote a long post on social media. He said that he tolerated many insults and adverse situations since 1989 but never left the TMC only because of Didi (Banerjee). “This is no longer Didi’s party. She is aloof. That is why Didi’s men are no longer required. If you have to stay, you have to be a ‘yes man’ or else, leave,” wrote Goswami. Expressing anguish for not receiving a phone call from Banerjee in six weeks, he wrote, “My party is no longer in the hands of my leader. This can no longer be my party.” Ever since BJP’s Cooch Behar Lok Sabha MP, Nisith Pramanik, met Goswami at his residence after Durga Puja, speculations have been rife that he might join the saffron camp. “I am giving everything a deep thought,” Goswami said on Tuesday, when asked whether he would leave the TMC. Though infighting is not new in the TMC, the current spate has its roots in the induction of younger faces in district committees during a reshuffle in July this year. Done on the recommendations of Kishor, the structural changes have made many old-timers insecure. Another senior TMC leader, Jadadish Chandra Barma Basunia, the legislator from Sitai constituency in Cooch Behar, has spoken in support of Goswami and questioned internal changes being made at the recommendation of Kishor and his team. “Responsibilities are being given to leaders who helped the BJP in the last election. This will severely affect the TMC’s prospects in 2021. Goswami is being insulted by some people in the party. There is a conspiracy to throw him out. He is a senior and experienced leader,” said Basunia. Members from Kishor’s team met him on Tuesday. In Murshidabad district, TMC legislator from Hariharpara, Niamot Sheikh openly challenged Kishor’s authority at a rally on Sunday. “Prashant Kishor is the cause of all trouble. Suvendu Adhikari revived the party in Murshidabad. And now leaders who talk to him are facing action,” Sheikh said at the rally. Also Read: After Bihar, it is now focus Bengal and Tamil Nadu for the BJP Murshidabad was traditionally a Congress bastion but Adhikari, who hails from East Midnapore district, changed the scenario after he was given charge of the district organization three years ago. Many Congress leaders switched camps under his guidance. “There are bound to be some differences among members of a big family but Niamot and Basunia should have raised these issues with the leadership instead of speaking in public,” said deputy parliamentary affairs minister and TMC spokesperson Tapas Roy. Meanwhile, leaders close to Adhikari said that he will address a big rally at Ramnagar in East Midnapore on Thursday where he is likely to announce his next step. Senior TMC leaders told HT last week that Adhikari is unhappy with Banerjee’s nephew and Lok Sabha member Abhishek Banerjee and Kishor for making the recent organisational changes and wants the party to field candidates of his choice in 65 assembly seats spread across several districts, including Murshidabad and Bankura. This is unacceptable to the leadership. Also Read: West Bengal: Five injured in an explosion in a house in West MidnaporeKishor drove down from Kolkata to Adhikari’s home at Kanthi on November 12. The minister, who threw a veiled challenge to the TMC in a huge rally on November 10, was not available. Kishor talked to his father Sisir Adhikari, the TMC’s senior most Lok Sabha member, who represents the Kanthi constituency, for over two hours. TMC leaders aware of the development said, Kishor conveyed to Adhikari that the leadership might consider discussing the minister’s demand for assembly poll tickets for some of his followers if he stops acting against the party. Troubled by infighting among district leaders in north Bengal, Abhishek Banerjee and Kishor visited Siliguri last month to iron out differences in the ranks. They discreetly held meetings with leaders from Darjeeling, Alipurduar, South Dinajpur, Cooch Behar and Malda. Goswami skipped the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-mlas-question-prashant-kishor-rebel-says-mamata-banerjee-no-more-in-control/story-3hgo8o83O0CFmpPZFvWE0H.html
17-11-2020||Noida||Random Covid-19 test for people coming from Delhi to Noida from Wednesday||People coming from Delhi to Noida will be randomly tested for Covid-19 from Wednesday, the administration of Gautam Buddh Nagar, adjoining the national capital, in Uttar Pradesh said.The decision for random sampling came during an online meeting of senior administration and health department officials with District Magistrate Suhas L Y on Tuesday amid a spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi.There will be no restriction on free movement of people between Noida and Delhi, Suhas told PTI.“In view of the rising cases of coronavirus in Delhi, the district magistrate has directed officials to form teams that would be deployed at Noida-Delhi borders at DND and Chilla to randomly check people coming from the national capital for the infection,” he said.The district magistrate said the recent rise in cases in Gautam Buddh Nagar because of which the strategy to fight the pandemic is being “retuned”.“This rise has been due to cross-border infection from areas like Delhi and others. So, a random sampling of such people will be done and all institutions (here) will be issued advisory to look out for symptomatic people, track them early and provide them with whatever treatment is required,” Suhas told reporters.He said there was an increased cross-border movement of people during the recent days of festivals, hence the coming few days are going to be “crucial” and the health department has also been directed to make adequate preparations in hospitals.He also appealed to the people to follow all Covid-19 protocols like wearing masks or covers, practicing social distancing in public places and avoiding casual approach against the infection.The random sampling will be done by a rapid antigen-based test, the DM said. Gautam Buddh Nagar has recorded 20,566 cases of Covid-19 including 73 deaths, with 1,236 active cases, according to official data on Tuesday.However, Delhi has recorded over one lakh new coronavirus cases and around 1,200 deaths between November 1 and November 16 while nearly 94,000 patients recovered during the same period, according to official data.The national capital has witnessed a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases since October 28 when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on November 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/random-covid-19-test-for-people-coming-from-delhi-to-noida-from-wednesday/story-Vk1sMaNSFNgEMvfJemAxeL.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||10 mobile testing vans, double ICUs to add serious Covid fighting muscle to Delhi||To curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the government will double the number of tests done with a focus on increasing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, which gives more accurate results than rapid antigen tests that account for a bulk of Covid-19 testing in Delhi.Ten mobile vans will be deployed and labs under ICMR and other scientific institutions will be roped in to increase testing, said NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul in a press briefing on Tuesday. “It has been decided that the number of tests will be doubled in Delhi between 1 lakh and 1.2 lakh. And, a strategy for the same has been devised. However, we need to ensure that the ratio between rapid antigen tests and the RT PCR is right; it should not become lopsided in the favour of rapid antigen tests,” said Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan at the briefing. On average, the gold standard RT-PCR tests accounted for almost 36% of the total tests done in Delhi over the last seven days, an increase from around 28% the week before. It is necessary to ensure high numbers of RT-PCR tests as the alternate rapid antigen test is known to throw up many false negatives for people who might have the infection. The ratio has been skewed in favour of rapid antigen tests in Delhi since its introduction in mid-June as it is cheap, easy to deploy in dispensaries, and gives results in fifteen minutes. To increase testing in the city quickly, Dr Paul said the entire capacity of laboratories in Delhi will be utilised. “Currently, the city does about 57 thousand tests a day, of which nearly 20,000 are done using RT-PCR tests. Delhi has a capacity of 27 thousand RT-PCR tests. This existing capacity will be utilised,” he said. Other than that, laboratories under the Indian Council of Medical Research and the health ministry will add 10,000 tests to the city’s total. Another 1,000 will be added by scientific institutions in the city. The health ministry will also deploy 10 mobile laboratories for testing as well. “Five of these mobile laboratories will be operationalized in the next four to five days and the others will be added in a week,” said Dr Paul. Also Read: Covid-19 showed our cities are vulnerable, says PM Modi at Bloomberg New Economy ForumIn the briefing, both Dr Paul and Bhushan emphasised that anyone who had symptoms of Covid-19 should get themselves tested. They said it was another Covid Appropriate Behaviour in addition to wearing masks, maintaining social distancing and not going to crowded places, and washing hands frequently. With increase in the number of hospitalisations and the intensive care unit beds almost running full, Dr Paul said that the current 3,500 ICU beds will be increased to 6,000 in the next few days with the help of Delhi government, army and central government. The army-run hospital in Dhaula Kuan will add 537 ICU beds, the central government hospitals 45, and 2,680 beds will be added by the Delhi government, mostly through the order reserving 80% ICU beds in 33 big private hospitals. Also Read: PM Modi seeks funding to build smarter Indian cities post Covid-19 pandemicTo staff the hospitals, 75 doctors and 250 paramedics from central forces are being flown in. “More than half of them have already arrived and the other will also arrive in the next couple of days. Manpower will also be drawn from central government and Municipal Corporation run hospitals,” said Dr Paul. With the number of active cases on the rise in the city, the government has also decided to augment the support system needed for home care to facilitate home isolation of up to 35 to 40 thousand people. “The support system needed for patients in home isolation – telemedicine support, pulse oximeter etc – will be ramped up, as the number of active cases might go up in the future,” said Dr Paul. The number of active cases has touched a peak of almost 44,500 in the city so far, of whom nearly 80% people remain in home isolation as per data shared by the Delhi government. To increase isolation facilities for mild cases not eligible for home isolation, the union government has decided to operationalize 5,000 beds at the Radha Soami Satsang Beas centre in Chattarpur and 800 beds in railway coaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/10-mobile-testing-vans-double-icus-to-add-serious-covid-fighting-muscle-to-delhi/story-DlRnj8oWsdWcVx6G8jIa0L.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi Govt declares November 20 as public holiday on account of Chhath Puja||Delhi Government has declared November 20 as a public holiday on account of ‘Chhath Puja’.“Chhath Puja is an important festival for the people of NCT of Delhi. Accordingly, Government of NCT of Delhi, has decided to declare November 20, 2020 as a public holiday on account of ‘Chhat Pooja,” said Delhi government in order.Earlier in the day, BJP Puravnchal Morcha held a protest march towards the residence of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal against the government’s decision of banning Chhath Puja on the banks of river Yamuna and public ghats.Shouting slogans against the Kejriwal government and demanding that the chief minister should either lift the ban or resign, the protesters claimed that they will celebrate Chhath, no matter what.“The government has opened all the markets. The DTC buses are plying with no social distancing norms. But the government is banning the puja on the pretext of the COVID-19. This is clearly a failure of this government. Rather than banning celebrations, arrangements should have been made to ensure social distancing,” said Adesh Gupta, the President of the Delhi BJP unit.Responding to allegations levelled by BJP, senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Durgesh Pathak said that the BJP-ruled Central government has issued guidelines stopping the celebration of Chhath puja but the same BJP is doing politics and falsely accusing the Kejriwal Government of not allowing the celebration. Pathak said that the “AAP demands that BJP should get permission from Home Minister Amit Shah to celebrate Chhath Puja and the Aam Aadmi Party will ensure the celebration.”The Delhi Disaster Management Committee (DDMC) has ordered that Chhath Puja will not be held at any public place this time due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The DDMC has suggested the people can celebrate the festival in private places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-declares-novmber-20-as-public-holiday-on-account-of-chhath-puja/story-vJiMJXwJsZuDpTjQhKEJJP.html

17-11-2020||City||Amit Shah disappointed at us participating in democratic process: PAGD||The People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), which was formed last month to fight for the restoration of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status, on Tuesday hit out at Union home minister Amit Shah for his attack on the grouping calling it is a “global gathbandhan [alliance] against national interest”. It linked Shah’s attack to PAGD’s decision to contest the local elections and said he was disappointed over their move to participate in the democratic process.“Fighting elections in an alliance is also anti-national now. BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] can stitch as many alliances in its hunger for power but somehow we are undermining national interest by putting up a united front,” former chief minister and PADG vice-president Mehbooba Mufti tweeted. “BJPs stale tactic of dividing India by projecting themselves as saviours and political opponents as internal & imagined enemies is far too predictable now. Love jihad, tukde tukde, and now Gupkar Gang dominates the political discourse instead of rising unemployment and inflation.”Also Read: Indians will not tolerate any unholy ‘global gathbandhan’: Shah on Gupkar allianceShah earlier lashed out at the political parties that have come together under the banner of PAGD and said by supporting the restoration of Article 370, which gave the region the special status, they want to take away the rights of Dalits, women, and tribals. Another former chief minister, Omar Abdullah, said they are not a gang but a legitimate political alliance having fought and continuing to fight elections much to Shah’s disappointment. “Only in J&K [Jammu & Kashmir] can leaders be detained & called anti-national for participating in elections & supporting the democratic process. The truth is all those who oppose the ideology of the BJP are labelled ‘corrupt & anti-national’,” he said.Abdullah said he can understand the frustration behind this attack. “He had been briefed that the People’s Alliance was preparing to boycott elections. This would have allowed the BJP & newly formed King’s party a free run in J&K. We didn’t oblige them,” he said.Jammu & Kashmir Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said that his party does not need lessons on nationalism from BJP. “Anti-BJP is not anti-national,” he said. “Were Omar Abdullah and Mufti nationalist or anti-national when you were in coalition with them. You [Shah] should clear this first.”Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader MY Tarigami said the BJP was frustrated over their decision to trust the democratic process.“What have we done except that we have [decided to] participate in the elections. Does it mean that they expected us not to join [the electoral process]? Does it mean that those who are in authority characterise it as anti-national? Is being part of Indian democracy dangerous for those who are in authority?”The constituents of PAGD are fighting the District Development Council jointly on individual party symbols. Last week, the Congress said it will join hands with PAGD for the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amit-shah-disappointed-at-us-participating-in-democratic-process-pagd/story-n1RQGXJrMWAmHRiWRJUHVL.html
17-11-2020||Lucknow||In UP, Opposition may fall back on backward class politics in 2022 polls||Not many eyebrows were raised in political circles when the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) appointed Bhim Rajbhar as its new state party chief.The step came after the BSP failed to win any seat in the recent by-elections to seven assembly seats and its vote share went down to 18.97% now against 22.23% in the 2017 assembly elections.The BSP’s move to appoint a backward leader replacing Munkad Ali is also an indication towards the strategy that major opposition parties may attempt to follow as they prepare for the 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. Major political parties including the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Samajwadi Party and the Congress have a backward leader each as its state president and the BSP’s move is in consonance with them.Will the BSP be able to bring the focus back on the politics of the backward and the Dalits ahead of 2022 polls? “Yes, the BSP and all other parties are trying to bring the focus back on the backward classes after trying all other options. They (opposition parties) tried to woo the upper castes and fielded Brahmin candidates in Deoria. The BJP won Deoria, as it has been working for the upper caste community. Others are paying only lip service,” said Om Prakash Rajbhar, former minister and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party leader, who formed the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha of smaller parties in 2019. The SBSP now claims about bringing eight smaller parties together. It proposes to rope in leaders like Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar and others into the fold of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha. The Bhim Army chief’s recent utterances blaming the BSP for “weakening the Bahujan moment” give an indication of the political scenario that may unfold ahead of the 2022 polls.“We are in touch with Bhim Army and some other parties. We have our options open. The political parties have regrouped in the past and will do so ahead of the 2022 polls too. We have brought eight smaller parties together. These include (the parties of) Babu Singh Kushwaha (Jan Adhikar Party), Krishna Patel (Apna Dal), Prem Chandra Prajapati (Bhagidari Aandolan Manch), Baburam Pal (Rashtriya Udai Party), Ram Sagar Bind (Bharat Mata Party), Ram Karan Kashyap (Bharatiya Vanchit Samaj Party) and Anil Chauhan (Janata Kranti Party). These parties have at least two lakh votes in each constituency and will make the difference,” said Rajbhar who broke away from the BJP ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections.As various attempts to work out new political equations and caste combinations, including the SP-BSP’s Maha Gathbandhan in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, have failed to work, questions are being raised about the workability of such strategy in future.“An alternative model of development and governance is what the political parties need to focus on to counter the BJP, instead of attempting to work out new political equations and caste combinations,”said SK Dwivedi, former head of department of Lucknow University’s political science department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/in-up-opposition-may-fall-back-on-backward-class-politics-in-2022-polls/story-B8FdUUfnfDfG7nM7A5XGcJ.html
17-11-2020||City||Branded Indian spy, Kanpur man returns home after 28 years in Pakistan||Shamsuddin, 70, finally made it back to Kanpur and his family after 28 years in Pakistan. He spent eight of these years in a Pakistan prison after being branded an Indian spy but was later acquitted of the charge. His return set off Diwali- like celebrations in the congested Kanghi Mohal here.Shamsuddin was quarantined in Amritsar after he was released from a Pakistan jail on October 26. A police team brought him to Kanpur on Monday afternoon and he was handed over to his family after brief questioning, circle officer (Sisamau) Tripurari Pandey said.As he stepped into the narrow lane, his sister Shabeena fainted. His daughters Azra and Uzma cried on seeing him after a long time. There were hundreds to welcome Shamsuddin, who was choked with emotion. “I suffered a lot in that prison; my freedom is the best Diwali gift I could ask for,” he said. A shoemaker by profession, Shamsuddin had left India in 1992 after a tiff with some relatives and went to Pakistan on a 90-day visa.After sometime, he sent his family back to Kanpur and stayed on in Pakistan. In 2012, he was arrested allegedly for being an Indian spy and then spent eight years in a Pakistan prison. He was exonerated of the charge and released from Ladi jail in Karachi on October 26.He entered India via the Attari border, but since the rules required him to complete 14-day quarantine, he was kept in Amritsar.After completing all the formalities, the UP police team reached Amritsar on November 14 and brought him back on Monday morning.“My country is the best; the Muhajirs (Indian immigrants) are not treated well (in Pakistan). I made a huge mistake by going there. The Indians are like enemies to them,” he said.On his return, the policemen gave him a piece of a sweet and put a garland around his neck. He started sobbing and said this was the most memorable Diwali for him. His sister Shabeena said the prayers of the family were finally answered and everyone was elated to have him back.His brother Fahim thanked the Indian government for help. The family, he said, had lost all hope of seeing him ever again at one stage. His two daughters, who were three and four years old when they last saw him, did not leave their father’s side after their return. His wife, who has not been keeping well, could not stop crying.“I cannot explain what I am feeling on seeing him alive. I am going to take such care of him that he forgets all the suffering he underwent,” said Azra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/branded-indian-spy-kanpur-man-returns-home-after-28-years-in-pakistan/story-NUSP67X2H7pcHYtuKXuwTN.html

According to the family members, in 1976 their grandfather had verbally donated the land in the city’s Indira Nagar locality for the temple. The temple was constructed on this donated land almost 25 years ago but land was still in the name of late Kasim Ali of Shakoor Nagar here. Meanwhile, a group of local residents tried to take control of the temple as there was no management committee to take care of it. Another group of local residents, led by Sumit Kumar Sharma, opposed them and formed a committee of 11 members for management of the temple. “We submitted all required documents in the registrar’s office almost a month ago for registration of the committee,” said Sharma, president of the committee. They then came to know that Kasim Ali had verbally donated the land for the temple and the committee members approached Ali’s family last week with a request to hand over the papers of the land. Kasim Ali’s sons Hazi Asim, Sajid and Sabir assured them of handing over the documents of the land soon. Kashif Ali, son of Sajid and a TV artiste in Mumbai, said his family got the papers of the land prepared and handed them over to the committee on Diwali day. Showing their gratitude towards the Ali family, members and officials of the temple committee and local residents felicitated the three brothers and Kashif Ali inside on temple premises on Monday and expressed their gratitude to them for honoring the will of their grandfather. “They set an example of communal harmony by their gesture,” said Sharma Kashif said: “We believe that people should respect each other’s religion and spread the message of harmony and brotherhood.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/in-meerut-muslim-family-hands-over-temple-land-ownership-papers-to-mgmt-committee/story-lep3mq9kr48PCQfZixPJKJ.html

17-11-2020||City||Pakistan must vacate PoK: RSS leader Indresh Kumar||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Indresh Kumar on Tuesday asked Islamabad to vacate Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) as well as Gilgit-Baltistan.“Jammu & Kashmir has got rid of a separate flag, constitution, and citizenship. It has now integrated fully with India. I congratulate people. Now, a voice will be raised for PoK, and Gilgit-Baltistan. They were part of Jammu & Kashmir and hence should be acceded to India,” said Kumar. He was referring to the end of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status last year that provided for a separate flag and constitution for the erstwhile state.Kumar, who was in Jammu for a convention of RSS’s Muslim Rashtriya Manch, said it was now time to make Parliament’s February 1994 resolution about PoK being India’s integral part a reality. “From today, a movement will be launched to get PoK, Baltistan-Gilgit vacated by Pakistan. Pakistan should withdraw its forces and vacate it.”Also Read: ‘Those who oppose BJP’s ideology are labelled corrupt and anti-national’: Omar AbdullahKumar hit out at former Jammu & Kashmir chief ministers Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti and asked them to leave India and settle in China and Pakistan over their statements seeking restoration of Jammu & Kashmir’s special status. “It is better they leave India and Kashmir and settle wherever they want to. Jammu & Kashmir was, is, and will remain an integral part of India. Now no separatism will work here and separatist leaders are not going to be accepted.”Kumar said when leaders like Mufti and Abdullah were detained in 2019 as the Centre divested Jammu & Kashmir of its special status, the region was peaceful. “None resented their detention and none was sad. When they were released, none went to welcome them.”He said the Congress’s move to join the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, which has been formed for the fight for restoring Jammu & Kashmir’s special status, shows the party does not stand for sovereignty and integrity of India. “It joined those who are trying to disintegrate India... people will not forgive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pakistan-must-vacate-pok-rss-leader-indresh-kumar/story-7LZJIUw0fPdB4Qm5vZ8bEO.html
17-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra: No relief on inflated electricity bills; pay as per reading, says energy minister Nitin Raut||Contrary to the Diwali bonanza hinted at by energy minister Nitin Raut, the power consumers of the state received a rude shock on Tuesday as the minister announced that the government will not be able to provide any relaxation in the inflated electricity bills that consumers received post-lockdown. Electricity consumers in the state will have to pay the full amount, the minister said.However, the state government has provided the facility of payment in three instalments and has also announced an incentive for payment in one go, Raut said. The announcement comes as a shock to thousands of consumers, who have reported inflated bills after the lockdown period.Also Read: Shiv Sena remains a Hindutva party, will not play Hindutva politics: Sanjay RautThe Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government attempted to provide relief to the consumers but the burden on the state exchequer would have mounted, energy department officials said. Raut, earlier this month, had hinted at relief for consumers saying a Diwali gift is in the offing. The energy department had sent a proposal to the finance department seeking relief for consumers.Raut blamed the Centre for not helping the state and seeking interest on the financial assistance sought in the matter. “I tried everything possible to provide relief to power consumers but when we sought assistance from the Centre, they offered to give funds at 10.8% interest. We contended that this assistance was sought to provide relief to the people. The discussion on this has ended. We have already completed 69% bill recovery,” the minister said. He added, “[Consumers] will have to pay as per the meter readings. [After lockdown] correction in meter readings has also taken place.”During the lockdown, the power corporation staff were not able to physically record meter readings and the bills were an approximation based on past usage. Several people, including celebrities in Mumbai and other parts of the state, complained about the bills during the lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Some consumers even reported inflated bills in locked houses.“We provided electricity 24x7 during lockdown and bills have to be paid as per the readings. Even Mahavitaran [Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited] is a consumer, it buys electricity from other sources. Today we [MSEDCL] are facing a debt of Rs69,000 crore, we cannot avail further debt at this stage. Consumers, who have used electricity, and whose bills are found accurate as per the meter reading, must pay the bills,” Raut added.The minister added that there would not be any disconnection of power due to non-payment. He added that the notification issued by his department has allowed payment in parts and announced incentives as well. “We have already given orders to inspect whether the bills are accurate. If found accurate, we have given [residents] an option to pay in three instalments, if they pay it in one go, they would get an incentive of 2%. We have taken the decision keeping people in mind,” he said.The issue of the inflated bills has also gained political traction as the Bharatiya Janata Party and Maharashtra Navnriman Sena (MNS) have raised the issue. BJP leaders held protests in the city in the past few months, while MNS chief Raj Thackeray met governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari last month seeking his intervention in the issue of inflated bills. Thackeray accused the MVA government of dragging its feet on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-no-relief-on-inflated-electricity-bills-pay-as-per-reading-says-energy-minister-nitin-raut/story-rxc97IR1WhNWZw4IoOX9KM.html

It is, however, clear that the application of microbes needs to be integrated with machine-based solutions,” said Dr Shammi Kapoor, dean, College of Basic Sciences and Humanities, PAU.Dr Kapoor and GS Manes, additional director research, have also submitted a study to their vice-chancellor that a multipronged approach is the only way to manage the menace of paddy stubble burning. In the study titled, “Managing paddy straw with machines and Microbes” they cite examples and previous studies, with the central idea being that microbes need to incorporated into the soil with paddy residue.They claim that over the past two years, nine different microbial preparations, including five commercial and four in-house consortia, are under evaluation at different locations (Ludhiana, Ladhowal, Sangrur, Kapurthala and Gurdaspur) that vary with respect to soil and agro-climatic conditions. With an increase in the number of specialised machines like happy seeder, super seeder (around 73,000 in 2020), the need to rely on exclusively microbe-based approach has also become less relevant, their study states.AK Singh, director, IARI, said, “First, we have to see whether the PAU is talking about our consortium or the consortium that it has developed. Second, we have stated that after spraying the consortium, it has to be incorporated with a rotavator with some soil to remain over the paddy stubble. Then, it should be irrigated and left for 25 days. This is most sustainable option for the long-term solution.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pau-raises-questions-on-delhi-s-microbe-solution-to-paddy-straw/story-lqv3mSxoq5k09Zg9W5771N.html

They had planned to do this,” Shivakumar told media persons here. Earlier in the day, Karnataka Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai termed the arrest of Sampath Raj in the Bengaluru violence case as a major development that will lead to “exposure of the conspiracy and people behind it”.”He was accused and was absconding. Had he been innocent, he would not have absconded. We have caught him. There will be a further probe. His arrest is a major development that will lead to exposure of the conspiracy and people behind it (Bengaluru violence),” said Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka Minister.Sampath Raj was brought to the Central Crime Branch’s (CCB) office in Bengaluru after being arrested earlier in the day in connection with the DJ Halli and KG Halli violence case, police said.Raj had gone missing on October 31 after authorities at a Bengaluru hospital, where he was admitted for COVID-19 treatment, allegedly discharged him without informing the police.Earlier, his lawyer had alleged political vendetta behind the chargesheet filed against him in the Bengaluru violence case and said that the chargesheet had no material to prove any of the charges invoked in the matter.The CCB had last week filed a preliminary chargesheet in the August 11 violence that took place in Bengaluru, naming Congress corporators AR Zakir and Sampath Raj as accused.Violence had broken out in parts of Bengaluru on August 11 over an alleged “derogatory” social media post.

17-11-2020||Chandigarh||HC allows ED appeal against Chautala family for using Dabwali farmhouse for weddings||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday allowed the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) plea against de-sealing the Dabwali farmhouse of former chief minister and Indian National Lok Dal leader Om Prakash Chautala for a month for the wedding of his grandsons this month-end. The case has been sent back to the appellate tribunal, Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Delhi, for a fresh decision, ED counsel Arvind Moudgil said. The high court bench of justice AG Masih acted on the plea of the ED, which had challenged the October 20 order of the appellate tribunal, ordering the de-sealing of the farmhouse for a month. The detailed order is awaited. The tribunal order had come on the plea of Om Prakash Chautala’s son Abhay Singh Chautala, who sought permission to use the farmhouse at Tejakhera village for the wedding of his two sons on November 27 and 30. The tribunal had ordered that the farmhouse be de-sealed on November 6 and sealed again on December 7. The high court stayed the tribunal order on November 6. The farmhouse has been sealed by the ED as the probe against Om Prakash Chautala for money laundering is underway. The ED had told the high court that there is no provision in the PMLA to de-seal an attached property connected with the proceeds of crime even temporarily. In case it is allowed, it would set a wrong precedent that would be exploited by the accused to enjoy the proceeds of crime till the decision is rendered by the appellate tribunal, the ED argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-allows-ed-appeal-against-chautala-family-for-using-dabwali-farmhouse-for-weddings/story-BOuvhgcSSCVSWWTzGHoUoJ.html

In February, junior home minister G Kishan Reddy told Parliament the term “love jihad” is not defined under the laws and no such case has been reported by any central agency.Mishra said they will punish the people who promote “love jihad”. “The forceful conversions and marriages will be a cognisable offence and non-bailable. There will be a provision for declaring such marriages null and void,” said Mishra. He insisted they are not against inter-religion marriages but will prevent only incidents of “love jihad”.Mishra said any person wanting to convert for marriage has to inform district magistrates a month in advance.AK Gohil, a retired high court judge, questioned the need for separate legislation, saying there is already a law against forceful conversion. “If the state government wants to bring a specific law against forceful inter-religious marriages, it should first define the meaning of love Jihad because it is more an agenda of the saffron organisation. Forceful inter-religious marriages, which are emerging as a big problem, should be dealt with sensitively with a clearly defined law.”Opposition Congress lawmaker Kunal Chaudhary said his party will support every law brought for the safety of women in Madhya Pradesh. “But before introducing the new law, the home minister should ensure the implementation of existing laws as crimes against women are increasing in the state and the government is not taking any strict steps to curb them.”Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesman Rajneesh Agrawal expressed his happiness that the state government is serious about these torturous marriages. “The new law will definitely save the lives of many women.”Other BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have also promised to bring in similar legislation. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on November 2 first announced his government’s plan to introduce the Bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-to-table-bill-against-forced-and-fraudulent-inter-religious-marriages/story-nDKBKHnjM4cLAaKNfQONzJ.html

The move, however, would need the approval of lieutenant governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, who is the chairperson of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Kejriwal also said that he would request the Centre to allow the Delhi government to temporarily close markets identified as potential Covid-19 hot spots for the rampant violation of social distancing norms and other Covid-19-related regulations.“A few weeks ago, when the Covid-19 situation had improved, the cap on gatherings in marriages was relaxed – from 50 to 200 individuals. The government has decided to withdraw the order, and bring back the limit on the size of wedding-related gatherings from 200 to 50. The proposal has been sent for L-G’s approval today,” said the chief minister in a video press briefing.Also read | Delhi overtakes Maharashtra in daily Covid-19 count: List of states with high caseloadHe added, “During Diwali, we witnessed massive crowds in markets across the city and in some of them, a large number of people was found neither wearing masks nor following social distancing norms. This has led to the transmission of coronavirus. Even though crowds are expected to reduce in markets now, we will send a proposal to the Central government requesting them to allow us to temporarily close those markets where we see rampant violation of social distancing norms and Covid-19 regulations, which we assess as potential hot spots.”Under the current guidelines of the Union home ministry, states need the Union ministry’s approval to impose local lockdown-like restrictions.Kejriwal, on Tuesday, thanked the Centre for its recent intervention in Delhi’s fight against Covid-19 and specifically mentioned the shortage of ICU beds. “Total beds are adequate in Delhi. Though occupancy in private hospitals in high but there is a crisis of ICU beds. I thank the central government for its timely intervention and the 750 ICU beds they have assured,” he said.As on Tuesday noon, hospitals across the city – including both public and private ones – had 3,564 ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 cases, of which 3,145 were occupied, government records showed.The chief minister also asked people to not let their guards down at any cost. “Covid-19 does not discriminate.

17-11-2020||Delhi||BJP to protest govt ban on Chhath Puja outside Delhi CM Kejriwal’s residence||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will hold a protest outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence on Tuesday to oppose his government’s ban on Chhath Mahaparva.Naveen Kumar, Delhi BJP’s media in-charge, said Dinesh Pratap Singh and Kaushal Mishra will lead the party’s supporters, who will gather near Chandgiram Akhara and march towards Kejriwal’s house.The Delhi government has banned community celebrations of Chhath Puja at public places like river banks, temples, ghats amid a surge in Covid-19 cases.The number of cases started nearing the 8000-mark daily last week.Also Read: Delhi overtakes Maharashtra in daily Covid-19 count: List of states with high caseloadDelhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the government should not hurt the religious sentiments of Poorvanchalis and permission should be given to organise Chhath Mahaparva with specific guidelines or alternative arrangements should be made.“There is anger among Poorvanchalis living in Delhi due to the ban on Chhath Mahaparva... Chhath festival is the biggest festival for the Poorvanchalis and Chhath Vrati [those who fast] cannot leave the puja under any circumstances.”He said BJP-led municipal corporations and councillors have got Chhath Ghats cleaned, but it is the responsibility of the Delhi government to arrange electricity and water.Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, condemned the ban on Chhath Puja and demanded it be lifted. “We carried out sanitation activities at ghats much before the ban was announced. We can create more ghats to keep the crowd sparse. The government should issue specific guidelines to conduct the puja instead of banning it,” Prakash said.Nirmal Jain, mayor, East Delhi Municipal Corporation, said people will certainly celebrate Chhath if not at public ghats, then in their colonies and societies which would again lead to chaos. “The government should allow bigger ghats to be opened for the puja. The crowd can be regulated. We are all prepared but the government should come up with some guidelines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-bjp-to-protest-govt-ban-on-chhath-puja-outside-cm-arvind-kejriwal-s-residence/story-5EQeSHjlTpXZXcXWYVY2LO.html

17-11-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal: Five injured in an explosion in a house in West Midnapore||At least five persons were injured in an explosion in a house at West Midnapore district in West Bengal on Monday. Police suspect that crude bombs were being made in the house. Even though the Bharatiya Janata Party has alleged that the house belonged to a Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporter and crude bombs were being made to spread violence in the area, the TMC has rubbished the allegations saying that miscreants had attacked the house and hurled crude bombs. “Five persons have been injured. We have collected samples from the spot. It appears that crude bombs have exploded. Investigation is going on,” said a senior police officer. Also Read: After Bihar, it is now focus Bengal and Tamil Nadu for the BJPThis is however not the first time that such explosions have taken place in Bengal, which is heading towards crucial assembly polls. West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had alleged in September this year that the state has become home to illegal bomb-making factories. In October, an explosion in a local club located in the midst of a crowded residential neighbourhood in eastern-suburban Kolkata, had sent shockwaves among the residents. Police said that explosion ripped the roof of the house. The injured were initially rushed to a health centre from where they were referred to a state-run medical college and hospital in the district. Even though the owner of the house, Reyazed Mullick, was not injured in the blast, he was later beaten up by the locals and had to be admitted in the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-five-injured-in-an-explosion-in-a-house-in-west-midnapore/story-Hfa0z2BmCRceCSBiAWV2MP.html

17-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra forest dept probes poaching angle as decomposed tiger carcass found in Gondia||A mutilated and disjointed carcass of a tiger was recovered from different locations across paddy fields at Lodhitola village in the Mundipaar round in the Gondia forest range by the Maharashtra forest department between Sunday and Monday.Forest officials said the findings were unusual and they had started an investigation. “This seems to be a clear case of poaching but we cannot identify the cause of death at the moment. It could be through poisoning or electrocution. There has been no arrest yet,” said Kulraj Singh, deputy conservator of forests, Gondia.On Sunday evening, the local range forest officer and his team recovered the carcass in a paddy field belonging to one Amarnath Patle, and informed senior forest officials about the incident around 7pm. Following a preliminary inspection through the night, the team kept vigil until the next round of investigation commenced on Monday 6am using sniffer dogs, forest officials said. “One of the dogs was able to find two bags at two separate locations (both located 100 to 150 metres away from each other) that contained the tiger’s hind limbs and pelvic portion,” said Singh, adding that the remains of the tiger were found in fields belonging to Tilakchand Sharanagat and Yograj Nagpure.Also Read: Pregnant leopard killed in road accident on Mumbai’s Western Express HighwaySingh added that some portions of the tiger’s carcass, including one hind leg, claws, nails, and a portion of the forehead were still missing. “Though we conducted an autopsy, we could not ascertain the cause of death as the remains were putrefied. However, it seems that the tiger may have died 12-15 days ago. The organs were collected and sent for further analysis into the cause of death,” said Singh. The tiger’s remains were cremated in a nursery as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority protocol.“The sniffer dog Peter (German Shepherd) played an extremely important role in identifying parts of the tiger’s body. Interrogations with farmers, landowners, and those working in the area are underway,” Singh said.A forest official requesting anonymity said all landowners had some connection with the forest department. “One is a retired forest guard, the other is a former sub-inspector, and the third person’s daughter is presently employed with the forest department,” the official said. There have been 16 tiger deaths in Maharashtra so far this year, with recent cases including the death of a tiger cub after its mother (Mayuri) went missing. The incident took place at the buffer area (Khadsangi range) of the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve buffer during the last week of October. A tiger poaching via electrocution case was reported from Sindewahi forest range in Brahmapuri where two persons were arrested.In a separate case reported from Supane (west) range in Karad, Satara on Monday, the decomposed carcass of a three-year-old female leopard was found by sugarcane farmers. According to honorary wildlife warden and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau member Rohan Bhate, a post autopsy of the big cat showed that it may have died almost one-and-a-half to two months ago but all organs including the teeth and nails of the dead leopard were intact. “There were no injury marks on the leopard’s body either. This means poaching is ruled out. According to a local animal husbandry officer who conducted the autopsy, the animal may have died due to pneumonia during heavy rain two months ago,” said Bhate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-forest-dept-probes-poaching-angle-as-decomposed-tiger-carcass-found-in-gondia/story-HP6wH4SK6PJNlvpqPKz5RP.html

According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, at 6 am, the hourly average Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi was 162. The overall AQI on Monday was 221 in the poor category. At least 13 out of the 38 air quality monitoring stations recorded AQI levels below 200.India Meteorological Department (IMD)’s senior scientist, VK Soni, said that in the coming week, Delhi’s air is likely to remain in the moderate to the poor zone.According to the IMD forecast, the wind direction is expected to change again from easterly to north-westerly on Tuesday, which could result in a marginal deterioration in the air quality. The stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana has been reducing now and that is going to improve the quality of Delhi’s air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/strong-winds-rain-improve-delhi-aqi-to-moderate/story-jByzRVcW9YEnegRBj7EboN.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 situation in Delhi unprecedented, says Niti Aayog but govt won’t impose lockdown||Delhi contributed the most to the country’s fresh coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in the last week. Currently, the national capital has over four lakh cases of Covid-19.It recorded a single-day spike of 8,500 cases and overall 51,000 cases last week. But Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday clarified that there were no plans to reimpose the lockdown. “There will be no reimposition of lockdown in Delhi. I don’t think it will be an effective step now; wearing of masks will be more beneficial,” Jain told news agency ANI. He added that Delhi has crossed the peak of the third wave of infections. However, in a meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday, Niti Aayog’s Dr VK Paul described the Delhi situation as “unprecedented” and added that “it is likely to become worse”, according to two officials present at the meeting.Shah, in his meeting, told officials concerned that availability of beds with oxygen facilities had to be increased, the 10,000-bed Chhatarpur Covid centre to be further strengthened and RT-PCR tests had to be doubled, among other things. Mobile testing vans belonging to the Union health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will also be deployed in vulnerable places in the national capital, it was decided in the meeting.“Chaired a meeting to review the surge in Delhi’s Covid-19 cases and take stock of medical infrastructure here. In May, the Modi government took a series of steps with the Delhi government to save the people from the virus. We all witnessed the positive results,” Shah tweeted on Sunday. Meanwhile, after attending the meeting with Shah, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the number of daily Covid-19 tests would be increased to over 1 lakh. “Since October 20, there has been a rise in cases here. There’s sufficient number of Covid beds but ICU beds are exhausting. Centre has assured 750 ICU beds will be made available at the DRDO centre. The number of Covid tests to be conducted daily to be increased to over 1 lakh,” Kejriwal announced.Experts have pointed at the ongoing festive season, onset of winter and an increase in air pollution as the major reasons for the sudden spike Covid-19 cases in Delhi. Rising air pollution coupled with the coronavirus disease could make matters worse for people with lung or breathing-related complications, doctors have cautioned.“It’s a combined effect of the festive season, decrease in temperature and increased pollution. Experts had also suggested that at this time Covid-19 cases could rise,” Jain told news agency ANI last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-joins-hands-with-centre-to-fight-covid-19-but-spike-in-cases-continues/story-dayecGzYKuHGLCBj5OStDN.html
17-11-2020||Kolkata||After Bihar, it is now focus Bengal and Tamil Nadu for the BJP||After winning a close electoral race in Bihar and improving its solo performance, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has set its focus on West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, the two big states that will go to polls in early 2021.Preparations are afoot in these states with home minister Amit Shah visiting West Bengal earlier this month and planning a trip to Tamil Nadu on Saturday (November 21) to take stock of the party’s preparedness.In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP came up with a stellar show in Bengal, winning 18 of the state’s 42 constituencies in its best-ever performance in a fiercely fought contest that was marred by political killings and violence.It, however, drew a blank in Tamil Nadu, where a Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) alliance won 37 of the state’s 38 seats while one went to BJP ally All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). In 2014, the BJP won the Kanyakumari seat in Tamil Nadu.In its attempt to reap political gains in the southern state, the BJP has been able to draw attention towards its Vetrivel Yatra (“victorious spear march”), which began on November 6.Also Read: Nitish Kumar takes oath as Bihar chief minister for seventh timeDespite the AIADMK government’s denial to the march — citing the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and law and order — BJP workers went ahead with the programme. And now, they are continuing with the month-long rally as planned, courting arrests briefly. Despite differences over the issue, leaders of both parties say that their ties are not strained.According to analysts, the yatra has helped the BJP to become a talking point in the state and the month-long road show is an effort to consolidate the Hindu vote bank by invoking Lord Muruga, a popular deity amongst the Tamils who wields a spear. The BJP decided to hold the solidarity march after YouTube channel Karuppar Kootam in July ridiculed Kandha Sashti Kavasam, a devotional hymn dedicated to Lord Muruga.“It seems like Lord Muruga is being hijacked by the Aryan discourse,” said Ramu Manivannan, head, politics and public administration department, University of Madras.“The BJP is bringing in a Hindu narrative, which may create some dent, but insignificant. While the Ram mandir issue has appeal in the north, people in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have been marching for Lord Muruga for a long time, so they don’t need BJP to campaign for them now,” he added.Meanwhile, speculation was rife that M Karunanidhi’s elder son and ousted DMK leader, MK Alagiri, had been in talks with the BJP. But Alagiri dismissed it as a rumour. “I am not meeting anyone. I am not meeting Amit Shah,” he said. “I will be meeting my associates soon (in Madurai). Elections are anyway six months away. There is time.”Alagiri is said to have strong base in the Madurai region and has been looking for political partner to defeat the DMK led by his brother, MK Stalin.In the 2016 assembly elections, the BJP joined hands with some small parties and did not win a single seat in Tamil Nadu. It had a vote share of 2.8%, according to data from the election commission. The AIADMK, under the leadership of its charismatic leader J Jayalaithaa (who died in December 2016), won a consecutive second term with the party bagging 135 out 232 seats (vote share of 40.77%). The DMK won 88 out of the 180 seats it contested with a vote share of 31.6%.Also Read: Why blaming Congress in Bihar is a red herring“Ultimately, people would evaluate the BJP on its potential to become an alternative or a third party,” says Manivannan.In the eastern state of Bengal, the BJP has made a series of organisational changes and the party’s top leaders are arriving there to chart an effective game plan.The BJP’s IT cell chief, Amit Malviya, who has been recently appointed the co-incharge of West Bengal, came calling on Monday. BL Santosh, the BJP’s national general secretary (organisation), is set to arrive there on Tuesday.“For the last two-three elections fought in Bengal, Malviya has managed the social media and IT strategies of the party. He is well aware of the issues in Bengal. Santosh is also arriving to hold some meetings,” said Dilip Ghosh, the president of the BJP’s state unit.On Monday, the BJP upped its ante against the ruling Trinamool Congress. Ghosh, while speaking to the media, said that the BJP aims to transform Bengal into Gujarat.“Chief minister Mamata Banerjee sometimes says that efforts are to transform Bengal into Gujarat. I would say this is 100% true. We would turn Bengal into Gujarat. Now people from Bengal need to migrate to Gujarat to get jobs. In the coming years, people will not have to go to Gujarat. They will get jobs in Bengal,” said Ghosh.The Trinamool hit back. “The problem with Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh is police encounter....So we don’t want Bengal to be turned into Gujarat,” said Firhad Hakim, state minister and TMC leader.During his visit to Bengal in the first week of November, Shah said that the BJP should win over 200 of the 294 seats in the upcoming assembly polls, stressing that the Trinamool government will be ousted.In the 2011 assembly elections, the BJP failed to win a single seat and got a vote share of around 4%. In 2016, it did better, winning three seats and bagging a vote share of around 10%.Buoyed by the Lok Sabha performance last year, the BJP is now focusing on the issues of corruption and nepotism, lack of employment, and law and order in the politically charged state.“There is a popular resentment among some sections of people against the ruling party. The BJP has an even chance. The scenario will get clearer within the next two to three months as situations unfold. But it is a fact that the BJP, over the years, has become the principal opposition party and this time they are eyeing for the Bengal polls,” said Amal Mukherjee, a political commentator and a former principal of the Presidency College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/after-bihar-it-is-now-focus-bengal-and-tamil-nadu-for-the-bjp/story-de8gd12ckG2yk6jb5sMoxI.html

According to Bulandshahr senior superintendent of police (SSP) SK Singh, the woman initially lodged a complaint of kidnapping and threat to life against one of her neighbours and his two associates on October 3 but later retracted the statement, stating that she had lodged the complaint under pressure from her family. She approached the police again on October 24 and accused the three men of rape, Singh said. According to Singh, the woman said that her neighbour called her on her mobile phone, asking her to meet him. According to the woman’s complaint, the accused, his friend and his maternal uncle then raped her in Aligarh’s Charra, Singh said. However, during the investigation the police scanned the accused’s mobile phone records and found that he did not make any call to the deceased, Singh said and added that the accused was traced to another location at the time of the alleged crime.The woman’s father, however, accused the police of dereliction of duty. “On October 16, the accused called her [the woman] to tender apology in person but he raped her with two other men. We lodged a complaint on October 24 but no action was taken against them,” he said. The SSP has suspended the investigating officer in the case and has ordered an inquiry against an inspector and circle officer of Anoopshahar police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/rape-complainant-dies-by-suicide-in-up-s-bulandshahar-district/story-BIIQfwAdbgSI7k5shCR2ZM.html

The accused, his two brothers and father have been arrested in connection with the case.According to the police, the woman, her minor daughter and the 28-year-old accused have sustained injuries in the incident and have been hospitalised. The survivor has sustained 50% burn injuries in the incident, while the accused sustained 30%.The police have booked the main accused under Section 307 (attempt to murder), while his two brothers and father have been booked under sections 307 and 34 ( an act done by several persons with common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. Later, Additonal chief metropolitan magistrate court remanded them in police custody till November 18.Station House Officer of Kotwali police station, Yeshwant Singh, said the woman had lodged a complaint against the main accused, who is her relative and neighbour, in April this year alleging that he had raped her in 2018. On the night of Diwali, November 14, the accused entered the woman’s house and set her on fire after throwing an earthen lamp on her. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, 88 rape cases were reported on an average daily in 2019. While the national Capital Delhi occupied the pole position in the data with 1,231 reported cases of rape, Jaipur followed with 517 and Mumbai (394).Many experts believe that these figures might not portray the actual ground situation as many cases of violence against women are not reported due to social stigma attached to rape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/4-arrested-as-rape-accused-sets-survivor-afire-in-rajasthan/story-XR7sqPa0aV36W7KIXQSNmJ.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Losing your job||Jasbir Chatterjee, 54, was working as a customer relationship manager in a car dealership until recently—until the day before Diwali, actually, when she was told that her “services are no longer required.” In a WhatsApp video chat from her home in west Delhi’s Vikaspuri, she tells what it is like to lose a job in these tough times.How did you feel on losing a job, that too a day before Diwali?I was so benumbed that I didn’t think of Diwali at all when it happened. Later at home, I looked at the Diwali photos that my colleagues (I still can’t bring myself to call them ex-colleagues) had put on Facebook. Some of them called me and I fought back my tears to speak to them in a normal fashion.How important is a day job to you?It compels me to take care of myself, to look good, and the same feeling then pervades everything else I do—cooking, gardening, poetry writing, reading, etc. I like to have a fixed routine. As it happens, I also earn the most in my household. My husband, Sukhangshu, is a professional actor and he’s hardly getting any work these days, so it is important for me to earn and save money for our rainy days.What did you do once you were told you were being relieved?I walked out with my head high. I initially did wish I could sit somewhere to let the tears fall from my moist eyes. But that’s a luxury I stopped giving myself after my mother’s death in 2017. I instead told a colleague about what had happened, and asked her to let me know if she heard of vacancies elsewhere. I must confess here that once I was alone outside, my face mask helped me to conceal my distraught condition. I didn’t want to speak to anyone.How was the journey home from the office, that last time?On walking out from the office’s Lajpat Nagar branch, I saw a DTC bus stopping by. It was going to Nehru Place. These days, the Delhi government gives free bus rides to women, and from then on it seemed important to save as much as I could. So I hopped in. I usually go by Metro, but Metro train rides are costlier than before. I was pleasantly surprised to find the bus air-conditioned. After arriving at Nehru Place, I caught another DTC bus (no. 724) going directly to my locality. I decided to enjoy the long ride. This time there was no hurry to reach anywhere. Loud Haryanvi folk songs were playing on the music system. They brought a smile to my masked face. The songs reminded me of my college days and of movie dates with Sukhangshu in my first job. There is so much more to life, after all, than just money, I reminded myself. After having lunch at home with my husband and my daughter, Suroshri, I went to sleep. It gave me a lot of relief.What will happen next?I will look for a new job and be suitably employed again. Meantime, I have plans to meet all the friends and relatives I hadn’t met for long due to my busy schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-losing-your-job/story-t2IUY2KyjnMg8GYx5WJtNN.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: 3rd peak over, no new lockdown, says Delhi govt||There will be no new lockdown in the national capital and the peak of the third wave of infections appears to have been crossed, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said on Monday, a day after the Union government announced reinforcement of infrastructure and human resources to tackle what has been described as possibly the worst outbreak of Covid-19 anywhere in the country yet. In the last week, Delhi has recorded an average of 7,341 cases every day, compared to 4,174 during its second wave of infections in September and 3,446 during the first wave in June. This number was a mere 2,885 a month ago, before the situation rapidly deteriorated as festive seasons crowds gathered across the Capital. “I can assure that the peak of the third wave of cases in November has been crossed. If you look at the daily positivity rate, it had touched 15% and hasn’t reached that level since. It takes about a week for the numbers to go down from the peak,” said Jain, stating that the peak positivity rate during the surge in June had reached up to 37% and in September to about 14%. But experts said Jain’s contention may be premature, since there are likely to have been fewer tests due to festivities over the weekend. The government’s health bulletin on Sunday – which carried numbers reported on Diwali, the day before – added around 3,200 cases from roughly 21,000 tests. Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe number of tests was close to a third of what they are on a usual week day. On Monday, there were 3,797 new cases reported from the 29,821 tests that were done on Sunday. The death toll rose by 99 to reach 7,713 on Monday.The surge triggered speculation of new restrictions, but the minister denied any plans for it. “The lockdown had been an experiment and what we have learnt that wearing masks can give us the same benefits,” said Jain, citing the examples of hospitals where he said infections are low since doctors take precautions. “If everyone follows precautions the spread of the infection can be prevented. And, when it comes to lockdown, some people still go out and they can bring the infection back to their family members,” he added. On Sunday, Union home minister Amit Shah held a meeting with top ministers and officials from the Centre and the Delhi government, including chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and the two health ministers. The government announced a series of measures, including adding hundreds of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, doubling the rate of testing and the deployment of central paramilitary doctors.  During the meeting, Niti Aayog’s VK Paul opened with a presentation describing Delhi’s situation as “unprecedented” and “ likely to become worse”. The official highlighted a particularly worrying trend: on November 11, a day when it reported 8,593 new cases, Delhi recorded 361 cases per million of population, a level not seen before in India, not even in Maharashtra during its worst days. On Monday, the Union home ministry followed up on these measures by announcing a list of “multidisciplinary teams” that will visit all private hospitals and submit within two days a report of whether they are following protocols on Covid-19 treatment and access to services as per rules.Earlier in the day, Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla met Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Kumar Dev to fine-tune other decisions taken on Sunday, according to people familiar with the matter. Among these were ways to strengthen the containment strategy of Delhi as well as using resources of various departments such as the municipal corporations of Delhi, central armed police forces, Indian Council of Medical Research and Defence Research and Development Organisation, one of these officials said, asking not to be named. “Central paramilitary forces will provide 75 doctors and around 250 paramedics to Delhi from their different centres across the country,” this person said. “These doctors and paramedics will be flown into Delhi in the next week .”Also Read: A tipping point in the fight against Covid-19Individual departments involved in the ramping up of the response – from the Delhi as well as the central administrations – too held separate meetings, this person added. The ministry of home affairs will monitor the progress on a daily basis while the Delhi government and these departments — which includes MCDs — will implement the directions issued by the home minister. Bhalla is learnt to have stressed during the meeting on the need for robust public awareness campaigns for people to avoid crowds in markets and public places. Delhi Police has also been asked to assist the Delhi government in its efforts to fight the pandemic, the person quoted above added. Experts said the crisis is unlikely to have passed just yet. “There was a dip in numbers, but it is too soon to say whether the infections have peaked. In fact, I think that it isn’t even true decline. With Diwali, fewer people might have gotten tested. We are likely to see these cases on Monday again,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director, department of pulmonology and sleep disorders at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-3rd-peak-over-no-new-lockdown-says-delhi-govt/story-9e2AbUxhtUL9X8M4l13ilI.html
17-11-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University panel recommends ₹1.79-crore firefighting systems on campus||Despite suffering a revenue gap this year due to the pandemic, the budget estimate committee of Panjab University (PU) has recommended the installation of firefighting systems at various departments, on both the campuses, for ₹1.79 crore.Terming it essential as per Part 4 of the National Building Code (NBC), the panel had made the recommendation in its last meeting: the proposed amount will be utilised under the budget head “development fund” and will be incorporated in the budget estimates of the 2021-22 financial year.A member of the panel, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Many of our buildings do not have firefighting systems, which are essential.”In 2017, the Chandigarh municipal corporation had found lapses in the firefighting system in several buildings at PU during a check and had issued notices for violations.Down corner system recommendedFor firefighting, the down corner system has been recommended by the panel: a down corner pipe is connected to the terrace tank through pump, gate valve and non-return valve, having mains not less than 10mm internal diameter with landing valve on each floor/landing. It is also fitted with inlet connections at ground level for charging with water by pumping from fire service appliances and air release valve at roof level to release trapped air inside.The NBC dictates that all buildings depending upon the occupancy, use and height shall be protected by fire extinguishers, wet riser, down corner, automatic sprinkler installation, high/medium velocity water sprays, foam, gaseous or dry powder systems.Moreover, the panel has also recommended the carrying forward of certain provisions that were sanctioned for 2019-20, but could not be utilised by departments concerned by the end of March owing to the pandemic, to the next financial year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-panel-recommends-1-79-crore-firefighting-systems-on-campus/story-wIPgcHr9xrtpgLX2tWgZbI.html

The family had approached the high court in 2017 seeking ₹2 crore compensation and challenging the MACT order. The three beneficiaries were the victim’s widow, unmarried daughter and mother.In the high court it was argued that the son could not have been excluded as he was dependent on his father. Some other “errors” in the MACT order were also pointed out. The high court observed that the Supreme Court had held that even major, married and earning sons of the deceased, being legal representatives, had a right to apply for compensation and the Tribunal was duty bound to consider the claim irrespective of the fact whether the concerned legal representative was fully dependent on the deceased.The court announced ₹74.98 lakh as the total compensation to the family, increasing it by ₹14.35 lakh to four claimants with an interest at the rate of 7.5% from the date of application till realisation with disbursal within four weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-increases-relief-to-deceased-panchkula-banker-s-kin-by-14-lakh/story-njsJY4VTwA4cM72jFJDhlI.html

Last year, this amount was ₹23 lakh.The accompanying anti-encroachment drive against illegal hosting of stalls earned the MC an additional ₹2.8 lakh. The enforcement wing and MC staff had carried out the drive.On the increased earnings this year even amid Covid-19 restrictions, an MC official said that since there was a ban on cracker sale in the UT, residents had turned to these stalls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-mc-earns-25-more-from-diwali-stalls-this-year/story-bvNDXGOpnMSg5uqaFW90qK.html
17-11-2020||City||Air quality improves in Haryana cities||Residents of several cities and towns of Haryana on Monday heaved a sigh of relief as the air quality returned to “moderate” and “satisfactory” from “severe” and “very poor” categories, courtesy recent showers that lashed the region. In Monday’s air quality bulletin released by the Central Pollution Control Board, not even a single city out of 20 in Haryana mentioned in the bulletin had “severe” and “very poor” Air Quality Index (AQI).As per the bulletin, the air quality of only four cities — Fatehabad, Hisar, Gurugram and Manesar — was categorised as “poor”.It was the first time since the harvesting of paddy began in October that the AQI of Ambala, Ballabgarh, Kaithal and Panchkula was found “satisfactory”, while that of Sirsa, Panipat, Rohtak, Palwal, Bahadurgarh, Bhiwani, Faridabad, and Kurukshetra returned to “moderate” from “very poor” and “poor” levels.As per officials from the state pollution control board, after a dry spell of about two months, rain has improved the air quality of the entire state.However, incidents of stubble burning were still being reported with the number of farm fires crossing the 9,000 mark. Officials believe that there is very less possibility of air quality getting affected in days to come as the harvesting of crop has already ended. Haryana State Pollution Control Board member secretary S Narayanan said, “The air quality of all cities has improved considerably after rain as there is not even a single city that was in the category of severe or very poor.”On whether there is a possibility that the air quality may deteriorate again, he said, “We hope that the air quality will remain at the same level in future.Our efforts are still on and will sustain for another one crucial week. We expect cooperation from farmers as well.”Putting a check on burning of crop waste still remains a major challenge for the authorities as Haryana has reported 209 incidents of farm fires in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of AFLs to 9,040 against 6,364 incidents reported in 2019. The figure may cross the 10,288 mark attained in 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/air-quality-improves-in-haryana-cities/story-5EUDmmP1XTktoZIlsQ8OWO.html
17-11-2020||Chandigarh||Corridors, wards overflow with trash as sanitation workers strike for Diwali bonus at Chandigarh’s GMCH||The corridors and wards of the Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32 on Monday wore a picture of gross neglect as the 300-odd sanitation workers, who have been hired through a contractor, went on a strike demanding the grant of Diwali bonus.While the workers held a demonstration on the hospital campus by raising slogans against the administration, the patients and healthcare workers wore the brunt of their absence. The dustbins placed in the corridors, wards, waiting area and other places in the hospital could be seen overflowing with garbage. Even sinks were clogged at some places, and the patients and their attendants were seen navigating through the heaps of hospital waste.Till Monday evening, the floors had not been cleaned and the garbage was not picked for more than 12 hours.‘Bonus not granted first time in a decade’Om Kailash, the chairman of the GMCH-32 Safai Karamchari Union, said it was only three days ago that they were told that the Diwali bonus will not be granted. “The bonus amount had never been suspended in the last decade,” he said.“We immediately started the protest and no worker joined duties, except in the emergency ward, on Monday. We have apprised the authorities that the strike will continue till their demand is not met,” Kailash said.‘Reported to duty despite odds’Kailash said that the contractual sanitation workers had put in extra efforts during the pandemic times, reporting to duties no time despite all odds. The officials of the hospital administration, however, said that there was no mandatory provision for providing a bonus to the employees of hospitals.Jasbir Singh, joint director of the GMCH administration, said, “The workers should resume their duties because the contractors, through which they were hired, are marking them absent and their salaries will not be paid for those days. The workers are being hoodwinked by a few people claiming to be their leaders. They can democratically protest for their demand, but they should resume their duties. The hospital is not liable to pay any bonus to the employees and such is the case in every hospital administered by the UT administration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/corridors-wards-overflow-with-trash-as-sanitation-workers-strike-for-diwali-bonus-at-chandigarh-s-gmch/story-xWbbLCHgBuhNueZfbyp0IM.html
17-11-2020||City||Rain delays wheat sowing in Haryana||Light to moderate rainfall in several districts of Haryana has delayed the wheat-sowing operations in the state.As per farmers, hailstorm was reported in parts of Karnal, Hisar, Rohtak, Fatehabad and Bhiwani, which damaged several acres of standing crop, especially mustard and vegetables.Though agriculture experts believe that there is no major impact of the recent showers on crops, hailstorm is harmful for mustard and vegetables. The rain, however, has delayed the wheat sowing as it will take farmers about a week to prepare the fields for sowing. ICAR- Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research, Karnal, director Gyanendra Singh said, “There is no major impact of the rain on crops, but it has delayed the further sowing. Rain and hailstorm are harmful for the mustard crops, which is in flowering stage, but it is good for wheat that was sown earlier this month and has already germinated.” Farmers from Karnal, Hisar, Rohtak, Fatehabad and Bhiwani districts have, meanwhile, demanded a special girdawari to assess the crop loss.“Hailstorm has damaged my two and half acres of mustard and cattle fodder. We are left with no other option but to sow other crops,” said Dharambir Singh from Ardana of Karnal’s Assandh.Ravinder Singh, a farmer from Dhani Bhojraj village in Hisar, said his mustard crop on seven acres which was sown two weeks ago, was completely destroyed due to hailstorm. “Now, I will have to sow the crop again,” he rued, seeking relief from the government.Professor ML Khichar, head of agriculture meteorological department at Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agriculture University, Hisar, said the hailstorm has damaged vegetables, mustard and in very less area, wheat crops. “But rain is beneficial for wheat and several other crops,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rain-delays-wheat-sowing-in-haryana/story-xaT6d2t8iqKwZIJd2UxmeK.html

The Baroda voters were not happy with the Congress even, but they voted for its candidate to ensure the defeat of the BJP candidate. The bypoll has proved that the JJP would be merged with the BJP soon as they have lost relevance,” the former Haryana CM added.Slamming the ruling BJP-JJP government, Chautala said those sitting in power were looting the state and people will oust them from power in the “mid-term elections”.“I have never witnessed such a flop government in my political career. We will launch a statewide agitation against the three farm laws, urging the government to amend these laws,” he added.Ellenabad MLA Abhay Singh Chautala said the farmers were even being looted in the mandis across the state.“The farmers are forced to sell their produce below the minimum support price (MSP) in the state. The chief minister himself is lying by claiming that his government is purchasing crops on the MSP.

17-11-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal moots proposal to ban public gatherings||On the heels of the festive season, the health department has mooted a proposal to ban public gatherings and cap guests at marriage ceremonies and social functions to mitigate the spurt in Covid cases across the state. Covid cases in Himachal have been increasing at an alarming rate after the government unlocked all activities, reopened schools and relaxed restrictions on social gatherings. Himachal Pradesh recorded 7,674 cases in the first fortnight of November— a 35%jump in infections. November’s fortnightly tally surpasses the cumulative cases recorded in October. The state had detected 7,083 cases in October and 8,938 cases in September.Authorities say lax precautions at marriage ceremonies was one of the prime reasons for sudden spurt cases across the state. Marriage ceremonies have emerged as hotspots for infections in Mandi, Kullu and Shimla district. In Shimla district, the apple belt, comprising Kotgarh, Kumarsain, Jubbal-Kotkhai, Rohru and Rampur, was most affected. Last month, the state government had increased the guest limit in social gatherings from 100 to 200. Shimla, Mandi and Kullu districts have seen the maximum rise in infections. Shimla recorded the highest number of cases (1,812) during this period,registering a spike of 72%. Similarly, Mandi recorded 1,646 cases, recording a spike of 54.4%, and Kullu logged 881 cases, registering a 36.2% hike in cases.Kangra, which is the most dense district in the state, recorded 814 cases in the fortnight, registering a jump of 26.4%.In the last week alone, the percentage of new infections increased to 2.2%. The recovery rate has dropped to 75% from the 85% recorded in October-end. So far, 22,500 people have recovered in the state.1.5% case fatality ratio Meanwhile, there has been a slight increase in the death rate of the state. The case fatality ratio is 1.5%. So far, 441 patients have succumbed to the virus, of which 129 died in November alone.The state has conducted 4, 58,629 tests, which comes to 62,825 tests per million population. There are more than 4,000 positive cases per million population. Lahual-spiti, where residents have barred tourism to prevent the spread of Covid, has also witnessed a steep increase with122 cases reported in a single-day on November 15.The opening of schools had further accelerated the spread of Covid. The government had opened schools and other education institutions on November 2. However, in light of the spike of cases closed all educational institutions till November 25.The decision drew flak from the Opposition parties, which charged the government of mishandling the pandemic. The health department has also sent a proposal to the government asking them to curb social gathering. “We have forwarded a proposal to the government asking them to curb social gatherings,” said a senior health official, requesting anonymity. “The government should set up a committee of experts otherwise the situation will become graver. It is high time that the government re-works its strategy and curbs social gatherings”,said former Shimla mayor Sanjay Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-moots-proposal-to-ban-public-gatherings/story-zjvCZhUxQ80C9UNAJfo5nI.html
17-11-2020||Chandigarh||Virus spread in Haryana again nears peak levels||The coronavirus infection trajectory in Haryana continued its renewed escalation for the third week in a row with the state reporting 3,146 more infections last week (November 9-15) in contrast to the week before. With 17,070 fresh cases last week, the virus spread is close to the all-time high of 17,616 infections reported in the second week of September when the virus spread had hit its peak in the state. After a four-week drop, a fresh increase in cases during the festivities started in October end when 10,576 infections were reported between October 26 and November 1 followed by 13,924 the next week (November 2-8). Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora, said only four districts – Gurugram, Faridabad, Hisar and Rohtak — were badly affected at present. “These four districts collectively accounted for about 63% of the total active cases. However, as per the past trends and experience, we expect the virus to move again towards the northern districts after November 25. We are worried because wedding season is also going to commence now,” the ACS said. RT-PCR sampling up The health authorities had last week stepped up the testing, taking 9,000 more samples than the week before. Statistics showed that the number of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, considered the gold-standard diagnosis, increased by 35,441 last week whereas the less reliable rapid antigen tests (RAT) showed a reduction of 26,437. The positivity rate from RT-PCR testing is 7.7%, whereas its 4.4% from the RAT, statistics show. “We are going to further step up the testing in the coming days. The entire focus will now be on enforcement of safety measures like mask wearing and social distancing. The biggest consolation is that the fatality rate is 1.01%,” the ACS said. Gurugram, Faridabad at bottom in contact tracingThe health department data showed that while primary and secondary contacts of 94% of the infected persons in the state were traced by the authorities, there are over 11,000 cases where contact tracing is still pending. Contact tracing is an integral part of the strategy to break the chain of virus transmission. The average number of contacts traced per positive person is 6.6. Nuh district with 13.5 average number of contacts traced per positive person tops the chart followed by Sirsa (9.9), Bhiwani and Kaithal (9), Rohtak (8.8) and Sonepat (8.8), according to the data. However, hotspots like Gurugram (4) and Faridabad (4.5) have fared poorly and are at the bottom of the charts in terms of average number of contacts traced per positive person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/virus-spread-in-haryana-again-nears-peak-levels/story-rpiX8p5bEhx1Mz1UEPNkLI.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||MHA forms 10 teams to inspect private Covid-19 hospitals in Delhi||The Union home ministry on Monday formed 10 multi-disciplinary teams comprising doctors and officials from the health and home ministries to inspect 114 private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients in the national capital, a day after a high-level meeting was convened, even as new infections continued their rapid rise in Delhi. Each team has been assigned between 10 and 13 hospitals for inspection, which will begin within two days, as per the order. “The multi-disciplinary teams are constituted to visit all private hospitals in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi to check the status of compliance of various directions issued by the ministry of health and family welfare for testing and treating Covid-19 patients,” read the order issued by Gauri Shankar Jha, under-secretary to the government of India. The teams have been asked to check whether the number of ward and ICU beds available in the hospitals is as per Delhi government orders so far. The teams will also check whether the availability is being displayed in real-time on LED displays and on the Delhi government’s Corona dashboard. Sunday’s meeting was chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah and attendees included chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the health ministers of the Centre as well as the state, Delhi’s lieutenant governor and top officials from Niti Aayog, Indian Council of Medical Research and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Also Read: Delhi records 3,797 new Covid-19 cases, peak of third wave nearing end, says ministerThe Delhi government had initially reserved 20% of all beds in 117 big private hospitals in the city in May before the first surge, with some hospitals being asked to reserve more than this number. Then, during the September surge, the government ordered 33 of the biggest private hospitals in the city to reserve 80% of their total ICU beds, an order that the high court stayed. The stay was vacated during the November surge in cases. The Delhi government earlier this month also ordered 14 hospitals to reserve 50% of its total bed capacity for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The multidisciplinary team has also been asked to look into whether the hospitals are following the discharge protocols of the health ministry and whether patients were being referred to other hospitals without ascertaining availability of beds in the said hospital. The teams have also been asked to check whether the RT PCR testing capacity, if available, is being utilised and what the turnaround time of receiving the report is. The inspection order comes on a day when Delhi reported 3,797 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total tally of the city over 489,000. Only half the usual number of tests — 29,821 — were conducted on Sunday, as per the daily health bulletin. The infection also claimed 99 lives in Delhi, taking the toll of Covid-19 to 7,713 as on Sunday. The 10-day case fatality ratio – the number of people who died among those who tested positive – stood at 1.35%. “If you look at the proportion of deaths, it is at about 1%. Even the World Health Organization says that if the mortality rate is at 1%, it is good. At the beginning of winters, there is usually an increase in the number of old dying. If you check data from MCD, the total number of deaths is not going up,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Monday.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe positivity rate remained a high 12.73%, even as the minister claimed that Delhi had crossed the peak of infections in the “third wave”. As per Sunday’s bulletin, the city had recorded a positivity rate of the 15.3% — the highest in 140 days. “If the current level of testing is continued, the number of new cases is likely to remain the same for about one or two weeks. At present, about 60% of the Covid-19 beds in the city are occupied, but the occupancy in the ICUs — both with and without ventilators — is quite high. If the situation continues, there will be a crisis,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, who is also one of the members of the teams that have been constituted to inspect the private hospitals. It was also decided on Monday that around 75 doctors and 250 paramedics of central paramilitary forces will also be flown in from other centres to Delhi to meet the shortage of health workers in the national capital.In another related development, Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla had a meeting with Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan and Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Kumar Dev to fine-tune the decisions taken during the review meeting on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mha-forms-10-teams-to-inspect-private-covid-19-hospitals-in-delhi/story-RYeXao3gldOz32sSGuWLbI.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi govt to conduct door-to-door survey to identify high-risk individuals||The Delhi government is likely to initiate by Tuesday an assessment to identify locations where a door-to-door survey may be conducted in the light of the spike in Covid-19 cases, said a senior government official on Monday, adding that the objective of the survey will be to heighten surveillance of high-risk individuals and to scale up Covid-19 testing.The official further said the survey is planned in containment zones as well as in localities with a high Covid-19 caseload.However, a formal order in this regard is yet to be issued by the government.Delhi currently has 4,430 containment zones with the highest number being located in south-west district (740), followed by south district (700), government records showed.Officials from the district health teams and municipal corporation would primarily conduct the survey, said the official who did not wish to be identified. Also Read: MHA forms 10 teams to inspect private Covid-19 hospitals in DelhiThe person further said, “They are supposed to screen all members of the household, take note of the findings, keep a special record of high-risk individuals, which include senior citizens, pregnant women and those with co-morbidities. All symptomatic individuals and high-risk individuals would be asked to get themselves tested.”A standard operating procedure (SOP) for the survey is likely to be drafted in another two days, said the official.The directions regarding the survey came from Union home minister Amit Shah, who had on Sunday convened a meeting with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal in the light of the severe spike of Covid-19 cases in the capital over the past three weeks. The number of Covid-19 cases started soaring about three weeks ago, with the highest number of cases so far—8,593—being recorded on November 11. Delhi reported 3,235 new cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Diwali as per Sunday’s health bulletin.A similar survey was conducted once between June 26 and 30 – covering all containment zones at that point, buffer areas around the containment zones and few localities with high population density. More than 350,000 people were surveyed in that exercise.Also Read: Delhi records 3,797 new Covid-19 cases, peak of third wave nearing end, says ministerWhen asked about the survey, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said the objective would be to increase testing. “So far, we have taken all necessary steps to scale up testing. That is the reason why Delhi has the highest number of tests conducted per million population as compared to other states,” he said.He did not elaborate on deadlines, SOPs and other detailsAfter Sunday’s meeting with Shah, Kejriwal said that Covid-19 testing in Delhi would be scaled up to around 100,000 to 125,000 per day very soon – as against the current average 60,000 per day – adding that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has assured them that it would help Delhi in scaling up testing capacity||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-conduct-door-to-door-survey-to-identify-high-risk-individuals/story-BY8SPNuGs1p7C58WcOOZkO.html

Kick-starting the second phase of Delhi’s government’s ‘red light on, gaadi off’ (red light on, ignition off) campaign on Monday, Rai said a solution to the problem of pollution “cannot be found in a day”. “Around 70% of the residents of the city did not burn firecrackers after the government imposed a ban on it. I hope the results will be better next year,” he told the media. The Delhi government had on November 5 banned the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers till November 30, because of the rising pollution levels and the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the national capital. The National Green Tribunal had also imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight. Also Read: As Delhi pollution spikes, AAP launches 2nd phase of ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaignJoined Rai at the busy ITO intersection on Monday to urge drivers to turn off their ignition while waiting for the traffic light to turn green, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also said cracker bursting was negligible this time. “Flouting rules and bursting crackers was negligible in Delhi, but in neighbouring states, there were massive bursting of crackers,” Sisodia said. He said, “The key goal of this campaign is to bring down vehicular pollution. Every day across the city, this campaign is going on and I am sure it is delivering a positive impact on the pollution situation of Delhi.” “...There are various reasons behind air pollution such as stubble burning, vehicular pollution, pollution due to crackers. This is the time when every citizen should come forward and work together to combat air pollution.” Air pollution data shows the air quality index recorded on Diwali night this time was the worst compared to readings since 2015. On Saturday, the AQI reading according to the Central Pollution Control Board was 414. A day later on Sunday, the level rose to 435. Delhi police arrested more than 850 people and registered around 1,200 cases in Delhi on Diwali in connection with the sale and bursting of crackers. Delhi Police seized 1,314 kgs of crackers on Saturday. Also Read: Pollution levels soar on Diwali as cracker ban falls flat in DelhiAnumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said if the government has based its claims on evidence and data, it is a step in the right direction. She said it is time to rise above blame game and address the problem of air pollution because Delhi-NCR is under the same air shed. “It is not about how many people burst crackers. We could see that the cracker ban was not very successful, and it reflected in the air quality data. Even if cracker bursting happened in neighbouring towns, it has affected our air quality. We need to work on a solution together and not make it a political issue,” Roychowdhury said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/70-delhiites-did-not-burst-crackers-says-del-environment-minister/story-TV4ZYcr6WMAudXaqA94YiO.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Winter is here: Delhi records season’s lowest maximum temperature||The national capital recorded a maximum temperature of 25.8 degrees Celsius on Monday, the lowest this season so far, following rains under the influence of a Western Disturbance. However, the minimum temperature rose to 16 degrees Celsius, the highest since October 22, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). However, IMD has warned that by the weekend, minimum temperature will fall to 9 degrees Celsius. On Monday, the maximum temperature recorded at the Safdarjung observatory, which is the representative data for the city, was 25.8 degrees Celsius, two degrees below the season’s normal. Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said the rise in the minimum temperature was due to the presence of clouds in the region under the influence of a western disturbance. “Until now, Delhi has been witnessing a trend of low minimum temperatures this month due to the absence of cloud cover. But because of the western disturbance, the cloud cover over Delhi-NCR has increased. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground,” said Srivastava said. Srivastava, however, warned that by November 21, the minimum temperature is expected to fall to around 9 degrees Celsius. Also Read: Rain and winds help Delhi breathe a little easyHe explained that widespread snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, upper reaches of Uttarakhand will lead to a fall in minimum temperature by around 2 to 4 degrees over northwest India from Tuesday. “There was snowfall at many places over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and over Uttarakhand. Rain and thundershowers occurred over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh and some places over north Rajasthan. Today (Monday) the winds are easterly but they will shift to north-westerly from tomorrow (Tuesday). So cold winds will be blowing from the western Himalayas, where snowfall has just happened. We are expecting minimum temperature to drop under 10 degree C in the next couple of days,” he added. IMD data shows that except on Monday, November’s minimum temperatures have been around 2-3 degrees below the season’s normal. October this year was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital, according to IMD data. The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, the IMD said. Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October. Another IMD scientist said that since September, Delhi did not get a western disturbance up until Sunday, which kept the skies clear. If the sky is clear heat emitted from the earth’s surface freely escapes into space, resulting in colder temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/winter-is-here-delhi-records-season-s-lowest-maximum-temp/story-Rc09skenp9MbcB37cmEjfO.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Owner of building where 45 died in blaze nabbed after 1 year on run||One of the joint owners of the building in north Delhi’s Anaj Mandi that caught fire last December and left 45 persons dead was caught nearly a year after being on the run, police said on Monday. Mohd Imran, who was held on Saturday, is brother of another arrested suspect Mohd Rehan, and carried a reward of Rs 50,000 on his arrest. Together, they owned one of the two buildings that caught fire on December 8 last year, BK Singh, additional commissioner of police (crime branch) said. Two other suspects have already been arrested by the police, which had registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and attempt to commit culpable homicide in the case. Singh said Imran had gone into hiding on the day the fire broke out. “He had been hiding at the homes of his relatives in places such as Meerut, Agra, Raipur, Ajmer and Seelampur,” the officer said. Imran was caught on Saturday after the police were tipped off that he would visit Delhi to attend a family function. “We caught him in Azadpur,” Singh said. Police said Imran owned the fourth and fifth floors of one of the buildings that went up in flames. “He himself ran a small plastic products manufacturing unit from the ground floor of the same building and had rented out his floors to other small businesses,” said the officer. Singh said the two brothers had bought the two-storey building in 2007 and had gone on to construct three more floors. “The congested quarters inside the building had exacerbated the effect of the fire,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/absconding-owner-of-anaj-mandi-building-where-45-had-died-in-fire-is-arrested/story-9klzVu2ETsfXovi18iQa6J.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Rain and winds help Delhi breathe a little easy||Strong winds and light rains in some parts of the city brought the much needed relief to the Delhi residents with the air quality on Monday settling in at the lower end of poor category -- two days after recording the worst air quality on Diwali in the last five years and a 15-day spell very poor and severe air days. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that the overall air quality index of the national capital on Monday was 221, in the poor category. At 7pm on Monday, Delhi’s AQI had reached the moderate zone, with an AQI value of 199 , according to CPCB. At least 13 out of the total 38 air quality monitoring stations had recorded AQI levels below 200. The turnaround was clear since morning. At 9am on Monday, Delhi’s AQI was 300 compared to 467 around the same time the previous day.The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (256), Ghaziabad (292), Greater Noida (302), Gurgaon (314) and Noida (312) recorded their AQI in the poor and very poor categories after suffering severe air quality on Saturday and Sunday.On Sunday, a western disturbance which started impacting the western Himalayas on Saturday brought widespread and moderate rains to Delhi NCR. Delhi recorded 0.4 mm rainfall till 5.30 pm and wind speed of nearly 40kmph on Sunday. From recording severe AQIs of 414 and 435 on Saturday and Sunday—Diwali and the day after Diwali—the gusty wind helped in what was the maximum post-Diwali dispersion since 2015. Unlike previous years when air pollution levels remain very high turning to severe category the day after Diwali, this time air pollution levels gradually reduced due to favourable meteorological conditions, scientists at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said that rain coupled with high wind speed was the reason behind the improvement in the air quality seen in Delhi. “The average wind speed on Monday remained around 18kmph. The impact of the rain and wind on Sunday also showed on Monday’s air. For the past two days Delhi is also receiving easterly winds, which means that the contribution from the stubble fires in Punjab and Haryana has also been negligible,” Soni said. Also Read: Lower air pollution, noise recorded in Chennai on Diwali compared to earlier yearsAnalysis of the PM2.5 levels data from Delhi Pollution Control Committee’s (DPCC) monitoring stations shows a steady decline since midnight Monday till late evening. At several stations the PM2.5 levels were well under the safe limit of 60ug/m3. The average PM2.5 levels at 6pm was 88ug/m3 and average PM10 levels was 135ug/m3. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 is considered safe in India and 500 µg/m3 is the emergency threshold. Delhi last recorded such low PM10 levels on September 28, according to DPCC and CPCB data.Soni said that in the coming week, Delhi’s air is likely to remain in the moderate to poor zone. According to the IMD forecast, the wind direction is expected to change again from easterly to north-westerly on Tuesday, which could result in a marginal deterioration, but because the stubble burning counts over Punjab and Haryana have been reducing now, the impact on Delhi’s air quality will not be severe.  Union ministry of earth science’ air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), showed that on Monday 282 farm fires were spotted over Punjab and Haryana. Its impact on the PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) was also only 1% on Monday. “A change in boundary layer wind direction is forecasted by tomorrow (Tuesday) afternoon but since the fire-related emissions have reduced, significant impact is not expected. The AQI is likely to improve. It is forecasted to marginally deteriorate and stay in the very poor category on November 18 and November 19,” the Safar forecast read. In a special report on Diwali pollution released on Sunday, the Central Pollution Control Board had said that almost all pollutants reported higher values on Diwali day this year as compared to 2019. It could be attributed to bursting of firecrackers, higher share of stubble burning and unfavourable meteorology during the festival season, the CPCB said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rain-and-winds-help-delhi-breathe-a-little-easy/story-jT9S2seV77DHBrUHXKYrMI.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||25% traffic violations causing congestion and pollution in Delhi’s bad air hot spots||In the last six months, nearly one-fourth of traffic violations that cause road congestion and add to air pollution were spotted at Delhi’s 13 bad air hot spots, according to data seen by Hindustan Times. The Delhi traffic police said the number of violations such as improper parking or encroachments on the roads was comparatively higher at these 13 places because of strict enforcement to detect rule-breakers, keeping in mind the high levels of air pollution at this time every year. Police said they were working with the Centre and the state pollution board to ensure free movement of traffic at the 13 hot spots to keep the PM 2.5 levels in check. A major source of PM 2.5 -- the most harmful aerosol in Delhi’s air -- is primarily vehicles. According to data, since June 26 police fined 41,809 vehicles for improper parking, which slowed traffic movement and caused congestion, at these spots. Overall, 206,111 fines were issued across the city for haphazard parking.At least 126 of the 547 vehicles caught carrying uncovered construction material across Delhi were at these spots. In the absence of a proper cover, the construction material mixed with the air, aggravating the air quality. Hot spots are areas where air quality reaches hazardous levels and can cause severe health problems. The air quality index (AQI) in these 13 spots -- Anand Vihar, RK Puram, Jahangirpuri, Narela, Ashok Vihar, Dwarka, Rohini, Punjabi Bagh, Bawana, Okhla, Wazirpur, Mundka and Vivek Vihar -- is usually higher than the city average.Also Read| Winter is here: Delhi records season’s lowest maximum tempBetween November 5 and November 10, when Delhi recorded the longest spell of ‘severe’ air days this year, the AQI in at least 10 hot spots touched 500, the maximum value that can be recorded on the AQI scale.Trespassing on the roads in the form of makeshift huts, shops or hawkers, which add to traffic congestion, was high at the hot spots, where police cleared 3,409 such encroachments with the help of civic agencies. Overall, 24,829 encroachments were removed across the city.“The CPCB had identified the hot spots based on the air pollution levels. Our traffic personnel are working round-the-clock to ensure smooth traffic movement at these places. Our officers remove wrongly parked vehicles,” said Taj Hasan, special commissioner of police(traffic).Of the 51,495 people found without valid pollution under control certificates across Delhi, 12,325 were at these hot spots. Police caught 44 persons for driving vehicles more than 15 years old at these hot spots. Overall, 229 such drivers were caught. Pollution caused by the high number of vehicles (at least 11 million are registered in Delhi) on roads had prompted the government and courts to adopt schemes such as the odd-even road rationing plan. The National Green Tribunal also banned diesel and petrol vehicles more than 10 and 15 years old, respectively, from plying. At present, the Delhi government and police are working on an initiative called the “Red Light On, Engine Off,”which been extended till November 30.Also Read: As Delhi pollution spikes, AAP launches 2nd phase of ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaignAnumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), these 13 areas were earmarked only because the pollution levels there were higher than the rest of the city. She said the only way to improve air quality is to strengthen enforcement in these areas.“Under the (Supreme Court approved) Graded Response Action Plan (Grap), measures are listed on what needs to done when pollution levels reach a certain category. So the task of enforcing the action plan lies with the agencies. The focus has to be these hot spots,” Roychowdhury said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/25-traffic-violations-causing-congestion-and-pollution-in-delhi-s-hot-spots-of-bad-air/story-HPasNiT2hvRlKNg0JA1FdL.html
17-11-2020||Education||LSR may keep aside a few hostel rooms for second and third year students on need basis||Delhi University’s (DU) Lady Shri Ram (LSR) college for women on Monday deferred until further notice the order asking students to vacate their hostel rooms, and said the college administration is considering keeping aside some rooms in its hostel for the second and third-year students on a need basis. The announcement comes days after a 19-year-old student from the college, who was reportedly struggling to cope with her online classes, died by suicide in her home town in Telangana on November 2. Her parents said that she was stressed as the college had asked second-year hostellers to vacate their rooms by November 10. In 2019, the college had introduced a policy limiting its hostel to first-year students only. This was done to accommodate students from other backward classes (OBC) and economically weaker section (EWS) categories.In a notification issued on its website on Monday, the college said, “Current second-year students of LSRC, whose tenure in the hostel finished in May 2020, and whose belongings were safely kept in the hostel free of charge, for five months, were asked to collect their belongings by October 31. Subsequently, the date was extended to November 10 and beyond for several students in genuine need.” .Also Read: After LSR suicide, DU’s struggling students open up about financial stress of digital divideThe college said in view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases and the difficulties expressed by second-year students, the shifting of their belongings from hostel rooms has been postponed until further orders. “The management and administration of the college are looking at how we can help the girls during the pandemic by enhancing accommodation as a short-term arrangement. The process of removal of luggage has also been put on hold until further notice and a notice to this effect is up on the website,” the notification said. “We are also working on earmarking a few seats for some second and third-year girls to be allotted on the basis of need,” it added.Unnimaya P, general secretary of LSR students’ union, said, “The students have been demanding a complete revocation of the new hostel policy. Earmarking two or three rooms won’t help all students in need.”Despite repeated attempts, college principal Suman Sharma did not respond to calls and texts. However, in its notification, the college said, “There was no way in which LSR hostel could continue to be a hostel for three years and also implement OBC reservation. With the hostel envisaged as a first- year hostel only, about 60 girls from the OBC category could be accommodated. Increasing the number of beds in the existing hostel (an old building) or building a new hostel is not immediately possible (lack of funds).The college administration said implementing the OBC reservations (and subsequently EWS reservations) was the only way to make the hostel more inclusive and less exclusive by providing a cushioning effect to a much larger number of first-year students who needed hostel facilities the most.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/lsr-may-keep-aside-a-few-hostel-rooms-for-second-and-third-year-students-on-need-basis/story-FQHkqq1xca2anEDkAuoBFN.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi: SDMC plans doorstep property tax collection service||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has decided to provide a doorstep service to help taxpayers file property tax through ‘mobile sahayaks’ (assistants), in a bid to improve revenue collection that was hit by the pandemic. A proposal to launch the service, on the lines of a similar “doorstep delivery of services” scheme being run by the Delhi government, was cleared by SDMC’s standing committee last month.South corporation officials said the service was mooted after residents complained of problems in filling property tax through the updated online system. People were facing problems in uploading documents and server issues. The officials said the move is expected to enhance the civic body’s property tax collection, which “had not been satisfactory” this year.Municipal officials said the estimated number of dwelling units (households) in SDMC’s jurisdiction is around 12 lakh, which include unauthorised colonies, rural and urban villages. They said the target for 2020-21 is around Rs 1,100 crore of which Rs 500 crore has been collected so far.“We held special camps for offline collection of property tax but due to the coronavirus pandemic, people did not turn up in expected numbers. So ultimately we mooted a proposal to introduce a doorstep service to collect tax from citizens. This will help people, especially elderly citizens, in filling house tax,” Rajdutt Gahlot, chairman SDMC standing committee, said.According to the policy, residents will have to make a call to SDMC’s call centre to avail of the facility named the “doorstep service of collection of property tax through mobile sahayaks”. The applicants will get a unique token number for all future references till the final payment is made in SDMC’s account.“It will work on the model of the Delhi government’s doorstep delivery of services. A mobile sahayak, equipped with a tablet and internet connection, will visit the residences of applicants on a given date and time and help the users in filing the property tax. Users will have to pay a facilitation fee after a successful transaction of the tax amount to SDMC,” the official said.After an approval from the House, the corporation would engage an agency for providing the doorstep service, Gahlot said. The deadline to roll out this scheme is January 2021.Gahlot said the scheme would not put any financial burden on the municipality as beneficiaries would have to pay a nominal facilitation fee to the agency assigned the task of doorstep collection of property tax.“On successful completion of the property tax transaction, the mobile sahayak shall collect a nominal facilitation fee from the taxpayer. However, like the Delhi government’s facilitation fees, we have proposed a cap on this fee, which will be not more than Rs.100 per successful transaction. This scheme will help improve SDMC’s tax collection,” Gahlot said.Atul Goyal, president United Residents Joint Action of Delhi — an umbrella body of RWAs — appreciated the move, saying such innovative ideas would not only improve tax collection of the cash-strapped civic body but also make the process hassle-free for citizens. “It’s a good move. A Rs 100 convenience fee is not a problem to avail of benefits of this scheme as residents had to spend more when they go to MCD offices to file property taxes. This decision should be implemented uniformly in the east and north corporations as well,” Goyal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sdmc-plans-doorstep-property-tax-collection-service/story-LZqmxJ0THOUxWRGaP6byJL.html
17-11-2020||Education||Colours and bustle of campus life move online, DU colleges welcome students virtually||Eighteen-year-old Srijani Datta, who was looking forward to experiencing Delhi University’s “thriving student culture” on the North Campus, is now preparing to sit in front of her laptop from November 18 to begin her first year of college under DU.The teenager, who graduated from a private school in Vasant Kunj this year and will be pursuing an undergraduate (UG) degree in sociology at the Hindu College, has even bought a new top for the occasion. “But it will be a classic zoom meeting outfit-- I will be pairing them with old trousers,” said Datta, laughing. “My friends and I used to go out for “college shopping” during our pre-board exams to de-stress. At that time, we had no idea that this was how we would be starting our college life,” she said.Unlike the other years, when the academic session would begin either by July or August, this year, classes for around 67,000 first-year undergraduate students will begin on November 18 – after a delay of nearly four months brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. Even the board exams results got delayed and that meant the start of the new academic session was also impeded.Since colleges are still closed to undergraduate students, most of the institutes such as Hindu College, Miranda House, St Stephen’s College, Shri Ram College of Commerce, Ramjas College and others have opted for an online orientation process --- the new students will be introduced to the campus virtually. Class representative elections, college society functions, and other activities, too, have been moved online. “Official and unofficial” WhatsApp groups have also been formed by students. During the orientation ceremony of Hindu College last week, students said they were “texting on the group” about various matters of interest, including which college societies had seemed more appealing.“The whole experience wasn’t the same as sitting with classmates in the auditorium, but it was something. I wanted to get into DU and explore other parts of the city along with meeting new people and joining different societies or sports teams. But now, we know these can’t happen anytime soon. So while talking to my classmates who are not from Delhi, I tell them that the city is beautiful in February and we will have more fun if they get to join the college at that time,” said Datta. So far, the university has not made any plans to reopen colleges for UG students.From the delay in board exam results to soaring DU cutoffs, followed by the lengthy admission process, the year of the pandemic was particularly difficult for young students transitioning from school to college, especially for those who had to change cities.Varanasi resident Chitransh Srivastava, 18, who will be pursuing BA programme in Shivaji College, said many of his friends were not allowed to move to Delhi for their graduation due to the pandemic. “Their parents insisted on getting them admitted to local universities; so I don’t really have a support system in Delhi. We had been excited about coming to Delhi because the culture is completely different here. But now I am a little concerned. Our semester exams are scheduled to take place in March and we will need some offline classes before that to understand the exam culture. Even if we join in December or late January, we will not have enough time to easily adjust and study. ”Vanisha Meena, 18, a resident of Kota who will be pursuing an English degree at St Stephen’s College, however, viewed it differently. “We are sad about missing out on campus life. Outstation students, especially female students, often want to move out of their homes and explore different things which shape their identity. But we are also gaining a new experience -- of getting to know people through online platforms first and then meeting them in person, whenever the college reopens.”Students also said college societies are “reinventing themselves” and creating events that can be done virtually. These events also allow freshers to speak to students of all batches instead of just their classmates. “We often have zoom meetings in the evening where students talk about various contemporary issues -- politics or our writing. We do rant about missing out on campus life and exploring a new city. But at least we can rant together,” said Meena.While St Stephen’s College conducted a communion service and online assembly through YouTube streaming links on Monday, Shri Ram College of Commerce will also conduct a three-level orientation programme for its students. Principal Simrit Kaur said, “Each section of students, comprising around 50-60 students, has two mentor teachers who can be approached for queries. They will also be introduced to societies, alumni, and teachers through virtual platforms. It is a difficult time and we are trying to smoothen the transition for students. We have also introduced them to our psychological and career counsellors who will remain available online.”After the recent death by suicide of an undergraduate student from Lady Shri Ram College, principals are also making efforts to ensure freshers are not left without any support system in their first year of college.Anju Shrivastava, principal of Hindu College, said, “We had our orientation day with freshers on November 11 and did a long session with the college counsellor. She talked to students about when they should seek counselling as it is important for students to identify when they or their friends need help. We have also formed groups of first-year students along with second- and third-year students and teachers as part of a peer mentoring system. That way, students can be more comfortable in posing their queries either to seniors or teachers about courses, books, or anything else regarding the college.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/colours-and-bustle-of-campus-life-move-online-du-colleges-welcome-students-virtually/story-96ARQKM1tgzTYAtgL1bK4J.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Missing glasses help court decide bail plea||The Delhi high court has granted bail to an accused in one of the cases of riots in north east Delhi’s Bhajanpura area, on the grounds that even though he had a weak eyesight, he was not wearing glasses in the CCTV footage submitted by the police to establish his presence at the spot as well as the absence of call detail records as corroborating evidence. While granting bail to Saiyad Iftikhar on a personal bond of Rs 15,000, justice Suresh Kait said that it is not in dispute that he had a weak eyesight (-3.75) and he was wearing spectacles when he was arrested even though the CCTV footage did not show him wearing glasses.“It is not in dispute that petitioner’s eye sight is weak (-3.75) and when he was arrested he was wearing spectacles. However, petitioner was arrested on the basis of CCTV footage along with co accused Ali Hasan but admitted fact is that in CCTV footage petitioner is not wearing spectacles.“The alleged incident is dated February 24 at 21:31.50 hour. Thus, it cannot be believed that a person having such weak eye sight would have clear vision at night without spectacles. Moreover, CDR is not on record, whereby it could have been established that the petitioner was available at the site,” the judge said in his order of November 12.According to the plea filed through advocates Mehmood Pracha and Jatin Bhatt, Iftikhar had been falsely and maliciously implicated in the FIR registered at Bhajanpura police station for rioting, unlawful assembly and arson. He has been in custody since April 11.Appearing for the accused, advocate Pracha contended that his client was arrested for alleged arson, looting, and damaging of shops, despite no public and police witnesses. He said his client’s name has also not been mentioned in the FIR.He submitted that the only basis of arrest is the alleged sighting of his client on CCTV footage as well as certain undisclosed secret information. Challenging the orders of the trial court which had dismissed his bail pleas, Pracha stated that no recoveries have been made from Iftikhar and the charge sheet in the case has already been filed.The court after hearing the contentions, said, “Keeping in view the above facts and the fact that petitioner is in judicial custody (JC) since April 11, therefore, I am of the view that the petitioner (ifitkhar) deserves bail”.Communal riots had broken out in the city in February this year claiming 53 lives and leaving over 400 injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-missing-glasses-help-court-decide-bail-plea/story-5GV4K9tXqi3cbTxyUPrhyL.html
17-11-2020||Delhi||Family attacked with swords for objecting to lewd remarks||A man and his family members were allegedly attacked with a sword and an iron rod by group of men for objecting to lewd remarks passed on his teenage daughter in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar on Diwali night, the police said. The attack left the young woman, her sister and brother and their parents with cuts and wounds, but all of them are out of danger, Samir Sharma, additional deputy commissioner of police (west), said. The police nabbed two of the four suspects and obtained their custody for two days to help catch two other alleged assailants. Sharma said the accused men and the victims live in the same neighbourhood in Tilak Nagar. The victim’s family runs a street side stall. Around 11pm on Diwali night, the two sisters -- aged 18 and 20 -- were standing outside their house when a neighbour allegedly said something objectionable to the younger woman, the police officer said. The officer said the woman’s father objected to the behaviour, but he responded by fighting with the family. “Soon, the man was joined by three other men who were armed with a sword and an iron rod,” Sharma said.In the assault that followed, the father of the two women received the most grievous injuries while the other four family members sustained relatively less serious wounds.A caller initially informed the police control room that the hands of the two sisters were chopped off and their father was decapitated, Sharma said. But when the police reached the spot, the injuries weren’t as serious as the caller had made it out to be, the officer said. They were taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital where they are undergoing treatment. The police subsequently nabbed the alleged attacker and another suspect.Police said they initially registered a case of attempt to murder given the nature of injuries to the women’s father and a case of causing hurt with dangerous weapons for wounds received by the other members of the family.Later, on the statement of the woman who was allegedly being harassed, the police added sections of molestation, sexual harassment and criminal intimidation. “The woman’s statement is being recorded in court and the investigation into the assault continues,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/family-attacked-with-swords-for-objecting-to-lewd-remarks/story-ZYe1JQSRiQzF1vLYzJ323O.html

Additionally, 50% of the general beds across 42 private hospitals have also been reserved for moderately ill Covid-19 patients, as per the directives issued by the deputy commissioner Amit Khatri. Earlier this week, Delhi government reserved 80% ICU beds for Covid-19 patients in 33 private hospitals in the city. With Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) noticing a consistent upward trend in cases and a proportionate uptick in hospitalisation, Niti Aayog on Friday had directed the state officials to urgently increase bed capacity in the neighbouring states of the Capital. “Under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005, public and private hospitals have been directed to ensure that 50% of the general beds and 75% of ICU/ventilator beds are reserved for Covid-19 cases,” stated Khatri in the order. Till now, only 35% beds in hospitals were reserved for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. It included both general and ICU beds along with those with ventilator. The bed capacity earlier in September was increased from 25% to 35%. Amid the record surge in Covid-19 cases since the last week of October, hospital beds are fast being occupied by serious new infections. Hospitalisation has consistently increased from 191 on November 2 to 293 on November 7 and further to 408 on November 13. On Monday, at least 417 infected patients from Gurugram were hospitalised. Additionally, 287 outstation patients from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, parts of Haryana and other states are also undergoing treatment, as per the district hospitalisation data.“There has been a 40% increase in the ICU beds with the spike in Covid-19 cases, which is leading to fast occupancy of beds in hospitals,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. “The decision to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients has been taken based on the directives issued by Niti Aayog on Friday to tackle surge of Covid-19 cases in Delhi-NCR in the last three weeks,” he said. Data available on the government website showed that on Monday, 2,095 beds were reserved in 42 hospitals. It includes 312 ICU beds and 139 beds with ventilator support system. Of these 118 ICU beds and 63 ventilators are presently occupied. Also, out of 1,644 general beds, at least 994 are occupied. Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine department and school of public health , PGIMER- Chandigarh, said, “There is no specific treatment for Covid-19 except for the supportive care, which should be provided to serious patients immediately. With increased bed capacity, people will not be left without treatment and mortality would be controlled. Some people due to age, poor immunity and co-morbidity issue might succumb to the illness but citizens should not die due to lack of treatment facilities.”On Monday, 546 new infections were confirmed from 2,524 samples collected on Sunday. Due to the festive weekend, overall testing recorded a dip from the daily average of 3,000 tests. But at least 3,501 samples were collected on Monday. Currently, cases are growing at a weekly test positivity rate of nearly 18%. The total tally of Covid-19 has reached to 39,933. Of these, 5,749 are active cases while 33,940 have recovered from the illness. The Covid-19 death toll also reached 244, with three new deaths being reported in the last 24 hours. Presently, 92% of the active cases are home isolated and seven percent of the patients are hospitalised. Yadav said that as part of the strategy, the next action would be to further increase testing to identify new infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-reserves-75-of-icu-beds-for-seriously-ill-covid-19-patients/story-XzlWmEwFDqxYUPrLOLusOL.html
17-11-2020||World||Volunteers still needed to test variety of coronavirus vaccines||Two Covid-19 vaccines might be nearing the finish line, but scientists caution it’s critical that enough people volunteer to help finish studying other candidates in the US and around the world.Moderna Inc and competitor Pfizer Inc recently announced preliminary results showing their vaccines appear more than 90% effective, at least for short-term protection against Covid-19.If those early results hold up and US regulators agree the shots are safe, emergency use of small, rationed supplies could start in late December. Other countries with contracts for early doses would undertake their own reviews.But multiple vaccines will be needed to meet global demand and help end the pandemic, raising concern that studies that still need to sign up thousands of volunteers could run short if people wait for an already OK’d option instead.“We don’t want to see that happen,” said Dr James Cutrell, an infectious disease expert at UT Southwestern Medical Centre in Dallas.Supplies aside, other Covid-19 vaccines under development may work differently in different populations and “we likely will benefit from having a menu of vaccine options,” Cutrell said.“We still need volunteers,” stressed National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins, urging Americans to sign up.Additionally, participants in the Moderna and Pfizer studies who originally got dummy shots would almost certainly be offered the real vaccine if the US Food and Drug Administration allows emergency use. But no one knows how long protection would last, meaning those studies also must continue to track recipients somehow.Also Read| Covid-19 in US: States plead for more federal help as virus outbreak worsens“It’s one thing to be effective two months after your last vaccination and another thing to be effective a year” later, said Dr Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former director of the FDA’s vaccine division. “It’s going to be really important to complete these clinical trials and the trials of the other vaccines so we can make comparisons.” The promising Moderna and Pfizer news bodes well for some of their competitors, said Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert whose team at NIH helped develop the Moderna candidate.Those shots target the “spike” protein that studs the surface of the coronavirus, and the early results prove that’s enough to generate “a protective response”, Fauci said. “Conceptually this looks good” for other spike-focused vaccines made in different ways.Here’s a scorecard of the frontrunners in the global vaccine race: GENETIC CODE VACCINES The Moderna-NIH vaccine and the candidate developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech aren’t made with the coronavirus itself, meaning there’s no chance anyone could catch it from the shots.Instead, the vaccines are made with a brand-new technology that injects a piece of genetic code for the spike protein. That messenger RNA, or mRNA, instructs the body to make some harmless spike protein, enough to prime the immune system to react if it later encounters the real virus.There are no licensed mRNA vaccines for people, so scientists had no idea if or how well the Covid-19 candidates might work.Both manufacturers are working to scale up production in factories in the US and Europe. They can’t simply partner with other vaccine companies to take on some of the work because the technology is so different than the way most of today’s shots are made.“It is not a very easy or quick swap,” said Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel.TROJAN HORSE VACCINES A different way to target the spike protein: Use another, harmless virus to carry the spike gene into the body. Once again, the body produces some spike protein and primes the immune system.Britain’s Oxford University and AstraZeneca are making their version of this “viral vector” vaccine with a cold virus, or adenovirus, that normally infects chimpanzees. Studies of tens of thousands of people are underway in the UK, US and several other countries.Johnson & Johnson is using a human adenovirus for its version, and is the only option in advanced US testing aiming to show if a single dose rather than two would be enough.Also Read: Joe Biden fears more people may die from Covid-19 as Donald Trump delays smooth transitionChina’s government authorised emergency use of CanSino Biologics’ adenovirus shots in the military ahead of any final testing. Russia likewise began offering an adenovirus vaccine ahead of late-stage tests.PROTEIN VACCINES Novavax makes its vaccine candidate by growing harmless copies of the coronavirus spike protein in the laboratory and packaging them into virus-sized nanoparticles.There are protein-based vaccines against other diseases, so it’s not as novel a technology as some of its competitors. Novavax has begun a large final-stage study in Britain, and is set soon to begin another in the US.“KILLED” VACCINES Spike-focused vaccines aren’t the only option. Making vaccines by growing a disease-causing virus and then killing it is a tried-and-true approach — it’s the way Jonas Salk’s famed polio shots were made.China has three so-called “inactivated” Covid-19 vaccine candidates in final testing in several countries, and has allowed emergency use in some people ahead of the results. An Indian company is testing its own inactivated candidate.Safely brewing and then killing the virus takes longer than newer technologies. But inactivated vaccines give the body a sneak peek at the germ itself rather than just that single spike protein.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/volunteers-still-needed-to-test-variety-of-coronavirus-vaccines/story-bPMdnikrGZbNfARm18xe7M.html

During a Congressional hearing over the company’s content moderation policy, Senator Dianne Feinstein mentioned a Trump’s tweet in which he had claimed a win in the presidential elections while media networks had not called the election in anyone’s favour.Feinstein, a Democrat and ranking member of Senate Judiciary Committee, said that Trump and his allies tweeted hundreds of false claims about 2020 elections. She highlighted that the US President even falsely claimed victory and alleged widespread voter fraud. The 87-year-old Senator quoted Trump tweet from November 7, which reads “I won this election by a lot”.Also Read | Facebook, Twitter CEOs facing questions on poll measuresTwitter applied a warning label to the tweet, saying “Official sources may not have called the race when this was tweeted”. Feinstein asked Dorsey whether he believes a label goes “far enough to prevent the tweet’s harms” when the tweet is still visible and not accurate. “I do, because it’s not the just surface-level label. It points to a collection of news articles of information and conversation that gives you an expansion on what’s happening with the election,” replied Dorsey.Seemingly unconvinced by the answer, the Senator reiterated the question, stressing that these tweets “arouse people”. She said that the entity running such an operation ought to have an understanding that the tweets can play a major role on stirring people up to unacceptable levels.“I believe it’s really important that we show people a broader context. And that is the intention of the label. It is not just text below a tweet, it is a link to connect to a much larger conversation and news articles across the spectrum,” said Dorsey, without providing proper justification for keeping the tweets on the platform. During the hearing, the Twitter chief also testified that the platform has removed some 300,000 election-related tweets between October 27 and November 11, representing 0.2 per cent of all election-related tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-defends-decision-to-not-remove-trump-s-tweet-falsely-claiming-victory/story-RoDlJkAkdgj3qbQYrct6oJ.html
17-11-2020||World||Joe Biden fears more people may die from Covid-19 as Donald Trump delays smooth transition||US President-elect Joe Biden on Monday said more Americans “may die” because of President Donald Trump’s failure to allow his administration to cooperate and coordinate its response to the Covid-19 pandemic with members of the incoming team - part of his broader refusal to accept the outcome of the election.Biden had run on the promise of according top priority to the battle against Covid-19 if elected, and in his first significant step since the election, he set up an advisory team to start planning his administration’s approach after his inauguration on January 20. It has received no cooperation from Trump’s team yet.“More people may die if we don’t coordinate,” Biden told reporters when asked about the consequences of Trump’s refusal to cooperate with the new administration. “The vaccine is important. But it’s of no use until you’re vaccinated.”He said it would take a massive effort to get all Americans vaccinated - “a huge, huge, huge undertaking” - and pressed for the need to read into the Trump administration’s plan for development, procurement and distribution of vaccine under Operation Warp Speed, saying, “If we have to wait until January 20 to start that planning, it puts us behind.”The deadly coronavirus has killed more than 247,000 Americans and infected over 11.2 million. Cases have been surging in recent days with 166,045 new infections reported in the last 24 hours and 995 fatalities, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.“We’re going into a very dark winter. Things are going to get much tougher before they get easier,” Biden said. “That requires sparing no effort to fight Covid, so that we can open our businesses safely, resume our lives and put this pandemic behind us. It’s going to be difficult, but it can be done.”On Trump’s refusal to allow the transition process, Biden said, “I find this more embarrassing for the country than debilitating for my ability to get started.” Trump has refused to publicly acknowledge that Biden beat him in the election, and has launched a flurry of lawsuits challenging the outcome. Also, he has barred his administration from getting started with the routine transition process, denying the president-elect intelligence briefings, among other things, that he should be getting.Trump has lately appeared to have tuned out of the pandemic. He last attended a meeting of his coronavirus team five months ago and has barely acknowledged the crisis in his tweets, which are mostly about allegations of election fraud and claims that he won the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-fears-more-people-may-die-from-covid-19-as-donald-trump-delays-smooth-transition/story-PhPkqUqPLKQkQIOWW7ZndN.html
17-11-2020||World||Indian-American attorney explains how student loan debt cancellation via executive order is good economics||An Indian-American member of Covid-19 Congressional Oversight Commission has made a case for broad student loan debt cancellation via executive order. In a series of tweets, Bharat Ramamurti, a Democrat, argued that cancelling student loan debt has positive income effects. Sharing the data on student loans and other education debts, Ramamurti highlighted that a median borrower’s typical monthly payment is between $200 and $299 per month. He said that cancelling debt could reduce or eliminate those payments, which could be equivalent to sending them a check every month.Ramamurti, who acted as top economic adviser of Senator Elizabeth Warren during her presidential campaign, said that student debt contributes to the reason behind declining home ownership. He stressed that cancelling the debt would lead to more jobs and growth. Citing a study on macroeconomic effects of student debt cancellation, Ramamurti said that cancelling all debt would have a big stimulative effect.“The impact would be less if less debt were canceled, but debt cancellation one of the relatively few ways to really stimulate the economy without Congress,” he tweeted.Also Read | Know the top contenders for Secretary of State in Biden AdministrationAccording to the latest data and research by the Roosevelt Institute, student debt is also a racial issue. Ramamurti said that the median White borrower, twenty years after graduating, has paid off 94 per cent of their student loan balance, while the median Black borrower still owes 95 per cent.Ramamurti noted that debt cancellation has the highest approval among people earning under $50,000 per year and among people who don’t have a college degree. He concluded that broad debt cancellation via executive order is “popular, economically potent, and life-changing for millions of Americans struggling through this crisis.” During Warren’s presidential pitch, Ramamurti helped develop a number of proposals, including the much-debated wealth tax and student loan debt cancellation plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-attorney-explains-how-student-loan-debt-cancellation-via-executive-order-is-good-economics/story-5clWfT3NzDfAWCLfYXMPeJ.html
17-11-2020||World||US, Europe plan vaccination schemes as second virus wave builds||Plans for vaccination programmes began taking shape in Europe and the United States following recent breakthroughs, as surging coronavirus caseloads prompted gruelling new restrictions, with Austria taking the unpopular step Tuesday of closing schools and shops.Global hopes of vanquishing the coronavirus pandemic were high after US biotech firm Moderna said its vaccine candidate was nearly 95 percent effective in a trial, a week after similar results announced by pharma giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.Top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci hailed the results, telling AFP that the data exceeded expectations. “The idea that we have a 94.5 percent effective vaccine is stunningly impressive,” he said.Moderna, whose clinical trial involved more than 30,000 participants, expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the United States by year-end -- with elderly and at-risk people to be first in line for jabs.The US Food and Drug Agency may approve both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines early next month, according to Moncef Slaoui, head of the government’s “Operation Warp Speed” vaccine quest.He said that from January, 25 million people would be vaccinated per month.France too said it was “getting on the starting blocks” for a vaccination programme to launch in January pending French and EU regulatory approval, budgeting 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) for the rollout in 2021, according to spokesman Gabriel Attal.Fauci, who heads the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, warned it would be crucial to convince people to take the vaccine, particularly in the US, where anti-vaccine sentiment runs high.“A vaccine with a high degree of efficacy is of no use if nobody gets vaccinated,” he said.Yet with widespread availability of any vaccine still far off, restrictions on free movement, gatherings and business were inevitable as the second wave of the coronavirus continued to build.In the hardest-hit United States, President-elect Joe Biden expressed frustration over Donald Trump’s refusal to cooperate on the White House transition process, saying “more people may die” of Covid-19 without immediate coordination on fighting the pandemic.Globally, infections have surpassed 55 million with more than 1.3 million deaths, and experts caution the months ahead will still be difficult and dangerous.- ‘Total loss of control’ -Curbs have returned in Europe -- often in the face of protests -- from Greece to Britain, where Covid-19 survivor Prime Minister Boris Johnson was self-isolating after coming into contact with an MP who later tested positive for the virus.Sweden, which has drawn attention for a softer approach to combating the virus, decided to ban gatherings of more than eight people for the first time. Tightened restrictions took effect Tuesday in Austria, with schools and shops shut until December 6.Chancellor Sebastian Kurz drew a sharp backlash for the new measures, which Pamela Rendi-Wagner, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, said reflected a “total loss of control”.“Austria has gone from being a model country to being the bottom of the table in terms of infections,” said Rendi-Wagner, herself a doctor and former health minister.The number of daily infections in the Alpine nation of 8.8 million people grew from 1,000 in early October to 5,984 on Tuesday.Italy meanwhile said Tuesday it had inspected over 230 retirement and nursing homes and identified 37 with violations, shutting down four of them outright.The virus tore through the country’s care homes during the first wave of the pandemic, with many residents dying before they could be hospitalised and without having been tested.Italy, which is currently reporting over 500 deaths a day from the virus, has seen a spike in the number of contagions in such structures since the start of November.In Greece, tensions were high on the anniversary of a 1973 student uprising against a military junta after police banned public gatherings -- including the traditional march recalling the crackdown that killed 24 people, a bloodbath considered to have speeded the restoration of democracy.Some left-wing groups have called on supporters to defy the ban and stage an afternoon demonstration in central Athens, with nearly 6,000 police officers standing by, media reports said.And in Germany, which began a new round of shutdowns earlier in the month, Chancellor Angela Merkel was pushing for tighter measures such as masks in all schools and smaller class sizes.- US reeling -While new cases were plateauing in Germany, officials said daily numbers were still too high.Bucking the trend in Europe, Russia has not imposed a new nationwide lockdown, even as it reported a record high 442 new coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday.Infections in the United States, meanwhile, show no sign of relenting after one million new cases in less than a week pushed the total number to 11,206,054 with 247,229 deaths.The spikes have prompted new curbs in various states, while experts warn families against large gatherings for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.A stay-at-home advisory came into force Monday in the country’s third-biggest city, Chicago; while New York, an earlier outbreak epicentre, was also trying to flatten a second curve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-europe-plan-vaccination-schemes-as-second-virus-wave-builds/story-5CmvIZuUCwlzxGq8tU2leM.html

We are prepared to have cooperation with South Africa and India as well,” Xi said while addressing the 12th BRICS summit via video link.The virtual summit, hosted by Russia President Vladimir Putin, was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.“China has joined the COVAX facility and will actively consider providing vaccines to BRICS countries where there is a need,” Xi said.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said nine candidate vaccines, including two from China, are currently being evaluated for inclusion in the COVAX Facility. The COVAX is co-led by Gavi, an international vaccine alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the (WHO). Its aim is to accelerate the development and manufacture of vaccines.So far the coronavirus has infected more than 54 million people around the world and killed more than 1.3 million people even as governments implemented strict lockdowns and restrictions to slow the spread of the virus that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.“To support the development of BRICS Vaccine R&D centre, China has designated its own national centre. I propose we convene a BRICS symposium on traditional medicine to explore its role in coronavirus prevention and treatment,” Xi said.He also said that China will open the BRICS partnership on a new industrial revolution innovation centre in the Chinese city of Xiamen. “We welcome the active participation of fellow BRICS countries”, he said.Xi said the BRICS countries need to “overcome divisions with unity and pool the maximum global synergy to beat the virus.” In his speech, Xi focussed on the need for the BRICS countries to support multilateralism, globalisation which faced headwinds from growing nationalism in the US and other developed countries and advanced five proposals for the five-member bloc.He said BRICS countries should uphold multilateralism and safeguarding world peace and stability, deepen solidarity and cooperation in jointly coping with the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic, uphold openness and innovation to boost global economic recovery, prioritising people’s livelihood and promoting sustainable development across the world and promote green and low-carbon development and advancing the harmonious co-existence of man and nature.“History teaches us that multilateralism, equity and justice can keep war and conflict at bay. While unilateralism and power politics will inflate dispute and confrontation. We BRICS countries must hold high the banner of multilateralism. We must endeavour to safeguard the UN centred internationals system and international order underpinned by international law,” he said.“It is impossible to reverse the trends of world multi-polarity and economic globalisation,” he said.“The practice of using the pandemic to pursue de-globalisation will end up hurting one’s own interests,” he said.The BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) is known as an influential bloc that represents over 3.6 billion people, or half of the world’s population. The BRICS countries have a combined GDP of USD 16.6 trillion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-offers-to-cooperate-with-india-brics-countries-to-develop-covid-19-vaccine/story-tEfeFMUxfgXD7aYHH3GZPL.html

It dismissed the appeal.The committee upheld the findings of the commissioner that Ahmed breached the code of conduct by failing to act on his personal honour in the discharge of his parliamentary activities, and recommended his expulsion from the House, instead of a lengthy suspension.It said that Ahmed had breached the code “by agreeing to use his position as a member of the House to help a member of the public, but then, sexually assaulting the complainant, lying to the complainant about his intentions to help her with a complaint to the Metropolitan Police regarding exploitation by a faith healer, exploiting the complainant emotionally and sexually despite knowing she was vulnerable.”The committee said it considered the sanction of suspension, but concluded, “The abuse of the privileged position of membership for a member’s own gain or gratification, at the expense of the vulnerable or less privileged, involves a fundamental breach of trust and merits the gravest sanction.”“Even though it is possible to think of even more serious breaches, the case in all its circumstances which we have set out crosses the threshold calling for immediate and definitive expulsion,” the nine-member committee added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-origin-lord-retires-from-uk-house-faced-expulsion/story-HbEFhYr4DA7lJ9yxl2OiyH.html

The sides are allies in a U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition fighting against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels since 2015.At least 47 fighters were killed and around 90 others were wounded in the clashes centered in Zinjibar, the Abyan provincial capital, and the officials described it as the fiercest in the recent months.The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to brief the media.The fighting between Yemen’s internationally recognized government and the separatists’ Southern Transitional Council started in August 2019. Last fall, the two sides signed a power-sharing deal in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, but the agreement was never implemented.The secessionist council, an umbrella group of militias backed by the United Arab Emirates, hopes to restore an independent southern Yemen, which existed from 1967 until unification in 1990.The clashes had reopened a new front inside the larger civil war, complicating international efforts to broker a broader peace agreement to end Yemen’s conflict.The war in the Arab world’s poorest country erupted in 2014, when the Houthis seized the capital and much of the country’s north. A Saudi-led coalition, determined to restore President Abed Rabu Mansour Hadi’s government, launched a military intervention months later.The fighting in Yemen has spawned the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, leaving millions suffering from food and medical shortages. It has killed over 112,000 people, including fighters and civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yemen-clashes-between-government-separatists-kill-about-50/story-N0iJfDdAhGs0o1rwZPVedK.html

However, the recent defeat in US elections has ensured that Trump will be stripped of his privileges soon, leaving him vulnerable to civil and criminal proceedings.Tax fraudManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has been looking into the finances of the Trump Organization and real estate business of Trump’s family for a criminal investigation. Vance, a Democrat, had sought Trump’s tax returns for the investigation. US District Judge Victor Marrero allowed the enforcement of the ‘dragnet’ subpoena, forcing Trump to disclose eight years of business and personal tax returns from his longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA.Trump has been seeking absolute immunity from criminal probe while he remains in the White House. The US President urged the federal court of appeals to block the enforcement of the subpoena, arguing that it amounts to political harassment, but the court disagreed. Trump is now expected to appeal in Supreme Court against Vance’s attempt to obtain his tax returns. The tax returns could provide Vance with ample ammunition to move forward with his investigation into alleged tax and bank fraud.Also Read | Michele Flournoy: All about former US govt official likely to become first woman Pentagon chiefHush-money allegationsIn 2018, Playboy model Karen McDougal and porn actress Stormy Daniels spoke out about their sexual relationships with Trump and alleged that they received payments to remain quiet.

E Jean Carroll, an American journalist and advice columnist, has accused Trump of raping her at a Manhattan department store. Trump is facing a defamation lawsuit for calling her a liar and making “she’s not my type” remark to defend himself. Carroll has sought unspecified damages and demanded a retraction of the statement. In September, US Department of Justice tried to replace Trump with the United States as a defendant in the case, but a federal judge ruled against the intervention, arguing “the allegations have no relationship to the official business of the United States”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-election-2020-legal-battles-trump-may-face-after-losing-presidential-privileges/story-RQb9setuekOAXZaNU9ranO.html
17-11-2020||World||Climate change bigger threat than Covid: Red Cross||The world should react with the same urgency to climate change as to the coronavirus crisis, the Red Cross said Tuesday, warning that global warming poses a greater threat than Covid-19.Even as the pandemic rages, climate change is not taking a break from wreaking havoc, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies (IFRC) said in a new report.In the report, on global catastrophes since the 1960s, the Geneva-based organisation pointed out that the world had been hit by more than 100 disasters -- many of them climate related -- since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic in March. More than 50 million people had been affected, it said.“Of course, the Covid is there, it’s in front of us, it is affecting our families, our friends, our relatives,” IFRC Secretary-General Jagan Chapagain told a virtual press conference.“It’s a very, very serious crisis the world is facing currently,” he said of the pandemic, which has already claimed more than 1.3 million lives. But he warned that the IFRC expects “climate change will have a more significant medium and long term impact on the human life and on Earth.”And while it looked increasingly likely that one or several vaccines would soon become available against Covid-19, Chapagain stressed that “unfortunately there is no vaccine for climate change”.‘No vaccine for climate change’When it comes to global warming, he warned, “it will require a much more sustained action and investment to really protect the human life on this Earth.”The frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate-related events had already increased considerably in recent decades, said the IFRC. In 2019 alone, the world was hit by 308 natural disasters -- 77 percent of them climate or weather-related -- killing some 24,400 people. The number of climate and weather-related disasters has been steadily climbing since the 1960s, and has surged by nearly 35 percent since the 1990s, IFRC said.Read more | Jeff Bezos announces USD 791 million in grants to 16 groups fighting climate change: ReportThis is a deadly development. Weather and climate-related disasters have killed more than 410,000 people over the past decade, most of them in poorer countries, with heatwaves and storms proving the most deadly, the report said. Faced with this threat, which “literally threatens our long-term survival”, IFRC called on the international community to act with the urgency required.Protect most vulnerable communities’ It estimated that around $50 billion would be needed annually over the next decade to help the 50 developing countries to adapt to the changing climate. IFRC stressed that that amount was “dwarfed by the global response to the economic impact of Covid-19,” which has already passed $10 trillion. It also lamented that much of the money invested so far in climate change prevention and mitigation was not going to the developing countries most at risk.“Our first responsibility is to protect communities that are most exposed and vulnerable to climate risks,” Chapagain said, warning though that “our research demonstrates that the world is collectively failing to do this.”“There is a clear disconnection between where the climate risk is greatest and where climate adaptation funding goes,” he said.“This disconnection could very well cost lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-change-bigger-threat-than-covid-red-cross/story-rtkRRhfZ2vgDQk15WPrkoK.html
17-11-2020||World||Measles outbreaks likely in wake of Covid-19 pandemic, say scientists||A major measles outbreaks might occur during 2021 as an unexpected consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic, say scientists in an academic article published in the Lancet journal. According to the researchers, including Australian paediatrician Kim Mulholland, Chair of the World Health Organization’s SAGE Working Group on measles and rubella vaccines, many children across the world have missed out on measles vaccination this year, making future measles outbreaks inevitable.The scientists called for urgent international action to prevent potentially devastating measles epidemics in the coming years. While 2020 had been a quiet year for measles, in part due to travel reductions and national Covid-19 control measures, they said the economic impacts may lead to many cases of childhood malnutrition.The researchers said malnutrition worsens the severity of measles, leading to poorer outcomes and more deaths, especially in low- and middle-income countries. “Children who die from measles are often malnourished, but acute measles pushes many surviving children into malnutrition,” Mulholland said. “Malnutrition, along with measles-associated immune suppression, leads to delayed mortality, while co-existing vitamin A deficiency can also lead to measles-associated blindness,” he added.The scientists believe the coming months may likely see increasing numbers of unimmunised children who are susceptible to measles. “Many live in poor, remote communities where health systems are less resilient, and malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency are already increasing,” they said. According to Mulholland, the Covid-19 pandemic has also had a profound effect on the control of vaccine preventable diseases, with vaccination campaigns paused in the early months of 2020 and routine immunisation services greatly disrupted in many countries. The WHO estimated that by the end of October, 2020, delayed vaccination campaigns in 26 countries have led to 94 million children missing scheduled measles vaccine doses. “All these factors create the environment for severe measles outbreaks in 2021, accompanied by increased death rates and the serious consequences of measles that were common decades ago,” Mulholland said. “Without concerted efforts now, it is likely that the coming years will see an increase in measles and its severe, frequently fatal, complications,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/measles-outbreaks-likely-in-wake-of-covid-19-pandemic-say-scientists/story-d0YyzgUMaj3Vvk6hjbCAqL.html

But despite its singular status, the lonely male doesn’t have a name.The white giraffe now stands alone after a female and her calf were killed by poachers in March, the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy said in a statement Tuesday.A rare genetic trait called leucism causes the white color, and it makes the one surviving giraffe stand out dangerously for poachers in the arid savannah near the Somalia border.Now the GPS tracking device, attached to one of the giraffe’s horns, will ping every hour to alert wildlife rangers to its location.The conservancy has thanked the Kenya Wildlife Service along with the Northern Rangelands Trust and Save Giraffes Now for the help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-s-last-known-white-giraffe-gets-gps-tracking-device/story-ff5i0k2wL8VNc1tF6v0FmL.html

These accusations are frequently used against critics and activists in China.According to the prosecution document, the indictment sheet on Monday claimed that Zhang had sent formal information through text, video and other media through the Internet media such as WeChat, Twitter and Youtube.“She also accepted interviews from overseas media Free Radio Asia and Epoch Times and maliciously speculated on Wuhan’s Covid-19 epidemic,” it said.The Guardian reported that the NGO Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) had stated that Zhang’s reports included ‘the detentions of other independent reporters and harassment of families of victims seeking accountability from the epicentre via her WeChat, Twitter and YouTube accounts’.The CHRD further mentioned that she was also previously detained on similar accusations by Chinese authorities in 2018 and in the following year for voicing support for Hong Kong activists.Zhang is among the several journalists who have been arrested this year after travelling to Wuhan to report on the virus outbreak and response, reported The Guardian.Several journalists have been arrested in China after the national security law was implemented in Hong Kong this year.The draconian law is aimed at crushing dissent in the erstwhile British colony which saw massive pro-democracy protests last year. The legislation, which came into effect on July 1, punishes what Beijing terms secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference with up to life in prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-sentences-up-to-5-years-imprisonment-to-journalist-who-reported-on-covid-19-outbreak/story-b3rDKhQL9dft08JWID2A3L.html

We have been in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and no NATO ally wants to stay any longer than necessary. But at the same time, the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high,” Stoltenberg said in a statement.He said the conflict-ravaged country “risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organize attacks on our homelands. And ISIS (Islamic State) could rebuild in Afghanistan the terror caliphate it lost in Syria and Iraq.”The US decision comes just days after Trump installed a new slate of loyalists in top Pentagon positions who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in the war zones. The expected plans would leave 2,500 troops in Afghanistan after mid-January.US officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawal and that an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders.NATO took charge of the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003, two years after a U.S-led coalition ousted the Taliban for harboring former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. In 2014, it began to train and advise Afghan security forces, but has gradually pulled troops out in line with a US-brokered peace deal.NATO relies heavily on the US armed forces to operate in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-chief-warns-of-high-price-if-troops-leave-afghanistan/story-1WJxTxktosajnG3xmBXRSJ.html
17-11-2020||World||Tokyo talks move to bolster defense ties with Australia amid China’s rise||The leaders of Australia and Japan held in-person talks on Tuesday to bolster defense ties between the two US allies to counter China’s growing assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region amid the transition in American leadership.The two countries are close to concluding a Reciprocal Access Agreement, a legal framework to allow their troops to visit each other’s countries to conduct training and joint operations.During the talks in Tokyo, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his Japanese counterpart, Yoshihide Suga, were expected to further discuss the deal, though it was not immediately clear whether it would be finalized. They were also expected to discuss the coronavirus and the economy, Japanese officials said.If signed, the deal would be Japan’s first such pact since the 1960 status of forces agreement with the United States, which set bases for about 50,000 American troops to operate in and around Japan under the Japan-US security pact.Japan is committed to maintaining and deepening its 60-year-old alliance with the US as the cornerstone of its diplomacy and security, but has in recent years sought to complement its regional defense by stepping up cooperation with others, especially Australia, amid China’s growing maritime activity that has spread from the East and South China seas and beyond.Japan still sticks to self-defense and bans first strikes under its postwar pacifist constitution, but bolstered its defense role and spending under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Abe pushed Japan’s military cooperation and weapons compatibility with the US as its forces increasingly work alongside US troops. He also bolstered purchases of costly American stealth fighters and other arsenals.Suga, who took office in mid-September after Abe resigned due to ill health problems, is carrying on his predecessor’s diplomatic and security policies.Japan considers Australia as a semi-ally and the two countries signed a defense cooperation agreement in 2007, a first for Japan with a country other than the US. The two nations agreed on the sharing of military supplies in 2013, expanding the deal in 2017 to include munitions after Japan eased restrictions on arms equipment transfers.Japan has initiated a “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” vision of economic and security cooperation as a counter to China’s influence, and recently hosted foreign ministerial talks among the countries known as the Quad that also include the US, Australia and India.Those four nations are now seeking to bring in more countries, from Southeast Asia and beyond, that share concerns about China’s increasing assertiveness in the region.China defends its actions in the regional seas as peaceful and denies violating international rules. It has criticized the Quad as a NATO in Asia to counter China.Despite its pacifist constitution, Japan’s defense spending ranks among the world’s top 10, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Australia ranks among the top 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-talks-move-to-bolster-defense-ties-with-australia-amid-china-s-rise/story-XxrWduCxBLWp3qLVOfRfoJ.html
17-11-2020||World||‘Warning to US’: Former PLA colonel claims China’s missiles hit moving target in sea||In the month of August, China fired two of its most capable conventional missiles - a DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) and DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) - into the South China Sea from bases in the mainland.There was no official information so far about the reason or whether they hit any target on the day of the launch on August 26. But now, a former senior colonel of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has claimed that these missiles hit a moving ship target near the Paracel Islands.Wang Xiangsui’s claim was made in the wake of the US military flowing a U-2S Dragon Lady spy plane near a Chinese naval live-fire drill in the Bohai Sea off China’s northeast coast in August. China had declared a no-fly zone in international airspace above the Bohai Sea, meaning its declaration had no legal merit.“So several days later [after the aircraft carrier manoeuvres], we launched the DF-21 and DF-26, and the missiles hit a vessel sailing south of the Paracel Islands,” said Wang, who is now a professor at Beihang University in Beijing.“Shortly after that, an American military attache in Geneva complained and said it would lead to severe consequences if the missiles hit an American aircraft carrier. They see this as a show of force, but we are doing this because of their provocation,” Wang said at a closed-door meeting of the Moganshan Forum in Zhejiang.Though the meeting was held in October, the transcripts of Wang’s comments were made public on Tuesday.Read more | Malabar exercise that upsets China is a tectonic shift in power balance | Analysis“This is a warning to the US, asking it not to take any military risks. Such actions mark the bottom line of Sino-US confrontation,” he had said.The US had said that the flight was “within the accepted international rules and regulations governing aircraft flights”, and that the air force would “continue to fly and operate anywhere international law allows, at the time and tempo of our choosing”.In previous months, the US Navy had sailed two aircraft carrier strike groups (USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan) in the South China Sea “in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific”.Out of the two missiles fired by China on August 26, the DF-26 was launched from Qinghai Province in northwest China (approximately 2,500 km away from the Bohai Sea), and the DF-21D from eastern China in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province (a distance of 1,600 km).Read more | Russia to consider India’s request for speedy delivery of S-400 air defence systemsThe DF-21D “carrier killer” has a range of approximately 1,800 kilometre. The DF-26 IRBM, on the other hand, has a 4,000-km range and it can carry either a nuclear or conventional warhead.The DF-21D and DF-26 are in categories banned under the Russia-US Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which the US withdrew from in 2019. China was never a signatory, and Washington cited China’s possession of such weapon categories as one justification for its INF withdrawal.August 2020 was not the first time China fired ballistic missiles into the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/warning-to-us-former-pla-colonel-claims-china-s-missiles-hit-moving-target-in-sea/story-96AadmRtIQCBITDlSJiEmJ.html

While 20% remained neutral, 73% held either a moderately negative or very negative view of China. Significantly, 79% see China as posing a serious or moderate threat to Canada, far outpacing other traditional foes such as Russia or Iran.Relations between Canada and China remain at a low with two Canadians, including a diplomat, in Chinese jails in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has described as “hostage diplomacy” being practised by Beijing after a senior Huawei executive was arrested in Vancouver in a case related to defrauding a bank to evade sanctions on Iran.“This study confirms yet again how out of sync the government of Canada is with public opinion on China’s emerging threat to Canadian sovereignty and national security,” noted MLI senior fellow Charles Burton in a statement released with the report. “As a consequence, the credibility of Canada’s claim of principled commitment to the international rules-based order rings hollower and hollower as the years go by.”Views of other Asian nations, including that for Taiwan, remain far more positive, though with as many as 51% remaining neutral. As far as India is concerned, 19% are either highly or moderately positive about it, while 34% veer in the other direction, with a large 48% opting for neutrality.“Canadians held a more positive view of most developed democracies. Overall, countries like Australia, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, South Korea and Taiwan are given high net-positive scores by Canadians. However, Taiwan also has high neutral scores, alongside Israel, Ukraine, Latvia and India. This indicates that these countries have opportunities to improve Canadians’ views,” the statement noted.Among democracies, the United States under the Donald Trump administration remains an outlier, with 63% negatively inclined against just 20% positive towards Canada’s neighbour and ally. “Modern American populism is facilitating Canadian anti-American sentiments, despite the fact that this strategic relationship provides the bedrock for Canada’s national security and economy,” noted MLI Munk senior fellow Shuvaloy Majumdar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/only-7-of-canadians-hold-a-positive-view-of-china-says-new-survey/story-Z6GhChwxc39rrrD4K9T9cP.html

That will determine the panel’s recommendations to the CDC on how to prioritize shots.State officials are expected to follow the CDC’s guidance as they distribute the first vaccines.Vaccine supplies will be limited at first. There won’t be enough to protect everyone, yet getting the shots to the right people could change the course of the pandemic.Many other questions about distribution remain unanswered, Sgaier noted, such as whether to distribute shots equally across the country, or to focus on areas that are hot spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-limited-covid-19-vaccine-supplies-who-will-be-the-first-to-get-it/story-HZHkDEFstK5HJSMEP6nz3K.html

These people are also more likely to feel negatively towards local ethnic diversity, the study also showed.After the research findings, Institute founder Ed Kessler called on ministers to create new opportunities for friendships under public policies to improve community relations. As more and more people continue to work from home in the wake of Covid-19, they risk going “back into isolated silos,” Kessler also said.Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases worldwide soared to 54,826,773 as the virus continues to infect thousands of people across the world. While the number of people succumbing to the disease stood at 1,323,093.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-term-work-from-home-may-lead-to-increase-in-racism-study/story-HxFTwZh13P6uujrTjdVFCK.html
17-11-2020||World||Angela Merkel sees German recovery accelerating once coronavirus is tamed||German Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed optimism that a recovery in Europe’s biggest economy will gather pace once the coronavirus pandemic is brought back under control.Merkel said that while the situation remains “very serious,” officials are better equipped now to fight the disease than at the start of the outbreak in the spring. She cited recent progress in developing vaccines as another positive sign.“We must bring the numbers down and keep them at a low level,” Merkel said Tuesday at a Sueddeutsche Zeitung conference. “And if that succeeds -- we saw this in the third quarter of this year -- then the economic recovery will significantly accelerate.”Germany’s economy bounced back strongly after a collapse in activity in the spring, but new curbs introduced after a fresh wave of infections are likely to lead to stagnation at best in the final quarter. That’s despite financial aid for the hardest-hit sectors like hospitality and entertainment.Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, speaking immediately after Merkel, said the government is making some 14 billion euros ($16.6 billion) available this month to ease the blow, up from the original allocation of 10 billion euros.While the latest restrictions are less severe and more focused on hospitality and leisure activities, Germany’s critical export sector is suffering from a resurgence of the virus across Europe, the Bundesbank said Monday. On balance, it expects the hit to the economy to be smaller than after the lockdown in March and April.Merkel on Monday failed to push through a range of tougher contact restrictions, thwarted by resistance from the country’s 16 state premiers. She had proposed requiring face masks for all school students and limiting playmates to one other child.After a five-hour video conference with the regional leaders, she urged citizens to further limit public and private gatherings, while postponing decisions on a road map for the coming months to next week.Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, indicated that the government would make another attempt to tighten curbs when the chancellor holds the next round of talks with state premiers on Nov. 25 -- days before current measures are due to expire.“Restrictions are never easy to decide on and have to be well thought through,” Braun said Tuesday in an interview with ZDF television. “We’re not making a secret of the fact that the chancellor and the government would like to have acted sooner.”The dispute shows the fine line Merkel’s government is treading in trying to slow the pandemic without stoking social, political and economic tensions.Two weeks into a partial shutdown -- which closed bars and restaurants but kept schools and most shops open -- Germany’s contagion rates are still almost three times the level authorities have determined to be manageable.On Monday, incidence over the previous seven days was at 143 per 100,000 citizens, according to the RKI public health institute, and the government has said it must come down to around 50 to allow effective contact tracing.There were 14,580 new infections in the 24 hours through Tuesday morning, taking the total to 817,526, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That compares with more than 2 million cases in France, 1.5 million in Spain and 1.2 million in Italy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-sees-german-recovery-accelerating-once-coronavirus-is-tamed/story-teJU0EiBzyv5rTpf9g5hCJ.html

So we have to reduce contacts, reduce contacts, reduce contacts,” Merkel said.France regaining controlFrance’s health minister Olivier Veran said on Tuesday the country was regaining control over the coronavirus but was not ready to ease the second national lockdown.After curfew measures applied in major French cities in mid-October failed to produce the results the government had hoped for, it enforced a one-month lockdown on Oct. 30, though it was less strict than the one that ran from March 17 to May 11.“If we let up our efforts too early, if we are less compliant with the lockdown, we might be subject to a new epidemic surge that would undo all the hard work done by the French people for several weeks,” Veran told BFM TV.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-updates-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-right-now/story-dojqgQzRuqJviO60nRftdN.html
17-11-2020||World||Henry Kissinger warns Joe Biden of US-China catastrophe on scale of World War I||Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said the incoming Biden administration should move quickly to restore lines of communication with China that frayed during the Trump years or risk a crisis that could escalate into military conflict.“Unless there is some basis for some cooperative action, the world will slide into a catastrophe comparable to World War I,” Kissinger said during the opening session of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. He said military technologies available today would make such a crisis “even more difficult to control” than those of earlier eras.“America and China are now drifting increasingly toward confrontation, and they’re conducting their diplomacy in a confrontational way,” the 97-year-old Kissinger said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. “The danger is that some crisis will occur that will go beyond rhetoric into actual military conflict.”The diplomat who paved the way for President Richard Nixon’s historic 1972 trip to China said he hoped that the shared threat of the Covid-19 pandemic would provide an opening for political discussions between the two countries when Biden takes office on Jan. 20.“If you can look at Covid as a warning, in the sense that in practice it is dealt with by each country largely autonomously, but its long-term solution has to be on some global basis,” Kissinger said, “it should be dealt with as a lesson.”US-China relations are at their lowest in decades, despite the two sides reaching a “phase one” trade deal at the start of the year. Since then, the virus outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, has gone global, killing more than 1.3 million people and crushing economies around the world.As President Donald Trump stepped up his criticism of China, blaming it for the spread of the virus and the death toll in the US, each side also has ramped up moves the other sees as hostile.Last week, China’s crackdown on Hong Kong’s autonomy continued, as officials there disqualified lawmakers viewed as insufficiently loyal to Beijing. US officials have decried the death of the “one country, two systems” policy that has helped Beijing navigate its ties with the West for a generation.The US followed up on its criticism by imposing new sanctions, banning investments in 31 Chinese firms it says are controlled by the country’s People’s Liberation Army.“Trump has a more confrontational method of negotiation than you can apply indefinitely,” Kissinger said. Early in Trump’s term, “it was important for him to emphasize the deep concerns Americans have about the evolution of the world economy that is not balanced. I think that was important to emphasize. But since then, I would have preferred a more differentiated approach.”The swift erosion in ties this year means China and the US are edging toward a new Cold War, Kissinger said, adding that the two sides should “agree that whatever other conflict they have, they will not resort to military conflict.”To achieve that, the US and China should jointly create “an institutional system by which some leader that our president trusts and some Chinese leader that President Xi trusts are designated to remain in contact with each other on behalf of their presidents,” he said.Relations with China may dominate the foreign policy agenda of President-elect Joe Biden’s administration. He’s expected to seek ways to defuse tensions in areas including the future of 5G technology, China’s expansionism in the South China Sea and Hong Kong’s fading autonomy.While Biden has decades of experience in dealing with China, his tone took a harsher turn during the presidential primaries. He frequently criticized China’s assertive policies in its region as well as Beijing’s human rights record, even branding President Xi Jinping a “thug” during a debate in February.“Of course, there are differences on the issue of human rights,” Kissinger said when asked what more China could do to improve relations. “It is important for each side to understand the sensitivities of the other, and not necessarily to solve the problem, but to alleviate it to a point where further progress is possible.”Xi used a speech last week to call for countries to strengthen cooperation and avoid conflict, even as his policies set China on a collision course with the US And China last week congratulated Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on their election victory.“The United States and China have never faced countries of a magnitude that is roughly equal with the other,” Kissinger said. “This is the first experience. And we must avoid its turning into conflict, and hopefully lead to some cooperative endeavors.”Reviewing some of Biden’s proposals for addressing China, Kissinger urged caution when asked about the idea of building a coalition of democracies to take on Beijing.History of Crisis“I think democracies should cooperate wherever their convictions allow it or dictate it,” he added. “I think a coalition aimed at a particular country is unwise, but a coalition to prevent dangers is necessary where the occasion requires.”Ultimately, Kissinger said, the two nations’ leaders need to recognize that they see the same issues very differently, and that colors their approach to talks.“Americans have had a history of relatively uninterrupted success,” he said. “The Chinese have had a very long history of repeated crises. America has had the good fortune of being free of immediate dangers. Chinese have usually been surrounded by countries that have had designs on their unity.”Europe will increasingly find itself caught in a tug-of-war between the US and Eurasia, Kissinger added.“Europe has been an anchor of American foreign policy in the entire post-World War II period,” he said. “The question for them now is whether, in the evolution of relations with other parts of the world, they will attempt to play a totally autonomous role.”The New Economy Forum is being organized by Bloomberg Media Group, a division of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News.

Interim data from a late-stage trial indicated Moderna’s vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19.“We have today secured an initial agreement for 5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine,” Hancock said at a news conference.Britain had previously secured supply deals for a total of 350 million vaccine doses from six different suppliers, including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), whose vaccine was found to be more than 90% effective, and 100 million doses of an AstraZeneca/Oxford (AZN.L) candidate expected to report late-stage results in coming weeks. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the government had prioritised deals with vaccine developers who could provide early supply to Britain and have advanced manufacturing supply chains in place.Asked if he regretted not being able to buy more of the Moderna vaccine, Hancock said Britain expected to have other vaccines sooner.“The Moderna vaccine doesn’t come on stream until the spring,” Hancock said. “I’m just really pleased that we’ve got those early vaccines that will be available early, and we’ve already got the orders of those in.”Britain expects to take delivery of the Pfizer vaccine before the Moderna shot becomes available, as well as AstraZeneca’s candidate if it proves to be effective.Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van Tam said data from late-stage trials of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine had not been reviewed, so it was still unknown if it works.But he added that trial results from both the Pfizer and partner BioNTech (22UAy.F) vaccine and Moderna’s augured well for other candidates that target the coronavirus’ spike protein. “This really does begin to show us that the spike protein is a completely plausible and effective target for vaccines to be working against,” Van Tam said.“We’re feeling in a happier place than we were. But do we know the (Oxford/AstraZeneca) data? No we don’t.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-orders-five-million-doses-of-moderna-vaccine-eyes-spring-arrival/story-Ju7ZlxuSA4hhQQCPcVp4oM.html

17-11-2020||World||Certain elements inside Pak military had links to al-Qaeda: Obama on raid that killed Osama||Barack Obama has said that he had ruled out involving Pakistan in the raid on Osama bin Laden’s hideout because it was an “open secret” that certain elements inside Pakistan’s military, and especially its intelligence services, maintained links to the Taliban and perhaps even al-Qaeda, sometimes using them as strategic assets against Afghanistan and India.Giving a blow-by-blow account of the Abbottabad raid by American commandos that killed the world’s most wanted terrorist on May 2, 2011 in his latest book “A Promised Land”, the former US president said that the top secret operation was opposed by the then defence secretary Robert Gates and his former vice president Joe Biden, who is now the President-elect.In the book that hit the stands globally on Tuesday, America’s first Black president described the various options of killing bin Laden once it became increasingly clear that the elusive al Qaeda chief was living in a safe hideout on the outskirts of a Pakistani military cantonment in Abbottabad.“Based on what I’d heard, I decided we had enough information to begin developing options for an attack on the compound. While the CIA team continued to work on identifying the Pacer, I asked Tom Donilon and John Brennan to explore what a raid would look like,” Obama writes in his memoir.The need for secrecy added to the challenge; if even the slightest hint of our lead on bin Laden leaked, we knew our opportunity would be lost. As a result, only a handful of people across the entire federal government were read into the planning phase of the operation, he said.“We had one other constraint: Whatever option we chose could not involve the Pakistanis,” he wrote.“Although Pakistan’s government cooperated with us on a host of counterterrorism operations and provided a vital supply path for our forces in Afghanistan, it was an open secret that certain elements inside the country’s military, and especially its intelligence services, maintained links to the Taliban and perhaps even al-Qaeda, sometimes using them as strategic assets to ensure that the Afghan government remained weak and unable to align itself with Pakistan’s number one rival, India,” Obama revealed.“The fact that the Abbottabad compound was just a few miles from the Pakistan military’s equivalent of West Point only heightened the possibility that anything we told the Pakistanis could end up tipping off our target. “Whatever we chose to do in Abbottabad, then, would involve violating the territory of a putative ally in the most egregious way possible, short of war— raising both the diplomatic stakes and the operational complexities,” he wrote.In the final stages they were discussing two options. The first was to demolish it with an air strike. The second option was to authorise a special ops mission, in which a select team would covertly fly into Pakistan via helicopter, raid the compound, and get out before the Pakistani police or military had time to react. Despite all the risks involved, Obama and his national security team opted for the second option, but not before multiple rounds of discussions and intensive planning.The day before he gave the final approval for the raid, at a Situation Room meeting, Hillary Clinton, the then Secretary of State, said that it was a 51-49 call. “Gates recommended against a raid, although he was open to considering the strike option,” he said.“Joe (Biden) also weighed in against the raid, arguing that given the enormous consequences of failure, I should defer any decision until the intelligence community was more certain that bin Laden was in the compound. “As had been true in every major decision I’d made as president, I appreciated Joe’s willingness to buck the prevailing mood and ask tough questions, often in the interest of giving me the space I needed for my own internal deliberations,” Obama wrote.After the successful Abbottabad raid, Obama made a number of calls domestically and internationally, the toughest of which he expected to be that with the then Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, he wrote.“I expected my most difficult call to be with Pakistan’s beleaguered president, Asif Ali Zardari, who would surely face a backlash at home over our violation of Pakistani sovereignty. When I reached him, however, he expressed congratulations and support. ‘Whatever the fallout,’ he said, ‘it’s very good news.” He showed genuine emotion, recalling how his wife, Benazir Bhutto, had been killed by extremists with reported ties to al-Qaeda,” Obama wrote.“Mike Mullen had put a call in to Pakistan’s army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and while the conversation had been polite, Kayani had requested that we come clean on the raid and its target as quickly as possible in order to help his people manage the reaction of the Pakistani public,” he said. Laden, the world’s most wanted terrorist, was the chief of al-Qaeda that carried out the 9/11 attacks on twin towers in New York, killing nearly 3,000 people. He was killed in a covert raid by a US Navy SEAL team at his Abbottabad compound in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/certain-elements-inside-pak-military-had-links-to-al-qaeda-obama-on-raid-that-killed-osama/story-tqCmflEPqSqXiId3eSbbHK.html

17-11-2020||World||24 hours in the ICU: Fighting for an open bed in Covid-19 hit French town||Four more calls to go, each with careful words, painful silences.It’s 2 p.m. in the intensive care ward of Marseille’s La Timone hospital, and Dr. Julien Carvelli is phoning families hit by the second wave of the coronavirus with news about their children, husbands, wives. With intensive care wards at over 95% capacity in France for over 10 days, Carvelli makes at least eight of these difficult calls a day.In Marseille, this wave is bringing even more people to the ICU than the first one in the spring, many in more severe condition. Carvelli warns one father that his son may need to be put into a coma.“For the moment, he’s holding on. But it’s true that — I don’t know what you’ve been told already — his respiratory state is worrying,” Carvelli acknowledges. There’s a long pause on the other end.Also Read: What a surge in coronavirus cases in California means“Listen, do your best,” comes the strained reply at last.France is two weeks into its second coronavirus lockdown, known as “le confinement.” Associated Press journalists spent 24 hours with the intensive care team at La Timone, southern France’s largest hospital, as they struggled to keep even one bed open for the influx of patients to come.The doctors and nurses tell themselves and each other that they just have to hold on a little longer. Government tallies show infections may have reached their second-wave high point, and hospitalizations dropped last weekend for the first time since September.But the medical workers are also frustrated that France did not prepare more in the months after the first wave. And while doctors and nurses were seen as heroes back then, this time is different.“Before, they applauded every night. Now they tell us it’s just doing our job,” says Chloe Gascon, a 23-year-old nurse who has spent half her 18-month career under the shadow of coronavirus. Her voice carries more than a trace of bitterness.Marseille has been submerged with coronavirus cases since September. The port city, on France’s Mediterranean coast, was spared the worst of the virus last spring only to be hit with a vengeance as the summer vacation wound down. Bars and restaurants closed across the city on Sept. 27, more than a month before they shut down nationwide. It wasn’t enough.A decade of budget cuts left France with half the number of intensive care beds this year, when it needed them most. By the time the first confinement ended on May 11, more than 26,000 people had died in France. The government pledged to take advantage of the expected summer lull to add beds and train reinforcements.That was the time to act, when new infections were at their low point, said Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds.Also Read: Coronavirus curbs return across United States“It was always bubbling away under the surface,” he said.But it was only in early fall that work started on refashioning an acute care wing at La Timone, which opened less than two weeks ago and still has exposed wiring and a fiberboard barricade with duct tape. The promised reinforcements have been slow in coming as well, and any training they get is in the moment, as Pauline Reynier is learning during her first week as an ICU nurse.Compared to the emergency room, the ICU is a relatively calm place, with moments of urgency when a patient needs more oxygen or an intervention. The quiet is punctuated by the constant soundtrack of machines beeping. There is no good news here; the best news is that a patient is stable enough to be moved elsewhere.When the 12-hour nursing shift starts at 7 a.m., all 16 beds are filled with COVID-19 patients, and five are conscious. For those in artificial comas, it takes about an hour and at least two people to wash and then carefully rotate each one in their beds, keeping the wires and plastic tubing in place.This is Reynier’s first task.She helped in a regular coronavirus ward during the first wave and offered to retrain over the summer for intensive care. Instead, the 26-year-old was sent back to cardiology, which was filling with patients who had postponed heart surgeries. It was just a week into the second lockdown that the call came to report to the ICU on November 11, a lightly staffed national holiday.It is only Reynier’s second shift as an ICU reinforcement. Her new colleagues barely know her name and have little time to teach. The daughter of a nurse who also works at La Timone, she largely learns by watching.It takes months to train as an intensive care nurse, years to become experienced in the gruelling specialty of holding death at bay.This virus is even more demanding than the usual urgent challenges. Caregivers risk nearly as much as the patient, and dress accordingly, each time they enter a room. And so going to the bedside means planning multiple tasks at once: washing, toothbrushing, checking vitals, changing IV drips and, finally, turning the patient over to help improve breathing.Reynier pulls on a long-sleeved apron over the scrubs with a quick twist of the wrist to knot the neck. Then a pair of gloves. Punch a thumbhole through the bottom of the sleeve to secure the gloves, then pull on a second pair of gloves. Head covering, goggles and, finally, a second apron in plastic. X-ray technicians wear a third set of gloves to handle the plates. Doctors performing an intubation or other major procedure wear a plastic face shield over the goggles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/24-hours-in-the-icu-fighting-for-an-open-bed-in-covid-19-hit-french-town/story-jbf3tsjdpLnVU7lXg77CoO.html
17-11-2020||World||What a surge in coronavirus cases in California means||California has become the second US state after Texas to have a million known cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), while the US has surpassed 10 million infections, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. California recorded 10,968 fresh cases on Monday which takes the total cases to 1,019,345 since the pandemic began.There have been 18,253 Covid-19 deaths reported in the state. The seven-day positivity rate is now 4.8% and the 14-day positivity rate is 4.4%.As California is the United State’s most populous state - with 40 million residents - the surge in the cases has been very worrying. Eleven counties in California had to reimpose limits this week.What do the experts say?ABC news reported that the virus has struck poor Californians and Latinos especially hard as Latinos make up 39 per cent of the population but account for more than 60 per cent of infections. NYT reported that the expected mortality rate is lower and has dropped by nearly a third since April due to advances in therapeutic treatments.How has California managed the pandemic so far?California had some of the earliest known cases in America in February among travellers from China, where the outbreak began. The February 6 death of a San Jose woman is the first known coronavirus fatality in the US. In February, California recorded the first US case not related to travel and the infection spread within the community. On March 19, Governor Gavin Newsom issued the nation’s first state-wide stay-at-home order, shutting businesses and schools to try to prevent hospitals from overcrowding. The spread slowed, but California faced the same challenges as other states: providing enough protective gear for health workers, doing enough testing and providing timely results, tracking infections and those potentially exposed.Read more | Moderna Covid-19 vaccine progress lifts stock marketsAs the state tried to balance public health and the economy, cases rose as it relaxed business restrictions.What about the other states in the US?West Virginia, Kentucky and Maryland have been reporting record rises in the coronavirus cases for the past one week.

The release of the bunch of documents that Islamabad has described as a dossier came after its repeated attempts to implicate Indians for terrorism did not succeed. The last one was in September when the United Nations Security Council rejected a proposal by Imran Khan, backed by President Xi Jinping’s China, to designate two Indians as terrorists under the 1267 sanctions committee process. A few months earlier, the UNSC had already blocked proposals to designate four other Indians.It is in this context that Moeed W Yusuf, Imran Khan’s special assistant on National Security Division and Strategic Policy Planning, switched gears and started building the ground for a public campaign in October when he accused India of perpetrating terrorism in Pakistan. An academic believed to have had links with the Pakistan Army when he was still in the United States, Moeed Yusuf has been big on building narratives after joining the government. Yusuf did complain not so long ago how Pakistan had not been able to set the narrative on Kashmir, a remark that was then seen as an indictment of the foreign office led by Shah Mahmood Qureshi. Last month, he told a news conference that the media should play a role to change the country’s narrative. “Pakistan’s narrative is of economic security and the world has not seen that,” he lamented, claiming Islamabad stood for regional peace. At the same briefing, Yusuf complained about India’s “one-sided narrative” against Pakistan and hinted that Islamabad would launch a counter-narrative.The ‘dossier’ unveiled at a Press conference by foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and he military spokesperson Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar in Islamabad was Moeed Yusuf’s first step to make an attempt to change the narrative.By all indications, a Pakistan watcher in New Delhi said, the “dummy dossier”, which regurgitated old allegations, was a rush job. It had got spellings of Indian intelligence chiefs accused of fomenting trouble in Pakistan wrong. Some basics too.“The entire dossier is full of such howlers,” he said. “From the estimates of economic costs of terrorism ($126 billion) to reports of terror training camps in India and Afghanistan, from allegations of a special cell to sabotage China Pakistan Economic Corridor to Indian embassies (high commission) and consulates along Pakistan’s border serving as operations centre, the dossier is full of half-baked, fatuous, and asinine assertions which the Imran Khan government believes constitute ‘irrefutable evidence’,” he said.It also repeats Moeed Yusuf’s recent charge that attempts to link India to the 2014 terrorist assault on an army school in Peshawar, an attack for which the Taliban had claimed responsibility. The Pakistan army had then claimed to have arrested the main executors of the dastardly attack that killed 141 people including 131 children. In August 2015, then Pakistan Army chief Raheel Sharif had confirmed the death sentence given by military courts to seven members of Tehrik-e-Taliban and Tawhid-wal-Jihad group for supporting and collecting funds for the school attack.To be sure, this isn’t Pakistan’s first effort to tarnish India’s reputation and acquiring some sort of parity with New Delhi by levelling charges of sponsoring terrorism. Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations in 2017, did make the effort when she called India the mother of terrorism in south India and accused New Delhi of “indulging in an orgy of slander against Pakistan”. But that campaign sank without a trace. Indian counter-terror officials said there were four possible explanations why the Imran Khan government decided to amp up its pitch against India at this time.A counter-terror official said the attempt to put the spotlight on India comes at a time Imran Khan is under tremendous pressure from a resurgent opposition, and economic distress, continuing drift in governance and an economy drowning in debt. Desperate to get the opposition to call off their anti-regime programme, the government has resorted to the time-tested India bogey. Moeed Yusuf did tacitly admit that the government wants the opposition to understand the sensitivity of the matter and not politicise things to a point that India can take advantage.Secondly, officials said, this was a ploy to divert attention from the rigging that was planned in the Pakistan-occupied Gilgit Baltistan. The India threat could help both shift focus as well as be used as a bogey to contain any fallout of the rigging. Pakistan Peoples Party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has already accused Imran Khan’s party of carrying out “open and naked rigging” in Gilgit-Baltistan’s elections.Thirdly, the dossier coincides with the election of the Joe Biden administration in the United States. An official said Pakistan timed the dossier to persuade the in-coming administration that it needs to play a more even-handed role in the region and force India to desist from taking any aggressive action against Pakistani adventurism and export of terrorism.Fourthly, it would help target and tarnish opposition leaders such as Nawaz Sharif who have been accused of being soft on India and wanting to normalise relations with India.The dossier is aimed as much at the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’ constituency back home as the international community, a national security planner in New Delhi said. It is a gamble but could backfire on Imran Khan if the campaign collapses like the last one. Because then he will have to explain why he couldn’t sell its narrative to the people and the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-dossier-on-india-is-a-gamble-it-could-backfire-on-imran-khan-analysis/story-bxFNR488ZtmqiRTPK5GWUN.html

The Dragon capsule pulled up and docked late Monday night, following a 27-hour, completely automated flight from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. The linkup occurred 262 miles (422 kilometers) above Idaho.“Oh, what a good voice to hear,” space station astronaut Kate Rubins called out when the Dragon’s commander, Mike Hopkins, first made radio contact.“We can’t wait to have you on board,” she added after the two spacecraft were latched together.This is the second astronaut mission for SpaceX. But it’s the first time Elon Musk’s company delivered a crew for a full half-year station stay. The two-pilot test flight earlier this year lasted two months. The three Americans and one Japanese astronaut will remain at the orbiting lab until their replacements arrive on another Dragon in April. And so it will go, with SpaceX — and eventually Boeing — transporting astronauts to and from the station for NASA.This regular taxi service got underway with Sunday night’s launch.Read more | SpaceX launches 4 astronauts to space, kicking off regular crew flights from the USHopkins and his crew — Victor Glover, Shannon Walker and Japan’s Soichi Noguchi — join two Russians and one American who flew to the space station last month from Kazakhstan.

A space newcomer, Glover was presented his gold astronaut pin Monday.The four named their capsule Resilience to provide hope and inspiration during an especially difficult year for the whole world. They broadcast a tour of their capsule Monday, showing off the touchscreen controls, storage areas and their zero gravity indicator: a small plush Baby Yoda.Walker said it was a little tighter for them than for the two astronauts on the test flight.“We sort of dance around each other to stay out of each other’s way,” she said.For Sunday’s launch, NASA kept guests to a minimum because of coronavirus, and even Musk had to stay away after tweeting that he “most likely” had an infection. He was replaced in his official launch duties by SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell, who assured reporters he was still very much involved with Sunday night’s action, although remotely. As they prepared for the space station linkup, the Dragon crew beamed down live window views of New Zealand and a brilliant blue, cloud-streaked Pacific 250 miles below.“Looks amazing,” Mission Control radioed from SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California.“It looks amazing from up here, too,” Hopkins replied.Watch: SpaceX, NASA launches first operational astronaut mission to space||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-capsule-with-4-astronauts-reaches-space-station/story-lsFxpHDF3kHn2SGnQdk2xL.html
17-11-2020||World||‘My fascination with India largely revolved around Mahatma Gandhi’: Barack Obama in his book||Former US President Barack Obama has said that his fascination with India largely revolved around Mahatma Gandhi, whose “successful non-violent campaign against the British rule became a beacon for other dispossessed, marginalised groups”. However, the 44th US president, in his latest book, rues that the Indian icon was unable to successfully address the caste system or prevent the partition of the country based on religion. In his book “A Promised Land”, Obama writes on his journey from the 2008 election campaign to the end of his first term with the daring Abbottabad (Pakistan) raid that killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. “A Promised Land” is the first of two planned volumes. The first part hit bookstores globally on Tuesday. “More than anything, though, my fascination with India had to do with Mahatma Gandhi. Along with (Abraham) Lincoln, (Martin Luther) King, and (Nelson) Mandela, Gandhi had profoundly influenced my thinking,” writes Obama, who had visited India twice as president. “As a young man, I’d studied his writings and found him giving voice to some of my deepest instincts,” the former US president said. “His notion of ‘satyagraha’, or devotion to truth, and the power of non-violent resistance to stir the conscience; his insistence on our common humanity and the essential oneness of all religions; and his belief in every society’s obligation, through its political, economic, and social arrangements, to recognise the equal worth and dignity of all people -- each of these ideas resonated with me. Gandhi’s actions had stirred me even more than his words; he’d put his beliefs to the test by risking his life, going to prison, and throwing himself fully into the struggles of his people,” Obama writes. Gandhi’s non-violent campaign for Indian independence from Britain, which began in 1915 and continued for more than 30 years, hadn’t just helped overcome an empire and liberate much of the subcontinent, it had set off a moral charge that pulsed around the globe, he writes. “It became a beacon for other dispossessed, marginalised groups — including Black Americans in the Jim Crow South — intent on securing their freedom,” says Obama. Recollecting his first visit to India in November 2010, Obama said he and then First Lady, Michelle, had visited Mani Bhavan, the modest two-story building tucked into a quiet Mumbai neighbourhood that had been Gandhi’s home for many years. “Before the start of our tour, our guide, a gracious woman in a blue sari, showed us the guestbook Dr King had signed in 1959, when he’d travelled to India to draw international attention to the struggle for racial justice in the United States and pay homage to the man whose teachings had inspired him,” he writes. “The guide then invited us upstairs to see Gandhi’s private quarters. Taking off our shoes, we entered a simple room with a floor of smooth, patterned tile, its terrace doors open to admit a slight breeze and a pale, hazy light,” he said. “I stared at the spartan floor bed and pillow, the collection of spinning wheels, the old-fashioned phone and low wooden writing desk, trying to imagine Gandhi present in the room, a slight, brown-skinned man in a plain cotton dhoti, his legs folded under him, composing a letter to the British viceroy or charting the next phase of the Salt March,” he said. “And in that moment, I had the strongest wish to sit beside him and talk. To ask him where he’d found the strength and imagination to do so much with so very little. To ask how he’d recovered from disappointment,” he wrote. Obama said Gandhi had had more than his share of struggle. “For all his extraordinary gifts, Gandhi hadn’t been able to heal the subcontinent’s deep religious schisms or prevent its partitioning into a predominantly Hindu India and an overwhelmingly Muslim Pakistan, a seismic event in which untold numbers died in sectarian violence and millions of families were forced to pack up what they could carry and migrate across newly established borders,” he said. “Despite his labours, he hadn’t undone India’s stifling caste system. Somehow, though, he’d marched, fasted, and preached well into his seventies — until that final day in 1948, when on his way to prayer, he was shot at point-blank range by a young Hindu extremist who viewed his ecumenism as a betrayal of the faith,” Obama writes.

Pfizer’s vaccine, which was shown to be more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19 based on initial data, must be shipped and stored at -70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46°F).“We are hopeful that results from this vaccine delivery pilot will serve as the model for other U.S. states and international governments, as they prepare to implement effective Covid-19 vaccine programs,” Pfizer said in a statement on Monday.It picked Rhode Island, Texas, New Mexico, and Tennessee for the program after taking into account their differences in overall size, diversity of populations, immunization infrastructure, and need to reach individuals in varied urban and rural settings. The four states will not receive vaccine doses earlier than other states by virtue of the pilot, nor will they receive any differential consideration, Pfizer said.Read more | Covid-19 vaccine update: Bharat Biotech begins phase 3 trials, Moderna says its candidate nearly 95% effectiveThe company expects to have enough safety data on the vaccine from the ongoing large scale late-stage trials by the third week of November before proceeding to apply for emergency use authorization (EUA). Pfizer and its partner BioNTech have a $1.95 billion deal to supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to the US government, which has an option to acquire up to an additional 500 million doses.Earlier on Monday, rival Moderna Inc said its experimental vaccine was 94.5% effective in preventing Covid-19 based on interim data from a late-stage trial, boosting hopes that vaccines against the disease may be ready for use soon.

The summit will bring together PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping for the second time in seven days, amid the ongoing Indo-China standoff in Ladakh, after last week’s Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.Also Read | BRICS Summit: Narendra Modi, Xi Jinping to share platform againThe 12th BRICS summit is being held on the theme of “Global stability, shared security and innovative growth.”Here’s all you need to know about the 5-member bloc ‘BRICS’1.The acronym ’BRICS’ stands for the five member states of the bloc: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Initially, the group was only called ‘BRIC’ as South Africa was not among its original members and only joined in December 2010 at China’s invitation. The name of the group was hence modified to ‘BRICS.’2. Goldman Sachs’ Jim O’Neill is credited with coining the term ‘BRIC’ in his 2001 publication titled ‘Building Better Global Economic BRICs.’ Neill coined this term to indicate the emerging powers he believed would be, along with the United States, the world’s five largest economies in the 21st century.3. In 2006, the foreign ministers of the original four member states met in New York City on the sidelines of the General Debate of the United Nations Assembly. Subsequently, in 2009, Russia’s Yekaterinburg hosted a full-scale diplomatic meeting of the group.4. The Russian city also hosted the first formal BRIC summit on 16 June 2009. Lula da Silva (then-Brazilian President), Dmitry Medvedev (then-Russian President), Manmohan Singh (then-Indian Prime Minister) and Hu Jintao (then-Chinese President) were the participants of the first BRIC summit.5. A total of 10 BRICS summits have taken place since then. These were held in Brazil (2010), China (2011), India (2012), South Africa (2013), Brazil (2014), Russia (2015), India (2016), China (2017), South Africa (2018) and Brazil (2019).6. South Africa’s first summit as a full member was in 2011 in China’s Sanya. The current summit is the first BRICS summit that will take place virtually though Russia retains its status of the host nation. India, meanwhile, is scheduled to host its third BRICS summit, the group’s 13th, in 2021. 7. Of the five member states, four are among the world’s 10 most populous countries: China (1), India (2), Brazil (6) and Russia (9). South Africa, meanwhile, is the 24th most populous nation in the world.8. In terms of area, once again, four are among top 10: Russia (1), China (3), Brazil (5) and India (7). Here, too, South Africa comes at 24.9. BRICS has a total of five official languages: Portuguese (Brazil), Russian (Russia), Hindi (India), Mandarin (China) and English (South Africa). The group is headquartered at Shanghai, China.10. The group also comprises two financial institutions: the New Development Bank (NDB; also called BRICS Development Bank) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA). Both were created at the 6th summit in 2014, held in Brazil’s Fortaleza, and became active in 2015.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-to-attend-brics-summit-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-5-nation-bloc/story-JsPlRlukEsuftQDCboGFYP.html
17-11-2020||World||Moderna vaccine results ‘stunningly impressive,’ says Anthony Fauci||The United States’ top infectious disease scientist on Monday hailed early results from Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine trial as “stunningly impressive,” calling the findings an emphatic validation of experimental mRNA technology that some had doubted.“I must admit that I would have been satisfied with 70 or at the most 75 percent efficacy,” he told AFP.“The idea that we have a 94.5 percent effective vaccine is stunningly impressive. It is really a spectacular result that I don’t think anybody had anticipated would be this good.”Also Read: Covid-19: Pfizer, Moderna to supply 50 million, 20 million of vaccine dosesFauci leads the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which began co-developing the vaccine with the US biotech company in January, shortly after China shared the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus.The vaccine is based on a relatively new technology that uses a synthetic version of a molecule called “messenger RNA” to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.No vaccine based on this platform has ever been approved.“There were many people who had reservations about using something that had not been tried and true over the years; in fact, some people even criticized us for that,” said Fauci.On Monday, Moderna and NIAID announced their preliminary results based on 95 of the 30,000 volunteers they had recruited who fell ill with Covid-19.Of the 95, 90 had been in the trial’s placebo group, and five in the group that received the drug, called mRNA-1273, translating to an efficacy rate of 94.5 percent.Fauci recalled that some had questioned whether the vaccine would prevent severe forms of Covid-19, not just mild or moderate cases -- and this too had been resoundingly answered.“There were 11 severe events, none in the vaccine group -- 11 in the placebo group, so that settles the question of whether it prevents severe disease, which it definitely does.”‘The data speak for themselves’ It follows a similarly impressive result from American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech last week, which reported an efficacy of 90 percent for their vaccine.Asked whether it was too early to say if mRNA technology had now been proven, Fauci -- who is usually known for his cautious statements -- said the jury was definitely in.“I think when you have two vaccines like this, that have proven to be greater than 90 percent effective, I think that mRNA is here, it’s established itself, it doesn’t need to prove anything anymore.“The data speak for themselves; it isn’t me, it isn’t my opinion -- look at the data,” he said.Also Read: Covid-19: India records more daily recoveries than new cases for 6 successive weeksTraditional virus vaccines use actual viruses that have to be grown in chicken eggs or fetal cell lines and then weakened so they don’t harm people -- a process that can take many months. By contrast, the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines deliver the genetic information needed to create a protein that lies on the surface of the virus -- called the spike protein -- directly to cells in the human body, which then grow it.This primes the immune system to make antibodies to the actual virus, and has the major advantage of shortening vaccine development time to a matter of weeks, once scientists have the genetic sequence of the protein they want to create.While Moderna has basked in the spotlight, Fauci was keen to highlight the work of NIAID, which he said was responsible for developing a precise way to orient the spike protein molecule such that it elicited the strongest immune response.But there are still some unanswered questions, including how long the immunity lasts. Fauci said he was “certain” it would endure to some extent, as immune system cells called “memory B cells” remained on standby to generate new antibodies to the virus.But for how long was unclear. “We don’t know whether it’s going to be a year, two years, three years, five years, we don’t know,” he said.Looking forward, Fauci said he was worried about anti-vaccine sentiment in the United States, the country that has been the worst-hit by the pandemic. “You’ve got to overcome that and convince people to get vaccinated, because a vaccine with a high degree of efficacy is of no use if nobody gets vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-vaccine-results-stunningly-impressive-says-anthony-fauci/story-Lzd1JoP9QY5dD0fmQhhsSL.html
17-11-2020||World||Hurricane Iota makes landfall on Nicaragua coast||Powerful Hurricane Iota made landfall on Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast late Monday, threatening catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by equally strong Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago. Iota had intensified into an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm early in the day, but the US National Hurricane Center said it weakened slightly to Category 4, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kph). Its center made landfall about 30 miles (45 kilometers) south of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi.Iota already had been hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds. Iota came ashore just 15 miles (25 kilometers) south of where Hurricane Eta made landfall Nov. 3, also as a Category 4 storm. Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil in the region, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.In Bilwi, business owner Adán Artola Schultz braced himself in the doorway of his house as strong gusts of wind and rain drover water in torrents down the street. He watched in amazement as wind ripped away the metal roof structure from a substantial two-story home and blew it away like paper.“It is like bullets,” he said of the sound of metal structures banging and buckling in the wind. “This is double destruction,” he said, referring to the damages wrought by Eta just 12 days earlier.“This is coming in with fury,” said Artola Schultz.Storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt in Bilwi’s seaside El Muelle neighborhood.“The situation doesn’t look good at all,” Wriedt said earlier in the day. “We woke up without electricity, with rain and the surf is getting really high.”Read more | Trump aide promises ‘very professional transition’ to BidenWriedt, who works for a small-scale fishing organization called Piquinera, said the roof of her house was blown off in Eta less than two weeks ago.“We repaired it as best we could. Now I think the wind will take it again because they say (Iota) is even stronger,” she said, the sound of hammering echoing around her as neighbors boarded windows and reinforced roofs.During Eta, the surf came up to just behind her house, where she lives with eight other members of her family. “Today I’m afraid again about losing my house and I’m frightened for all of us who live in this neighborhood,” she said. Wriedt said some neighbors went to stay with relatives elsewhere, but most have stayed. “We’re almost all here,” she said. “Neither the army nor the government came to move us.”Cairo Jarquin, Nicaragua emergency response project manager for Catholic Relief Services, had just visited Bilwi and smaller coastal communities Friday. In Wawa Bar, Jarquin said he found “total destruction” from Eta. People had been working furiously to put roofs back over their families’ heads, but now Iota threatened to take what was left. “The little that remained standing could be razed,” Jarquin said. There were other communities farther inland that he was not even able to reach due to the condition of roads. He said he heard that Wawa bar was evacuated again Saturday.Read more | Wealthy, corporations will ‘pay their fair share’: BidenEvacuations were conducted from low-lying areas in Nicaragua and Honduras near their shared border through the weekend. Nicaraguan Vice President Rosario Murillo, who is also the first lady, said that the government had done everything necessary to protect lives, including the evacuation of thousands. She added that Taiwan had donated 800 tons of rice to help those affected by the storms. Limborth Bucardo, of the Miskito Indigenous ethnic group, said many people had moved to churches in Bilwi. He rode out Eta with his wife and two children at home, but this time decided to move in with relatives in a safer neighborhood.“We hadn’t finished repairing our houses and settling in when another hurricane comes,” Bucardo said. “The shelters in Bilwi are already full, packed with people from (surrounding) communities.”Iota is the record 30th named storm of this year’s extraordinarily busy Atlantic hurricane season. It’s also the ninth storm to rapidly intensify this season, a dangerous phenomenon that is happening increasingly more often. Such activity has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms. Iota is stronger, based on central pressure, than 2005′s Hurricane Katrina and is the first storm with a Greek alphabet name to hit Category 5, Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said. It also sets the record for the latest Category 5 hurricane on record, beating the record set by the Nov. 8, 1932, Cuba Hurricane. Eta had hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, killing more than 130 people as torrential rains caused flash floods and mudslides in parts of Central America and Mexico. Then it meandered across Cuba, the Florida Keys and around the Gulf of Mexico before slogging ashore again near Cedar Key, Florida, and dashing across Florida and the Carolinas.Iota was forecast to drop 10 to 20 inches (250-500 millimeters) of rain in northern Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and southern Belize, with as much as 30 inches (750 millimeters) in isolated spots. Costa Rica and Panama could also experience heavy rain and possible flooding, the hurricane center said.The prospect of more rain was raising the anxiety of those still homeless after Eta.On Monday, Carmen Isabel Rodríguez Ortez was still living inside a government shelter with more than 250 people in La Lima, Honduras, just outside San Pedro Sula. Devastated by Eta’s destruction, she quickly broke into sobs as she contemplated the torrential rains of another storm.“We’re living a real nightmare,” Rodríguez said. The Chamelecon river flooded her Reformada neighborhood as Eta passed, submerging their homes. “Now they announce more rain and we don’t know what’s going to happen, because our homes are completely flooded.”Eta was this year’s 28th named storm, tying the 2005 record. Over the past couple of decades, meteorologists have been more worried about storms like Iota that power up much faster than normal. They created an official threshold for this rapid intensification — a storm gaining 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in just 24 hours. Iota doubled it. Earlier this year, Hannah, Laura, Sally, Teddy, Gamma, Delta, Zeta and Iota all rapidly intensified. Laura and Delta tied or set records for rapid intensification.The official end of the hurricane season is Nov. 30.Watch: Trump claims credit after Moderna claims its vaccine is 94.5% effective||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-iota-makes-landfall-on-nicaragua-coast/story-r3nO0DvIR9guUnY4VR5AqK.html

After Pfizer, US biotech company Moderna said on Monday that its candidate for Covid-19 vaccine is nearly 95% effective in preventing the viral disease and as per the company current projections, it will produce 20 million of Covid-19 vaccines doses by the end of this year. Pfizer, meanwhile, is expecting to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020.As both of the vaccines are two-dose regimen, the companies claim they will be able to vaccinate 25 million and 10 million people around the world, respectively.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBy the next year, Pfizer will expand their production and increase to producing 1.3 billion units. Moderna is planning to increase production between 500 million and one billion.The news could be a start for the future win against the Covid-19, however, the supply will be restricted to countries that already have deal with the manufacturers. Among them is the United States which has a deal with both Pfizer and Moderna for Covid-19 vaccine supply.Also Read | 43% of children have antibodies for Covid-19: StudyThe Indian government is in dialogue with both domestic and international vaccine manufacturers for purchase of Covid-19. “Not only with Moderna, the government is also in communication with Pfizer, Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila for their Covid-19 vaccine candidate in terms of safety, immunogenicity and efficacy,” news agency PTI reported quoting a senior government official.Europe also has a deal with Pfizer and Moderna for 200 million doses.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pfizer-moderna-to-supply-50-million-20-million-of-vaccine-doses/story-xMgvc7ue8C0N2X3DxlMClM.html
17-11-2020||World||Moderna says its Covid-19 vaccine stable at refrigerator temperatures for 30 days||Moderna Inc. said its Covid-19 vaccine was 94.5% effective in a preliminary analysis of a large late-stage clinical trial, another sign that a fast-paced hunt by scientists and pharmaceutical companies is paying off with potent new tools that could help control a worsening pandemic.The highly positive readout comes just a week after a similar shot developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE was found to be more than 90% effective in an interim analysis. Both shots rely on a technology called messenger RNA that has never been used to build an approved vaccine. Soon, millions of people around the world could be spared from illness by the breakthroughs.Also Read: Bharat Biotech begins phase 3 trials, Moderna says its candidate nearly 95% effectiveA first analysis of data from more than 30,000 volunteers showed Moderna’s vaccine prevented virtually all symptomatic cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, the company said in a statement on Monday.Moderna shares rose as much as 15% in New York. The rally in global shares following the news represented about $567 billion in market value added to the MSCI All Country World Index.Only five participants who received two doses of the vaccine became sick, compared with 90 coronavirus cases in participants who received a placebo, according to a review by an independent data safety monitoring board appointed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.The vaccine also appeared to be effective in preventing the most serious Covid-19 infections. There were no severe cases among people who got the vaccine, compared with 11 in volunteers who received placebo shots, according to Moderna’s statement.“The thing that got me the most excited today was the severe disease,” Moderna Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel said in an interview. “That for me is a game-changer.”The results arrive at a moment when the pandemic’s grip is tightening. The U.S. surpassed 11 million coronavirus cases Sunday as Florida reported the most new infections since July and new cases in California hit a three-month high. Deaths and hospitalizations are also rising. Europe has also seen cases soar as much of the world braces for what is expected to be a dire winter.While the results are preliminary, both Moderna and Pfizer are expected to seek emergency-use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration if further study shows their vaccines are safe. In its statement, Moderna said it could seek a go-ahead from regulators in the coming weeks.“The results of this trial are truly striking,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on a conference call with reporters. The efficacy against severe disease “is really quite impressive.”What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“Moderna’s vaccine mRNA-1273 showing an impressive 94.5% effectiveness in preventing Covid-19 cases gives it an equal footing vs. Pfizer-BioNTech’s mRNA vaccine BNT162b2, in our view. Further, the less-rigorous distribution and shipping requirements provide mRNA-1273 an edge over its rival, though both will be used given the production constraints, while their long-term protection is still unknown.”The company said it would expect an emergency authorization to be based on a final analysis containing 151 cases, along with two months of safety follow-up data that U.S. regulators want to see. That final data is expected later this month.Also Read: Indian govt in talks with Moderna for its Covid-19 vaccine candidateCambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna received $955 million from the U.S. Operation Warp Speed program to develop its vaccine, and the country has agreed to pay up to $1.53 billion to purchase supply of the shot. Pfizer has said it didn’t receive any federal funding to develop its vaccine, though it has a supply agreement with the U.S. worth nearly $2 billion.Moderna expects to manufacture 20 million doses of its vaccine by year-end, enough to vaccinate 10 million people. This initial batch will go to the U.S.Government officials today said on the conference call they also expect to have at least 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, sufficient for another 10 million recipients, available in the U.S. by year-end. Pfizer has said it expects to produce as many as 50 million doses of its vaccine by the end of 2020.Shot StabilityOnce a vaccine is cleared, distribution is expected to be a significant challenge. Handling some of the shots that are being studied is complicated: For example, Pfizer’s must be stored at ultra-cold temperatures until a few days before it’s used, a requirement that adds logistical hurdles for states that will be in charge of overseeing the inoculation effort.Moderna said on Monday that new data showed its vaccine is stable at refrigerator temperatures for 30 days, much longer than previous estimate of seven days. For longer-term storage, it can be kept in freezers, though it doesn’t need the special facilities required for the Pfizer vaccine.“Every pharmacy, doctor’s office, hospital” has the capability to store a vaccine in a regular refrigerator, Bancel said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Monday. The vaccine’s stability at such temperatures will have “a huge impact” in the ability to distribute it widely.Both Moderna’s and Pfizer’s vaccines are based on mRNA technology designed to transform the body’s own cells into vaccine-making factories. Once injected, the vaccines instruct cells to make copies of the coronavirus’s spike protein, stimulating the creation of protective antibodies.The analysis of Moderna’s data found no significant safety concerns, the company said. It said some participants had severe fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain and headaches after getting the vaccine, though the side effects were generally short-lived.Bancel said the data safety monitoring board met at 10 a.m. on Sunday. The CEO said he anxiously checked his email every five minutes until he heard in the early afternoon they had results, and got on a video call to hear them.The result “is a big milestone” for messenger RNA technology, Bancel said. “It shows that mRNA can be a drug.”Surging CasesIn vaccine trials, a certain number of volunteers -- a percentage of whom get a placebo -- have to get infected in order to determine if the vaccine works. That’s easier to accomplish with the pandemic in the U.S. surging. The country has recorded more than 100,000 new infections every day since Nov. 5, according to Johns Hopkins University data compiled by Bloomberg.The same explosion of Covid-19 cases that helped Pfizer get results for its vaccine trial on Nov. 9 helped speed along Moderna’s trial. Moderna on Nov. 11 said its study had accumulated more than 53 infections, allowing a preliminary analysis to begin.Infections were accumulating so fast in the trial that Moderna’s analysis ended up being based on 95 cases, the company said.Bancel said at the rate cases are piling up Moderna should get the final 151 cases by the end of the month, allowing it to complete a final analysis and file for emergency use authorization.Moderna’s final-stage trial started on the same day as Pfizer’s in late July. The company was slightly behind Pfizer largely due to structural differences in the studies. The two doses of Moderna’s vaccine are given four weeks apart; Pfizer’s two doses are given over three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-stable-at-refrigerator-temperatures-for-30-days/story-jbtcMaAWmQ1GmNvKzIVG9K.html

17-11-2020||World||In absence of coordination with Trump, there is risk of many more dying: Joe Biden||US President-elect Joe Biden has said many more Americans are at the risk of dying from coronavirus, if he and incumbent President Donald Trump do not coordinate on tackling the virus outbreak. According to media projections, Democrat Biden has won the November 3 presidential election. However, Trump, a Republican, has alleged election fraud and mounted legal fights in a number of battleground states. “More people may die if we don’t coordinate,” Biden said in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, responding to a question on President Donald Trump refusing to concede the election and the outgoing administration not co-operating in the transition process. “A vaccine is important. It’s of little use until you’re vaccinated. So, how do we get the vaccine, how do we get over 300 million Americans vaccinated? What’s the game plan? It’s a huge, huge, huge undertaking to get it done, prioritise those greatest in need and working our way through, and also cooperate with the World Health Organization and the rest of the world in dealing with this,” he said. “So they (Trump administration) say they have this ‘Warp Speed’ program that not only dealt with getting vaccines, but also how to distribute this. If we have to wait until January 20th (day of Presidential inauguration) to start that planning, it puts us behind over a month, month-and-a-half. And so, it’s important that it be done, that there be coordination now, now or as rapidly as we can get that done,” Biden said. As of now, Biden said his action plan is to deal with every individual, organisation in the country from business to labour, Republicans and Democrats, to try to pull together a serious and consistent plan so that he is ready on day one with everything from staffing to ultimately naming cabinet members to moving along on coordinating with business and labour, the Covid-19 outbreak. “And so, it would make it a lot easier if the president were to participate. We have a number of Republicans suggesting that--the good news here is my colleague is still on the Intelligence Committee so she gets the intelligence briefings. I don’t anymore. But there’s a number of Republicans calling for that,” he said. “My message is I will work with you. I understand a lot of your reluctance because of the way the president operates, but I’ve been in contact with and will be in contact with more of them as we move along. And if it has to wait until January 20th to get--to actually become operational, that’s a shame but it may be that’s the only way to get it done,” he said. Biden was also asked about his thoughts on Trump’s tweet over the weekend where he first seemed to acknowledge that Biden had won the election. However, soon after Trump said he would not concede, and that he had won. “I interpret that as Trumping-ism, no change in his modus operandi. And I think the pressure will continue to build,” he said. The President-elect said that he is having a lot of meetings with world leaders on the telephone and he can get into negotiating with them about things that are going to be done. They are calling with some degree of enthusiasm everyone from a holy father to prime ministers across the globe. “So we are moving along knowing what the outcome will be and … but I find this more embarrassing for the country than debilitating for my ability to get started,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-absence-of-coordination-with-trump-there-is-risk-of-many-more-dying-joe-biden/story-heLKGzDIhym26FqHTSsoEK.html
17-11-2020||World||‘In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story,’ says Barack Obama||Former US President Barack Obama has said that modern day India can be counted as a success story in many respects, despite bitter feuds within political parties, various armed separatist movements, and corruption scandals. The 44th US president, in his latest book, says the transition to a more market-based economy in the 1990s unleashed the extraordinary entrepreneurial talents of Indians, leading to soaring growth rates, a thriving technology sector, and a steadily expanding middle class. In his book “A Promised Land”, Obama writes on his journey from the 2008 election campaign to the end of his first term with the daring Abbottabad (Pakistan) raid that killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden. “A Promised Land” is the first of two planned volumes. The first part hit bookstores globally on Tuesday.Also Read: ‘A Promised Land’: First volume of Barack Obama’s memoir to hit stands on November 17 “In many respects, modern-day India is counted as a success story, having survived repeated changeovers in government, bitter feuds within political parties, various armed separatist movements, and all manner of corruption scandals,” Obama writes. As the chief architect of India’s economic transformation, (former) Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seemed like a fitting emblem of this progress: a member of the tiny, often persecuted Sikh religious minority who had risen to the highest office in the land, and a self-effacing technocrat who had won people’s trust not by appealing to their passions but by bringing about higher living standards and maintaining a well-earned reputation for not being corrupt, says Obama, who had visited India twice as president in 2010 and 2015. Referring to his November 2010 India visit, Obama says he and Manmohan Singh had developed a warm and productive relationship. “While he could be cautious in foreign policy, unwilling to get out too far ahead of an Indian bureaucracy that was historically suspicious of US intentions, our time together confirmed my initial impression of him as a man of uncommon wisdom and decency; and during my visit to the capital city of New Delhi, we reached agreements to strengthen US cooperation on counterterrorism, global health, nuclear security, and trade,” Obama writes. “What I couldn’t tell was whether Singh’s rise to power represented the future of India’s democracy or merely an aberration,” he said. Obama writes that Singh at the time was worried about India’s economy, cross border terrorism and the rise of anti-Muslim sentiments.Also Read: ‘How much does he know about this nation?’: Sanjay Raut in response to Obama’s memoir During a conversation without aides and note takers, Singh told him: “In uncertain times, Mr President, the call of religious and ethnic solidarity can be intoxicating. And it’s not so hard for politicians to exploit that, in India or anywhere else.” “I nodded, recalling the conversation I’d had with Václav Havel (Former President of Czechoslovakia) during my visit to Prague and his warning about the rising tide of illiberalism in Europe. If globalisation and a historic economic crisis were fueling these trends in relatively wealthy nations—if I was seeing it even in the United States with the Tea Party —how could India be immune?” he said. Across the country, millions continued to live in squalor, trapped in sunbaked villages or labyrinthine slums, even as the titans of Indian industry enjoyed lifestyles that the rajas and moguls of old would have envied, Obama writes. “Expressing hostility toward Pakistan was still the quickest route to national unity, with many Indians taking great pride in the knowledge that their country had developed a nuclear weapons program to match Pakistan’s, untroubled by the fact that a single miscalculation by either side could risk regional annihilation,” he says. Obama writes Manmohan Singh’s elevation as prime minister, sometimes heralded as a hallmark of the country’s progress in overcoming sectarian divides, was somewhat deceiving. He hadn’t originally become prime minister as a result of his own popularity. “In fact, he owed his position to Sonia Gandhi — the Italian-born widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and the head of the Congress Party, who’d declined to take the job herself after leading her party coalition to victory and had instead anointed Singh. More than one political observer believed that she’d chosen Singh precisely because as an elderly Sikh with no national political base, he posed no threat to her forty-year-old son, Rahul, whom she was grooming to take over the Congress Party,” he said.Also Read: Obama urges media to rebuild social trust; ‘the country is divided’ In his book, Obama, referring to his meeting with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi at the dinner table, said that the Congress president listened more than she spoke, careful to defer to Singh when policy matters came up, and often steered the conversation toward her son. “It became clear to me, though, that her power was attributable to a shrewd and forceful intelligence. As for Rahul, he seemed smart and earnest, his good looks resembling his mother’s. He offered up his thoughts on the future of progressive politics, occasionally pausing to probe me on the details of my 2008 campaign,” he wrote. “But there was a nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject,” Obama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-many-respects-modern-day-india-is-counted-as-a-success-story-says-barack-obama/story-lEzrN1PFSnesxSWEhzJ0ZJ.html

17-11-2020||World||Hurricane Iota nearing Nicaragua as catastrophic Category 5||Tremendously powerful Category 5 Hurricane Iota was just off Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast Monday evening and was likely to bring catastrophic damage to the same part of Central America already battered by a powerful Hurricane Eta less than two weeks ago.The US National Hurricane Center said the storm had maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 kph). It was centered about 35 miles (55 kilometers) east-southeast of the Nicaraguan city of Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi, and moving westward at 9 mph (15 kph). Iota was hitting the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rains and strong winds while the western edge began battering the Nicaraguan coast.Also Read: Hurricane Iota heads for already battered Central AmericaAuthorities warned that Iota would probably come ashore over areas where Eta’s torrential rains saturated the soil, leaving it prone to new landslides and floods, and that the storm surge could reach 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 meters) above normal tides.That storm surge was on the mind of Yasmina Wriedt on Monday in Bilwi’s El Muelle neighborhood, sitting tight against the sea.“The situation doesn’t look good at all,” Wriedt said. “We woke up without electricity, with rain and the surf is getting really high.”Wriedt, who works for a small-scale fishing organization called Piquinera, said that the roof of her house was blown off in Eta less than two weeks ago. “We repaired it as best we could, now I think the wind will take it again because they say (Iota) is even stronger,” Wriedt said, the sound of hammering echoing around her as neighbors boarded windows and reinforced roofs.During Eta the surf came up to just behind her house, where she lives with eight other members of her family. “Today I’m afraid again about losing my house and I’m frightened for all of us who live in this neighborhood.”Wriedt said some neighbors went to stay with relatives elsewhere, but most have stayed. “We’re almost all here,” she said. “Neither the army nor the government came to move us.”Cairo Jarquin, Nicaragua emergency response project manager for Catholic Relief Services, had just visited Bilwi and smaller coastal communities Friday.In Wawa Bar, Jarquin said he found “total destruction.” People had been working furiously to put roofs back over their families’ heads, but now Iota threatened to take what was left.“The little that remained standing could be razed,” Jarquin said. There were other communities farther inland that he was not even able to reach due to the condition of roads. He said he heard that Wawa bar was evacuated again Saturday.Also Read: ‘On steroids’: Hurricanes are becoming turbocharged and harder to predictEvacuations were being conducted from low-lying areas in Nicaragua and Honduras near their shared border through the weekend.Nicaraguan Vice President Rosario Murillo, who is also the first lady, said Monday the government had done everything necessary to protect lives, including the evacuation of thousands. She added that Taiwan had donated 800 tons of rice to help those affected by the storms.Limborth Bucardo, of the Miskito Indigenous ethnic group, said many people had moved to churches in Bilwi. He rode out Eta with his wife and two children at home, but this time decided to move in with relatives in a safer neighborhood.“We hadn’t finished repairing our houses and settling in when another hurricane comes,” Bucardo said. “The shelters in Bilwi are already full, packed with people from (surrounding) communities.”Iota is the record 30th named storm of this year’s extraordinarily busy Atlantic hurricane season. It’s also the ninth storm to rapidly intensify this season, a dangerous phenomenon that is happening increasingly more often. Such activity has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.Iota is stronger, based on central pressure, than 2005′s Hurricane Katrina and is the first storm with a Greek alphabet name to hit Category 5, Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said. It also sets the record for the latest Category 5 hurricane on record, beating the record set by the Nov. 8, 1932, Cuba Hurricane.Eta had hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane, killing more than 130 people as torrential rains caused flash floods and mudslides in parts of Central America and Mexico. Then it meandered across Cuba, the Florida Keys and around the Gulf of Mexico before slogging ashore again near Cedar Key, Florida, and dashing across Florida and the Carolinas.Iota was forecast to drop 10 to 20 inches (250-500 millimeters) of rain in northern Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and southern Belize, with as much as 30 inches (750 millimeters) in isolated spots. Costa Rica and Panama could also experience heavy rain and possible flooding, the hurricane center said.The prospect of more rain was raising the anxiety of those still homeless after Eta.On Monday, Carmen Isabel Rodríguez Ortez, 48, was still living inside a government shelter with more than 250 people in La Lima, Honduras, just outside San Pedro Sula. Devastated by Eta’s destruction, she quickly broke into sobs as she contemplated the torrential rains of another storm.“We’re living a real nightmare,” Rodríguez said. The Chamelecon river flooded her Reformada neighborhood as Eta passed, submerging their homes. “Now they announce more rain and we don’t know what’s going to happen, because our homes are completely flooded.”Eta was this year’s 28th named storm, tying the 2005 record. Remnants of Theta, the 29th, dissipated Sunday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.Over the past couple of decades, meteorologists have been more worried about storms like Iota that power up much faster than normal. They created an official threshold for this rapid intensification -- a storm gaining 35 mph (56 kph) in wind speed in just 24 hours. Iota doubled it.Earlier this year, Hannah, Laura, Sally, Teddy, Gamma, Delta, Zeta and Iota all rapidly intensified. Laura and Delta tied or set records for rapid intensification.The official end of the hurricane season is Nov. 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hurricane-iota-nearing-nicaragua-as-catastrophic-category-5/story-XxNNelqna9BYTN2tRlymfO.html
17-11-2020||World||‘US, allies need to set global trade rules to counter China’s influence’: Joe Biden||US President-elect Joe Biden said on Monday the United States needed to negotiate with allies to set global trading rules to counter China’s growing influence but declined to say whether he would join a new China-backed Asian trade pact signed on Sunday.Asked at a news conference in Wilmington, Delaware, whether the United States would join the Asian-focused 15-country Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, Biden said he could not yet discuss US trade policy because he had not taken office “and there’s only one president at a time.”Also Read: Under Biden, the future of US-India ties“We make up 25% ... of the economy in the world,” Biden said of the United States. “We need to be aligned with the other democracies, another 25% or more so that we can set the rules of the road instead of having China and others dictate outcomes because they are the only game in town.”The signing of the RCEP at a regional summit in Hanoi creates the world’s largest trade agreement, covering 30% of the global economy and 30% of the global population, joining for the first time Asian powers China, Japan and South Korea.It also marks a another setback for US influence in the region after President Donald Trump in 2017 quit the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, negotiated while Biden was vice president.Biden said he had a detailed trade plan he would discuss on Jan. 21, 2021, the day after he is due to be sworn into office.Also Read: Donald Trump admits Joe Biden ‘won’, but insists US election was ‘rigged’While TPP members including Japan and many free-trade advocates have expressed hope that Biden would rejoin that trade pact, he has said little about the subject and advisers have said he would not immediately remove tariffs on Chinese goods. Biden said he had told leaders the United States would approach trade by insisting that Washington would “invest in American workers and make them more competitive,” make sure that labor and environmental interests were represented in any new trade negotiations and stop “poking our finger in the eyes of our friends.”Asked why he would not comment on plans for trade agreements when he has said he would rejoin the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accords, Biden said: “You’re asking me about whether I’d join a specific proposal, the details of which are now only being negotiated among those nations. It would require a negotiation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allies-need-to-set-global-trade-rules-to-counter-china-s-influence-joe-biden/story-P7YJxmb529BbJABiKGGcxK.html

About 10% of Covid-19 tests came back positive, the data showed. To put it another way, one out of every 315 Americans tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the past week.Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota all had positive test rates over 50%.

17-11-2020||World||Campaign underway in UK against rising rape cases in India||A newly-formed campaign group on Monday put up billboards in stations on the London Underground to raise awareness of rapes in India and put pressure on authorities to deal with the issue by putting in place a robust system to help victims.Called RapeFreeIndia UK, the group said its members are non-political and include women of Indian origin, including professionals working in the civil service, IT and medicine. It raised over £2000 from a crowd-sourced online platform for the campaign.The billboards campaign, it said, will run from November 16 to December 13 with support from campaign group White Ribbon UK, which works to end male violence against women.London-based Roohi Ghouse, a medic and member of the organisation, said: “Seeing the issue highlighted on international platforms may put pressure on India to tackle rape crimes, review strategies and put in place a robust system that helps victims get their cases processed quickly, beginning from the medical examination, all the way up to the judiciary, and provide protection to the families when under threat.”The billboards have been put up in Regent’s Park, Chalk Farm and Kennington stations.Leena, an IT professional and part of the campaign, said: “We are deeply disturbed by the increasing incidents of rape, and gruesome rape in India. We are not happy for India to be seen as an unsafe country for women or a rape capital. India has so much to offer and we do not want to end up with this title”.Over 150 people in UK and abroad contributed to the campaign with funds and support, including anti-rape campaigners such as Sohaila Abdulali and Tara Kaushal, according to Rekha Sharma, a civil servant, who said the campaign remains distinctly apolitical to ensure that the focus on women’s safety is not lost.“In 2019, with 3200+ cases ‘reported’ rape cases in India and with only 28% conviction rate, women’s safety in the country is far from ideal. We believe it should be the norm and not a privilege. We want India to be attain gender equality and mutual respect in a true sense”, IT professional Anita Rajan, another campaigner, added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/campaign-underway-in-uk-against-rape-incidents-in-india/story-xcmFukGWr7VGadaNxL9TPI.html

It said that strict regimen of wearing masks, no overcrowding by devotees and social distancing will be ensured by the police deployed around artificial ponds.According to the circular, the permissions to perform Chhath Puja will be given at the ward-level. All 24 administrative wards will ensure that a medical team is set up near the artificial ponds to conduct Covid tests for devotees through antigen or RT-PCR kits. Police will also be deployed at places that have been prohibited for performing the rituals to ensure that there is no gathering of devotees.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have protested against the restrictions by the BMC alleging that they are discriminatory in nature. Vinod Mishra, BJP leader in the BMC, said, “Immersion of Ganesh idols were allowed at beaches and lakes this year. The Covid situation during that period was grave and now when it has improved, the civic body is imposing more restrictions.

17-11-2020||India||‘Stressful relations’: Jaishankar analyses China ties, then some advice||India-China relations have been disturbed by the unexplained violation of agreements on border management and troop deployments and Beijing needs to reflect on the world’s reaction to its actions, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday. The current status of bilateral ties is a “cause for concern” because 45 years of peace and tranquillity on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) have been eroded by the developments of this year, including the Galwan Valley clash of June, Jaishankar said while participating in a virtual discussion with his Canadian counterpart François-Philippe Champagne. Champagne described Canada’s relations with China as “multi-dimensional and complex”, and said one of the biggest issues for Ottawa was the arbitrary detention by Beijing of two Canadian citizens for close to 700 days. “Coercive diplomacy” has no place in today’s world, and Canada will challenge China on issues such as human rights and the situations in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, while co-existing and cooperating in areas such as the Indo-Pacific, trade and climate change, Champagne said. Jaishankar said 45 years of peace on the LAC had made China one of India’s top trade partners and triggered growth in investments, tech tie-ups and tourism. “The last time somebody was killed [by violence] on that border was 1975, and in June 2020, it changed,” he said. “I think we are going through a period of stressful relations with China. My hope is that people at that end of the relationship understand the seriousness of what has happened,” he added. He suggested China needs to reflect on the world’s reaction to its actions. Though the rise of China is part of a global rebalancing, “it is the responsibility of the rising power to also consider how does the world react...It is not just enough to rise, I think it is enough to rise with a certain degree of care and consideration for the larger international system”, he said. Jaishankar said the two sides had agreements not to bring large number of forces to the border that were observed for 30 years. “If today, that is violated without explanation, with no justification offered to us, we have to ask ourselves, where is this going?” he asked.“There is cause for concern but it is in the nature of our job to try and work out solutions,” he said, against the backdrop of India and China failing to make headway in disengagement after several rounds of talks. The two ministers were participating in a discussion on the theme “Canada and India’s role in a post-Covid-19 world” organised by the think tanks Centre for International Governance Innovation and Gateway House. Jaishankar and Champagne spoke of the potential for India and Canada to cooperate for post-Covid-19 economic recovery, creating stable supply chains, and vaccine development and access. Champagne said India has a critical role in the manufacturing and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines and the two countries can do more together in the Indo-Pacific region and for upholding a rules-based international order. Jaishankar noted Covid-19 has shaken up the world and India and Canada should focus on how they can shape the emerging order. India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat presents new opportunities for Canadian businesses and new areas for cooperation include digital technologies, space and clean energy, he said. Without naming the Khalistan movement, which was a major irritant in India-Canada ties during Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s first term, Jaishankar said: “Both nations have benefited from the talent and creativity of the human bridge. However, we have also seen the misuse of democratic freedoms by a small minority with medieval beliefs and a propensity to violence.” India-Canada trade is currently worth about $10 billion a year and Canadian investments in India total more than $60 billion. Among the major investors are Canadian pension funds, and 500 Canadian companies have investments in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-going-through-stressful-relations-with-china-says-jaishankar/story-1KfP9Mx388WUzcWuLGUqtL.html
17-11-2020||India||Indo-US ties will pick up, Joe Biden no stranger to India: S Jaishankar||The Indian government will face no problems in taking forward ties with the US under the Joe Biden administration because of the strong element of bipartisan support for the bilateral relationship, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday. “I am very confident that we will pick up where we left off (with the Donald Trump administration), we have done that over the last four administrations,” Jaishankar said while participating in an online discussion organised by the think tanks Centre for International Governance Innovation and Gateway House. “I think that will be the case as well here and I say that because within the American politics, it’s not just that we deal with the administration of the day, we also tend to deal with the Congress. American politics by its nature has very strong elements of bipartisanship,” he said. President-elect Biden is “not a stranger to India or to the relationship” and India has dealt with him in his former roles as vice president in the Barack Obama administration and as ranking Democratic member and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jaishankar said. “He (Biden) is very much part of this period when Indo-American relations underwent a radical transformation, which I reasonably date back to former President Bill Clinton’s visit to India in 2000,” he said. “You had four presidents and you really cannot find more dissimilar people – Clinton, George W Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. But one issue and one relationship to which all of them were committed was the Indian relationship,” he added. There is a “very strong element of structural predictability and a certain ballast” in the India-US relationship, Jaishankar said, adding that both countries are natural partners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indo-us-ties-will-pick-up-joe-biden-no-stranger-to-india-s-jaishankar/story-TVJTUS27KN3q6oadQjwjoO.html
17-11-2020||India||It’s turning out to be a lucky year for Sandeep!||Like every sector, ongoing pandemic has affected the entertainment industry too but still there are a few lucky ones for whom it did bring a positive change. Lucknow-based actor Sandeep Yadav feels it has been a blessed year for him in terms of work and self-growth. It started in March when he was seen in Anubhav Sinha’s ‘Thappad’ followed by Shoojit Sircar’s ‘Gulabo Sitabo’, OTT series ‘Hansmukh’ and ‘Ashram’. Sandeep has already shot for two films and is working on his third that will be ‘Satyamev Jayate-2.’ “Certainly, it has been luckiest year for me. My four major projects released this year and fortunately during the lockdown people had time to sit down and notice my work. In unlock phase while in Lucknow, I was offered a feature film. It has been an exciting phase in terms of getting good opportunities,” said the ‘Bhabhiji Ghar Par Hain actor.’ On personal too front he gained a lot. “I got a lot time to explore myself. I was never into finance planning but now, I have became more organised and well versed in such matters. Interestingly, I also got time to work on personal being and lost 15 kgs weight. After losing weight (from 80 kg) the roles I’m getting are very different even lesser than my real age. Makers are looking at me in varied roles.” Besides, his film ‘Uljhan’ directed by Amit Pant and shot in Lucknow last year became NFDC’s official entry to Cannes Film Festival this year. “I played an honest government officer who due to family pressure takes bribe and gets caught.” Giving an insight about his future projects he shares, “In Kunal Kohli’s ‘Lahore Confidential’ I play a RAW agent. In Faiz Anwar’s film ‘Stage Singer’ I have a negative role while in ‘Satyamev Jayate-2’ I’ll be seen in a negative character — a corrupt government employee. I’m also scheduled to shoot for a web-series with Arshad Warsi in December.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-turning-out-to-be-a-lucky-year-for-sandeep/story-50cB3NRYECb3MSFFQn2nzH.html
17-11-2020||India||‘Still a long way to go...’||Known for films like ‘Zameen,’ ‘My Wife’s Murder,’ ‘D-Day’ and shows like ‘Jai Hanuman’ and ‘Naagin,’ Varanasi-born actor and director Manish Khanna feels it has been a contented journey but still he has a long way to go. “Mine, has been an eventful career with a great mix of roles but still there many interesting characters out there waiting for me,” he said. Giving an insight on how things have changed in all these years in the industry, Manish said, “It’s a complete 360 degree turn that our industry has undergone. I’ve been here for almost 30 years now and in terms of content and stories we are living in the best era. It’s unbelievable that we could finally say no to those 100 dancers’ songs and overdramatised action films. I’m so glad that I’m able to work in this period where storytelling and good scripts are extremely essential.” When asked about his TV journey where he has been part of larger than life shows too, he was quick to revert. “TV too underwent change but then television caters vast audience which includes kids, elderly and youngsters. These fantasy shows are planned for a target audience especially kids who enjoy such mind-boggling tales. Like, we as kids used to love super hero comics so why not a TV show can be based on it,” said Manish who plays a ‘tantrik’ in upcoming fantasy drama ‘Brahmarakshas-2.’The versatile actor plans to shoot his directorial OTT series in Lucknow next month. “I have completed my college from Lucknow and have spent beautiful days in the city before shifting to Mumbai for my bread and better. I’ll always cherish those days and I always have this strong carving for Lakhnavi cuisine. I’m glad next month my work will take me to the city of Nawabs again,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/still-a-long-way-to-go/story-FMwhBAyF44q6W6GWwN3GFM.html
17-11-2020||India||BSF officer arrested by CBI in Kolkata in cattle smuggling case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday evening arrested Satish Kumar, a senior Border Security Force (BSF) officer, in the cattle smuggling case in Bengal that the agency has been probing since 2018. Kumar was arrested in Kolkata after hours of interrogation. The officer is one of the prime accused named in the first information report (FIR). He was commandant in the South Bengal Frontier of the BSF and is now posted in Raipur in Chhattisgarh. His home in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, was raided in September, a senior BSF official of the South Bengal Frontier said on condition of anonymity. A house that he owns in the Salt Lake area in the eastern fringes of Kolkata was also sealed by the agency. The CBI is probing the alleged involvement of several BSF and Customs officials in the ongoing probe into cattle smuggling along the West Bengal-Bangladesh border. The illegal trade involved crores of rupees. A CBI officer said on condition of anonymity that according to the agency’s FIR more than 20,000 cows were seized by the BSF when Kumar was posted as commandant of the 36th Battalion from May 2016 to May 2017. However, neither was any smuggler arrested nor the vehicles used for ferrying the cattle seized, the FIR says. The case was registered in 2018 after a BSF commandant, who served in Bengal, was booked in Kerala. The probe revealed a nexus between government officers and cow traders. It is alleged that cattle seized by the BSF were auctioned within 24 hours with the help of some Customs officers so that cattle traders could buy these at very low price and legally sell them again. The CBI is probing charges that for every cow seized and sold through this nexus, BSF officials used to get Rs 2,000 and Custom officials used to get Rs 500, according to the CBI FIR that HT has seen. In addition, Customs officials used to allegedly get 10 per cent of the auction price as a bribe. CBI officers suspect that a large amount of money was sent to other states through hawala operators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsf-officer-arrested-by-cbi-in-kolkata-in-cattle-smuggling-case/story-R6SO6NZ3xelf7JfnWq3qfO.html

But then, if at all it has to be obtained, we are examining what we need to do...and will work out a strategy,” he said.As for both the vaccine candidates of Moderna and Pfizer, Paul said, “We are watching the developments. They have announced the preliminary results and have not got the regulatory approvals.” The official expressed hope on the success of the five vaccines that are under different phases of trial in the country. The doses of these vaccines will be available in sufficient numbers. Giving an update, he said the phase-3 trial of the Oxford vaccine of the Serum Institute is almost near completion, while the phase-3 clinical trial of the indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of the Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has already started.Another indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of the Zydus Cadila has completed the phase-2 clinical trial, Paul said.Dr Reddy’s Laboratories will soon start the combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, in India. Also, the Biological E Limited has started early phase 1 and 2 human trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate.Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE last week said their vaccine candidate was found to be more than 90 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19.  Moderna on Monday said the independent National Institutes of Health-appointed Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the Phase 3 study of mRNA-1273, its vaccine candidate against Covid-19, found it to have an efficacy of 94.5 per cent.Asked if the government is working on a draft scheme on Covid-19 vaccine distribution, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said one of the mandates of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 is to have a time-bound scheme to ensure the fulfilment of the commitment that the prime minister made to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on August 15, where he said the citizens will be inoculated as soon as the vaccine becomes available.“A document in this regard is in its final stages of preparation. We have shared it with the state governments and have taken their inputs. We are also in the process of finalising the database of the priority population groups, who will be administered the vaccine if and when it becomes available, and there also, we are in collaboration with the states and other central ministries,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/storage-of-pfizer-s-covid-19-vaccine-challenge-for-most-nations-india-examining-possibilities-govt/story-nlF3R682pCxkzCqeyFwRYI.html

Agrawal expressed shock and disbelief over the news.Former information commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said it is a big loss to the transparency advocates’ community.“He was one of the few serious experts of the RTI Act. He had developed his own software to keep a track of his applications, appeals and complaints. Jain was an important contributor to information jurisprudence with some very important cases brought by him and in a number of others, he appeared,” he said.Jain was a strong supporter of bringing political parties under the ambit of the RTI Act but unfortunately, that case could not reach culmination, Acharyulu said.“Very sad to hear about his sad demise. A great fighter. Very outspoken and upfront without being abrasive or hurtful. We fought so many appeals and complaints together in the CIC and secured some important orders. Hearings used to be always followed by a meal at a dhaba in Bhikaji Cama Place. Will miss him as a great friend and advisor,” Hyderabad-based activist CJ Karira said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rti-activist-rk-jain-succumbs-to-covid-19-other-ailments/story-PXGUpzkcmRHdO0fHvOCI3K.html
17-11-2020||India||Nitish Kumar draws RJD fire for appointing scam-tainted Mewalal Choudhary education minister||The main opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Tuesday attacked Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar for appointing JD(U)’s Mewalal Choudhary as education minister three years after he was sacked from the party for alleged involvement in a corruption case when he headed the Bihar Agriculture University.Choudhary, the JD (U) MLA from Tarapur, was expelled from the party in 2017.“The corrupt JDU MLA Mewalal has been given a ministerial position by Nitish Kumar. This is the double standard of Nitish Kumar, the patron of 60 scams. This man can fall to the lowest level for a chair,” the RJD tweeted in Hindi.Choudhary was accused of irregularities in the appointment of assistant professors and junior scientists at the Bihar Agriculture University (BAU) in Bhagalpur when he was its vice-chancellor.According to sources, an FIR was lodged against him on February 20, 2017 with the Sabour police station in Bhagalpur on the directives of the then Bihar governor Ram Nath Kovind, who set up a probe committee after several applicants alleged irregularities in appointments. Choudhary was booked under sections 409 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine of forged document) and 120 (B) (conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Three days after the FIR was lodged against him, Choudhary was expelled from the JD(U), party sources said.BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi, the then Opposition leader, had said, “We demand his immediate arrest. If he is not arrested, we will raise the issue in the House.”On August 22, 2017, the Patna high court granted Choudhary anticipatory bail. In January 2018, he was taken back into the JD (U).Choudhary was the founder V-C of the BAU from 2010 to mid-2015. BAU sources said the university had in 2011 issued an advertisement seeking applications for 281 posts of assistant professor-cum-junior scientist. The appointments were made against only 161 vacancies under general category in 2012. BAU is an autonomous institute under the Bihar government, established in 2010 under Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Choudhary joined the JD (U) in October 2015 after his stint as VC.Sujit Kumar, Deputy Inspector General of Police (Bhagalpur range) said till date police filed a charge sheet against only two persons in the case. Investigation is on and supplementary a charge sheet would be filed against more suspects.Meanwhile, former IPS officer Amitabh Kumar Das on Tuesday wrote a letter to the Director General of Police and sought a probe into the mysterious death of Mewala’s wife and former MLA Neeta Choudhary on June 2, 2019. Das said he suspected that Neeta might have known about corruption in the agriculture university.When contacted, BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said he did not have any information on the entire episode.Choudhary remained combative. “The state government is looking into it and the IPS officer will be served legal notice,” he told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitish-kumar-draws-rjd-fire-for-appointing-scam-tainted-mewalal-choudhary-education-minister/story-JuQv2Xv1dZwhLEggnuvLGN.html
17-11-2020||India||Govt will leave no stone unturned to make India preferred global investment destination: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said his government will leave no stone unturned to make India a preferred global investment destination as he pitched for foreign investment to modernise urban centres, offering a business friendly climate and a huge market. As the nation rebuilds post pandemic, Modi said Covid-19 has given governments the chance to accelerate the “process of making cities more liveable for people”. “We are looking at a future where a major chunk of education, healthcare, shopping may happen online. Our cities need to be ready for the convergence of the physical and digital worlds,” he said in his speech at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. Noting that the Covid-19 pandemic has posed enormous challenges before the world, Modi said he thinks the historic reconstruction efforts after the two world wars can give “us several lessons”. Post world wars, the entire world worked on a new world order. New protocols were developed and world changed itself. “Covid-19 has also given us a similar opportunity to develop new protocols in every field. This opportunity should be grabbed by the world if we want to develop resilient systems for the future. We should think on post Covid requirements of the world. A good starting point would be the rejuvenation of our urban centres,” Modi said. Highlighting Indian cities have presented an extra-ordinary example during these tough times, Modi said: “There were world-wide incidents of resistance against the lockdown measures. However Indian cities meticulously followed these preventive measures. This is because, for us, the biggest building block of our cities was not concrete, but the community.” The prime minister said the pandemic has re-emphasised “that our biggest resource, as societies and as businesses, is our people”. The post-Covid world, he stressed, has to be built by nurturing this key and fundamental resource. The prime minister said it has been the endeavour in India to build urban centres, which have the amenities of a city but the spirit of a village. Pitching for foreign investment, he said India has exciting opportunities for investment in urbanisation, mobility, innovation and sustainable solution. These opportunities come along with a vibrant democracy, a business friendly climate, a huge market and a government which shall leave no stone unturned to make India a preferred global investment destination, he said. Modi further said India is well on its way towards urban transformation. “I have no doubt that with the help of all stakeholders, the civil society, academic institutions, industry and most importantly the citizens and communities, we will achieve the dream of resilient and prosperous global cities,” he said. In his address, Modi emphasised cities cannot prosper without availability of affordable housing, and talked about the ‘Housing for All’ programme launched by his government in 2015. “We will deliver more than one crore or 10 million houses to aspiring families in urban areas before the targeted deadline of 2022,” he said. He also told the gathering that looking at the conditions created by the pandemic, the government also introduced an affordable rental housing initiative. He also said the Real Estate Regulation Act has transformed the dynamics of the real estate sector. This has made it more customer-oriented and transparent, the prime minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-will-leave-no-stone-unturned-to-make-india-preferred-global-investment-destination-pm-modi/story-zhjLjfi11u0XNAsN8PVKmN.html
17-11-2020||India||Covid-19 vaccine: Centre may not procure Pfizer shots at all||The Centre will deliberate if Pfizer vaccine against Covid-19, which needs a temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius, should be obtained at all. And the storage requirement is not the only roadblock the Covid-19 task force is worries about. The quantity in which they will be available would not be sufficient for Indian population, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul, who also heads the National Task Force on Covid-19, said. But if the vaccine gets regulatory approvals meanwhile, the government will work out a strategy for procurement and distribution, he said. Not only for India, the cold storage requirement of the PFizer vaccine will pose a challenge to many countries — an issue that is being highlighted by medical experts across the world. Both Moderna and Pfizer have announced the results of their initial trials and are awaiting regulatory approvals. India is pinning its hope on the five vaccines that are under different phases of trial in the country. Also Read: Covid-19 vaccine update: Bharat Biotech begins phase 3 trials, Moderna says its candidate nearly 95% effectiveThe five candidates also include Russia’s Sputnik-V whose trials in India will start next week in collaboration with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, apart from Bharat Biotech’s indigenous COVAXIN and Serum Institutes Oxford vaccine Covishield. Zydus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D and another vaccine being developed by Biological E. Ltd alongside Baylor College of Medicine and Dynavax Technologies Corp are also on the list.Pfizer and BioNTech SE last week said their vaccine candidate was found to be more than 90 per cent effective in preventing Covid-19. Moderna on Monday said its vaccine candidate against Covid-19, found it to have an efficacy of 94.5 per cent. Moderna’s vaccine has normal temperature requirement, unlike that of PFizer. Pfizer vaccine requires minus 70 degrees Celsius as it is based on a technology that uses synthetic mRNA to activate the immune system against the virus. The biggest hospitals in the United States have said they don;t have this storage capacity. The pharma company has said it will ship the vaccines using dry ice. The vaccine shots can be kept for five days at two to eight degrees.Hence, even if India plans to procure Pfizer vaccines, the quantity will be less.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-centre-to-deliberate-if-pfizer-vaccine-should-be-obtained-at-all/story-TVYBCvLvCnFzUj8iXnbPqO.html

Citing a media report on the key accused in the chopper deal mentioning the names of senior Congress leaders like Salman Khurshid and Ahmed Patel, and Kamal Nath’s nephew Ratul Puri, he said, “Whenever you think of a kickback in a military deal, think of some Congress leaders.” “No defence deal without a loot, no defence deal without a kickback and no defence deal without some Congress leaders becoming beneficiary of it has been the go-to policy of Congress leaders,” the BJP leader said at a press conference. The Congress president and “the prince of the party” have to answer to the people, Prasad said.In 2010, there were talks of buying AgustaWestland helicopters for VVIPs like the president and the prime minister at a cost of Rs 3,600 crore, Prasad said. Two years later, media reports revealed that kickbacks had been given in the deal, the Union minister said.Though the Manmohan Singh-led UPA-2 government had ordered a CBI inquiry but no progress was made until the BJP-led NDA government was formed in May 2014. Thereafter, arrests were made in the case, Prasad said.Now, the key accused in the case, Rajiv Saxena, has mentioned the names of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath’s nephew Ratul Puri and son Bakul Nath, along with names of other Congress leaders Salman Khurshid and Ahmed Patel in his statements before the Enforcement Directorate (ED), he said.“The BJP demands that the Congress party not maintain silence on this grave issue. The nation is awake and listening,” Prasad said and asked “why do we always get names of Congress leaders whenever a defence deal is referred to an investigative agency”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whenever-you-think-of-kickback-in-defence-deal-think-of-congress-leaders-bjp-s-ravi-shankar-prasad/story-fzC0em0CoM3GpTojrN5u7J.html
17-11-2020||India||Amit Shah’s remarks on Gupkar alliance appropriate: BJP||The BJP on Tuesday termed Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s remarks on the Gupkar alliance as appropriate and said after the abrogation of Article 370, a number of pro-people central laws came into force in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Shah on Tuesday termed the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), a conglomerate of political parties in Jammu and Kashmir, an “unholy global alliance” and alleged that it, along with the Congress, wants to take Jammu and Kashmir back to the era of terror and turmoil. The senior BJP leader in a series of tweets also asserted that Jammu and Kashmir has been and always be an integral part of India. The conglomerate of regional and national political parties, including the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Jammu and Kashmir was formed defending the restoration of the Article 370, scrapped last year. Welcoming Shah’s statements on the Gupkar alliance, BJP leader and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told a press conference that his remarks are appropriate as PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti had made it clear that she will not raise the national flag until the separate flag of Jammu and Kashmir is restored. Prasad also claimed that NC leader Farooq Abdullah had once stated that he will seek China’s support for the restoration of special status of Jammu and Kashmir. The Centre on August 5 last year had abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Unlike these leaders, the people of the Jammu and Kashmir have started benefitting from pro-people central laws that have been brought into force in the Union Territory after the abrogation of special status, Union minister Prasad said. Prasad citing various laws said that women were earlier deprived of property rights in Jammu and Kashmir if they married outside, and anti-corruption laws, reservation for disadvantaged sections of society and various other “humanist” central laws were not implemented in the region. On August 4 last year, a day before abrogation of Article 370 was announced, political parties in Kashmir, except the BJP, met at Abdullah’s residence on Gupkar Road in Srinagar. They had also issued a joint statement defending Article 370. The constituents of the conglomerate besides the NC and the PDP also include the CPI-M, the Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference and the Awami National Conference. The Congress recently announced that it will have a seat-sharing arrangement with the PAGD for the forthcoming elections to District Development Councils in Jammu and Kashmir. Abdullah is the PAGD’s chairperson and PDP chief Mehbooba its vice-chairperson. Veteran CPI-M leader M Y Tarigami is the alliance’s convenor while People’s Conference leader Sajjad Gani Lone is its spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-s-remarks-on-gupkar-alliance-appropriate-bjp/story-Vs1s316VK5HjkdUAWSvLLK.html
17-11-2020||India||Uttrakhand police transfer rape, extortion cases involving BJP MLA to Pauri Garhwal from Dehradun||In a fresh development in the probe into extortion and rape cases involving BJP MLA from Dwarahat Mahesh Singh Negi, inspector general of police (Garhwal range) Abhinav Kumar on Tuesday transferred both the cases from Dehradun police to mahila thana in Pauri Garhwal district. The development came a day after the Dehradun police submitted the charge sheet against the 30-year-old woman in the extortion and blackmailing case in which she was accused by Negi’s wife of trying to extort ₹5 crore from him by blackmailing him with a threat to frame him in a rape case. The woman had accused Negi of raping her for several years and fathering her daughter after which Negi and his wife were then booked for rape and criminal intimidation. “We have transferred both the cases to mahila thana police in Pauri Garhwal district. It has been done to prevent allegations of not doing a fair and unbiased probe in both the cases,” said Kumar. The senior police officer said that the decision was also a result of a letter written by the Dehradun police to him citing the same aforementioned reason. “In September I received the letter from Dehradun police requesting the transferring of both the cases to a different district police citing allegations of not doing a fair probe. Apart from this I was also of the opinion that as both the cases are related to one matter, it should be probed by a single police officer unlike two different as was the case in Dehradun,” said Kumar. On Monday, the Dehradun police had also filed a charge sheet in the court against the woman in extortion and blackmailing case on Monday. But they withdrew it on Tuesday. “We had withdrawn it following some allegations that the action was to favour the complainant in the case which is not true. The charge sheet will be reviewed by the mahila thana police which will verify the evidence collected,” he said. Earlier on Tuesday, the opposition Congress accused the BJP government of trying to save Negi following reports of filing of charge sheet against the woman. “The development just shows that the police is working under the pressure of government by acting in favour of the rape accused MLA Negi,” said Garima Dasauni, Congress spokesperson in Uttarakhand. “It has also unmasked BJP which has taken no action against Negi so far despite several evidence of him raping the woman at several places. Their slogan of Beti Bachao Beto Padhao is just a farce,” said Dasauni. The BJP however, refuted the allegations and said there was no pressure on the police by the party or government. “We have always said that the law will take its own course and BJP will not interfere in it in any way. Whatever the probe results, BJP will accept it. Congress has a tendency to find negativity in everything,” said Devendra Bhasin, BJP state vice-president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttrakhand-police-transfer-rape-extortion-cases-involving-bjp-mla-to-pauri-garhwal-from-dehradun/story-Tr6cToMmFt5iV43SmKjjCN.html
17-11-2020||India||At Brics, PM Modi calls for holding countries backing terror guilty||As the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping adopted a new counter-terrorism strategy on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for countries that help and support terrorists to be held guilty. Participating in the virtual Brics Summit chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Modi called on members of the grouping to back a move by India and South Africa to secure exemption of Covid-19 vaccines from intellectual property agreements. Multilateralism, Modi said, is facing a crisis and questions are being raised about the functioning of global institutions since they haven’t kept pace with the times and are based on the mindset of 75 years ago. In a tacit reference to Pakistan-backed terrorism, Modi, who was speaking in Hindi, said: “Terrorism is the biggest problem the world is facing today. We must ensure that countries that help and support terrorists are also held guilty and this problem is dealt with in an organised manner.” He described the finalisation of the Brics Counter-Terrorism Strategy as an “important achievement” and said India, as the chair of Brics from next year, will take this work forward. In a subsequent intervention, Modi suggested the national security advisers of Brics states should discuss the formulation of a counter-terrorism action plan. The Brics Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which will allow member states to work out common measures and coordinate more closely at the UN and other forums and promote the implementation of UN’s global counter-terrorism strategy, was adopted at the conclusion of the summit. Also Read: Xi Jinping offers to cooperate with India, BRICS countries to develop Covid-19 vaccineModi’s remarks on terrorism were endorsed by Putin, who said some countries were like the “black sheep of the family” and the world cannot afford any complacency in dealing with problems such as terrorism and the pandemic. With a group of developing nations led by India and South Africa set to urge the World Trade Organization (WTO) this week to waive patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines so that they become accessible to poor countries, Modi said: “India and South Africa have proposed that Covid-19 vaccines and treatments be exempted from intellectual property agreements. We hope that other Brics countries will support this.” Also Read: PM Modi to hold virtual summit with his Luxembourg counterpart on Nov 18He added that India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to benefit humankind. Noting that significant geo-strategic changes taking place around the world will impact security, stability and growth, Modi said Brics will play an important role in tackling these issues. The multilateral system is going through a crisis and questions are being raised about the credibility of global institutions since they haven’t changed with the times and are operating with outdated mindsets, he said. Besides the UN Security Council, reforms are needed in the WTO, IMF and WHO, he added. The Brics countries, with 42% of the global population, will play a key role in post-Covid-19 economic recovery and there is scope to increase mutual trade, Modi said. India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, which aims to make the country self-reliant and resilient, can be a force multiplier for the post-Covid-19 economy and contribute to global supply chains, he added. This was the second time in a week that Modi and President Xi Jinping were on the same virtual platform since the India-China border standoff emerged in the open in May. The theme for the Brics Summit was “Global stability, shared security and innovative growth” and its agenda included global issues such as reforming the multilateral system and measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-brics-pm-modi-calls-for-holding-countries-backing-terror-guilty/story-VAGZxoB6qODcGtmo0GliqO.html

This was the second test of the QRSAM system in five days. The QRSAM test on November 13 achieved a direct hit while the second one on Tuesday proved the performance parameters of the warhead, the statement said. Both tests were carried out against the Banshee target drone that simulates an aircraft. Congratulating the DRDO for the back-to-back successful tests, defence minister Rajnath Singh tweeted, “First launch test on 13th Nov proved the Radar and Missile capabilities with direct hit. Today’s test demonstrated the warhead performance on proximity detection.” The DRDO has carried out a series of weapons tests during the last three months at a time when India and China are locked in a border row in the Ladakh sector.“The radars acquired the target from long range and tracked it till the mission computer automatically launched the missile. Continuous guidance was provided through radar data link. Missile entered the terminal active homing guidance and reached the target close enough for proximity operation of warhead activation,” the statement said. A variety of equipment was deployed to capture the flight data and verify the performance of the missile, officials said. The equipment included radars and telemetry and electro-optical sensors. The test was conducted in the deployment configuration of the weapon system consisting of the launcher, fully automated command and control system, surveillance system and multi-function radars. “The QRSAM weapon system, which can operate on the move, consists of all indigenously-developed subsystems. All objectives of the test were fully met. The launch was carried out in the presence of the users from Indian Army,” the defence ministry said. The key tests recently conducted by India include the supersonic missile-assisted release of torpedo (SMART) to target submarines at long ranges, a new version of the nuclear-capable hypersonic Shaurya missile with a range of 750 km and the anti-radiation missile launch to take down enemy radars and surveillance systems. India is also developing a new class of ultra-modern weapons that can travel six times faster than the speed of sound (Mach 6) and penetrate any missile defence. In early September, the DRDO carried out a successful flight test of the hypersonic technology demonstrator vehicle (HSTDV) for the first time from a launch facility off the Odisha coast. Only the United States, Russia and China have developed technologies to field fast-maneuvering hypersonic missiles that fly at lower altitudes and are extremely hard to track and intercept.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-surface-to-air-missile-shoots-down-aerial-target-in-latest-test/story-XjnHy11SCLkMO7hZ724eHL.html

He also accused the BJP of not letting free and fair polls happen. The SP chief’s statement has come in the wake of his party’s poor show in the bypolls to seven assembly seats in the state. The BJP had bagged six seats while the SP won one. He had earlier too accused the BJP of rigging elections. “The party (BJP) uses rigging as its weapon in elections. In 2022, you will have to cast your votes carefully. The victory of the Samajwadi Party is necessary to save democracy,” the former UP CM said addressing a delegation of weavers at the party’s headquarter here. He said the BJP was deliberately harassing weavers and did not want their progress and prosperity. The BJP government has targeted the weavers by scrapping the electricity rate scheme of 2006, he said, promising more facilities to them once his party comes to power in the state. He alleged that in the present regime, not a single unit of extra power was generated in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-rigs-polls-be-alert-in-2022-polls-akhilesh-yadav-to-people/story-1gWHeYnaH14vOq5lfqrC4J.html

The flight had been diverted to Chennai from its original route of Belgaum to Mysore, but failed to land safely. Officials at the Chennai airport said the incident took place at around 7.51pm when the diverted flight made an emergency landing in Chennai. “The flight was diverted to Chennai due to technical reasons,” the official said on condition of anonymity.“A TruJet aircraft (ATR-72) operating as 2T 543 is an ex-Jet Airways aircraft.

17-11-2020||India||Kerala court rejects senior bureaucrat’s bail plea in gold smuggling case||A local court in Kochi on Tuesday rejected the bail petition of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s former secretary and senior IAS officer M Sivasankar who was arrested in the sensational gold smuggling case.Sivasankar was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on October 28. After rejecting the bail plea the additional sessions court remanded him in judicial custody till November 26. Earlier the court had granted permission to Customs to interrogate him in the jail. The ED has opposed his bail plea saying the investigation was at a crucial stage and bail to him at this juncture will affect the ongoing multi-agency probe. The court witnessed heated arguments for two days.On Monday Sivasankar had submitted an argument note in the court alleging that he was made an accused in the case after he refused to name political leaders as asked by the investigating agency. He also said he was made a political pawn in Centre-State tussle. The ED stoutly denied his charge and said he was using alibis to hide his role in the case. Being a senior official he should have been a role model for others but his actions were not in pursuant with his position, the ED said. The agency also claimed that he intervened to get the baggage that carried 30 kg smuggled gold cleared without Customs check. Sivasankar fell from grace after the smuggling case came to light in July. After main accused Swapna Suresh’s arrest from Bengaluru by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), reports surfaced that he was allegedly close to her and travelled with her during some of the foreign trips. Investigators had also claimed that he was instrumental in getting Suresh a plum post in the state government-controlled Space Park and allegedly helped her take a flat outside the secretariat which was later used by smugglers. Sivasankar maintained that though Suresh was his friend he was not aware of her smuggling activities. Sivasankar was suspended after his alleged links with Suresh surfaced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-court-rejects-senior-bureaucrat-s-bail-plea-in-gold-smuggling-case/story-jjohcUFIogG9jwmWI6OiFL.html

17-11-2020||India||Covid-19 showed our cities are vulnerable, says PM Modi at Bloomberg New Economy Forum||Addressing the Bloomberg New Economy Forum, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic showed the world that cities, which are also growth engines, are the most vulnerable. “Covid-19 has given us an opportunity to reset before restart. Things like community gatherings, sports activities, education & recreations are not the same as before. The biggest question before the entire world is how to restart. A good point to restart now will be rejuvenating urban centres,” PM Modi said.Talking about Covid-19 lockdown, PM Modi said, “Lockdown faced resistance across the world. But Indian cities abided by lockdown rules as the building block of our cities are not concrete but community.” People migrate cities for work. But isn’t it time to make cities work for people, PM Modi said.“Can we not build sustainable cities? It has been our endeavour in India to build urban centres which have the amenities of cities but the spirit of villages. Technologies helped us continue our work during Covid-19 pandemic,” PM Modi said.Sustainable mobility is the key to set up resilient cities, Modi said as he talked about his government’s affordable housing and rental projects, apart from Digital India, Smart Cities projects.“If you are looking to investment in mobility, sustainability, India is the best place. And all these come with a vibrant democracy where the government will leave no stones unturned to make the country investment-friendly,” PM Modi said as he concluded his speech.The inaugural forum was held in Singapore, followed by a second edition in Beijing, covering issues such as global economic management, trade and investment, technology, urbanisation, capital markets, climate change and inclusion. Director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, former US President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and Secretary-General of the United Nations Antonio Guterres are some of the other speakers scheduled to address the forum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-addresses-bloomberg-new-economy-forum-talks-about-covid-19-impact-on-businesses/story-B2NevUu0V5spuFfeUkLjUK.html

In a press statement on Tuesday, Surjewala hits out at Union home minister Amit Shah over asking Congress interim President Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi to clear their stand if they support the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration.Surjewala in the statement in Hindi said, “Congress party is not a part of Gupkar alliance or People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration.”Hitting out at the BJP government in the Centre, the Congress leader said, “To spread lies, fraud and creating new illusions have become the way of the Modi government. It’s a shame that Home Minister Amit Shah is keeping aside the responsibility of the national security and is making false, misleading and mischievous statements on Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.”While asserting that Congress is fighting the DDC elections in Jammu and Kashmir and said, “The Indian National Congress favours democratic elections in Jammu and Kashmir and for this purpose the Congress Party is contesting the District Development Council elections.... in a democratic manner.” आए दिन झूठ बोलना, कपट फैलाना व नए भ्रमजाल गढ़ना मोदी सरकार का चाल-चेहरा-चरित्र बन गया है।शर्म की बात है कि देश के गृहमंत्री श्री अमित शाह राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा की अपनी जिम्मेदारी दरकिनार कर जम्मू, कश्मीर व लद्दाख पर सरासर झूठी, भ्रामक व शरारतपूर्ण बयानबाजी कर रहे हैं!हमारा बयान-: pic.twitter.com/AsX67nFI03Earlier in the day, Amit Shah said that the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration wants foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir and asserted that Indian people will no longer tolerate an “unholy global gathbandhan” against national interest.Taking to Twitter, Shah asked Congress interim President Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi if they support the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration which, he said, insults India’s tricolour.“The Gupkar Gang is going global! They want foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir. The Gupkar Gang also insults India’s Tricolour. Do Sonia Ji and Rahul Ji support such moves of the Gupkar Gang? They should make their stand crystal clear to the people of India,” Shah tweeted. The Gupkar Gang is going global! They want foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir. The Gupkar Gang also insults India’s Tricolour. Do Sonia Ji and Rahul Ji support such moves of the Gupkar Gang ? They should make their stand crystal clear to the people of India.“Congress and the Gupkar Gang want to take J-K back to the era of terror and turmoil. They want to take away rights of Dalits, women and tribals that we have ensured by removing Article 370. This is why they’re being rejected by the people everywhere,” he said in another tweet.“Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will always remain an integral part of India. Indian people will no longer tolerate an unholy ‘global gathbandhan’ against our national interest. Either the Gupkar Gang swims along with the national mood or else the people will sink it,” Shah said.Jammu and Kashmir Congress chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir said that People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration will contest Dist Development Council (DDC) poll and will try to defeat those who have been forcefully implementing laws in Union Territory (UT).Read more | Indians will not tolerate any unholy ‘global gathbandhan’: Amit Shah on Gupkar alliance“Today Farooq Saab (Farooq Abdullah) called the meeting to give final touches to the seat-sharing, and by and large we are satisfied.

17-11-2020||India||Black particles, suspected to be coal, washes up on Goa’s beaches||An unusual black powder and chunks suspected to be coal particles have begun washing up along beaches in Goa leading to speculation that imported coal that is being handled at Mormugao Port was making its way to the state’s beaches. Two separate instances of the dark particles were found -- in South Goa along the Benaulim beach by fishermen and water sports operators as well as in Querim beach in North Goa by environmental campaigner Claude Alvares who held up chunks of a black solid that resembled coal. “We noticed it yesterday for the first time, the black particulate matter that was different from the tar balls,” Pele Fernandes, a water sports operator from Benaulim beach, said. “A few tourists were asking me what it is and I had to say I don’t know even though I suspected it was coal because I feared that they may not visit the beach again,” Fernandes said. Speaking of his find, the Director of Goa Foundation Claude Alvares said that the coal washing up along Goa’s beaches was “only because the loading and unloading operations at MPT are still very primitive.”The news comes even as protests across Goa have intensified against a railway line double tracking that is believed will only be used to transport more coal from the port to the hinterland.At its peak around 12-14 million metric tons of coal was imported from Indonesia and Australia via Mormugao Port which has since reduced to around 9-10 million metric tons of coal this year. The coal is loaded and unloaded from ships in the open air allowing coal dust to be carried away by the wind into the surrounding Vasco da Gama town and into the water bodies including the sea.Earlier, a study published in 2019 by researchers at IIT-Kharagpur and the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa who were studying the presence of mercury in the waters of Goa had found a “dark black powder from the adjacent beaches of the Mandovi river” in which the concentration of mercury in this black powder was found to be 200.5 ± 5.0 microgram per kg, which they said could explain the higher concentration of mercury in the waters of the Mandovi, which was similar to the concentration of mercury in the coal obtained from the Mormugao Port. “The physical appearance of the black powder looked very similar to that of the fine particles of coal. The scanning electron microscope images also support that the black powder was coal particles. However, further investigation is required to identify the sources of this fine black particle associated with high concentration of Hg,” the study noted. The Goa government has publicly pledged to reduce coal imports with chief minister Pramod Sawant assuring that the state will not be allowed to turn into a ‘coal hub’ for import of coal for steel industries in neighbouring states. “I assure you coal import and handling will drop by 50 per cent. We will reduce coal and are in the process of stopping it as soon as possible. We cannot stop it altogether. Industries are on (have been running) for 40 years,” Sawant had said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-particles-suspected-to-be-coal-washes-up-on-goa-s-beaches/story-da9tyj67kwUlfAlS1WJUoL.html

Putin endorses him||As the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping adopted a new counter-terrorism strategy on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for countries that help and support terrorists to be held guilty.Participating in the virtual Brics Summit chaired by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Modi also called on members of the grouping to back a move by India and South Africa to secure exemption of Covid-19 vaccines from intellectual property agreements.Multilateralism, Modi said, is facing a crisis and questions are being raised about the functioning of global institutions since they haven’t kept pace with the times and are based on the mindset of 75 years ago.In a tacit reference to Pakistan-backed terrorism, Modi, who was speaking in Hindi, said: “Terrorism is the biggest problem the world is facing today. We must ensure that countries that help and support terrorists are also held guilty and this problem is dealt with in an organised manner.”He described the finalisation of the Brics Counter-Terrorism Strategy as an “important achievement” and said India, as the chair of Brics from next year, will take this work forward.In a subsequent intervention, Modi suggested the national security advisers of Brics states should discuss the formulation of a counter-terrorism action plan.The Brics Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which will allow member states to work out common measures and coordinate more closely at the UN and other forums and promote the implementation of UN’s global counter-terrorism strategy, was adopted at the conclusion of the summit.Modi’s remarks on terrorism were endorsed by Putin, who said some countries were like the “black sheep of the family” and the world cannot afford any complacency in dealing with problems such as terrorism and the pandemic.With a group of developing nations led by India and South Africa set to urge the World Trade Organization (WTO) this week to waive patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines so that they become accessible to poor countries, Modi said: “India and South Africa have proposed that Covid-19 vaccines and treatments be exempted from intellectual property agreements. We hope that other Brics countries will support this.”With a group of developing nations led by India and South Africa set to urge the World Trade Organization (WTO) this week to waive patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines so that they become accessible to poor countries, Modi said: “India and South Africa have proposed that Covid-19 vaccines and treatments be exempted from intellectual property agreements. We hope that other Brics countries will support this.” He added that India’s vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to benefit humankind.Noting that significant geo-strategic changes taking place around the world will impact security, stability and growth, Modi said Brics will play an important role in tackling these issues. The multilateral system is going through a crisis and questions are being raised about the credibility of global institutions since they haven’t changed with the times and are operating with outdated mindsets, he said. Besides the UN Security Council, reforms are needed in the WTO, IMF and WHO, he added.The Brics countries, with 42% of the global population, will play a key role in post-Covid-19 economic recovery and there is scope to increase mutual trade, Modi said. India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, which aims to make the country self-reliant and resilient, can be a force multiplier for the post-Covid-19 economy and contribute to global supply chains, he added. This was the second time in a week that Modi and President Xi Jinping were on the same virtual platform since the India-China border standoff emerged in the open in May. The theme for the Brics Summit was “Global stability, shared security and innovative growth” and its agenda included global issues such as reforming the multilateral system and measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hold-countries-that-support-terror-guilty-says-pm-modi-putin-endorses-him/story-52GAfJ8jcvcb640GitU79H.html
17-11-2020||India||India may start producing Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V, says Putin||India is set to join the list of nations who are likely to start producing Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine against Covid-19, Russian president Vladmir Putin said on Tuesday. China is also among the countries expected to take up Sputnik V’s production, Putin said. The Russian president has also proposed speeding up of creation of vaccine research centres in BRICS nations – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, news agency Reuters reported quoting TASS. Marking their feat in the league of nations to have come up with Covid-19 vaccines, Russia announced in August that it had registered the world’s first coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V -- named after the Soviet-era satellite. However, Russia registered the vaccine ahead of large-scale clinical trials.The nation had claimed that its vaccine is 92 per cent effective at protecting people from Covid-19 according to interim trial results. results are only the second from a late-stage human trial, following on swiftly from data released by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, which said their shot was also more than 90 per cent effective. While successful vaccines are being eyed by nations across the globe, who have been dealt a blow by the coronavirus pandemic resulting in battered economies, unemployment across nations and over-burdened public health systems, in addition to disruption of daily life cycle, experts have raised their doubts about Russia’s vaccine trial, dubbing the design as sparse, making it hard to interpret the data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-may-start-producing-russia-s-covid-19-vaccine-sputnik-v-says-putin/story-10ExOSDWxUAd5Ku0mQQCDI.html
17-11-2020||India||UP: 1 held after woman dies by suicide alleging police inaction in rape case||The Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday arrested a man for allegedly raping a 19-year-old law student in Bulandshahr a day after she allegedly died by suicide after accusing police of inaction in the case.Bulandshahr’s senior police superintendent, SK Singh, said Kamruddin was arrested from Faridabad on Tuesday morning and raids were on to arrest Abrar and Mobin, the co-accused. He added the investigating officer in the case, sub-inspector Vijay Rathi, has been suspended for failing to thoroughly investigate the case.“He [Rathi] largely remained dependent on mobile locations of the accused on the day of the crime which did not match with the details of the incident. He should have investigated it thoroughly before reaching a conclusion,” Singh said.Circle officer Atul Kumar said different teams were conducting raids in neighbouring villages to arrest the other two accused and hoped that they would be held soon. He said the student’s body was buried after a post-mortem examination amid tight security.Singh earlier said the woman first lodged a complaint of kidnapping, a threat to life, and also recorded a statement in the presence of a magistrate. He added therefore a final report was submitted in the case accordingly.Singh said the woman later lodged another complaint against the accused on October 24, saying one of them telephoned her and thereafter took her to the home of a co-accused, where the three men allegedly raped her. He added during the investigation, the mobile phone location of Kamruddin, a neighbour of the woman, was found in Faridabad at the time of the alleged crime. Singh said he made no call on the woman’s phone. The locations of Abrar and Mobin were found to be in his village and in Aligarh.The woman’s father alleged Kamruddin tried to rape his daughter on October 3 and later apologised to her on phone and on October 16 in person. He alleged Kamruddin, Abrar and Mobin then raped her and they lodged a police complaint on October 24 but no action was taken.In a note purportedly written by the woman, she said she was ending her life to make people believe she was raped. Kamruddin, his friend, Abrar, from a neighbouring village and Mobin, who is from Aligarh district, have been accused of raping her in the note and ruining her life, career and forcing her to kill herself.The woman’s father accused the police of doing nothing when the accused would taunt his daughter. “My daughter was under depression. The accused often taunted her that nothing will happen to them because they can spend money.” The father said he tried his best to convince his daughter to forget everything like a bad dream but she was deeply hurt. “I have lost my daughter and she will never return.” He recalled how his daughter would call Rathi to inquire about the developments in the case and how every time she received only hollow assurances.“She was completely broken and chose to end her life,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-1-held-after-woman-dies-by-suicide-alleging-police-inaction-in-rape-case/story-RgqDiqddVcE4qAPrw2kZVJ.html

17-11-2020||India||Maharashtra: Ex-Union minister Jaysingrao Gaikwad Patil quits BJP||Former Union minister and three-time Parliament member Jaysingrao Gaikwad Patil, 71, quit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday after he was denied a ticket for Maharashtra legislative council elections being held on December 1.A prominent Maratha leader from central Maharashtra, Patil represented Aurangabad graduates’ constituency in the council from 1990 to 1998. He was a minister in the Shiv Sena-BJP government from 1995 to 1999. Patil was later elected as Parliament member from Beed and served as a minister in Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government. He quit the BJP and joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in 2004 and was elected as a Parliament member that year for the third time. He returned to the BJP in 2010.Also read | ‘Those who oppose BJP’s ideology are labelled corrupt and anti-national’: Omar Abdullah“I have been asking for organisational responsibility for more than 10 years, but to no avail.

I have not decided to join any party as of now, but my only aim is to defeat the BJP candidate in the graduates’ constituency. I am supporting NCP candidate Satish Chavan to ensure that he is elected at least by 15,000 votes,” said Patil.A BJP leader called Patil a spent force, who has no base in Marathwada. “The graduates’ constituency needs concentrated efforts of building support among voters for three to four years before elections. He was lacking on that front too. He may join the NCP, but will hardly prove beneficial there too,” the leader said, requesting anonymity.Former minister Eknath Khadse earlier quit the BJP to join the NCP last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-ex-union-minister-jaysingrao-gaikwad-patil-quits-bjp/story-T336BC5dzIxRHkF7oGx4KI.html

17-11-2020||India||We have electoral arrangement, don’t fully endorse Gupkar agenda: Congress||Following sharp criticism by the BJP for joining the Gupkar Alliance, the Jammu and Kashmir unit of the Congress said Tuesday that it has entered into seat sharing arrangements for the upcoming district development council (DDC) polls and doesn’t “fully endorse” the agenda of Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD). Ahead of the DDC elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP has launched a scathing attack on the Gupkar alliance and said that its only agenda was to bring back Article 370. The Congress has hit back on Tuesday and accused the BJP of double standards.“Till the time BJP was sharing power with the PDP and Sajad Lone, it was all fine and they were nationalists. Congress has only entered into seat sharing arrangement with Gupkar Alliance and that doesn’t mean Congress has become part of their agenda,” said Ravinder Sharma, chief spokesperson of the Congress in J&K.Sharma also said that the Congress has rejected any statement that goes against the nation and sentiment of the people.“We don’t fully endorse their agenda but there are certain common issues. We stand for restoration of statehood and protection of land and jobs. We have just entered into an electoral arrangement with them. Why did BJP enter into alliance with PDP and NC and not to forget these parties had been demanding more than Article 370 (autonomy and self rule),” he said. Sharma said that the Congress party also endorses constitutional safeguards but their broader contours and forms can be discussed with sections of society that were denied justice over the years. “We are in favour of justice for Valmikis, Gurkhas and West Pakistan refugees living here for over 70 years,” he added. Sharma also said that the participation of the Gupkar constituents in the DC polls should be welcomed.“We should welcome that they (Gupkar constituents) are contesting the elections, which in turn defeats Pakistan’s proxy war and other ulterior motives in J&K,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-have-electoral-arrangement-don-t-fully-endorse-gupkar-agenda-congress/story-L1VMsxLLsvAkGu9ubUEUPP.html

17-11-2020||India||Bhima Koregaon case: HC asks Maharashtra government to provide Varavara Rao’s medical report to his wife||The Bombay high court has directed Maharashtra to provide details of the examination conducted by the doctors of Nanavati Hospital through video consultation on 81-year-old Telugu poet P Varavara Rao to his wife. The latter has petitioned the court to shift the Bhima Koregaon accused from Taloja jail to Nanavati Hospital. The directions were issued after senior counsel Indira Jaising informed the court that the report provided to them on Tuesday afternoon was incomplete and did not have any details of the tests done on Rao. Jaising added that the one page report provided by the state through WhatsApp had no information regarding dementia and the urinary tract infection which Rao is suffering from. A division bench of justices S S Shinde and Madhav Jamdar, while hearing the plea filed by Rao’s wife P Hemlatha, was informed by Jaising that the state had failed to comply with the court orders passed last week. The court had directed the doctors of Nanavati Hospital, who had previously treated Rao in July while he was admitted there, to conduct a check-up of Rao through video consultation and submit a report on his condition to the court as well as the petitioner and the NIA. Also read | NPRD appeals NHRC’s to intervene for basic amenities to jailed octagenarian activist Stan SwamyJaising submitted that though the tests to be done had to be read in conjunction with the July report, the current report had no mention about Rao’s co-morbidities. She added that the latest report also lacked Rao’s neurology and urology report. Jaising submitted that the state was resorting to delaying tactics and the report submitted on Tuesday was an eyewash. She added that Rao’s condition was critical and he needed to be shifted to the hospital where the doctors could physically assess his condition and conduct all the requisite tests in one go. Saying that Rao’s wife had come to know of his deteriorating health, her petition had sought shifting him to Nanavati Hospital. She had also sought constitution of a medical board to independently examine Rao’s condition. Hemlatha also prayed for the release of Rao on grounds of failing health. The court has directed the state to provide a detailed report to it as well as the petitioner and posted hearing for 11am on Wednesday. Rao was first taken to JJ Hospital on May 28 after he fell unconscious, but was discharged on June 1. The family had alleged that he was discharged in a hurried manner to obstruct his bail plea. The family had then issued a statement, saying, “He was not normal at the time of discharge...later on June 2 it was proved that all this – admission in hospital, getting a normal report, getting him discharged – was part of conspiracy by the police. June 2 was the date of hearing on his bail application on health grounds in the NIA special sessions court and police argued against his bail showing this hospital “normal” report. The judge accepted that and refused bail on June 26.” Rao continued to show signs of delirium and after voices were raised from various quarters Rao was admitted to JJ Hospital again on July 13. Later he was shifted to St George’s Hospital after he tested positive for Covid-19.The National Human Rights Commission also intervened and issued notices to the Maharashtra government, asking it to ensure Rao is taken care of and adequate medical facilities are arranged. It had also asked for a report on his health.The commission had observed that the right to life and medical care is one of the basic human rights and the state is duty bound to provide the same to a prisoner as well. Maharashtra state was directed to constitute a medical board to examine Rao’s health, provide him the best possible treatment and bear the cost for the same. Rao was then moved to Nanavati Hospital for treatment.

However, on October 13 it was removed from the list of such facilities, in view of its low occupancy.With the capital city now under the third wave of the spread of Covid-19, the hospital is likely to be converted into a dedicated facility once again, sources said. North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash on Tuesday afternoon inspected the hospital and took stock of the situation there.Read more | Covid-19: Delhi looks to withdraw relaxation on wedding attendees, shut markets emerging as hotspotsThe Centre after a high-level meeting here recently had announced a slew of steps, including making available 300 additional ICU beds, doubling the number of daily RT-PCR tests and a house-to-house survey in the national capital, to check the spiralling numbers of cases in Delhi.Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said that some of the hospitals under the municipal corporations of Delhi will be converted into dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needed to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh Covid-19 cases per day, taking into account winter-related respiratory problems, a large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.Delhi recorded 3,797 fresh Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.89 lakh, even as 99 new fatalities pushed the toll to 7,713, authorities said. The highest single-day spike till date here -- 8,593 cases -- was recorded on November 11 when 85 fatalities were also recorded. Delhi has witnessed a spurt in coronavirus cases since October 28 when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on Wednesday.

The figure is likely to improve further as spot admissions are scheduled to continue till November 20. In comparison, the 490-odd private ITIs in the state have 66 per cent of the 77,184 seats going vacant with many of the private ITIs reporting 90-95 per cent vacancy.Officials said the dwindling vacancies in the government ITIs are a far cry from what it was 5 years ago when around 6700 seats remained vacant. “We never had it so good. Had the Covid pandemic not happened, we would have filled up all the seats this year. The increased enrolment is a testament of the quality of education and placement opportunities being provided in government ITIs. Government ITIs have now better infrastructure in terms of labs and well-qualified teachers. The buildings no longer look drab and the ITI students have their own uniform designed by National Institute of Fashion Design,” said Reghu G, director of department of technical education and training.Though the uptick in government ITI admission has been happening due to the improved quality of education and infrastructure, the placing of 7 government ITIs from the state among the 100 top ITIs of the country in the list drawn up by Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship recently may have been a factor in pushing the enrolment despite the pandemic-induced slowdown. Apart from the 7 government ITIs, 4 private ITIs of Odisha too featured in the top 100 ITI list.Rashmita Panda, chief executive of Odisha Skill Development Authority, that provides all-round direction to various skill development initiatives of the state government, said counselling in high schools by government ITIs may have been one reason in the surge of admission. “Teachers from many of the government ITIs go to local schools to motivate the students to join ITI. While governments ITIs have been canvassing in schools to get newer students, private ITIs have not been that aggressive. Another programme named Sudakshya that made ITI education free for girls too has pushed enrolment of girls from 6 per cent 3 years ago to 18 per cent now. All the ITIs barring five have separate hostels for girl students,” said Panda. Scholarships for children of construction workers also led to increase in enrolment.The buzz around the government ITIs began in 2016 when the government started Skilled in Odisha Mission to provide skilled hands to the manufacturing ecosystem of the country. “ITIs in Odisha had not many takers as students enrolled in ITIs if they could not do anything worthwhile after college. There was an information asymmetry. Though people in a few districts knew there is an ITI around, most people – parents, teachers, district officials had no idea what happened in there. Empowering the ITIs and unleashing their true potential made common sense,” said Ajay Panda, deputy director of DTET.To build up the brand ITI, the government signed up with Tata Strive, a Mumbai-based Trust to impart training on communication and other life skill to the students for increasing employability. More than 200 teachers from 49 government ITIs were sent to ITEEs in Singapore for training on knowledge, skills, innovations and best practices. Temasek Foundation International supported this training programme.While persuading teenagers in villages and towns to enroll in ITIs was one part of the task, increased placement through central placement cell as well as at the level of individual ITIs, has also been a factor. Of all the students who are passing out of government ITIs, anything between 17-18 per cent are managing to get placed. Individual ITIs like Berhampur ITI are reporting even higher placement. This year despite the pandemic-induced slowdown, 1346 students have been placed in different companies. To encourage entrepreneurship among the students, the government has started Nano-Unicorn funding under which each of the selected student gets Rs 1 lakh assistance to start their own project which they have to return without any interestOwners of private ITI said the fall in enrolment in non-government ITIs was due to faulty policies of government than anything else. “Though Covid has taken a toll on admission this year, the government has refused to extend the benefits of Sudakshya scheme to girl students of private ITIs. Had that happened, many girl students who wanted to take admission could have taken admission in our ITIs. Besides, there is much uncertainty over the examination as the final exam scheduled in July has not happened due to Covid,” said Arun Kumar Nayak, president of State Pvt ITI Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-odisha-govt-itis-log-highest-ever-enrolment-amid-covid-19-pvt-ones-lag-behind/story-HBB0SsS1tvWjF4oy1uEyzI.html

The injured driver was rushed to the hospital where he is being treated. According to the police, the private security guard at AAP leader Deepak Bali’s residence shot at the car driver, injuring him when he rammed his car into the house, breaking the main gate. “CCTV footage shows that a car came straight and rammed into my residence after breaking the main gate. The driver in an attempt to flee took the car in reverse gear. This incident stunned my private guard and he tried to stop him while going back, but the driver refused. I failed to understand what the car driver’s motive was. Police are investigating the case,” Deepak Bali, AAP leader and a local businessman in Kashipur, said. Satish Kapri, senior sub-inspector at Kashipur police station said Bali’s private security guard Bhupendra was stunned by the sudden incident and tried to stop the car’s driver.

Patra lost the election to BJD’s Pinaki Mishra.Soon after a video clip of her statement went viral on social media, both BJD and Congress leaders trained their guns on her. Niranjan Patnaik, Congress chief in Odisha said Samantasinghar’s remark reeked of BJP’s arrogance. “Not just have they insulted the abode of Lord Jagannath, but it seems the BJP leaders have started imagining themselves as God,” he said.Senior BJD leader Arup Patnaik said Samantsinghar has probably gone insane. “As the son of Delanga (in Puri district), I take strong objection to her remarks that people did not know about Puri before Sambit Patra’s arrival as a candidate in the 2019 polls. I condemn this as an individual from Puri District. It’s outrageous for me and many others to see the lady making disparaging remarks on our Jagannath Dham. We Odias have become a soft target,” said Patnaik.BJD MP Amar Patnaik said the BJP spokesperson’s statement was an insult to Odisha and the land of Jagannath, the Lord of the Universe. “Even a 3-year-old child knows where Puri is, the humble abode of Lord Jagannath. Make no mistake, he is the lord of Kolkata as well,” he said.Faced with the blowback, the BJP launched a firefighting operation to defend Samantsinghar. Samir Mohanty, head of the BJP unit in Odisha said Samantsinghar was being quoted out of context.“She spoke about Puri in the context of Vocal for Local issue. While Pipili is known for its applique work, there are other products in the districts that need to be popularised. All that she meant was that Sambit Patra would take the lead in popularising those products,” Mohanty said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-bjp-member-claims-sambit-patra-made-puri-famous-stirs-hornets-nest/story-TzMXFEA0NOrdkCKoBT6uyM.html

He said that anyone who opposes the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) ideology is labelled corrupt and anti-national.“We are not a “gang” Amit Shah ji, we are a legitimate political alliance having fought & continuing to fight elections, much to your disappointment,” Omar said on Twitter.In a series of tweets, Shah had on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the newly-formed PAGD by saying that either the alliance gets with the national mood or else people will sink it. The home minister had accused the alliance of insulting India’s Tricolour and that it was trying to bring back the era of terror and turmoil in Jammu and Kashmir.“Only in J&K can leaders be detained & called anti-national for participating in elections & supporting the democratic process. The truth is all those who oppose the ideology of the BJP are labelled “corrupt & anti-national”,” Omar, also vice president of the National Conference, said in a subsequent tweet.Omar said BJP’s failed agenda to have a free run in the upcoming local body elections in the state is the root cause of the frustration behind Shah’s remarks. “I can understand the frustration behind this attack by the Hon’ble Home Minister. He had been briefed that the People’s Alliance was preparing to boycott elections. This would have allowed the BJP & newly formed King’s party a free run in J&K. We didn’t oblige them,” Omar added.Not only Omar, but Shah’s recent comments on the alliance did not go down well with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Mehbooba Mufti, who reacted sharply as well.“Old habits die hard. Earlier BJPs narrative was that the tukde tukde gang threatened India’s sovereignty & they are now using ‘Gupkar Gang’ euphemism to project us as anti nationals.

17-11-2020||India||Citing illegal encroachments, Assam student body starts indefinite economic blockade of Nagaland||Several organisations in Assam’s Karbi Anglong district have started an indefinite economic blockade of Nagaland from Tuesday citing alleged illegal encroachments by the neighbouring state. Led by Karbi Students Association (KSA), the organisations blocked NH 39 from 8am. Several trucks carrying goods and other commercial vehicles have been stranded because of the blockade. There are allegations that Nagaland authorities have issued land certificates to people in areas falling in the Daldali forest reserve under Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council (KAAC) in Assam. Authorities in Assam also allege that border pillars demarcating the 512 km-long boundary between the two states have been removed by people from Nagaland in order to encroach on Assam territory. “Encroachment of Assam territory has been going on for many years, but the state government has failed to stop it. Hence, we have decided to impose the indefinite economic blockade against it,” KSA president Bijoy Bey told journalists on Sunday. “We demand that both the state governments talk and find a permanent solution to the border dispute. Houses constructed on Assam soil should be vacated, land certificates issued by Nagaland government should be cancelled and border pillars should be reinstalled in the original spots,” he added. District police officials said that though the protesters have blocked movement of commercial vehicles, private vehicles have been allowed to ply without restrictions. No violence was reported from the protest sites. “Normal movement of private vehicles hasn’t been affected and protesters have blocked vehicles carrying goods. Border disputes between both the states can be resolved only by the Centre or through the Supreme Court where a case is pending. Our job is to maintain peace and ensure law and order,” said Debojit Deuri, superintendent of police, Karbi Anglong. On Monday, members of Assam’s Adivasi Students Union (ASU) had blocked the road leading to Nagaland’s Mokokchung alleging encroachment by the Naga side. The blockade was lifted in the evening. Assam’s leading student body, All Assam Students Union (AASU), had on Sunday threatened to block roads to Nagaland in protest against alleged encroachment of Dissoi Valley reserve forest in Assam’s Jorhat district. The present border row between the two states comes on the heels of a month-long dispute between Assam and Mizoram which resulted in two road blockades. The situation along the Assam-Mizoram boundary is now returning to normal following intervention of the union home ministry. Nagaland and Assam share a 434 km boundary and a dispute that’s going on for over five decades.

During Diwali, it was seen many that people were not wearing masks and violating social distancing norms due to which the coronavirus spread very much, he said. “I hope the crowd in the markets will thin out and there will be no need to lock them down. “However, if violations of mask wearing and social distancing are witnessed and there is chance of these markets becoming local coronavirus hotspots, these could be shut down as a preventive measure for some days, said Kejriwal. On Monday, Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said there was no chance of reimposition of lockdown in the national capital since the third wave of the coronavirus has peaked out in the city. Jain had also said the virus cannot be contained through lockdown and that people should protect themselves by wearing face masks.

Only the capital city of Dehradun reported a dip of 14.2% in air quality index this year. The pollution control board monitored air quality during Diwali in five major cities of Dehradun, Rishikesh, Kashipur, Haridwar and Haldwani. The board monitored indices like PM 2.5, PM 10, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. SP Subudhi, member secretary of the Uttarakhand Pollution Control Board said, “Except Dehradun, all other cities have shown improvement in air quality this year on Diwali when compared to last year, even if it was marginal. In Dehradun, the air quality dipped by 14.2% with an increase in PM 2.5 and PM 10. From our analysis, we understand that the increase in the level of air pollution in Dehradun is due to the bursting of crackers.” The data released by the pollution control board states that this year the air quality improved by 39% in Rishikesh, 15.4% in Kashipur and around 2% in Haldwani and Haridwar compared to last year on Diwali day. “The improvement of air quality in other cities shows the seriousness of citizens towards an important issue like air pollution. In Haridwar, levels of only PM 10 had increased this year, which can be traced to dust from road construction and development activities underway in the area,” added Subudhi. According to records, the cumulative air quality index of all five cities this year was registered to be 296 (poor category) compared to 326 last year, with an improvement of around 9.5%. In Dehradun, the two-hour limit fixed by the Uttarakhand government for the bursting of firecrackers on Diwali went up in smoke, with people bursting crackers from evening till the wee hours of Sunday. In an order issued on November 11, the state government had allowed sale and bursting of only green crackers from 8 pm to 10 pm in six cities -- Dehradun, Haridwar, Kashipur, Rudrapur, Rishikesh and Haldwani. It has allowed bursting of green crackers from 6 am to 8 am on Chhat Puja on November 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-quality-improves-in-4-out-of-5-uttarakhand-cities-this-diwali-compared-to-last-year/story-LDzp21XBYsqfgkDJsI8PJM.html

They want to take away rights of Dalits, women and tribals that we have ensured by removing Article 370. This is why they’re being rejected by people everywhere.”In a separate tweet, he said J&K has been, is, and will always remain an integral part of India. “...Indian people will no longer tolerate any unholy ‘global gathbandhan’ against our national interest.

He also said that the Jammu and Kashmir will always be an integral part of India.“Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will always remain an integral part of India. Indian people will no longer tolerate an unholy ‘global gathbandhan’ against our national interest. Either the Gupkar Gang swims along with the national mood or else the people will sink it,” Shah said in one of the tweets. Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will always remain an integral part of India. Indian people will no longer tolerate an unholy ‘global gathbandhan’ against our national interest. Either the Gupkar Gang swims along with the national mood or else the people will sink it.The home minister said PAGD was trying to go global and seek intervention in Jammu and Kashmir from foreign forces. “The Gupkar Gang is going global! They want foreign forces to intervene in Jammu and Kashmir,” Shah said. He also dragged Congress in his attack as he questioned what the grand old party’s stand was. “The Gupkar Gang also insults India’s Tricolour. Do Sonia Ji and Rahul Ji support such moves of the Gupkar Gang ? They should make their stand crystal clear to the people of India,” Shah asked. Congress, after attending Gupkar alliance meeting a few days ago, had announced that it supports the alliance and will fight the BJP on all fronts in the upcoming council polls in Jammu and Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir has been, is and will always remain an integral part of India. Indian people will no longer tolerate an unholy ‘global gathbandhan’ against our national interest. Either the Gupkar Gang swims along with the national mood or else the people will sink it.The PAGD is a political alliance between multiple regional political parties of Jammu and Kashmir and has vowed to restore Article 370 in the state.Shah accused them of trying to bring back the era of terror in Jammu and Kashmir. “Congress and the Gupkar Gang want to take J&K back to the era of terror and turmoil. They want to take away rights of Dalits, women and tribals that we have ensured by removing Article 370. This is why they’re being rejected by the people everywhere,” Shah wrote on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-gupkar-gang-want-to-take-j-k-back-to-era-of-terror-amit-shah/story-lQbtkunQ5EWEROvYLq94dJ.html

If passed, it will perhaps be the first such law in the country.“Making preparations to introduce Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Bill, 2020, in Assembly. It will provide for five years of rigorous imprisonment. We’re also proposing that such crimes be declared a cognisable and non-bailable offence,” news agency ANI quoted Mishra as saying.“There will be provision to declare marriages taking place forcefully, out of fraud or by tempting someone for religious conversion as null and void. Those assisting in committing this crime will also be considered a party to it,” the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader further said. There will be provision to declare marriages taking place forcefully, out of fraud or by tempting someone, for religious conversion, null and void. Those assisting in committing this crime will also be considered a party to the crime: Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra https://t.co/zubI4ePO6kMishra added that under the proposed law, the parents/siblings of a person who has been forcibly converted will have to mandatorily file a complaint for action. “Religious leader who is converting the person will have to inform the District Magistrate one month in advance. We’ll introduce this bill in the next session,” he said.Earlier this month, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, too, had backed a potential law against forced inter-faith marriages, saying his government would bring a strict law to counter the alleged practice.Such marriages are called ‘love jihad’ by right-wing activists to describe, what they allege, are instances of Muslim youths, pretending to be in love with Hindu girls and, upon marriage, forcibly converting them to Islam. The demand for a strict law against this alleged practice picked up steam after the murder last month of Nikita Tomar in Haryana’s Ballabhgarh.In the wake of the incident, several BJP-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka had suggested they would bring laws to curb such instances.However, earlier this year, the central government, where, just like the aforementioned states, the BJP is in power, had rejected the idea, saying that neither was such a term defined in law nor had any such case been reported by any of the central agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-year-imprisonment-non-bailable-offence-madhya-pradesh-to-bring-law-against-forced-inter-faith-marriages/story-JWG6DxoI8sbg7X3i7JC29L.html

However, the trains were not operating since March 19 this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.The Mumbai-Ahmedabad Tejas Express resumed operations from October 17 and only 25 to 40 percent out of the total 736 seats were occupied as against 50-80 percent before the spread of coronavirus.IRCTC, a subsidiary of the Indian Railways, is the first corporate entity to run the Tejas Express services, according to Mint. The entity had released guidelines for how these trains were to function-- every alternate seat on the two trains will be kept vacant to ensure social distancing and passengers will be thermally screened before entering the coach and not allowed to exchange their seats once seated -- the guidelines said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/irctc-cancels-lucknow-delhi-and-mumbai-ahmedabad-tejas-express/story-VUz9ttKZ1TlxnBJsiIDppI.html
17-11-2020||India||India not ‘expansionist’, believes in welfare of world: Nitin Gadkari||Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said India is not an “expansionist” country and it only believes in the welfare of the world.Addressing an event in Pune via video-conferencing, Gadkari said to achieve self-reliance, there is a need for knowledge, entrepreneurship, science, technology, research and successful practices.“...while taking the country on the path of development, we need to emphasise on scientific advancement.We need to acquire the number one position on the basis of knowledge to make our country a world power,” he said.“But while doing this, we are not expansionist. There are some countries, which are driven by expansionist desires, but we believe in the welfare of the world. We believe in ‘Vasudev Kutumbakam (the world is one family),” said Gadkari.He said the speech given by Swami Vivekanand in Chicago is our inspiration.Stressing the need to make education available for everyone, he said “it should reach the last man standing”.“But, at the same time, we need to ensure that quality education is provided,” he added. Gadkari said knowledge -as power- should not be the only goal and thrust should be given on imparting value-based education to create ideal citizens.To become “atmanirbhar” (self-reliant), there is a need to lower imports and increase exports, said Gadkari, who is also the minister for Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).“In my department, I am collating the information about things that are imported. I appeal to everyone that we need to produce import-substitute things,” he said.Speaking about self-reliance in education, Gadkari said universities should be upgraded in the country so that people will not need to go abroad for education.“We have all the capabilities to create world-class universities and we can do that, the only thing needed is willpower and ambition,” he said.The minister rued the fact that the pace of development of people working selflessly in elevating the standards of education is slow, but on the other hand, those who have done commercialisation of education, their pace of progress is faster.“The pace of the progress of people who have done commercialisation is equal to (that of) bullet train, but those who are doing selfless work in education, they are moving at the pace of a passenger train,” he said.The event was organised by the Maharashtra Education Society, which runs several educational institutions in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-not-expansionist-believes-in-welfare-of-world-nitin-gadkari/story-JeJaiATZGH77Zp5OeRUggK.html

17-11-2020||India||Congress panel meeting today to discuss organisational matters||A special committee of the Congress formed to assist party chief Sonia Gandhi on operational matters is expected to meet later Tuesday to discuss organisational issues amid rumblings over its dismal show in the Bihar elections. The six-member panel was formed by Gandhi in August this year as part of the party reshuffle carried out after a group of 23 leaders wrote a letter to her seeking internal elections and organisational overhaul. The panel comprises AK Antony, Ahmed Patel, Ambika Soni, Mukul Wasnik, KC Venugopal and Randeep Singh Surjewala. The meeting will be held through video-conferencing at 5pm. While Patel is in the intensive care unit of the Medanta hospital in Gurugram after having tested positive for Covid-19, Venugopal, whose mother passed away recently, is likely to join the meeting. The Congress president and Rahul Gandhi are not attending the meeting. A panel member said Bihar is not on the agenda as the committee is likely to discuss organisational matters and also review the progress on the party’s nationwide signature campaign against the three new farm laws enacted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government recently. The Congress had launched a two-month-long nationwide agitation against the government over the farm laws from September 24 onwards. The party had also then said that it will collect 20 million signatures from protesting farmers against the legislations to be submitted to President Ram Nath Kovind. The Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, had been passed by both the Houses of Parliament. It was widely expected that the meeting will discuss the Bihar poll outcome after the Congress’ dismal show triggered a war of words within the party. While senior leader and former union minister Kapil Sibal had asked the leadership if it the Bihar loss was “business as usual”, he was countered by Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot who claimed that his remarks have “hurt the sentiments” of workers and reminding him that the party had been through crisis several times in the past. The Congress party’s performance has widely been held responsible for the failure of the ‘mahagathbandhan’ to oust the National Democratic Alliance government in the recent assembly elections in Bihar. It has also prompted renewed calls within the party for introspection and course correction. Sibal, a former union minister and one of the 23 signatories to a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in August this year seeking internal elections and organisational overhaul, questioned the leadership in the wake of the Bihar debacle. “We are yet to hear on recent polls... Maybe Congress leadership thinks it should be business as usual,” he tweeted. Sibal further said he was “compelled to speak publicly” as there is “no forum in the party to discuss party issues” and insisted that the Congress needs efficient and senior leaders to manage elections. Gehlot countered Sibal with a series of tweets and defended the leadership, saying there are various reasons for electoral setbacks and that the Congress will come out stronger from the present crisis as had happened in the past as well. “There was no need for Mr Kapil Sibal to mention our internal issue in media, this has hurt the sentiments of party workers across the country,” he said. “Congress has seen various crises, including 1969, 1977, 1989 and later in 1996, but every time, we came out stronger due to our ideology, programmes, policies and firm belief in party leadership,” the Rajasthan chief minister added. The Congress proved to be the weakest link in the ‘mahagathbandhan’, winning just 19 of the 70 seats it contested. While the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) won 75 seats and emerged as the single largest party in the 243-assembly, the Left parties bagged 16 of the 29 they fought as part of the Grand Alliance. “We have improved with each and every crisis and also formed UPA government in 2004 under the able leadership of Soniaji, we shall overcome this time too. There are various reasons for electoral losses. But each time rank and file of the Congress party has shown undivided and firm belief in the party leadership and that is why we came out of it stronger and united after every crises,” Gehlot said. “Even today, Congress is the only party which can keep this nation united and take it forward on the path of comprehensive development,” he added. Sibal also came under attack from Youth Congress president Srinivas BV. “When Congress wins elections, Rahulji never gets the credit. And we lose, he is made responsible. I want to ask those who are raising questions today what is their contribution to the party?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-panel-meeting-today-to-discuss-organisational-matters/story-VWEdlbqw1OjYwMBHaaVTkM.html
17-11-2020||India||‘Shiv Sena will always come forward wielding sword of Hindutva when country calls’: Sanjay Raut||The war of words between two former allies - Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - continues. Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said that his party will come wielding the sword of Hindutva whenever the country needs it.Raut also said that his party was and will always be Hindutvawadi. “We don’t need to get our Hindutva certified from any party. We were, we are and we will always be Hindutvawadi. We don’t play Hindutva politics like them. Whenever the country needs us, Shiv Sena will always come forward wielding the sword of Hindutva,” the Shiv Sena leader said, as quoted by ANI.This isn’t the first time Raut has hit out at the BJP on Hindutava. After the Maharashtra government announced the reopening of religious places in the state from November 16, the BJP had called the move a victory of Hindutva.“This is not a victory or defeat of anybody,” Raut had said on Sunday. The Shiv Sena leader slammed the party by reminding them that they were shut down on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s instructions.“The lockdown was imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the decision to shut the temples was also taken by him. So there is no reason for BJP to take credit for the victory of Hindutva in this matter. I believe that the Prime Minister will have to tell the meaning of victory and defeat to such people,” he added.Raut had also pushed for the SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) announced by the Centre to be followed firmly as places of worship reopen. “The SOPs drafted by the government need to be followed strictly. There is no need to take credit. It was God’s will that people stay at home, and now it is God’s will that places of worship reopen with precautions,” Raut said.All the religious places in Maharashtra reopened for devotees from Monday after being shut for several months due coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-will-always-come-forward-wielding-sword-of-hindutava-when-country-calls-sanjay-raut/story-t66nM3cPAuLegqNM4v8QqM.html

The feast of the 16th century Spanish Jesuit who is revered as Goencho Saib (Lord of Goa) in Goa, where his sacred relics remain is celebrated annually on December 3, and draws thousands of devotees from across the state and beyond. “While people from every nook and corner of Goa would traditionally converge at Old Goa for the Saibachem Novena and Fest, Covid-19 has reversed the tide this year and the liturgy will now be celebrated in every parish, chapel and institution in Goa, in India and all over the world,” Fr Patricio Fernandes the Rector of the Basilica of Bom Jesus where the feast is celebrated, has said. Instead the Masses will be telecast live for those wishing to attend in a virtual mode. Veneration of the relics will however be allowed and has already begun. “Since it’s not possible to congregate because of MHA restrictions, veneration of the Relic will be allowed… The MHA guidelines also do not allow garlands, candles, water bottles, touching and kissing of statues, holy water fonts, etc.. Dress code will be implemented while entering the premises,” the church said in a statement. Trial runs for the entry and facilitation of devotees have already been conducted. Despite the Ministry of Home Affairs and the state government permitting the reopening of places of religious worship from July onwards, Churches in Goa have begun reopening only from October onwards with many yet to reopen owing to the risks associated with large gatherings that usually accompany religious ceremonies. “We need to recognise in all these realities a God-given opportunity to reflect deeply on the way we relate with God, with fellow human beings and with nature,” Goa Archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrão said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-s-famous-annual-feast-of-st-francis-xavier-to-go-online-this-year-amid-covid-19/story-H3KBpy22t0ztcVxzScf6RO.html

17-11-2020||India||RJD leader who criticised Rahul Gandhi has a theory why Sushil Modi isn’t Dy CM||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Shivanand Tiwari on Tuesday said that Sushil Kumar Modi was “cut off” from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) because he was not letting other leaders rise and was hungry for media attention.“Sushil Modi’s role had become less of BJP’s and more of Nitish Kumar’s associate. I think that’s why BJP cut him off this time. He wasn’t allowing other BJP leaders to rise. He used to speak on all topics daily and couldn’t live without appearing in newspaper/TV,” Tiwari told news agency ANI.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushil Modi was dropped from Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s cabinet and replaced as deputy chief minister by his party, after having served at the post since 2005. Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi have been chosen as the deputy CMs for the state.“I have no animosity with him, he is like my younger brother. But his personality used to reflect a lack of depth. I think this is the reason BJP leadership did not give him a post in the state cabinet this time,” Shivanand Tiwari added.The Rashtriya Janata Dal leader had set up a huge controversy this week when he appeared to blame the Congress for the grand alliance’s defeat in the just-concluded Bihar elections. Tiwari had targeted Rahul Gandhi who he had claimed had adopted a hands-off approach and addressed just three public meetings in the run-up to the election. His party later distanced itself from the criticism of the Congress, the RJD’s alliance partner for many years, insisting that Tiwari had expressed a personal view, which did not reflect the party’s assessment.NDA secured a majority in the election to the 243-member Bihar Assembly by winning 125 seats out of which BJP won 74 seats and the JD(U) won 43 seats. On Monday, JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar, in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda, took oath as the chief minister for the fourth consecutive term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushil-modi-cut-off-as-he-wasn-t-allowing-other-bjp-leaders-to-rise-rjd-s-shivanand-tiwari/story-TdAFrnbV4lcYAm940og1hL.html

17-11-2020||India||Man held for trying to sell leopard hide in Bhubaneswar, 15th such seizure this year||The Special Task Force of the Odisha CID on Tuesday arrested a man while he was trying to sell a leopard hide to another person in Bhubaneswar adding one more case to the rising number of trade in wildlife derivatives in the state.STF Deputy Inspector General of Police, Jainarayan Pankaj, said the cops had arrested a driver named Prasant Nayak while he was trying to sell the leopard skin to a person at Baramunda in the city. The STF seized the leopard hide from the side box of his motorcycle. Nayak hailed from Karanjia area, not very far from the Similipal Tiger Reserve in Mayurbhanj district that has a sizeable population of leopards.Leopards enjoy the same level of protection as tigers under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, but they are regularly poached for their skins and other body parts. Leopard skins are used for home decoration or to make luxury carpets.Data compiled by the forest department and STF officials showed that 2020 has turned out to be the worst-possible year for leopards with at least 15 seizures of hides from poachers across the state. In June this year, STF officials had seized 4 leopard skins in two separate cases and arrested several people including a college lecturer who was out to make quick money.Similarly, in Nuapada district, a mother and her minor son were arrested in September this year while trying to sell a leopard hide, its head as well as boar meat. The same month, 3 leopard skins were sized by forest officials in Nabarangpur district.Wildlife activists alleged that though the forest department has been seizing 8 to 9 leopard hides every year, this year the numbers have gone up due to seizures made by STF. “Poachers have become fearless due to weak investigation by law enforcement agencies. The number of poaching cases may be higher as many have gone unreported,” alleged Biswajit Mohanty, secretary of the Wildlife Society of Orissa. According to WSO, more than 160 leopards have been poached in the last 10 years.Raising concerns over the leopard skin trade in the state, the National Tiger Conservation Authority last year had sent a notice to the Chief Wildlife Warden of Odisha seeking action taken for the protection of leopards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-held-for-trying-to-sell-leopard-hide-in-bhubaneswar-15th-such-seizure-this-year/story-39l3RpMnlQFSx7gZscWsHM.html

In September, SAD went against the NDA over three new agriculture sector reform laws enacted - Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Service Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Later, SAD MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal also resigned from the Union cabinet. What is the history of SAD’s alliance with the BJP? BJP’s alliance with SAD in Punjab dates back to 1992. As per the seat-sharing formula settled between the allies over the years, the SAD being the senior partner used to contest on around 94 seats and the BJP on 23. Out of the 13 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab, SAD used to field candidates in 10 constituencies and the BJP on three. In 2017 Assembly polls, Congress won an absolute majority in the state by winning 77 seats and ousted the SAD-BJP government after 10 years. The SAD-BJP performed poorly in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls as they won 2 seats each while Congress bagged 8 seats in Punjab.

Therefore, the recommendations and road map will be prepared in view of this. The aim is to bring agricultural education to a zone where it can address contemporary and future needs,” said a government official.Apart from making the course structure more flexible, more inter-disciplinary activity and providing impetus to research are the areas that the committee is looking at.Dr R C Agarwal, Deputy Director General (Education) at ICAR, who is the convenor of the committee, when contacted, confirmed that the panel was looking at ways to bring agri-education in sync with the spirit of the NEP.Significantly, the NEP also envisages that the professional councils, such as the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) will act as Professional Standard Setting Bodies (PSSBs) and shall be member of the General Education Council (GEC) to frame expected learning outcomes for higher education.The ICAR-Agricultural University (AU) system through its network of 74 universities offers degree courses at the undergraduate level in 11 disciplines. The PG programmes in 96 disciplines and Ph.D. programmes in 73 disciplines make it multi-disciplinary as desired by NEP, said the official cited above.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icar-looks-at-bringing-agri-education-in-sync-with-national-education-policy/story-NKyTiyTmBzJC1wLrUVsCqI.html

17-11-2020||India||Air quality improves over NW India, winter chill to set in||Light snowfall and rain is likely over the Western Himalayas, including Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and upper reaches of Uttarakhand between November 18 and 20 under the influence of a western disturbance which brought widespread rain and snow to the region on Sunday. This will lead to a gradual fall in minimum temperatures across northwest India by 2 to 4 degree C this week according to India Meteorological Department (IMD).Due to widespread rain and strong winds on Sunday in the northwestern region, air quality has improved to “satisfactory” category in Alwar, Ambala, Amritsar, Baghpat, Ballabgarh, Hapur, Hisar, Karnal, Panipat today. Delhi and Noida recorded “moderate” air quality. Also read | Winter is here: Delhi records season’s lowest maximum temperature“We are seeing substantial improvement in air quality across the northwest region due to favourable meteorological conditions which has helped in dispersing Diwali pollution,” said Vijay Soni, scientist at IMD’s air quality division.The impact of the WD has started reducing. It is presently lying as a cyclonic circulation over north Pakistan and neighborhood.“There was snowfall at many places over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and over Uttarakhand on Sunday. Rain and thundershowers occurred over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh and some places over north Rajasthan. Today the winds are easterly but they will shift to north-westerly from Tuesday. So cold winds will be blowing from the Western Himalayas where snowfall has just happened. We are expecting minimum temperature to drop under 10 degree C in the next couple of days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. The change in wind direction to northwesterly will lead to a fall in minimum temperature on Wednesday temporarily. The minimum temperature is likely to rise again as a fresh feeble western disturbance is likely to impact the region on November 18.“A feeble WD is again likely to impact higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh on November 18. So, the minimum temperature will drop on November 16 and 17 but rise again on November 18 before falling substantially after that. The current active western disturbance coincided with Diwali which brought great relief from air pollution to the entire northwest India,” added RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-quality-improves-over-nw-india-winter-chill-to-set-in/story-JUwgC2K5qi0gSCERDgh1FN.html
17-11-2020||India||Deadline set for digital media firms to reduce foreign investment||News websites and other digital platforms providing news and current affairs with foreign investment beyond the permitted 26% of equity have been given till October 21 to reduce this, according to a notice by the information and broadcasting ministry. They, and other entities with foreign investment even up to the permitted limit have been asked by the ministry to provide details of their ownership patterns within a month. The norms also apply to entities involved in uploading or streaming of news and current affairs through digital platforms. The details on ownership sought to include names and addresses of promoters, directors, significant beneficial owners, and shareholders. The companies have been asked to provide confirmation on compliance with pricing, documentation and reporting requirements under the FDI Policy, Foreign Exchange Management (Non-debt Instruments) Rules, 2019 and Foreign Exchange Management (Mode of Payment and Reporting of Non-debt Instruments) Regulations, 2019. “The decision to keep it to 26% is also linked to concerns about the kind of content including on various digital media including social media. There is a view that there is need to ensure that the control on media should not be entirely in foreign hands. It can be a perceptional matter. However, as such details are not a secret, I don’t see any problem with entities sharing it,” former I&B secretary Uday Kumar Varma said. The ministry has also sought the Permanent Account Number and the latest audited or unaudited profit and loss statement and balance sheet along with the auditor report. Every entity has to comply with the requirements related to the citizenship of the Board of Directors and of the Chief Executive Officers. The ministry has also asked the entities to obtain security clearance for all foreign personnel likely to be deployed for more than 60 days in a year. Where FDI is involved, often security clearances are required, so I do not see anything different here, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deadline-set-for-digital-media-firms-to-reduce-foreign-investment/story-jjL985MpaRMD6i03ifZnrI.html
17-11-2020||India||Govt considering a code of conduct for TV channels, says Javadekar||The government is thinking of developing a common code of conduct for TV channels while also considering giving enhanced powers to the Press Council of India (PCI), information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar said on Monday.Javadekar also asserted that government felt that it should not step into the regulatory domain and self-regulation by those in the profession was the ideal system, although, in the case of so-called over the top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the government has effectively rejected any effort at self-regulation. Speaking at an event organized by the PCI on the occasion of National Press Day, Javadekar said that while the Press Council oversees the print domain there was no similar system for the electronic media.“There is no system like the Press Council for TV channels so there should be a system of self-regulation. An organization has been formed which is headed by Justice Sikri which even gives punishment and asks channels to apologise if required. However, many channels are not even members of this system and we can’t leave things like that,” Javadekar said.The I&B minister said that many people were suggesting a common code of conduct for all TV channels. “We have not taken a final decision but are definitely discussing it,” the minister said. Complaints related to content are presently handled by the News Broadcasters Standards Authority which is headed by Justice (retd) A K Sikri.Javadekar said that there was a demand to also increase the powers of the PCI. “Some people are demanding that there should be more power to Press Council. This is being considered,” the minister said.The minister’s comments come days after the government brought digital media and OTT platforms under the I&B ministry’s purview. Rules for these are yet to be released, though. There have been demands in the past that the Press Council of India be converted into a Media Council with digital and even electronic platforms under its ambit.For OTT platforms there is neither a platform like the PCI not a self-regulatory mechanism, Javdekar said. “There can be good films, bad ones and very bad ones on these platforms. That is why, what can be done there? People are giving suggestions and we are looking into all of them. These are the challenges.Interestingly, in January 2019, the main OTT platforms cam together and signed a self-regulatory code but the government has refused to sign off on this. Speaking on the issue of TRP manipulation, an issue that came to fore with the arrest of TV anchor Arnab Goswami, Javadekar said while the government is reluctant to enter this domain, it has set up a committee to look into the issue. “To check the possibility of any TRP manipulation and address the issue, we have formed a committee which will give its report very soon,” he said.The event also saw messages from President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi being read out or aired. All of these emphasized on the importance of a free media while also lauding the work done by journalists to spread awareness about Covid-19.In his written message, which was read out at the event, President Ram Nath Kovind said media persons were among front-line corona warriors, playing a major role in educating people and mitigating the impact of the pandemic.The vice president,in a video message, said the press in India has always been at the vanguard of protecting and strengthening the foundations of democracy.He said that any attack on the freedom of the press is detrimental to national interests and should be opposed. “Democracy cannot survive without a free and fearless press. Therefore, any attack on the freedom of the press is detrimental to national interests and should be opposed by one and all,” Naidu said.The prime minister also lauded the media for doing an exceptional service by spreading awareness against Covid-19 and said that it has acted as a valuable stakeholder in helping government in its initiatives. His message was read out by PCI Chairman C K Prasad.Modi said that at a time the world is up against an unprecedented crisis in the form of Covid-19, the nation’s fight against the pandemic is powered by the restraint and resolve of its 130 crore citizens.“In such a scenario, the media has been continuously doing exceptional service by spreading awareness against the Covid pandemic. In a post-Covid world, India is marching ahead with its resolve to build a strong and ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’. Media is giving our resolve the shape of a big campaign and carrying forward the message of ‘Vocal for Local’,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-considering-a-code-of-conduct-for-tv-channels-says-javadekar/story-nnwfOS8atblXmoHxWd3AaP.html

This is Kumar’s fourth consecutive term as chief minister and comes after the National Democratic Alliance secured a narrow majority in the recently concluded state elections even though his JD(U) crashed to its worst performance in 15 years.Kumar said based on the public’s decision, NDA once again formed the government. “We will work together and serve the people. Yes it’s a new team but every time there is a new element. We will endeavour to deliver the responsibility entrusted to us,” added the 69-year-old leader.Also Read: In 2-line tweet, Prashant Kishor throws many punches at ex-boss Nitish KumarHe was congratulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was widely credited with shoring up the NDA’s poll prospects in Bihar. “The NDA family will work together for the progress of Bihar. I assure all possible support from the Centre for the welfare of Bihar,” he said. The newly formed Bihar cabinet will meet on Tuesday. A special session of the state legislative Assembly is likely to be held on November 23, news agency ANI reported. As per rules, a maximum of 36 ministers can be appointed in the 243-member Bihar assembly.Prasad and Devi were administered oath after the chief minister and both were seated beside Kumar on the dais. They replaced Sushil Modi, who was deputy CM for 11 years and attended Monday’s ceremony. “It’s a big responsibility and I am extremely thankful to my party leaders for giving me this opportunity,” said Devi, the first woman deputy CM of Bihar.Prasad is a four-time MLA from Katihar who became a minister for the first time. Devi, a former BJP national vice-president and four-term MLA from Bettiah, previously served as a minister of art, culture and sports from 2005 to 2009 under Kumar. The main opposition party, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), boycotted the swearing-in ceremony and said the mandate was against the NDA. But party leader Tejashwi Yadav later congratulated Kumar. “I hope that instead of the ambition of the chair, he (Kumar) will prioritise the wishes of the people,” he said.Other prominent faces from the JD(U) inducted as ministers are former speaker, Vijay Kumar Choudhary, Bijendra Prasad Yadav, Ashok Choudhary, Mewalal Choudhary and Sheela Kumari. From the BJP, former health minister Mangal Pandey, former deputy speaker Amarendra Pratap Singh, Rampreet Paswan, Jivesh Kumar and Ramsurat Kumar were sworn in as ministers. Paswan and Jibesh took oath in Maithili. The Mithilanchal region comprising Dabhanga and Madhubani, where the NDA won 17 of 20 assembly seats, got three new faces.

You should pose your questions to the BJP leadership”.Four of the 14 ministers are from upper caste communities, three are Dalits and the remaining from other backward classes (OBC) and extremely backward classes (EBC).Two ministers belong to the Yadav caste, traditionally the support base of the RJD. There are two women, Devi and Kumari, who made a successful electoral debut from Phulpharas in Madhubani district.The NDA won 125 seats in the 243-member assembly against 110 by the opposition Grand Alliance.

17-11-2020||India||China-Pakistan CPEC project has long road ahead as Beijing puts hold on projects||The Covid-19 pandemic, ongoing political unrest and foreign debt limits have resulted in a slowing of Chinese investments in Pakistan as Beijing has put a hold on projects that are part of the USD 62 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, whose government is criticised for being under military control, is also facing flak in his country for not prioritising and expediting big-ticket Chinese infrastructure investments, Asia Times reported.In 2018, Khan had put on hold several CPEC projects suspecting corruption by the previous government. However, two years later, several of his Cabinet members were named in big corruption scandals involving the country’s power sector. About one-third of Pakistan’s power companies are involved in Chinese projects under the CPEC.The 278-page inquiry report, compiled by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and presented to Khan in April, unearthed alleged irregularities worth over USD 1.8 billion in subsidies given to 16 independent power producers (IPPs) including those belonging to Khan’s advisors Razak Dawood and Nadeem Baber, Asia Times said.The SCEP had also investigated the profits earned by the Chinese power companies.The report revealed that Huang Shandong Ruyi Pakistan Ltd (HSR) and Port Qasim Electric Power Co Ltd (PQEPCL) were together overpaid by 483.6 billion rupees (USD 3 billion).The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance of 11 opposition parties, has demanded the Imran Khan-led government to speed up the Chinese-funded projects, especially the motorway and railway modernisation plans that have had almost no progress in the last five months.The PDM has also demanded the removal of CPEC Authority’s chairman, retired Lieutenant General Asim Saleem Bajwa, until he comes clear of his personal and his family business assets in the US.Recently, a local media had exposed Bajwa’s several offshore businesses, including more than 100 companies and franchises in the US, UAE and Canada in which his family are involved.In 2019, the Prime Minister had promulgated an ordinance to establish a CPEC Authority (CPECA) ahead of his visit to China and appointed a former lieutenant general as its chairperson. Earlier, the Planning and Development Ministry used to oversee the CPEC projects.Planning Ministry sources told Asia Times that CPECA was forced upon the government by China, which wanted the army to be directly involved in the CPEC portfolio as Beijing was reportedly irked with Khan’s slow movement on the wider scheme.The sources further said that the recent revelations of Bajwa’s offshore assets had shocked China as it had wished to work with the Pakistan military to prevent private corruption.Following the revelations, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s scheduled visit to Pakistan in September was postponed citing Covid-19 as the official reason.Asia Times has reported that the CPEC Authority Ordinance gives immunity to the CPECA’s chairperson and staff from all legal proceedings against them, hence, protecting them from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and police to institute cases.“The CPECA’s legality issue, chairperson’s immunity from legal proceedings and the controversies of overseas family businesses surrounding the authority’s incumbent chairperson gave a bad impression and must be resolved to improve the efficiency of CPECA,” Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader and chairman of the Pak-China Institute think tank told Asia Times.He further said that the PDM has concerns about the CPECA’s immunity clause.While attributing the delay of the CPEC project to coronavirus pandemic, he said, “Additionally, the new Chinese Ambassador, Nong Rong comes with a strong economic background which should give impetus to CPEC.”He further said that the PDM protests will not affect the CPEC’s progress.“Pressures are emanating from the West and Western institutions - primarily in Washington - against the CPEC but Pakistan has demonstrated willingness, readiness and ability to withstand these pressures,” he added.As in recent weeks Chinese workers and engineers working in Balochistan and Sindh have been targeted and killed, the cost of providing around-the-clock security to Chinese nationals is raising the price of the projects at a time Pakistan’s economy is faltering badly, Asia Times said.Meanwhile, Pakistan had requested a 1 per cent interest rate on the Chinese loan for the ML-1 rail project. China is, however, reluctant to heed to the request and instead used “delaying tactics” to pressurise Islamabad to continue accepting the high rate of interest.Khan and Bajwa now reportedly plan to take the issue to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who they believe can dictate terms on China Development Bank and Export-Import Bank of China loans, in hopes that an agreement can be reached on the rail line, Asia Times said.The review meeting of CPEC’s Joint Coordination Committee (JCC), which is held every month, is unlikely to finalise the ML-1 project in the upcoming meeting despite Pakistan Railways Minister Shaikh Rasheed Ahmad emphasising that the project is ready.Asia Times further reported that the Greater Peshawar Mass Transit Project, Swat Express Way Phase-II and Peshawar-DI Khan Motorway, all nominally under the CPEC, have likewise been delayed and are not on the agenda of the next JCC meeting.Citing local media reports, Asia Times quoted Jeremy Garlick, an assistant professor at the Jan Masaryk Centre of International Studies at the Prague University of Economics and Business, as saying that Beijing was using delaying tactics on the ML-1 as it doesn’t want to end up with a bad deal on its hands.“Beijing doesn’t want to say no to ML-1. It wants to appear committed in Pakistan, but at the same time it is aware of the risky environment for Chinese investments,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-pakistan-cpec-project-has-long-road-ahead-as-beijing-puts-hold-on-projects/story-vTWomwV7sqMy1qD0V6AofO.html
17-11-2020||India||Amid war of words among party leaders, Congress’ Special Committee to meet today||After facing defeat in Bihar assembly elections and by-elections, a meeting of the special committee to assist Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi is going to take place on Tuesday.According to information received from sources, there will be a meeting at 5 pm through video conferencing but its agenda is not clear.This meeting is taking place at a time when the issue of review in Congress has been emerging after the defeat in the elections. Kapil Sibal, one of the 23 Congress leaders who wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi a few months ago to demand reforms in the party, has demanded a fresh review of the defeat, after which he has come under fire from fellow Congress leaders.From Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary, Congress leaders are targeting Sibal for raising questions.Amidst all this, the meeting of Sonia Gandhi’s advisory committee is giving rise to a lot of speculation. In August, a Special Committee was formed to assist the interim president of the Congress, Sonia Gandhi on organisational and operational matters.Ahmed Patel, KC Venugopal, AK Antony, Ambika Soni, Mukul Wasnik, Randeep Surjewala are its members. The important thing is that due to ill health, Ahmed Patel is admitted to the hospital. Despite this, questions are being raised about whether a new storm is coming inside the Congress.The Congress is being blamed for the defeat of the Grand Alliance (Mahagathbandhan) in the recently concluded Bihar elections. In the Mahagathbandhan, the success rate of RJD and the Left parties was more than 50 per cent whereas the Congress could win only 19 seats out of 70 seats it contested.Congress got only nine seats out of 28 in Madhya Pradesh by-election. The Congress could not win a single seat in the by-elections in two assembly seats in Karnataka and eight assembly seats in Gujarat. Congress performance was also disappointing in UP where Priyanka Gandhi is in-charge.RJD leaders have also raised questions over Congress party’s attitude towards Bihar Assembly polls. RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari has taken on the party leadership saying that they didn’t pay heed to the campaign as many senior leaders like Priyanka Gandhi, former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and even Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi didn’t turn up for the poll campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-war-of-words-among-party-leaders-congress-special-committee-to-meet-today/story-hiT5a61B0I46YQo3Q8wf7O.html

I don’t seek to debate with one who’s not connected to it. Delhi power minister is welcome for the debate. I haven’t challenged anybody,” said Cabral.Earlier today, Chadha said he is ready to have a debate with Cabral over the Delhi electricity model as compared to the Goa one, but the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high command is not giving permission.“I informed Goa power minister that I will be debating with him on the topic of Kejriwal electricity model vs Goa electricity model of the BJP and I will reach Goa by 2 pm on November 17. But now he seems to be running away from the debate,” said Chadha.“BJP high command is not giving permission to Goa Power Minister Cabral for the debate, which was originally his idea. I now urge BJP high command as well as Mr Cabral to readily accept this challenge and let me know the venue and time of this debate,” he added.Earlier, a war of words took place on social media between the chief ministers of Delhi and Goa on November 11-12, with Arvind Kejriwal accusing his Goan counterpart of ignoring local voices under “the Centre’s diktat”, in return being accused by Dr Pramod Sawant of doing “divisive politics”.The spat began on Twitter last Wednesday after Delhi Chief Minister responded to a news portal’s tweet citing Sawant, a BJP member, as saying that “Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should first fix issues of pollution in his area before getting worried about Goa.”There has been an ongoing feud in Goa between the ruling BJP and Kejriwal’s AAP over environmental issues, especially the railway “double-tracking project” inside the protected forest areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-interested-in-debate-with-one-who-s-not-connected-with-power-issue-goa-minister-on-aap-challenge/story-V2ioLp4OdcrSGQkWhrcJpO.html
17-11-2020||India||Why blaming Congress in Bihar is a red herring||The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan (MGB) failed to get a majority in Bihar despite getting almost identical vote share as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the state. Multiple theories have been given from within the MGB fold to explain the loss. In its first press conference after the results, the MGB leadership accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of having cancelled postal ballots which were in its favour in various assembly constituencies (ACs). However, it did not provide details of such cancellations. ECI has dismissed such allegations. Dipankar Bhattacharya, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India Marxist-Leninist (Liberation), said that the MGB would have performed better had the Left parties been given more tickets than the Congress. The seat distribution within the MGB was 144, 70 and 29 for the RJD, Congress and the Left. In an interview to ANI, senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari took potshots at Rahul Gandhi , blaming the Congress for the MGB’s performance.An HT analysis suggests that the real picture could be far more complicated.Has the Congress really underperformed in Bihar? The Congress managed to win 19 out of the 70 ACs it contested in these elections. In 2015, it won 27 out of the 41 it had contested. Compared to 2015, 2020 looks like an underperformance. However, the 2020 numbers need to be seen in the context that it was the Congress’s second best performance, both in terms of seats and strike rates, in the state since 1995. When seen from the historical perspective, it can be said that both the 2015 and 2020 performances of the Congress were more a function of the alliances it entered into rather than its actual support. Any political party rooted in Bihar, the RJD included, would have known the Congress’s actual strength before sealing the alliance. So, why did the RJD entertain the Congress at all? That leads to another question. Why were the elections so close in Bihar this time? The simple answer to this question is a fragmentation of the NDA’s upper caste support base. The CSDS-Lokniti post-poll survey for Bihar – it got the seat shares wrong, but its vote share predictions of 39%-36% for MGB-NDA were not very off the mark – shows that the NDA’s support among upper caste voters was perhaps the lowest since the 2005 October assembly elections in the state.Findings of the 2020 Lokniti post-poll survey show that the NDA had a support of 52%, 51%, 55% and 59% among Brahmins, Bhumihars, Rajputs and other upper castes in the state. The weighted average is likely to be less than 55%. The 2015 post-poll survey by Lokniti found more than 80% upper caste support for the NDA. This number was 65% and 56% in the October-2005 and 2010 assembly elections.Lokniti findings also show that the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) was the main factor for the fragmentation in the NDA’s upper caste support base in these elections. Congress is the RJD’s upper caste appeasement agent in Bihar It is among the anti-NDA upper caste voters that the Congress was the most effective in the 2015 elections. Information collected by the Trivedi Centre for Political Data at Ashoka University shows that 17 out of the 41 candidates fielded by the Congress in the 2015 polls were from the upper castes. This number was just 8 out of 101 for the RJD. 13 of Congress’s upper caste candidates won in the 2015 polls compared to just five on the RJD’s ticket. Things did not change much in 2020. 29 out of the 70 candidates fielded by the Congress were from the upper castes. The RJD fielded just 23 in the 144 ACs it contested. The Congress’s role as an upper caste party in the alliance becomes clearer when one looks at the share of upper caste candidates among non-Muslims and non- Scheduled Caste (SC)/non-Scheduled Tribe (ST) candidates. This number was 81% in 2015 and 66% in 2020. While most parties field SC/ST candidates from reserved constituencies, Muslims are mostly fielded from ACs where they are in significant numbers.Obviously, if the RJD had a wider support beyond Yadavs and Muslims, then it would not need the upper castes and the Congress.  Would it have helped if the Left had a bigger share in the alliance? The Left parties, especially the CPI(ML), said that giving more seats to the Left parties instead of the Congress would have helped the MGB improve its performance in the assembly. Is there merit in such assertions? The strength of the combined Left block has risen to the highest since 1995 assembly elections. Many, including this author, have argued that the Left was more successful in championing the economic justice rhetoric of the MGB. However, an analysis of 2010 and 2015 election results shows that the MGB seat distribution in 2020 did follow some logic. Left parties have had a much higher vote share in the 29 ACs they contested this time than the 214 they did not contest this time. This means that the Left parties were given ACs where they have had some historical traction. A pre-2010 comparison is not possible because AC boundaries changed after the 2008 delimitation. What the Congress needs to realise? While it is unfair to blame the Congress for the MGB’s poor showing, it does not make the former any less irrelevant in the state’s politics. If the Congress intends to revive itself as an upper caste party in the state — the purpose it has served in the 2015 and 2020 polls — then its central leadership would do well to cultivate a set of local leaders who acknowledge this realpolitik requirement and plan accordingly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-blaming-congress-in-bihar-is-a-red-herring/story-dOiCBmGpEzSF1xDk7J9JLL.html

We will provide details on Tuesday at a news conference,” a senior CCB official said.On August 11, an angry mob enraged over an alleged insult to the prophet had burnt down more than 60 vehicles as well as DJ Halli and KG Halli police stations apart from the house of Congress legislator Akhanda Srinivasa Murthy.In the subsequent police firing three people were killed. More than 377 people were arrested for the violence and a preliminary charge sheet filed by the police in the case said that intra-party rivalry within Congress was one of the key reasons for riots. Both Sampath Raj and Abdul Zakir, another Congress corporator were named among the key accused in the charge sheet.However, Raj who had claimed to be under treatment for Covid-19 at the Baptist hospital fled from the facility when the police went to take him into custody. On Monday afternoon Riyazuddin, a key aide of Raj, had been arrested for aiding and abetting his escape and subsequent flight.On November 13, the Karnataka High Court had issued a non-bailable warrant for Sampath Raj. Home minister Basavaraj Bommai had appealed to the senior Congressman to surrender or that the law would take its course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-bengaluru-mayor-arrested-in-riots-case-after-3-months/story-NsJw1PGwzmQbQ3K1nMSRNP.html

But now, we heard that they are planning to give place to 6,000 families. If this happens, the demography and environment of the subdivision will be effected. We can’t accept that,” chairman of JAC Dr. Zairemthiama Pachuau told mediapersons. Over 32,000 Bru migrants have been staying at six relief camps located at Kanchanpur and Panisagar subdivisions in Tripura’s North District for over two decades after they fled Mizoram following an ethnic clash in 1997. In January this year, the Centre signed an agreement with governments of Tripura and Mizoram and the Bru migrants for their permanent settlement in Tripura. The Centre also announced a Rs. 600 crore package for their resettlement. According to government officials, 15 different spots areas have been identified in different districts including the North district for their resettlement. The Mizoram Bru Displaced Peoples’ Forum (MBDPF) recently demanded the state government issue permanent resident and Scheduled Tribe certificates to them as part of their resettlement.MBDPF general secretary Bruno Msha said,” We have nothing to say about their movement. We believe that the state government will take necessary action in this regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bru-migrants-resettlement-in-tripura-runs-into-opposition-from-locals/story-73T0D5EWuo4qkCgdz7zZ6N.html
17-11-2020||India||Supreme Court discourages use of Article 32 in scribe case||The Supreme Court said on Monday it was trying to discourage the use of a provision that allows incarcerated people to directly approach the top court against violation of their fundamental rights as it felt that high courts were well-equipped to deal with such matters.In a case pertaining to Malayalam journalist Siddique Kappan, who is facing charges of sedition and offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and who is being probed by the Uttar Pradesh police for alleged links with banned outfit Popular Front of India (PFI), the SC said it was trying to discourage the use of Article 32. Article 32 of the Constitution allows any citizen to approach the Supreme Court against the breach of any fundamental right.Kappan was arrested on October 5 while on his way to Hathras to report the death of a 19-year-old Dalit girl after she was gang-raped.The bench headed by the CJI issued notice to the UP government on a petition filed on behalf of Kappan by the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) and posted the matter for hearing on Friday. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for KUWJ, sought interim bail for Kappan, but the bench wished to hear the state first before passing any order.Also Read: UP cops gather evidence of Kerala scribe’s role in Hathras violence incitement plotThe SC bench told Sibal of its reservation to entertain the petition, saying that such petitions should be filed before high courts. “We are trying to discourage Article 32 petitions. Of late, we find a spate of Article 32 petitions.”Sibal mentioned the fact that the court was granting bail in Article 32 petitions and in this case, too, an extraordinary situation arose due to the arrest of a journalist. The bench said: “We are not commenting on the merits of the case. We are aware of similar orders in the past and the vast powers that this Court possesses under Article 32. We want to discourage this trend.” Although notice was issued, the bench told Sibal that it was keen on ordering the petition to be heard by the Allahabad high court.In another case, involving Sameet Thakkar, a resident of Nagpur who is currently under arrest in multiple criminal cases for his tweets on Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the SC decline to entertain a petition under Article 32. Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, who appeared for Thakkar, pointed out that while all offences were bailable, his client was being arrested in one case after another.The bench of CJI Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian told Jethmalani to approach the Bombay high court. The bench said: “High Court can also uphold your fundamental rights and grant you bail. Why are you coming under Article 32?”Jethmalani pointed out that the facts of the case were “shocking” as was under arrest for three weeks, with the police treating him inhumanly by producing him in court with a rope around his neck. The bench replied: “We are quite immune from shocks. What makes you think that we approve of all this. We are only saying go to the High Court. You can point all this out to the High Court too.”The Maharashtra government, represented by advocate Rahul Chitnis, informed the court that the petitioner’s custodial interrogation was over and the state would not oppose his bail plea. The bench held: “The petitioner seeks permission to withdraw the writ petition with liberty to move before the appropriate forum.” A magistrate’s court in Mumbai later granted bail to Thakkar in one of the three cases registered against him for allegedly tweeting “objectionable” content against Thackeray and his son Aaditya Thackeray.Thakkar was granted a cash bail of Rs 25,000 by the magistrate’s court in Bandra, said his lawyer Abad Ponda. He secured bail in a case registered against him at the BKC Cyber Cell police station in Mumbai following his tweet against the Thackerays earlier this year.Two more FIRs were registered against him for the same tweets, one in Nagpur, and another in the VP Road police station, also in Mumbai.Ponda said Thakkar will be released from jail following the bail order since he had already secured similar relief in the other two cases.Thakkar was arrested by the Mumbai Police in October this year after he failed to appear before the VP Road and BKC police stations to record his statement, despite a Bombay HC order directing him to do so.(With PTI inputs from Mumbai)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-discourages-use-of-article-32-in-scribe-case/story-vTALfDmd21QyPxuR0HgBiJ.html
17-11-2020||India||‘Don’t implement tourism policy’, industry bodies tell Goa govt||Goa’s leading industry bodies have written to the state government asking it not to implement the recently approved Goa Tourism Policy and seeking that the board as envisioned by the policy be not constituted. Expressing their dissatisfaction with the policy drawn by consultancy firm KPMG, the heads of the three associations - the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa and the Goa Chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry -have asked the government to cease and desist from acting on the policy. “After a series of joint meetings (we) are writing this letter to express our dissatisfaction about the Goa Tourism Policy 2020 and the structure of the Goa Tourism Board as per what was received by us,” the letter written by Manoj Caculo (GCCI president), Nilesh Shah (TTAG president) and Blaise Costa Bir, (CII president), said. “It must therefore be of utmost importance that the Policy is formulated comprehensively and The Goa Tourism Board has a balanced representation of all key stakeholders in the trade, to facilitate sound decision making for the betterment of the tourism sector in the State of Goa” the joint letter states asking the Chief Minister to “make sure that no immediate decisions are taken for the long term while the Board is in the process of being formulated and to defer the proposed decision of the State Tourism Department for floating a tender for appointing of a PR agency to promote its activities and provide assistance at trade fairs.” “We can work together to ensure that a well-structured Tourism Board is formulated that can help take informed decisions for the betterment of the tourism sector in Goa,” the industry honchos have said. The Goa Tourism Policy was finalised after many delays by the Goa cabinet at the end of October. KPMG billed the Goa government upwards of Rs 5-crore to draft the policy. But opposition members as well as some members of the ruling BJP have alleged that the money has been ‘wasted’ as the policy has made ‘vague’ and ‘generic’ recommendations for which an expensive consultant need not have been hired..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-implement-tourism-policy-industry-bodies-tell-goa-govt/story-9aSZ6NDLs3SlVir4963zlI.html
17-11-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Just how bad is the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Delhi? And how does it compare with what the US and Europe are going through right now?The trajectory of Covid-19 in Delhi is different from that of any other Indian state or Union territory. No other Indian region has seen a clear second wave (many have just seen the end of the first). Delhi hasn’t just seen, but also seen off a second and is now in its third — although, as I’ve pointed out in this column, the peak of the curve of the first wave was too sharp (which is rare), and poor testing strategy may have been responsible for the optics of the entire second wave.Still, on paper, Delhi is now seeing its third wave, and like the ongoing third wave in the US and the second wave in Europe, it is bad.To return to the original question, how bad? A measure of new cases per million — both daily and a seven-day average — provides the answer.This number has steadily increased (barring blips caused by lower testing) as shown in the accompanying graphic. The first wave peaked in late June and then fell off sharply — too sharply, perhaps. The second wave started in late August, peaked in mid-September, and then fell off, and the third wave started in mid-October.Since November 3, the number of daily cases per million of population in the Capital has been in excess of 300 (barring November 15, when it was low on account of a national holiday on Saturday). This column is being written before the day’s numbers are out but it is Monday’s too will be low, on account of low testing on Sunday. The 7-day average has been in excess of 300 since November 6 and was at 370.5 on November 14. It’s important to note that while many states and Union territories report their Covid numbers late in the day, Delhi reports its earlier — but its numbers are the previous day’s.Click here for complete coverage of the Covid-19 pandemicThe Delhi cases-per-million number is comparable to that in Europe and the US. The latter’s is higher, in the mid-400s, but the former’s is currently just around where the Delhi number is. And their trajectory looks the same too. Delhi, then, is an outlier whose coronavirus disease trajectory is completely different from the national trend.Some of Delhi’s current problems can be attributed to its botched approach to testing. In late June, as the first wave roared through it, Delhi decided to accelerate and expand its testing through the use of rapid antigen tests. These are unreliable, returning false negatives 50% of the time (this means they identify infected people as uninfected). Every region that uses such tests has seen an immediate improvement (a fall) in its positivity rate (proportion of people testing positive to those tested), which tells the story. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have almost exclusively depended on such tests and their respective Covid dashboards, too, tell the same story.Over the past month, Delhi has increased its testing capacity for the reliable RT-PCR test, but at a peak of around 20,000 a day last week, these still accounted for just a third of the total tests carried out in the Capital.This has interfered with the accuracy and representativeness of Delhi’s positivity rate — Dispatch 156 on September 12 explained how rapid antigen tests, while useful in certain contexts, can do this when used indiscriminately, the way Delhi, UP and Bihar have done — presenting and perhaps amplifying a false sense of safety and security. In contrast, Tamil Nadu, used only RT-PCR tests and its positivity rate saw an extremely long plateau before dipping.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayAnd this misplaced sense of safety and security manifested itself in several ways. Checks at airports of incoming passengers became lax; containment zones were honoured more in the breach than in the observance; and citizens started behaving as if they had nothing to fear. A final caveat: Delhi’s overall cases-to-date-per-million number is magnified by its lower population when compared to other states (it’s the same reason Goa tops the cases-to-date-per-million chart, and Ladakh comes second) but the number is bad by any measure. Delhi is seventh on the list of states and Union territories in terms of case numbers. And only Maharashtra and Kerala have more active cases than the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-rBWzmWCcol98FQ1yNoNfRI.html
17-11-2020||India||Coronavirus: India in talks with global vaccine manufacturers||India is in talks with Pfizer, Moderna and other manufacturers for a possible deal to purchase a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine as rising infections pose a challenge to the country’s health authorities, officials familiar with the matter said on Monday.The officials working for the Union government maintained that all vaccines will be considered for uptake, and Pfizer as well as Moderna’s announcements that their vaccine candidates were 90% and 94.5% successful, respectively, in phase 3 clinical trials prompted India to recalibrate its options.A senior official of the Centre’s team of experts on the vaccine said, “We are mindful of the prices, the cost factor is a profound concern to us”. Last month, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said their vaccine would be priced at $19.50 a dose, a steep difference from the Oxford AstraZeneca candidate that is expected to carry a price tag of below two dollars apiece. Moderna, the other front runner, has pegged its doses between $32 and $37 a dose.Also Read| Covid-19: Bharat Biotech begins Phase 3 trials of Covaxin in IndiaTo be sure, two officials from the expert group insisted that no agreement has been made with Pfizer or Moderna or even for Moscow’s Sputnik V so far but talks are on with all possible candidates.“We are in touch with all manufacturers, both domestic and international. To provide access to vaccine to our people at the earliest, we have to keep in mind the entire landscape. While Indian vaccines are promising, some other candidates are ahead in the race. We are closely watching all developments. But affordability is critical and important,’’ said a member of the group. Another member said recent news of the EU striking a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech for securing 200 million doses but at a lower price than the US has also caught the group’s attention and a bargain is not being ruled out.“We will secure vaccines from every possible source. While our own vaccines are still in the race, some vaccines are near the finishing line. If we want quick procurements, we have no option but to negotiate with them.” Also Read: A tipping point in the fight against Covid-19The central government has so far earmarked ₹50,000 crore — from its own resources — for the Covid-19 vaccine programme. The Oxford AstraZeneca candidate would fit the bill perfectly.Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul, chairman of the expert group, said, “We are keeping an open watch on vaccine developments nationally and internationally, with the goal of ensuring that we have access to a safe and effective vaccine at the earliest to the maximum possible people.’’ “We can expect a vaccine early 2021 — the first quarter of the year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-in-talks-with-global-vaccine-manufacturers/story-x6zIq39RaXAk7USxPKmN4O.html
17-11-2020||India||Temperatures to dip in northwestern India, says IMD||Widespread snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and the upper reaches of Uttarakhand on Sunday will lead to a fall in the minimum temperature by around two-four degrees Celsius over northwestern India from Tuesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). As a result of the western disturbance (WD) that brought rain and snow, most parts of northwest India saw a significant improvement in air quality that settled in the “moderate” and satisfactory” category in several places; it is unusual in mid-November and that too immediately after Diwali celebrations. “There was snowfall at many places over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and over Uttarakhand. Rain and thundershowers occurred over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh and some places over north Rajasthan. Today, the winds are easterly but they will shift to north-westerly from tomorrow (Tuesday). So cold winds will be blowing from the Western Himalayas where snowfall has just happened. We are expecting minimum temperature to drop under 10 degrees Celsius in the next couple of days,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. The lowest minimum temperature recorded over northwest India was 11.2 degrees Celsius — in Bhatinda. As the western disturbance is still impacting the region and winds are easterly, several places recorded above normal minimum temperatures on Monday. Minimum temperatures are likely to fall gradually by 2-4 degrees Celsius over Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim during the next four-five days. Due to rain and snow in most parts of northwestern India, Diwali pollution dispersed rapidly. On Monday afternoon, Agra, Baghpat, Bahadurgarh, Bhiwadi and Faridabad, among others — all of which recorded “severe” air quality on Diwali day — settled at “moderate” category air. Ambala, Alwar, Bhatinda, Ballabgarh. Chandigarh and Meerut, all in northwest India, recorded “satisfactory” air quality on Monday. “Air quality across northwest India has improved due to rain and thundershowers....Though wind direction will change to northwesterly, wind speed will not reduce completely,” explained Vijay Soni, scientist at IMD’s air quality division. A fresh western disturbance is very likely to affect the western Himalayan region from November 18. “A feeble WD is again likely to impact higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh on November 18. So the minimum temperature will drop on November 16 and 17 but rise again on 18 before falling substantially after that. The current active WD coincided with Diwali, which brought great relief from air pollution to the entire northwest India,” added RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the national weather forecasting centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/temperatures-to-dip-in-north-india/story-TJS31J2ZLqa6MV2KIj72nI.html

In 1975, 1979 and 1984 there was no winter session for the upper house. In 1952, the first session was held on May 13 and a second session was held in the winter.In 2008, the house met for two sessions, but these were held in four parts, which covered the budget session, the winter season and the monsoon session.

17-11-2020||India||India favours bilateral free trade agreements over China-led RCEP||India consciously rejected the China-centric Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in favour of beneficial trade agreements with key economies such as the US and the European Union (EU), where Indian products and services are competitive, three officials familiar with the matter said on Monday. The Narendra Modi government frustrated Chinese designs of using RCEP to get unfettered access to the vast Indian market at the cost of India’s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), farmers and start-ups, officials from three ministries said on condition of anonymity. While RCEP states resorted to the unusual step of adopting a separate ministers’ declaration on India’s future participation in the trade deal when the agreement was signed on Sunday, people familiar with developments said there is no fresh effort underway from Asean or New Delhi in this regard. The people said Japan, which consistently pushed for India’s inclusion in RCEP to ensure a balanced outcome, led the drafting of the ministers’ declaration that acknowledged India’s strategic importance in creating “a region of even deeper and expanded value chains”. One of the people said: “Japan will continue to play a leading role in India’s future participation in RCEP.”One of the three officials with direct knowledge of the matter said: “It is widely known that RCEP is not lucrative enough without India. But India cannot engage with any trade bloc led by China, which is globally notorious as an aggressor. Besides, it is a direct threat to India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” The 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea signed the world’s biggest free trade deal at a virtual ceremony hosted by Vietnam on Sunday. More than a year before the signing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi signalled India’s decision not to join RCEP, telling a summit in Bangkok in 2019: “When I measure the RCEP agreement with respect to the interests of all Indians, I do not get a positive answer. Therefore, neither the Talisman of Gandhiji nor my own conscience permits me to join RCEP.” China’s official Xinhua news agency said on Monday that India had committed a “strategic blunder” and “missed the bus” to long-term growth by not signing the deal.

What’s next?“The Chinese outburst shows how India has frustrated Beijing’s design to invade the Indian market,” a second official said. “India will avoid joining agreements, which are in reality free trade agreements (FTAs) by stealth with countries like China,” said the official directly involved in trade matters. “Unlike previous governments, the Modi government will not succumb to global pressures and sign uneven, biased and useless agreements,” a third official said. The government has initiated a comprehensive review of all FTAs as most of them are “heavily tilted against” India. “India’s trade deficit with RCEP states increased from $7 billion in 2004 to $78 billion in 2014. India’s deficit with China is more than $50 billion. India’s domestic industry is still reeling from dumping and cheap imports,” the third official said. India eliminated tariffs on 74% lines under Asean, but richer countries such as Indonesia eliminated tariffs on only 50% lines for India, and Vietnam on 69%. This led to significant trade distortions, the third official said. “Therefore, to sign RCEP, India needs to first resolve issues in previous FTAs, and second, to ensure balanced, fair and beneficial framework in RCEP,” he added.While delivering a lecture on Monday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar referred to similar concerns without naming RCEP. He said the effect of trade agreements signed since India’s economic reforms of 1991 had “been to de-industrialise some sectors”. “The consequences of future ones would lock us into global commitments, many of them not to our advantage. Those who argue stressing openness and efficiency do not present the full picture. This is equally a world of non-tariff barriers of subsidies and state capitalism. Without exaggeration, what we will be deciding now will determine whether India will become a first-class industrial power or not,” Jaishankar said. However, a joint statement by leaders of the 15 RCEP states said they “would highly value India’s role in RCEP and reiterate that the RCEP remains open to India”. India’s accession will be welcome in view of “its strategic importance as a regional partner in creating deeper and expanded regional value chains”, the statement added. A diplomat from an Asean nation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “It costs nothing to keep the door open for India and we believe, with time, it will be India’s decision [whether to join RCEP].” Also Read| India will miss the bus to economic development by not joining RCEP: Chinese state mediaRam Singh, professor at the Delhi School of Economics (DSE), said India’s decision against signing the RCEP agreement was “practical and prudent” in terms of economic and geo-political circumstances. “The deal would have brought down import duties on 80-90% goods. These provisions will lead to flooding of Indian markets with cheap goods, particularly from China, harming our industries in the process. Issues like lack of framework for addressing trade deficit and opening of services also rendered the agreement less attractive for India,” he said. “India is the third biggest economy in the RCEP region. So access to Indian market is important for the RCEP countries. India can also gain from participation, but only if we join the grouping after addressing constraints on competitiveness of our industry and agriculture sector,” he added. Experts said while RCEP was not suited for India in its present form, New Delhi can explore other options in Europe, America and Africa. Adil Zaidi, partner and leader, Economic Development Advisory at consultancy firm EY India, said, “India will have to play to its strengths and negotiate trade agreements with existing consumption hubs in America and Europe as well as with emerging ones in Africa. It is equally important to monitor imports from alternate routes under Asean, SAFTA and other FTAs.” “With GoI’s [Government of India] focus on ‘Atamanirbhar Bharat’, it is important for India to consolidate the demand and drive factors of production in favour of domestic manufacturing. Thus, India needs to prepare itself to not only cater to domestic demand but also to improve exports,” Zaidi said. Divakar Vijayasarathy, founder and managing partner at consulting firm DVS Advisors LLP, said the RCEP deal was not favourable for India, particularly for its farming community. “RCEP was politically sensitive issue since access to India’s dairy market would have been available to these countries upon signing. The dairy market in India is highly unorganised and does not have the depth to compete with corporates of other countries.” “Further, greater access to India’s service sector was negotiated without any success and the government was also worried about the FTAs leading to trade deficits. All these issues lead to India pulling out of RCEP,” he said. He, however, said India cannot keep itself aloof from global markets. “In order to succeed in the mission of making India a manufacturing powerhouse under its Athmanirbhar Bharat programme, FTAs would be an important cog in the wheel, else global companies would choose countries which have favourable treaties giving access to many economies for their operations,” Vijayasarathy said. “FTAs are definitely double-edged; they would increase the export demand but at the same time it would challenge the domestic industries. The domestic industry has to mature to take on the global competition,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-favours-bilateral-free-trade-agreements-over-china-led-rcep/story-fpBmI5hxfIxZLubDLqsznL.html

They replaced veteran Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sushil Kumar Modi, who was deputy CM of the state for 11 years. Prasad, who was also elected leader of the BJP legislature party on Sunday, started his political career as a student leader in the anti-Emergency movement and has deep ties with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fount of the BJP. He hails from the Vaishya community, and first won assembly elections in 2005, and has remained unbeaten since.“This is a big responsibility and we will all work with our leadership for the betterment of Bihar and for the development of the people of the state,” Prasad said.Also Read: Top BJP leaders congratulate Nitish Kumar after he takes oath as Bihar CM for record 7th timeDevi, 61, started her political journey as a worker with the Durga Vahini, the women’s wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad.

It was sheer courage, conviction and determination bestowed by Almighty, support by the family and love and respect given by BJP that life has come full circle for me,” said Devi. “It’s a big responsibility and I extremely thankful to my party leaders for giving me this opportunity,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1st-woman-dy-cm-rss-veteran-to-be-the-second-in-command-in-bihar/story-VsbXVKK8ZAQubTcRDaEjxO.html
17-11-2020||India||Bihar debacle reignites calls for introspection in Congress||Questions are being asked of the Congress following its dismal show in the Bihar assembly elections with senior leader Kapil Sibal asking the leadership if it is “business as usual” and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot responding to him., claiming the remark has “hurt the sentiments” of party workers and reminding him that the party had been through similar crises several times in the past. The Congress party’s performance is seen in some quarters as being responsible for the failure of the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) or grand alliance to oust the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in the just-concluded assembly elections in Bihar. It has also prompted renewed calls within the party for introspection and course correction. Sibal, a former union minister and one of the 23 signatories to a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi in August this year seeking internal elections and an organisational overhaul, questioned the leadership in the wake of the Bihar debacle. “We are yet to hear on recent polls... Maybe Congress leadership thinks it should be business as usual,” he tweeted. Sibal further said he was “compelled to speak publicly” as there is “no forum in the party to discuss party issues” and insisted that the Congress needs efficient and senior leaders to manage elections. Indeed, after the August letter, the party sort of rallied behind the existing leadership, and none of the sought-for changes have materialised. Gehlot countered Sibal with a series of tweets and defended the leadership, saying there are various reasons for electoral setbacks and that the Congress will come out stronger from the present crisis as had happened in the past as well. “There was no need for Mr Kapil Sibal to mention our internal issue in media; this has hurt the sentiments of party workers across the country,” he said. “Congress has seen various crises including 1969, 1977, 1989 and later in 1996 -- but every time we came out stronger due to our ideology, programmes, policies and firm belief in party leadership,” the Rajasthan chief minister added. The Congress won just 19 of the 70 seats it contested in Bihar; its partner, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) won 75 seats and emerged as the single largest party in the 243-assembly; and the Left parties won 16 of the 29 they fought as part of the grand alliance. Also Read: Top BJP leaders congratulate Nitish Kumar after he takes oath as Bihar CM for record 7th time“We have improved with each and every crisis and also formed UPA government in 2004 under the able leadership of Soniaji (Sonia Gandhi), we shall overcome this time too. There are various reasons for electoral losses. But each time rank and file of the Congress party has shown undivided and firm belief in the party leadership and that is why we came out of it stronger and united after every crises,” Gehlot said. While the Congress officially maintained silence on Sibal’s remarks, another “dissenter” or letter-writer Vivek Tankha came out in support of the former union minister. “Kapil ji is an iconic lawyer & hard core congress personality. Together & individually we have fought countless battles and continue to fight against BJP shenanigans. For our democracy to survive Congress has to survive. Time to act is now or tomorrow may be too late,” he tweeted. The party’s Lok Sabha member Karti P Chidambaram also backed Sibal and said it is time for introspection and consultation in the organisation. “It’s time we introspect, ideate, consult and act,” said Karti, son of former union minister P Chidambaram, in a tweet. The Lok Sabha MP from Sivaganga in Tamil Nadu also tagged a tweet by Sibal on his remarks about the Bihar elections. But Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary launched an indirect attack on Sibal, saying that he has been inactive in Delhi politics for some time despite being a Member of Parliament (MP) from the national capital in the past. “Sibal ji, Delhi is capital of India. You have been an MP from here, also, a union minister. But for some time you have been inactive in Delhi politics. Let’s together fight Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal,” he tweeted in Hindi. A Congress functionary said senior party leaders will meet soon to discuss the Bihar poll outcome and one such meeting could even take place on Tuesday. Earlier, Congress Working Committee (CWC) member and general secretary Tariq Anwar too called for “deep introspection” following the party’s abysmal performance in the Bihar polls but maintained that there was no need for Sibal to make any remarks that would benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party “This is about Bihar elections and Mr Sibal should understand that. Keeping the critical timing in mind, he should not make any statement that will benefit the BJP,” he said. Also Read: Nitish says he’ll miss Sushil Modi, points to BJP for answersAnwar also defended Rahul Gandhi, saying the leader of a national party cannot be expected to devote time and energy to a state poll like the leader of a regional outfit. He was reacting to remarks by senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari’s remarks that the Congress had “shackled” the MGB and that Rahul Gandhi was “picnicking” with his sister Priyanka Gandhi in Shimla when campaigning was at its peak in Bihar. “First of all, Shivanand Tiwari is not an authorized spokesperson for the RJD. Also, he should realise that Congress is a national party while the RJD is a regional entity. The leader of a national party cannot be expected to devote time to a state election like a regional leader would,” Anwar said. His comments need to be seen in the context of Prime Minister Narendra Modi being the star campaigner for the BJP and the NDA in the Bihar election. Still, in an interview on November 15, Anwar admitted that his party’s poor show was the reason that the MGB could not form the government in Bihar. “We must accept the truth. Because of the poor performance of the Congress, Bihar has been deprived of a MGB government. The Congress must introspect as to where it faltered,” he said. The Congress also hit back at Tiwari for levelling “baseless allegations” against the party, calling him a “turncoat” and claiming that his “loyalty” appears to be with his former party, the Janata Dal (United). “Shivanand Tiwari has changed parties several times. He was an MP from JD(U). It is not surprising that his loyalty still seems to be with JD(U),” said Congress party’s Bihar in-charge Shaktisinh Gohil in a statement. The RJD also distanced itself from Tiwari’s remarks. “It is his personal opinion and not the party’s stand. There is a proper time and place for any analysis, which will be done to identify where we lacked in cooperation and synergy,” RJD leader Manoj Jha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-debacle-reignites-calls-for-introspection-in-congress/story-LdsE4TNiV7ZRIxutoI8NTI.html
17-11-2020||India||Protestors file review petition against Supreme Court’s Shaheen Bagh order||A group of 12 protestors who took part in the Shaheen Bagh protests have approached the Supreme Court against the October 7 decision of the apex court terming any protest held outside designated places to be illegal and giving a free hand to the police for clearing such protests.The review petition under Article 137 of the Constitution was filed on November 5 by advocate Kabir Dixit and has raised five grounds to challenge the decision rendered by a three-judge bench headed by justice SK Kaul.The judgment under challenge had held, “We have to make it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied in such a manner and that too indefinitely. Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.” By this standard, the Shaheen Bagh protests were illegal as the protest at Shaheen Bagh had blocked one of the key thoroughfares to Noida.The main ground for review was based on the vast powers the judgment conferred on police, leaving scope for its abuse. The petition said, “Prima facie the order under review appears to be giving way to an unrestricted sanction to the police to take action by misusing these observations…. Such observations may prove to be a license in the hands of the police to commit atrocities on legitimate voice of protest, especially protestors coming from vulnerable sections of the social strata.”The review petitioners further argued that the judgment of the top court would lead to a situation where the administration would never engage in dialogue with people, protesting against a government action or policy, but would instead take action against them including their prosecution.Stating that right to dissent and protest were essential facets of Article 19 of the Constitution, the petition stated, “The order takes away the constitutional protection guaranteed to peaceful protestors….to put any curbs on this freedom to show dissent (towards government policies, legislations and other acts and omissions) leaves the citizens with no resort whatsoever to voice their concerns.”The observation of the court that protests could be held at ‘designated places alone’ went against the five-judge bench decision of the Supreme Court in Himat Lal Shah case decided in September 1972 which upheld the right of a citizen to hold public meetings on public streets. The petitioners complained that before altering this principle, the apex bench did not hear the protestors.The apex court ruling came in the context of the protests held against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA conducted at South Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh area that began on December 15, 2019 and got dismantled following the lockdown imposed by the Central government on March 24 in view of the fight against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The protests threw traffic out of gear prompting one Amit Sahni, a resident of Delhi to file a public interest litigation (PIL) before the apex court. He wanted the blockade to be lifted and traffic to resume along this stretch. This resulted in the October 7 order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/protestors-file-review-petition-against-sc-s-shaheen-bagh-order/story-RE43LFJhxfzPzHcEX6v2LI.html
17-11-2020||India||Malabar exercise that upsets China is a tectonic shift in power balance | Analysis||Warships of four major Indo-Pacific democracies - the United States, Japan, Australia and India - will manoeuvre together in the Malabar naval exercise off the Goa coast on Tuesday, the second round of the war games by the QUAD countries over the last month that marks the evolution of the informal ‘QUAD’ partnership into a potential strategic alliance.India had invited Australia to this year’s war games for the first time in more than a decade, a move that has angered President Xi Jinping’s Communist Party of China government to an extent that its mouthpiece, China Daily chided the Australian government for “aggressively sending warships to China’s doorsteps” as part of Exercise Malabar. India and Australia, however, stayed firm, a sharp contrast from 2007 when several countries that had participated in the naval exercise eventually backed down in face of China’s protests.But President Xi’s aggressive approach has united the member countries of the four-nation alliance. For years, he had been pushing Japan over his claim to the Senkaku islands, threatening Australia with a trade war and talking nuke missiles to the US navy that made its presence felt in the South China Sea. China crossed the line with New Delhi this year when PLA soldiers attempted to seize control of Indian territory in Ladakh, setting up a face-off at the border that has stretched for more than six months in Ladakh and is expected to continue into next year.Also Watch l Malabar Exercise 2020: Navies of India, US, Japan & Australia in action Beijing’s approach in Ladakh has convinced India that it needs to be prepared for similar Chinese aggression in the high seas. People familiar with the matter said the government has already asked the Indian Navy to start prepping to counter the PLA Navy and change its orientation from diplomacy to deployment. The focus should be on the navy developing the capacity to be deployed from the Gulf of Eden to the Malacca Strait, and beyond.This year’s Malabar exercise - that mirrors the deepening strategic ties within QUAD - is one step. That is why, a national security planner said, the presence of the USS Nimitz strike group and India’s INS Vikramaditya at the exercise reflects the determination of the four countries to draw red lines for China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy.“It is a tectonic shift in the regional power balance,” he said.It was in this context that Australia’s Defence Minister Linda Reynolds recently described the naval manoeuvres not only as a demonstration of the strategic trust the four democracies held in each other but also “strengthened our collective ability to contribute to regional security”.Australia’s participation in the Malabar war games is considered significant given its geopolitical role in the Indo-Pacific region. Besides, Canberra is an advanced NATO alliance nation and has a military collaboration with the US and strategic security relations with Japan.Officials said the four-nation alliance could be expected to expand to other countries in one form or the other. For one, France is showing keen interest in QUAD’s move to secure sea lanes and freedom of navigation from the Gulf of Aden to western coast of the US.The barrage of commentaries in the Chinese communist party’s many mouthpieces that have attacked New Delhi’s invitation to Australia reflect the unease at the joint military drills.“Despite the drill jointly participated by India, the US, Australia and Japan, experts noted that such an ill-intentioned attempt to corner China is a hollow bluff, and China will not be disrupted by India’s irrationality or US interference,” the Global Times, a tabloid run by the communist party’s lead mouthpiece China Daily, asserted. It has also reported on the possibility of Germany’s interest in getting involved in the Indo-Pacific region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/round-2-of-malabar-war-games-tomorrow-it-represents-a-tectonic-shift-opinion/story-twV1VmPrB56FXLQfP8j27O.html

If you don’t mend your ways, your ‘Ram Naam Satya’ journey will begin,” Adityanath said.“The Allahabad high court has said that for marriages, changing religion isn’t necessary. The government too has decided to check ‘love jihad’ with all its might. An effective law would be made that would ensure that those who cheat gullible women by hiding their identity would be effectively dealt with,” the CM said. “Love Jihad” is a term used by right-wing workers to describe interfaith relationships between a Muslim man and a Hindu woman. In February this year, the government told Parliament that there was no definition of the term and no such cases were reported by agencies.Last week, a 21-year-old college student, Nikita, was shot dead in Haryana’s Ballabhgarh by a man. The victim’s family has alleged that the man was pressuring her to convert to Islam in order to marry him. Some Hindu outfits have alleged that the woman’s murder is a case of “love jihad”.Last year, the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission submitted a report to Adityanath, suggesting “a new law to check forcible religious conversions.”(With Agency Inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-uttar-pradesh-haryana-now-considers-law-against-love-jihad/story-91UEqkkrpd2ZiV204rZr3I.html

In this case, the woman was a Muslim and converted to Hinduism just before the marriage. The court said that religious conversion just for the purpose of marriage is not acceptable. Taking a leaf out of the verdict, Adityanath on Saturday said the government is taking concerted efforts to legally stop such cases of forceful conversions. The Uttar Pradesh government has been mulling an ordinance against “love jihad” for a long time, reports said. “Taking a serious note of such incidents [of forceful conversion and cruelty], the CM has directed that a concrete strategy be made to control such incidents. It has often been seen that this is being done in an organised manner. If required, an ordinance can be brought for it,” an official earlier told PTI.Last year, the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission submitted a report to Adityanath, suggesting “a new law to check forcible religious conversions.” Kanpur Police had also set up a special investigation team to look into “love jihad” cases.

17-11-2020||Editorials||The crisis of Muslim representation | HT Editorial||In Bihar, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has taken office after crossing the majority mark in the recently-held assembly elections, winning 125 of the 243 seats. But there is one striking dimension of the verdict. There isn’t a single Muslim legislator in any of the NDA’s constituent parties. Bihar has over 17 million Muslims. Three years ago, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a spectacular mandate in Uttar Pradesh (UP), winning 312 of the 403 seats in the assembly. It did not have a single Muslim legislator (and has a single Muslim minister brought in through the legislative council route). UP has over 40 million Muslims. In the entire assembly, there are 24 Muslim lawmakers. Nothing illustrates the crisis of representation, democracy and inter-community ties than these stark figures. In India, where both individual and group identities matter, communities feel a sense of empowerment when they have access to the formal state structure. This becomes even more critical because public services are often mediated informally — and having a representative from your community can help you lodge a complaint in the police station, get a hospital bed, or land government jobs. But most importantly, it gives a sense of belonging to the nation, deepens democracy, and allows social diversity to get reflected in political decisions. The rise of the BJP, which is not hesitant to use the vocabulary of majoritarianism, has led to the political disenfranchisement of Muslims. Non-BJP parties, worried that putting up Muslim candidates will only polarise the electorate, to be “tactically prudent” also hesitate in supporting Muslim candidates, leading to a further dip in representation. This is a disturbing situation, for if the country’s principal minority begins losing faith in the power of electoral democracy to win them their rights and voice, it will lead to extremism on one side and apathy on the other. Political parties, especially the BJP, must change course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-crisis-of-muslim-representation/story-fDKkisq8NTinONgbbeS2iL.html
